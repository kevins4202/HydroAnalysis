17010,hydrothermal treatment ht is a promising method to convert sewage sludge to hydrochar biofuel the heating value is directly correlated to the carbon content in hydrochar however the release of organic matter from sludge to hydrolysate and the transfer of the maillard reaction products generated in the hydrolysate to the solid phase alter the carbon content in hydrochar in this study the relationship between hydrolysate and heating value of sludge based hydrochar was presented aiming to explain how the calorific value of hydrochar was affected by ht conditions we adopted a direct combustion test to verify its clean combustion features hydrochar derived at 260 c and residence time of 4 h hc 260 4 exhibited the highest calorific value hhvdaf 26 23 mj kg with an energy density of 1 43 and its fuel characteristics were similar to those of lignite the increase in the ht temperature and residence time up to 260 c and 4 h respectively was beneficial for enhancing hhvdaf conversely further increase of the ht temperature to 300 c and ht time to 6 h yielded a decrease in hhvdaf investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that the protein and polysaccharide releasing from sludge to hydrolysate occurred the maillard reaction mr the generated humic like maillard reaction product mrp was transferred to hydrochar inducing an increase in the carbon content and calorific value and a decrease in the organic content of hydrolysate as the carbohydrate content in the hydrolysate decreased the mr was terminated so no more mrp was transferred to hydrochar at the same time the protein was still continuously released at higher temperatures and longer residence times yielding a decline in the hhvdaf moreover clean energy utilization was verified from the reduced nitrogen content in hydrochar and lower co and nox emission of hc 260 4 in the combustion test after the ht increased hydrophobicity and a lower fraction of bound water improved the dewaterability which is of great significance for applying hydrochar as biofuel the findings of this study provided a new perspective to explain the heating value generation of hydrochar and more direct evidence to assess its clean combustion properties with promising perspectives for practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge hydrothermal condition heating value clean combustion hydrolysate 1 introduction managing excess sewage sludge generated from a wastewater treatment process becomes a critical challenge for wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to its high moisture content enormous yield and expensive disposal wang et al 2017 in china landfills and incineration are employed at a large scale to dispose of this hazardous solid however the use of traditional landfills is not desirable due to the strict chinese environmental protection policy and limited land resources wu et al 2019 incineration is a common technology for excess sludge minimization but secondary pollution might easily occur for these reasons the development of green and sustainable technologies for minimization of sludge amount and use of resources is indispensable thermal conversion technologies such as pyrolysis gasification and hydrothermal treatment are efficient pathways to minimize the sludge amount and resource use simultaneously pyrolysis and gasification of sewage sludge require a dry pretreatment a professional high pressure reactor with complex operations and high energy consumption zhang et al 2018 compared with other thermal processes hydrothermal technology can convert energy from high moisture and organic abundant excess sludge and avoid an energy intensive drying pretreatment zhang et al 2018 carbon products hydrochars as final products obtained in a spontaneous and exothermic ht process hu et al 2010 exhibit moderate calorific value and they can be used as biofuels he et al 2013 therefore ht is a promising method to simultaneously reduce high moisture excess sludge and provide solid biofuel for further utilization previous investigations mainly focused on the influence of ht conditions especially temperature and dwell time on the calorific value and properties of hydrochar to achieve a higher heating value hhv he et al 2013 obtained hydrochar with dry ash free hhvdaf of 26 95 28 52 mj kg at 200 c and residence time of 4 12 h silva et al 2020 reported a maximum hydrochar yield at 150 c for 60 min by ht while the hydrochar produced at 150 c for 30 min exhibited the highest calorific value the key role of temperature is to provide sufficient energy to decompose organic macromolecules into fragments and then polymerize them to form hydrochar akhtar and amin 2011 in general higher ht temperatures are beneficial for enhanced carbon and energy content in hydrochar and longer residence times usually contribute to a higher carbonization degree he et al 2013 tasca et al 2020 besides temperature and residence time the initial solid content of feedstock was reported to influence the heating value of hydrochars and hhv was the lowest when hydrochar was obtained at the lowest solid content tasca et al 2020 however some experimental studies indicated only a slow increase in hhv danso boateng et al 2015 saetea and tippayawong 2013 and even a slight decrease in hhv when prolonging the reaction time he et al 2013 peng et al 2016 it is well known that ht conditions significantly impact the hydrochar heating value characteristics however it is still elusive why higher temperatures and longer residence times exhibit adverse effects on the hydrochar heating value hhv of hydrochar showed a positive correlation with its carbon content wang et al 2019 organic substances partly release from sludge during ht and then dissolve into the liquid phase to form hydrolysate zhang et al 2019 decreasing the carbon content in hydrochar meanwhile the released proteins and polysaccharides undergo maillard reactions to form dark brown humic like substances inoue et al 1997 which might be transformed into hydrochar and increase its carbon content the releasing pattern of organic substances from sludge and the interaction of organic matter in hydrolysate are affected by ht conditions therefore the organics in the hydrolysate and in the solid phase are supposed to be in a dynamic reaction process the characteristics of hydrolysate may correlate with the carbon content or calorific value of the solid phase still very limited information is available on the hydrolysate acting as a medium to facilitate the generation of hydrochar and its corresponding calorific value which may open a novel perspective in investigating the biofuel generation mechanism during the ht sludge derived biofuel is different from lignin derived biofuel and it possesses a relatively high nitrogen content magdziarz and wilk 2013 posing a potential risk of high nox emission during combustion in the previous studies the fuel characteristics of sludge derived hydrochar were assessed as thermodynamic parameters via thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetric analysis dtg liu et al 2013 khan et al 2009 demirbas 2004 the actual combustion performances such as emission concentrations of no no2 nox and co were ignored although the nitrogen content in hydrochar was expected to decrease due to the release of nitrogen containing organics to hydrolysate it is still unclear whether the exhaust emission during the sludge derived hydrochar combustion can meet emission standards therefore it is reasonable to assess the clean combustion characteristics with the level of co and nox emission of the synthesized biofuel using a direct combustion test especially for the high nitrogen content feedstock of ht the objective of the present study is to reveal the calorific properties of the sludge derived biofuel from the perspective of hydrolysate and evaluate its clean energy utilization performance the specific goals were to 1 investigate the effect of ht temperature and residence time on characteristics and calorific value of the hydrochar 2 explore possible correlations between hydrochar energy and hydrolysate characteristics e g chemical oxygen demand carbohydrate content and protein concentration and the mechanism of hydrochar energy generation 3 evaluate the thermodynamic performance of hydrochar as a biofuel and the exhaust emission concentrations of co and nox in the combustion test 2 materials and methods 2 1 excess sewage sludge excess sewage sludge was collected from the sedimentation tank in a municipal sewage treatment plant shanghai city china the sludge was stored in a plastic box within 24 h at 4 c and used for ht experiments the characteristics of sludge are summarized in table 1 2 2 ht experiments ht experiments were conducted in ht synthesis reactors 100 ml yanzheng instruments the heat was supplied by a 220 v electrical heating jacket the schematic diagram of the reactors is shown in figure s1 in supporting information si in each parallel experiment 1 g dry weight of sludge was loaded with ultrapure water to 80 ml into the reactor before the ht experiment the feedstock was stirred 600 rpm for 30 min to ensure a uniform sludge distribution the effect of ht conditions on the calorific value of sludge was investigated the reactor was maintained at various heating temperatures 200 300 c for different residence times 0 5 8 h before cooling down to room temperature with a cooling ramp of approximate 15 c min the solid products were washed with ultrapure water 60 ml before suction filtration 0 1 mpa finally the solid products hydrochars were dried using a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h at 40 c the hydrochars under different ht conditions were denoted following the notation system hc x y x and y represent the reaction temperature and the residence time respectively 2 3 characterization of original sludge and hydrochars elemental analyses c h s n and o were performed by an automatic elemental analyzer el iii vario the ash content and volatile matter vm were evaluated according to the american society for testing and materials astm d3174 and d3175 testing materials 2009 2013 respectively fixed carbon fc content was calculated by subtracting the ash and the vm contents from 100 on a dry basis the energy content of hydrochar was presented as hhv determined by a bomb calorimeter xry 1a changji and hhvdaf was adopted to reflect a maximum calorific value of hydrochar scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 250 fei was used to examine hydrochar surface structure morphology functional groups of hydrochar were investigated using a fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir tensor 27 bruker the dewaterability was analyzed via detecting specific resistance to filtration srf of solid samples thermal stability analysis of hydrochar was assessed with a thermogravimetric analyzer tga tga 2 mettler toledo ftir srf and tga methods were described in si the energy density ed and the fuel ratio are calculated using the following equations yan et al 2009 he et al 2013 1 ed hhvdaf of dried hydrochar hhvdaf of dried feedstock 2 fuel ratio fc vm 2 4 combustion emission test the combustion emission test was modified according to lusini et al lusini et al 2014 2 g of hydrochar was weighted and placed in the chamber the chamber temperature was set at 650 c and kept for 10 min to ensure complete ignition and combustion of biofuel the airflow was adjusted to 100 ml min a portable flue gas analyzer mru nova plus germany was used for the continuous measurement of o2 co2 co no no2 and nox their concentrations were automatically recorded every 10 s equation 3 is used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in dry emitted gas with a measured o2 content to an equivalent pollutant concentration in dry emitted gas with a specified reference o2 content of 6

relative contents of free water and bound water were determined using a differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyzer lee lee 1995 a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem f 4600 hitachi test was used to identify compounds in hydrolysate as described in si protein and carbohydrate contents were quantified using lowry and anthrone based methods lowry et al 1951 pons et al 1981 chemical oxygen demand cod was used to quantify the concentration of organics in the hydrolysate 2 6 data analysis statistical analyses were performed using the r software version 3 5 3 the pearson s correlation coefficient r was used for linear estimations of the strength and direction of linear correlations between two parameters the r is always between 1 and 1 where 1 means a perfect negative correlation and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation while 0 denotes the absence of a relationship correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the mean value and standard deviation were calculated and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ht conditions on hydrochar characteristics as shown in table 2 physicochemical properties of the original sludge and hydrochars obtained under different ht conditions were analyzed to find out optimal ht conditions for hydrochar biofuel generation compared to other types of biomass used in the ht process biological sludge possesses a higher ash content thus hhvdaf is applied to reflect the calorific value of hydrochar he et al 2013 setting the residence time at 4 h the hhvdaf of hydrochar increases from 25 2 to 26 2 mj kg 1 with the temperature increase from 200 to 260 c the hhvdaf decreases with a further temperature increase at a constant temperature of 260 c the hhvdaf of hydrochar initially increases with the residence time up to 4 h but it decreases for longer residence time intervals among all hydrochars hc 260 4 exhibits maximum hhvdaf 26 2 mj kg and ed 1 43 indicating that hc 260 4 has higher energy enrichment the hhvdaf of hydrochar in this study is similar to sludge based hydrochar in the previous publications zhao et al 2014 obtained hydrochar with the hhvdaf of 26 50 mj kg while he et al 2013 reported 28 52 mj kg the heating value of hydrochar was closely related to the carbon content wang et al 2019 the elemental analyses shown in table s1 reveal that hc 260 4 exhibits the highest carbon content which is consistent with its highest hhvdaf further temperature increase from 260 to 300 c or prolonging residence time from 4 to 8 h decreases the hhvdaf and the carbon content as shown in table 2 the vm of hydrochar decreases with the ht temperature increase which is partly accompanied by the fc increase when the temperature reached 260 c hc 260 4 vm decreased to 30 5 and fc increased to 5 6 suggesting that the stable carbonization of sludge occurred the fuel ratio fc vm is a critical parameter that ranks hydrochar as a biofuel the ratio rises from 0 04 original sludge to 0 11 hc 200 4 and further increases to 0 20 hc 260 4 revealing that the rank of hydrochar is greatly improved from the elemental composition in hydrochar table s1 the changes in o c and h c atomic ratios are visualized by the van krevelen diagram figure s2 showing that hc 260 4 approaches the area of lignite via dehydration and decarboxylation reactions in this regard the biofuel rank of the hydrochar is comparable to lignite and mixing hydrochar with coal is expected to achieve good combustion performance therefore ht is a reliable process to improve the biofuel rank of hydrochar furthermore based on table 2 and table s1 the related matrix fitting model is constructed to explore the relationship between the changes in elemental composition c h and o and the hhvdaf adjustment figure s3 the differences of o c and h c atomic ratios between original sludge and the hydrochars indicate that dehydration and decarboxylation are essential reaction pathways in the hhvdaf enhancement while demethanation is negative according to the change in energy variation tendency of hydrochars figure s3a in addition the o c atomic ratio exhibits a higher effect on hhvdaf compared to h c atomic ratios figure s3b as discussed above ht conditions remarkably affect the properties of hydrochars indicators such as hhvdaf fuel ratio and carbon content which reflect the biofuel characteristics of hydrochars improve with the ht temperature increase from 200 to 260 c or prolonging the residence time from 0 5 to 4 h however further temperature increase to 300 c or extending time to 8 h is detrimental to the biofuel performance similar phenomena were reported in the previous studies where the hhv exhibited a slight decline when the ht time or temperature was too high he et al 2013 peng et al 2016 peng et al 2016 reported that at 260 c the hhv reached the maximum value of 12 06 mj kg at a reaction time of 60 min while it decreased to 9 8 mj kg at 360 min while the carbon content decreased from 24 49 to 19 9 following the same change rule in the reaction time for the reaction time of 30 min the hhv increases when the temperature rises from 180 to 260 c and then exhibits a little decrease up to 300 c consequently determining the optimal ht conditions is a prerequisite to obtain hydrochar as biofuel however there is a knowledge gap regarding why higher temperature or longer reaction time detriments the heating value of hydrochars the carbon content in hydrochar is affected not only by dehydration and decarboxylation occurring in sludge but also the release of organic matter from solid to hydrolysate and the transfer of organic substances from liquid to char the organics in hydrolysate and the solid phase are supposed to be in a dynamic reaction process directly impacting its heating value therefore the effect of hydrolysate characteristics on the hhv of hydrochar is considered in this study 3 2 effect of hydrolysate on hydrochar calorific value generation the organics in sludge dissolve into the liquid phase during the ht the surface morphology of the original sludge and hydrochars is represented in sem micrographs figure s4 a bulk of zoogloea with a diameter of around 10 μm appears in the original sludge at a higher ht temperature figure s4 b d and longer residence time figure s4 e c f the bulk structure of the original sludge ruptures into fragments and the average size of hydrochar decreases which might originate from the mass transfer from the sludge to hydrolysate after the ht the ph value of hydrolysate decreases from 8 7 original sludge supernatant to around 7 6 figure s5a probably due to the separation of hydroxyl groups from the sludge surface to hydrolysate in the dehydration reaction as proteins and polysaccharides are the main components of sludge their concentrations and cod in hydrolysate are detected as shown in fig 1 a b after the ht the content of organic matter increases in total particularly the concentration initially increases followed by a decrease but then rises again with the increment of residence time or ht temperature the organic content is the lowest at 260 c and residence time of 4 h afterward the binary normal density correlations between hydrolysate organic matter concentrations cod polysaccharides and proteins and hhvdaf are established as shown in fig 1c there is a negative correlation r 0 717 0 771 0 783 between cod polysaccharides proteins and hhvdaf indicating that a high organic content in hydrolysate is unfavorable for the calorific value generation of hydrochar during the ht as discussed above the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions in sludge lower the o and h contents and increase the carbon content yielding a higher hhvdaf of hydrochar simultaneously organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides is released from the sludge to the hydrolysate depleting the carbon content in the solid phase and increasing the organic concentration in the hydrolysate the relationship between the organic content and the hhvdaf also confirms that this process is unfavorable for the heating value generation it is usually assumed that a higher ht temperature or longer residence time triggers the intensive release of organics increasing the concentration of organics in the hydrolysate however under different ht conditions investigated in our study the lowest organic content occurs at 260 c in the ht temperature range from 200 to 300 c and in ht residence time of 4 h in the range from 0 5 to 6 h to explore what happens in hydrolysate and how the hhvdaf is affected under higher temperatures and longer reaction times we employed the eem method to track the component variations in hydrolysate as shown in fig 2 the peak locations and fluorescence intensities fi are marked which can be used for semi quantitative analysis of dissolved organic matter in the hydrolysate as described in figure s6 in si five regions can be distinguished based on emission and excitation wavelengths chen et al 2003 before the ht there were no peaks in the original sludge supernatant during the ht the intensities of peak a of the ht hydrolysate increases with the ht temperature fig 2 a c and reaction time fig 6 d b e indicating that the biomacromolecules are constantly released from the sludge to the hydrolysate the maillard reaction a kind of humification process occurs because of the co existence of proteins and carbohydrates in sludge zhang et al 2019 the maillard reaction product mrp is a kind of humic acid like substance and is revealed by peak b in fig 2 its intensity was speculated to increase with ht temperature and reaction time however it is noted that its intensity at 260 c is stronger than that at 220 c and 300 c the higher intensity also appears at a reaction time of 4 h rather than after 6 h fig 2 and table 2 furthermore mrps contents expressed by the absorbance at λ420 nm are measured at different ht times and constant ht temperature of 260 c the absorbance values of λ420 nm are 3 62 3 08 1 38 and 1 43 at 2 4 5 and 6 h respectively which is consistent with the peak intensity in the eem spectra the probable reason is that the maillard reaction was inhibited and terminated because of the low carbohydrate content in the original sludge as shown in table 1 the carbohydrates in hydrochar and hydrolysate under different ht conditions also verify this assumption table 3 and fig 1 a similar phenomenon was observed in the previous study zhang et al 2019 and the authors pointed out that polysaccharide was the limiting factor for the maillard reaction zhang et al 2020 then the produced mrp can precipitate toward the formed solid char yielding a weaker peak b intensity and a decrease in the organic content in the hydrolysate correspondingly the carbon content in hydrochar is increased since the maillard reaction is the process of dehydration and condensation the produced humic like substance is expected to possess a higher heating value than the original proteins and carbohydrates and the hhvdaf of the hydrochar is further enhanced with the mrp transfer when the ht temperature further increased from 260 to 300 c the protein content in hydrochar constantly decreases table 3 indicating that the protein releasing from the solid phase proceeds which is consistent with the increased protein concentration and cod in the hydrolysate and the decreasing carbon content in the hydrochar resultantly the hhvdaf of hc 300 4 is lower than that of hc 260 4 due to the loss of heat containing protein the relationship between hydrolysate and hydrochar calorific value is described in fig 3 3 3 thermal behavior and clean combustion performance of biofuel 3 3 1 clean combustion performance of hydrochar as biofuel firstly dtg and tga analyses are applied to investigate the combustion behavior and energy application potential of hydrochars as depicted in fig 4 there are three major mass loss stages in the first stage weight losses correspond to the removal of moisture below 100 c the temperature of this dehydration stage for the original sludge is higher than that of hydrochars probably due to the higher percentage of bound water in the original sludge the second stage is a devolatilization and combustion stage and the third one is a combustion and burn out stage two separated peaks appear in the original sludge because of the large differences in activities of the components the mass loss reaches the highest value at 269 c mainly involving the volatile matter combustion the rapid weight loss of sludge in the lower temperature range implies incomplete combustion with low efficiency and high emission of pollutants such as co liu et al 2013 khan et al 2009 as to hydrochars two peaks in the second and third stages are close in dtg curves indicating that the substances in hydrochar achieved homologation being mostly converted to chars additionally the elevated combustion temperature usually accompanies increased combustion efficiency and decreased pollutant emission liu et al 2013 demirbas 2004 to further investigate the combustion characteristics of the hydrochars the ignition temperature ti dtg peak temperature tm and burn out temperature tb are derived from the dtg curves table 4 ti is a critical parameter to avoid fire and explosion when using hydrochar as a biofuel xu and sheng 2011 the ti values of all hydrochars increase comparing to that of the original sludge and hc 260 4 exhibits the highest value which is attributed to the decrease of vm in hydrochars he et al 2013 tm represents the temperature where the sample change is the most obvious with a maximum weight loss rate or maximum reactivity point among different hydrochars hc 220 4 exhibits the highest tm 536 c probably because of some hardly decomposed components at a relatively low ht temperature when the temperature reaches the tb value organic constituents are fully oxidized and the residual decreases to a stable level the higher tb the longer the burning time he et al 2013 hydrochars derived under 260 c have tbs ranging from 676 to 681 c around 140 c higher than hydrochars derived from agricultural biomass liu et al 2013 this probably originates from the fact that the humic acid like substance containing hydrochar has higher tb than lignin based hydrochar using hydrochar as a biofuel gas emissions during combustion should be considered to evaluate its clean combustion level in the previous study the decrease in the hydrochar nitrogen content compared to the original feedstock was introduced to verify its clean combustion features however the emission of pollutants such as co and nox was related to the nitrogen content the amount composition and behavior of inorganic matter also exhibited significant effects on biochar combustion characteristics xu and sheng 2011 therefore more direct evidence should be provided to verify its clean combustion characteristics besides the nitrogen content in this study the nitrogen content is only 0 9 in the hydrochar of hc 260 4 much lower than that of the original sludge 5 2 table s1 in si indicating that ht could promote sludge to yield clean biofuel under these conditions the concentrations of cod proteins and carbohydrates in the hydrolysate reach the lowest values table 3 which is beneficial for the hydrolysate wastewater treatment then the original sludge and three typical hydrochars derived under different ht temperatures were chosen to conduct a direct combustion experiment firstly the o2 concentration in combustion emissions of different feedstock remains at 18 7 20 1 figure s7 suggesting enough o2 in a chamber to ensure complete fuel combustion the emission concentrations of co and nox are detected and compared with the emission standard chinese emission standard of air pollutants for coal burning oil burning gas fired boiler gb13271 2014 and beijing local standard of air pollutants for coal burning oil burning gas fired boiler db11 139 2015 db11 139 2015 2015 as shown in fig 5 hc 260 4 is the only biofuel sample that meets the emission standard and its emitted co concentration after combustion is 91 3 mg m3 below the co limit of 100 mg m3 hc 260 4 with higher tb can burn a long time to provide the full oxidization thereby avoiding the co formation caused by inadequate combustion compared to the original sludge all the hydrochars generated less nox after combustion the nox emission of hc 260 4 is 28 2 mg m3 meeting the required nox limit at 30 mg m3 in the key region beijing city first one part of nitrogen in hc 260 4 is removed after the ht so it emits a low nox amount during combustion second according to the associated research fuel combustion with a lower fuel ratio fc vm exhibits stronger nox formation chen et al 1995 a high fuel ratio indicates a less reactive fuel which could inhibit the nox formation in combustion systems due to the low fuel volatility jung et al 2001 based on the results shown in table 2 among all the hydrochars hc 260 4 exhibits the highest fuel ratio indicating the nox formation pathway is partly inhibited third compared to other hydrochars hc 260 4 has a lower tm value indicating that the main combustion occurs at lower temperatures high tm fuel emitted a higher nox amount since nitrogen in the fuel is oxidized more easily to form nox at higher combustion temperatures shameer and ramesh 2017 conclusively hc 260 4 has an excellent hhvdaf and combustion performance and it is a clean biofuel with low pollution emission for practical applications 3 3 2 dewaterability enhancement of hydrochar beneficial for combustion the moisture of hydrochar is still high after the ht and good dewaterability is conducive to obtaining a high combustion calorific value before applying hydrochar as biofuel the srf that reflects the sludge dewaterability before and after the ht is shown in table s2 after the ht the srf decreases sharply from 9 88 108 s2 g of the original sludge to 1 06 5 22 108 s2 g of the hydrochars higher temperatures and longer residence times are beneficial for sludge dewaterability hc 260 4 has a low enough srf 1 29 108 s2 g and good dewaterability in the related publication guo et al 2015 employed an ultrasonic aided method to activate sludge dewaterability and the srf of sludge decreased from 1 0 109 to 4 108 s2 g guo et al 2015 yu et al 2017 developed a bdellovibrio and like organisms pretreatment technology to boost municipal waste sludge biolysis and dewaterability was enhanced with the srf reduction of 53 4 compared to these investigations hc 260 4 exhibits better dewaterability performance after the ht process the pearson correlation coefficient between srf and hhvdaf of hydrochars was 0 751 p 0 01 revealing a significantly strong correlation between dewaterability and heating value this suggests that enhancing the dewaterability of hydrochar is a necessary step before using it as a biofuel further investigation was conducted to explore the mechanism of dewaterability enhancement the contact angle of hydrochar table s2 increases from 86 49 original sludge to 92 97 hc 260 4 indicating the surface of sludge changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after the ht the surface functional groups reflected in the ft ir spectra are shown in figure s8 the peak at 3423 cm 1 is attributed to the o h stretching vibration of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups this peak in hydrochars becomes weaker than in the original sludge consistent with the dehydration reaction during the ht yielding enhanced hydrophobicity moisture in sludge is mainly classified into free water and bound water bound water is hard to dewater due to its tight binding with substances on the sludge surface such as extracellular polymeric substance eps li et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 the original sludge contains 59 5 of bound water and its proportion decreases to 28 6 after 0 5 h of ht at 260 c when the ht residence time reaches 4 and 6 h this proportion decreases to 12 9 and 9 2 respectively we assume that the bound water is converted to free water during the ht and it can be easily separated from the sludge therefore the hydrophobicity enhancement and the decrease in the amount of bound water contribute to good dewaterability moreover during the combustion the bound water turns into steam and takes away some of the potential energy in the form of latent heat of vaporization thus this process also indirectly improves the hhvdaf by reducing the bound water content in hydrochar 4 conclusion in this study sludge was hydrothermally converted to hydrochar as biofuel the effects of ht conditions on hydrochar calorific value generation and the clean combustion properties of the obtained hydrochar were investigated it was found that the hhvdaf of hc 260 4 reached maximum 26 23 mj kg with the highest ed 1 43 while the ht temperature higher than 260 c and residence time longer than 4 h decreased the hhvdaf further investigation revealed that dehydration and decarboxylation increased the carbon content and promoted the energy enrichment in the solid phase simultaneously biomacromolecules such as proteins and polysaccharides releasing from the sludge to hydrolysate participated in the maillard reaction and the precipitation of the generated mrp to hydrochar further increased the hhvdaf however under higher ht temperatures or longer reaction times the maillard reaction is terminated because of the polysaccharide shortage still the protein release proceeded resulting in decreasing the hhvdaf and the carbon content in hydrochar in energetic applications hc 260 4 owning to its lower nitrogen content higher fuel ratio and higher tm emitted less nox and co than other hydrochars during combustion due to the hydrophobicity enhancement and the free water fraction decrease the dewaterability was improved which is further beneficial for biofuel combustion

17010,hydrothermal treatment ht is a promising method to convert sewage sludge to hydrochar biofuel the heating value is directly correlated to the carbon content in hydrochar however the release of

combustion test to verify its clean combustion features hydrochar derived at 260 c and residence time of 4 h hc 260 4 exhibited the highest calorific value hhvdaf 26 23 mj kg with an energy density of 1 43 and its fuel characteristics were similar to those of lignite the increase in the ht temperature and residence time up to 260 c and 4 h respectively was beneficial for enhancing hhvdaf conversely further increase of the ht temperature to 300 c and ht time to 6 h yielded a decrease in hhvdaf investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that the protein and polysaccharide releasing from sludge to hydrolysate occurred the maillard reaction mr the generated humic like maillard reaction product mrp was transferred to hydrochar inducing an increase in the carbon content and calorific value and a decrease in the organic content of hydrolysate as the carbohydrate content in the hydrolysate decreased the mr was terminated so no more mrp was transferred to hydrochar at the same time the protein was still continuously released at higher temperatures and longer residence times yielding a decline in the hhvdaf moreover clean energy utilization was verified from the reduced nitrogen content in hydrochar and lower co and nox emission of hc 260 4 in the combustion test after the ht increased hydrophobicity and a lower fraction of bound water improved the dewaterability which is of great significance for applying hydrochar as biofuel the findings of this study provided a new perspective to explain the heating value generation of hydrochar and more direct evidence to assess its

moisture content enormous yield and expensive disposal wang et al 2017 in china landfills and incineration are employed at a large scale to dispose of this hazardous solid however the use of traditional landfills is not desirable due to the strict chinese environmental protection policy and limited land resources wu et al 2019 incineration is a common technology for excess sludge minimization but secondary pollution might easily occur for these reasons the development of green and sustainable technologies for minimization of sludge amount and use of resources is indispensable thermal conversion technologies such as pyrolysis gasification and hydrothermal treatment are efficient pathways to minimize the sludge amount and resource use simultaneously pyrolysis and gasification of sewage sludge require a dry pretreatment a professional high pressure reactor with complex operations and high energy consumption zhang et al 2018 compared with other thermal processes hydrothermal technology can convert energy from high moisture and organic abundant excess sludge and avoid an energy intensive drying pretreatment zhang et al 2018 carbon products hydrochars as final products obtained in a spontaneous and exothermic ht process hu et al 2010 exhibit moderate calorific value and they can be used as biofuels he et al 2013 therefore ht is a promising method to simultaneously reduce high moisture excess sludge and provide solid biofuel for further utilization previous investigations mainly focused on the influence of ht conditions especially temperature and dwell time on the calorific value and properties of hydrochar to achieve a higher heating value hhv he et al 2013 obtained hydrochar with dry ash free hhvdaf of 26 95 28 52 mj kg at 200 c and residence time of 4 12 h silva et al 2020 reported a maximum hydrochar yield at 150 c for 60 min by ht while the hydrochar produced at 150 c for 30 min exhibited the highest calorific value the key role of temperature is to provide sufficient energy to decompose organic macromolecules into fragments and then polymerize them to form hydrochar akhtar and amin 2011 in general higher ht temperatures are beneficial for enhanced carbon and energy content in hydrochar and longer residence times usually contribute to a higher carbonization degree he et al 2013 tasca et al 2020 besides temperature and residence time the initial solid content of feedstock was reported to influence the heating value of hydrochars and hhv was the lowest when hydrochar was obtained at the lowest solid content tasca et al 2020 however some experimental studies indicated only a slow increase in hhv danso boateng et al 2015 saetea and tippayawong 2013 and even a slight decrease in hhv when prolonging the reaction time he et al 2013 peng et al 2016 it is well known that ht conditions significantly impact the hydrochar heating value characteristics however it is still elusive why higher temperatures and longer residence times exhibit adverse effects on the hydrochar heating value hhv of hydrochar showed a positive correlation with its carbon content wang et al 2019 organic substances partly release from sludge during ht and then dissolve into the liquid phase to form hydrolysate zhang et al 2019 decreasing the carbon content in hydrochar meanwhile the released proteins and polysaccharides undergo maillard reactions to form dark brown humic like substances inoue et al 1997 which might be transformed into hydrochar and increase its carbon content the releasing pattern of organic substances from sludge and the interaction of organic matter in hydrolysate are affected by ht conditions therefore the organics in the hydrolysate and in the solid phase are supposed to be in a dynamic reaction process the characteristics of hydrolysate may correlate with the carbon content or calorific value of the solid phase still very limited information is available on the hydrolysate acting as a medium to facilitate the generation of hydrochar and its corresponding calorific value which may open a novel perspective in investigating the biofuel generation mechanism during the ht sludge derived biofuel is different from lignin derived biofuel and it possesses a relatively high nitrogen content magdziarz and wilk 2013 posing a potential risk of high nox emission during combustion in the previous studies the fuel characteristics of sludge derived hydrochar were assessed as thermodynamic parameters via thermogravimetric analysis tga and derivative thermogravimetric analysis dtg liu et al 2013 khan et al 2009 demirbas 2004 the actual combustion performances such as emission concentrations of no no2 nox and co were ignored although the nitrogen content in hydrochar was expected to decrease due to the release of nitrogen containing organics to hydrolysate it is still unclear whether the exhaust emission during the sludge derived hydrochar combustion can meet emission standards therefore it is reasonable to assess the clean combustion characteristics with the level of co and nox emission of the synthesized biofuel using a direct combustion test especially for the high nitrogen content feedstock of ht the objective of the present study is to reveal the calorific properties of the sludge derived biofuel from the perspective of hydrolysate and evaluate its clean energy utilization performance the specific goals were to 1 investigate the effect of ht temperature and residence time on characteristics and calorific value of the hydrochar 2 explore possible correlations between hydrochar energy and hydrolysate characteristics e g chemical oxygen demand carbohydrate content and protein concentration and the mechanism of hydrochar energy generation 3 evaluate the thermodynamic performance of hydrochar as a biofuel and the exhaust emission concentrations of co and nox in the combustion test 2 materials and methods 2 1 excess sewage sludge excess sewage sludge was collected from the sedimentation tank in a municipal sewage treatment plant shanghai city china the sludge was stored in a plastic box within 24 h at 4 c and used for ht experiments the characteristics of sludge are summarized in table 1 2 2 ht experiments ht experiments were conducted in ht synthesis reactors 100 ml yanzheng instruments the heat was supplied by a 220 v electrical heating jacket the schematic diagram of the reactors is shown in figure s1 in supporting information si in each parallel experiment 1 g dry weight of sludge was loaded with ultrapure water to 80 ml into the reactor before the ht experiment the feedstock was stirred 600 rpm for 30 min to ensure a uniform sludge distribution the effect of ht conditions on the calorific value of sludge was investigated the reactor was maintained at various heating temperatures 200 300 c for different residence times 0 5 8 h before cooling down to room temperature with a cooling ramp of approximate 15 c min the solid products were washed with ultrapure water 60 ml before suction filtration 0 1 mpa finally the solid products hydrochars were dried using a vacuum freeze dryer for 24 h at 40 c the hydrochars under different ht conditions were denoted following the notation system hc x y x and y represent the reaction temperature and the residence time respectively 2 3 characterization of original sludge and hydrochars elemental analyses c h s n and o were performed by an automatic elemental analyzer el iii vario the ash content and volatile matter vm were evaluated according to the american society for testing and materials astm d3174 and d3175 testing materials 2009 2013 respectively fixed carbon fc content was calculated by subtracting the ash and the vm contents from 100 on a dry basis the energy content of hydrochar was presented as hhv determined by a bomb calorimeter xry 1a changji and hhvdaf was adopted to reflect a maximum calorific value of hydrochar scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 250 fei was used to examine hydrochar surface structure morphology functional groups of hydrochar were investigated using a fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir tensor 27 bruker the dewaterability was analyzed via detecting specific resistance to filtration srf of solid samples thermal stability analysis of hydrochar was assessed with a thermogravimetric analyzer tga tga 2 mettler toledo ftir srf and tga methods were described in si the energy density ed and the fuel ratio are calculated using the following equations yan et al 2009 he et al 2013 1 ed hhvdaf of dried hydrochar hhvdaf of dried feedstock 2 fuel ratio fc vm 2 4 combustion emission test the combustion emission test was modified according to lusini et al lusini et al 2014 2 g of hydrochar was weighted and placed in the chamber the chamber temperature was set at 650 c and kept for 10 min to ensure complete ignition and combustion of biofuel the airflow was adjusted to 100 ml min a portable flue gas analyzer mru nova plus germany was used for the continuous measurement of o2 co2 co no no2 and nox their concentrations were automatically recorded every 10 s equation 3 is used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in dry emitted gas with a measured o2 content to an equivalent pollutant concentration in dry emitted gas with a specified reference o2 content of 6

relative contents of free water and bound water were determined using a differential scanning calorimetry dsc analyzer lee lee 1995 a three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem f 4600 hitachi test was used to identify compounds in hydrolysate as described in si protein and carbohydrate contents were quantified using lowry and anthrone based methods lowry et al 1951 pons et al 1981 chemical oxygen demand cod was used to quantify the concentration of organics in the hydrolysate 2 6 data analysis statistical analyses were performed using the r software version 3 5 3 the pearson s correlation coefficient r was used for linear estimations of the strength and direction of linear correlations between two parameters the r is always between 1 and 1 where 1 means a perfect negative correlation and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation while 0 denotes the absence of a relationship correlations were considered statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the mean value and standard deviation were calculated and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ht conditions on hydrochar characteristics as shown in table 2 physicochemical properties of the original sludge and hydrochars obtained under different ht conditions were analyzed to find out optimal ht conditions for hydrochar biofuel generation compared to other types of biomass used in the ht process biological sludge possesses a higher ash content thus hhvdaf is applied to reflect the calorific value of hydrochar he et al 2013 setting the residence time at 4 h the hhvdaf of hydrochar increases from 25 2 to 26 2 mj kg 1 with the temperature increase from 200 to 260 c the hhvdaf decreases with a further temperature increase at a constant temperature of 260 c the hhvdaf of hydrochar initially increases with the residence time up to 4 h but it decreases for longer residence time intervals among all hydrochars hc 260 4 exhibits maximum hhvdaf 26 2 mj kg and ed 1 43 indicating that hc 260 4 has higher energy enrichment the hhvdaf of hydrochar in this study is similar to sludge based hydrochar in the previous publications zhao et al 2014 obtained hydrochar with the hhvdaf of 26 50 mj kg while he et al 2013 reported 28 52 mj kg the heating value of hydrochar was closely related to the carbon content wang et al 2019 the elemental analyses shown in table s1 reveal that hc 260 4 exhibits the highest carbon content which is consistent with its highest hhvdaf further temperature increase from 260 to 300 c or prolonging residence time from 4 to 8 h decreases the hhvdaf and the carbon content as shown in table 2 the vm of hydrochar decreases with the ht temperature increase which is partly accompanied by the fc increase when the temperature reached 260 c hc 260 4 vm decreased to 30 5 and fc increased to 5 6 suggesting that the stable carbonization of sludge occurred the fuel ratio fc vm is a critical parameter that ranks hydrochar as a biofuel the ratio rises from 0 04 original sludge to 0 11 hc 200 4 and further increases to 0 20 hc 260 4 revealing that the rank of hydrochar is greatly improved from the elemental composition in hydrochar table s1 the changes in o c and h c atomic ratios are visualized by the van krevelen diagram figure s2 showing that hc 260 4 approaches the area of lignite via dehydration and decarboxylation reactions in this regard the biofuel rank of the hydrochar is comparable to lignite and mixing hydrochar with coal is expected to achieve good combustion performance therefore ht is a reliable process to improve the biofuel rank of hydrochar furthermore based on table 2 and table s1 the related matrix fitting model is constructed to explore the relationship between the changes in elemental composition c h and o and the hhvdaf adjustment figure s3 the differences of o c and h c atomic ratios between original sludge and the hydrochars indicate that dehydration and decarboxylation are essential reaction pathways in the hhvdaf enhancement while demethanation is negative according to the change in energy variation tendency of hydrochars figure s3a in addition the o c atomic ratio exhibits a higher effect on hhvdaf compared to h c atomic ratios figure s3b as discussed above ht conditions remarkably affect the properties of hydrochars indicators such as hhvdaf fuel ratio and carbon content which reflect the biofuel characteristics of hydrochars improve with the ht temperature increase from 200 to 260 c or prolonging the residence time from 0 5 to 4 h however further temperature increase to 300 c or extending time to 8 h is detrimental to the biofuel performance similar phenomena were reported in the previous studies where the hhv exhibited a slight decline when the ht time or temperature was too high he et al 2013 peng et al 2016 peng et al 2016 reported that at 260 c the hhv reached the maximum value of 12 06 mj kg at a reaction time of 60 min while it decreased to 9 8 mj kg at 360 min while the carbon content decreased from 24 49 to 19 9 following the same change rule in the reaction time for the reaction time of 30 min the hhv increases when the temperature rises from 180 to 260 c and then exhibits a little decrease up to 300 c consequently determining the optimal ht conditions is a prerequisite to obtain hydrochar as biofuel however there is a knowledge gap regarding why higher temperature or longer reaction time detriments the heating value of hydrochars the carbon content in hydrochar is affected not only by dehydration and decarboxylation occurring in sludge but also the release of organic matter from solid to hydrolysate and the transfer of organic substances from liquid to char the organics in hydrolysate and the solid phase are supposed to be in a dynamic reaction process directly impacting its heating value therefore the effect of hydrolysate characteristics on the hhv of hydrochar is considered in this study 3 2 effect of hydrolysate on hydrochar calorific value generation the organics in sludge dissolve into the liquid phase during the ht the surface morphology of the original sludge and hydrochars is represented in sem micrographs figure s4 a bulk of zoogloea with a diameter of around 10 μm appears in the original sludge at a higher ht temperature figure s4 b d and longer residence time figure s4 e c f the bulk structure of the original sludge ruptures into fragments and the average size of hydrochar decreases which might originate from the mass transfer from the sludge to hydrolysate after the ht the ph value of hydrolysate decreases from 8 7 original sludge supernatant to around 7 6 figure s5a probably due to the separation of hydroxyl groups from the sludge surface to hydrolysate in the dehydration reaction as proteins and polysaccharides are the main components of sludge their concentrations and cod in hydrolysate are detected as shown in fig 1 a b after the ht the content of organic matter increases in total particularly the concentration initially increases followed by a decrease but then rises again with the increment of residence time or ht temperature the organic content is the lowest at 260 c and residence time of 4 h afterward the binary normal density correlations between hydrolysate organic matter concentrations cod polysaccharides and proteins and hhvdaf are established as shown in fig 1c there is a negative correlation r 0 717 0 771 0 783 between cod polysaccharides proteins and hhvdaf indicating that a high organic content in hydrolysate is unfavorable for the calorific value generation of hydrochar during the ht as discussed above the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions in sludge lower the o and h contents and increase the carbon content yielding a higher hhvdaf of hydrochar simultaneously organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides is released from the sludge to the hydrolysate depleting the carbon content in the solid phase and increasing the organic concentration in the hydrolysate the relationship between the organic content and the hhvdaf also confirms that this process is unfavorable for the heating value generation it is usually assumed that a higher ht temperature or longer residence time triggers the intensive release of organics increasing the concentration of organics in the hydrolysate however under different ht conditions investigated in our study the lowest organic content occurs at 260 c in the ht temperature range from 200 to 300 c and in ht residence time of 4 h in the range from 0 5 to 6 h to explore what happens in hydrolysate and how the hhvdaf is affected under higher temperatures and longer reaction times we employed the eem method to track the component variations in hydrolysate as shown in fig 2 the peak locations and fluorescence intensities fi are marked which can be used for semi quantitative analysis of dissolved organic matter in the hydrolysate as described in figure s6 in si five regions can be distinguished based on emission and excitation wavelengths chen et al 2003 before the ht there were no peaks in the original sludge supernatant during the ht the intensities of peak a of the ht hydrolysate increases with the ht temperature fig 2 a c and reaction time fig 6 d b e indicating that the biomacromolecules are constantly released from the sludge to the hydrolysate the maillard reaction a kind of humification process occurs because of the co existence of proteins and carbohydrates in sludge zhang et al 2019 the maillard reaction product mrp is a kind of humic acid like substance and is revealed by peak b in fig 2 its intensity was speculated to increase with ht temperature and reaction time however it is noted that its intensity at 260 c is stronger than that at 220 c and 300 c the higher intensity also appears at a reaction time of 4 h rather than after 6 h fig 2 and table 2 furthermore mrps contents expressed by the absorbance at λ420 nm are measured at different ht times and constant ht temperature of 260 c the absorbance values of λ420 nm are 3 62 3 08 1 38 and 1 43 at 2 4 5 and 6 h respectively which is consistent with the peak intensity in the eem spectra the probable reason is that the maillard reaction was inhibited and terminated because of the low carbohydrate content in the original sludge as shown in table 1 the carbohydrates in hydrochar and hydrolysate under different ht conditions also verify this assumption table 3 and fig 1 a similar phenomenon was observed in the previous study zhang et al 2019 and the authors pointed out that polysaccharide was the limiting factor for the maillard reaction zhang et al 2020 then the produced mrp can precipitate toward the formed solid char yielding a weaker peak b intensity and a decrease in the organic content in the hydrolysate correspondingly the carbon content in hydrochar is increased since the maillard reaction is the process of dehydration and condensation the produced humic like substance is expected to possess a higher heating value than the original proteins and carbohydrates and the hhvdaf of the hydrochar is further enhanced with the mrp transfer when the ht temperature further increased from 260 to 300 c the protein content in hydrochar constantly decreases table 3 indicating that the protein releasing from the solid phase proceeds which is consistent with the increased protein concentration and cod in the hydrolysate and the decreasing carbon content in the hydrochar resultantly the hhvdaf of hc 300 4 is lower than that of hc 260 4 due to the loss of heat containing protein the relationship between hydrolysate and hydrochar calorific value is described in fig 3 3 3 thermal behavior and clean combustion performance of biofuel 3 3 1 clean combustion performance of hydrochar as biofuel firstly dtg and tga analyses are applied to investigate the combustion behavior and energy application potential of hydrochars as depicted in fig 4 there are three major mass loss stages in the first stage weight losses correspond to the removal of moisture below 100 c the temperature of this dehydration stage for the original sludge is higher than that of hydrochars probably due to the higher percentage of bound water in the original sludge the second stage is a devolatilization and combustion stage and the third one is a combustion and burn out stage two separated peaks appear in the original sludge because of the large differences in activities of the components the mass loss reaches the highest value at 269 c mainly involving the volatile matter combustion the rapid weight loss of sludge in the lower temperature range implies incomplete combustion with low efficiency and high emission of pollutants such as co liu et al 2013 khan et al 2009 as to hydrochars two peaks in the second and third stages are close in dtg curves indicating that the substances in hydrochar achieved homologation being mostly converted to chars additionally the elevated combustion temperature usually accompanies increased combustion efficiency and decreased pollutant emission liu et al 2013 demirbas 2004 to further investigate the combustion characteristics of the hydrochars the ignition temperature ti dtg peak temperature tm and burn out temperature tb are derived from the dtg curves table 4 ti is a critical parameter to avoid fire and explosion when using hydrochar as a biofuel xu and sheng 2011 the ti values of all hydrochars increase comparing to that of the original sludge and hc 260 4 exhibits the highest value which is attributed to the decrease of vm in hydrochars he et al 2013 tm represents the temperature where the sample change is the most obvious with a maximum weight loss rate or maximum reactivity point among different hydrochars hc 220 4 exhibits the highest tm 536 c probably because of some hardly decomposed components at a relatively low ht temperature when the temperature reaches the tb value organic constituents are fully oxidized and the residual decreases to a stable level the higher tb the longer the burning time he et al 2013 hydrochars derived under 260 c have tbs ranging from 676 to 681 c around 140 c higher than hydrochars derived from agricultural biomass liu et al 2013 this probably originates from the fact that the humic acid like substance containing hydrochar has higher tb than lignin based hydrochar using hydrochar as a biofuel gas emissions during combustion should be considered to evaluate its clean combustion level in the previous study the decrease in the hydrochar nitrogen content compared to the original feedstock was introduced to verify its clean combustion features however the emission of pollutants such as co and nox was related to the nitrogen content the amount composition and behavior of inorganic matter also exhibited significant effects on biochar combustion characteristics xu and sheng 2011 therefore more direct evidence should be provided to verify its clean combustion characteristics besides the nitrogen content in this study the nitrogen content is only 0 9 in the hydrochar of hc 260 4 much lower than that of the original sludge 5 2 table s1 in si indicating that ht could promote sludge to yield clean biofuel under these conditions the concentrations of cod proteins and carbohydrates in the hydrolysate reach the lowest values table 3 which is beneficial for the hydrolysate wastewater treatment then the original sludge and three typical hydrochars derived under different ht temperatures were chosen to conduct a direct combustion experiment firstly the o2 concentration in combustion emissions of different feedstock remains at 18 7 20 1 figure s7 suggesting enough o2 in a chamber to ensure complete fuel combustion the emission concentrations of co and nox are detected and compared with the emission standard chinese emission standard of air pollutants for coal burning oil burning gas fired boiler gb13271 2014 and beijing local standard of air pollutants for coal burning oil burning gas fired boiler db11 139 2015 db11 139 2015 2015 as shown in fig 5 hc 260 4 is the only biofuel sample that meets the emission standard and its emitted co concentration after combustion is 91 3 mg m3 below the co limit of 100 mg m3 hc 260 4 with higher tb can burn a long time to provide the full oxidization thereby avoiding the co formation caused by inadequate combustion compared to the original sludge all the hydrochars generated less nox after combustion the nox emission of hc 260 4 is 28 2 mg m3 meeting the required nox limit at 30 mg m3 in the key region beijing city first one part of nitrogen in hc 260 4 is removed after the ht so it emits a low nox amount during combustion second according to the associated research fuel combustion with a lower fuel ratio fc vm exhibits stronger nox formation chen et al 1995 a high fuel ratio indicates a less reactive fuel which could inhibit the nox formation in combustion systems due to the low fuel volatility jung et al 2001 based on the results shown in table 2 among all the hydrochars hc 260 4 exhibits the highest fuel ratio indicating the nox formation pathway is partly inhibited third compared to other hydrochars hc 260 4 has a lower tm value indicating that the main combustion occurs at lower temperatures high tm fuel emitted a higher nox amount since nitrogen in the fuel is oxidized more easily to form nox at higher combustion temperatures shameer and ramesh 2017 conclusively hc 260 4 has an excellent hhvdaf and combustion performance and it is a clean biofuel with low pollution emission for practical applications 3 3 2 dewaterability enhancement of hydrochar beneficial for combustion the moisture of hydrochar is still high after the ht and good dewaterability is conducive to obtaining a high combustion calorific value before applying hydrochar as biofuel the srf that reflects the sludge dewaterability before and after the ht is shown in table s2 after the ht the srf decreases sharply from 9 88 108 s2 g of the original sludge to 1 06 5 22 108 s2 g of the hydrochars higher temperatures and longer residence times are beneficial for sludge dewaterability hc 260 4 has a low enough srf 1 29 108 s2 g and good dewaterability in the related publication guo et al 2015 employed an ultrasonic aided method to activate sludge dewaterability and the srf of sludge decreased from 1 0 109 to 4 108 s2 g guo et al 2015 yu et al 2017 developed a bdellovibrio and like organisms pretreatment technology to boost municipal waste sludge biolysis and dewaterability was enhanced with the srf reduction of 53 4 compared to these investigations hc 260 4 exhibits better dewaterability performance after the ht process the pearson correlation coefficient between srf and hhvdaf of hydrochars was 0 751 p 0 01 revealing a significantly strong correlation between dewaterability and heating value this suggests that enhancing the dewaterability of hydrochar is a necessary step before using it as a biofuel further investigation was conducted to explore the mechanism of dewaterability enhancement the contact angle of hydrochar table s2 increases from 86 49 original sludge to 92 97 hc 260 4 indicating the surface of sludge changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic after the ht the surface functional groups reflected in the ft ir spectra are shown in figure s8 the peak at 3423 cm 1 is attributed to the o h stretching vibration of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups this peak in hydrochars becomes weaker than in the original sludge consistent with the dehydration reaction during the ht yielding enhanced hydrophobicity moisture in sludge is mainly classified into free water and bound water bound water is hard to dewater due to its tight binding with substances on the sludge surface such as extracellular polymeric substance eps li et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 the original sludge contains 59 5 of bound water and its proportion decreases to 28 6 after 0 5 h of ht at 260 c when the ht residence time reaches 4 and 6 h this proportion decreases to 12 9 and 9 2 respectively we assume that the bound water is converted to free water during the ht and it can be easily separated from the sludge therefore the hydrophobicity enhancement and the decrease in the amount of bound water contribute to good dewaterability moreover during the combustion the bound water turns into steam and takes away some of the potential energy in the form of latent heat of vaporization thus this process also indirectly improves the hhvdaf by reducing the bound water content in hydrochar 4 conclusion in this study sludge was hydrothermally converted to hydrochar as biofuel the effects of ht conditions on hydrochar calorific value generation and the clean combustion properties of the obtained hydrochar were investigated it was found that the hhvdaf of hc 260 4 reached maximum 26 23 mj kg with the highest ed 1 43 while the ht temperature higher than 260 c and residence time longer than 4 h decreased the hhvdaf further investigation revealed that dehydration and decarboxylation increased the carbon content and promoted the energy enrichment in the solid phase simultaneously biomacromolecules such as proteins and polysaccharides releasing from the sludge to hydrolysate participated in the maillard reaction and the precipitation of the generated mrp to hydrochar further increased the hhvdaf however under higher ht temperatures or longer reaction times the maillard reaction is terminated because of the polysaccharide shortage still the protein release proceeded resulting in decreasing the hhvdaf and the carbon content in hydrochar in energetic applications hc 260 4 owning to its lower nitrogen content higher fuel ratio and higher tm emitted less nox and co than other hydrochars during combustion due to the hydrophobicity enhancement and the free water fraction decrease the dewaterability was improved which is further beneficial for biofuel combustion

17011,many lowland regions are afflicted with high phosphorus p peaks in rivers during the summer months static incubations of sediments have shown that reductive dissolution of ferric iron fe iii minerals in the sediment explain these p peaks this study was set up to identify if that mechanism also dominates in a dynamic system thereby testing the roles of water flow velocity and sediment fe p ratio decreasing flow velocity was suspected to lower the flux of dissolved oxygen do towards the sediment the role of the fe iii p ratio was tested by amending iron rich glauconite sand gs to the sediment in this manner testing possible remediation techniques eight flumes 1 80 m long were constructed with duplicates of four treatments of two laminar flow velocities over the sediment 0 05 m s 1 or 0 15 m s 1 that was either or not amended with gs 10 w w in all flumes a daily dose of sodium glutamate was added as a carbon source to mimic wastewater with high bod the flumes were operated for 28 days a decreased velocity lowered the steady state do concentration and enhanced the sediment water release of p by a factor 3 sediment amendment with gs reduced solution p by factors 3 low flow velocity and 2 high flow velocity this effect is related to a combination of increasing binding sites for p and of lowering the do consumption these experimental data suggest that previously unexplained summer peaks of p in lowland rivers are related to low flow events that limit the do flux the internal loading of p requires management of do in water and can be mitigated by enhancing sediment fe keywords phosphate release sediment water interactions flow velocity iron rich sand introduction european lowland rivers belgium the netherlands germany denmark etc are characterised by high phosphorus p concentration peaks during summer periods the annual average concentration in these regions is about 0 4 mg p l 1 which exceeds environmental limits by a factor 4 amery and vandecasteele 2015 umwelt bundesamt 2020 despite decreasing p emissions from agriculture the effect on the p concentration in surface waters is limited in flanders for example a decrease in total p freshwater emission of about 40 between 2007 and 2017 had no significant effect on the average dissolved p concentrations in the freshwater system van peteghem 2018 vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2016 likely due to the legacy p present in the sediments since p is often a limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems correll 1999 controlling the p concentration is a vital step for preventing eutrophication various methods have been applied to mitigate eutrophication cooke et al 1995 schoumans et al 2014 zamparas and zacharias 2014 including ex situ techniques such as sediment removal yu et al 2017 and in situ techniques like aeration chemical p inactivation such as aluminium or iron salts addition ghosh et al 2011 van dael et al 2020a recently geo engineering using solid p sorbents has been put forward as alternative to the rather drastic method of sediment removal it is generally less invasive practical to implement has a lower cost and importantly can act an immediate remediation strategy spears et al 2013 the statistical analysis of monitoring data has indicated that reductive dissolution of iron iii fe iii oxy hydroxides probably explains the summer p peaks in lowland rivers of flanders smolders et al 2017 under reducing conditions the dissolved oxygen do concentration is insufficient to supply electron e acceptors for organic matter om oxidation alternative e acceptors such as nitrate manganese mn iv and fe iii will be used in this case when fe iii oxy hydroxides reduce they start dissolving due to the much larger solubility of fe ii compared to fe iii macrae et al 2011 van der grift et al 2014 the p that was bound to the oxy hydroxides is released leading to increased p concentrations in surface waters this mechanism has long since been known in lakes where reductive conditions at the sediment water interface swi are more common than in lotic systems jensen et al 1992 mortimer 1941 sundby et al 1986 van dael et al 2020b the study of smolders et al 2017 was the first to recognise the possible importance of reductive dissolution as an important p release mechanism in streams however it was focussed on statistical data analysis and a static incubation so far there is no experimental evidence of this mechanism in dynamic systems the two main factors determining the extent of p release as a result of reductive dissolution are 1 the do concentration at the swi and 2 the molar ratio of oxalate extractable p and fe in the sediment the importance of a reduced do concentration is likely the main reason that this mechanism has not been considered in streams before but it does explain why the p peaks in streams only occur during summer months the dips in do concentration relate to the combination of a higher do demand and lower flow velocity on the one hand higher temperatures during summer lead to increased respiration rates and an increased do demand the om inputs during summer are larger due to an increase in primary production and an increased microbial activity typically the q10 values for om degradation by microorganisms range between 1 5 and 2 meyer et al 2018 on the other hand the lower flow velocities during summer lead to more laminar flow and slower do transport towards the swi higashino et al 2008 this also explains why summer p peaks are more pronounced in first and second order streams based on strahler classification than in higher order streams the flow velocity of smaller streams is influenced much more by seasonality than is the case for large rivers huggins and anderson 2005 the p fe ratio in the sediment indicates how much p will be released per unit of fe that is reduced this suggests that a lower p fe ratio will yield lower p release for the same amount of fe that is reduced field data showed a strong correlation between the occurrence of summer p peaks and the sediment p fe ratio only at high p fe ratios 0 12 mol mol 1 the fe iii reduction is large enough compared to the p concentration to release significant amounts of p that will impact the environment smolders et al 2017 in contrast at low p fe ratios the fe iii concentration in the sediment is in excess and will buffer the p concentration even if there is reduction of part of the fe iii minerals testing these factors under field conditions is often impractical for example due to inaccessibility of the stream or due to its size which would require a large experimental set up stream solute workshop 1990 furthermore there are many confounding factors when comparing multiple streams in a field trial or even within one stream summer and winter not only differ in temperature and associated do solubility but also differ in water flow velocities i e the effects of do and flow velocity cannot be disentangled flumes could be used to experimentally vary single factors in model streams and act as an intermediate step towards field studies examples of such studies are those made to measure the diffusion of do under different flow conditions higashino et al 2008 determining the fate of pharmaceuticals in streams li et al 2015 or investigating variations in macro benthos populations depending on flow velocities pereda briones et al 2018 this study was set up to identify if reductive dissolution of fe iii explains p release in a dynamic system thereby testing the role of water flow velocity which is suspected to control the flux of do towards the sediment the role of the fe iii p ratio was tested by amending iron rich glauconite sand gs to the sediment thereby testing the efficiency and stability under reducing conditions for future use as a cheap and easily available remediation material materials and methods sediment and gs characterisation the sediment was sampled from the devebeek in pittem flanders 50 58 50 5 n 3 16 29 3 e in total 180 l of sediment was collected from the top 5 cm layer with shovels and the sediment was stored wet with overlying water at 4 c until the beginning of the experiment before use the sediment was manually filtered by removing stones plastic and other waste branches leaves twigs and other material with dimensions exceeding 1 cm characterisation of the sediment was done in previous research by van dael et al 2020 oxalate extractable elements om mineral n and the cation exchange capacity cec were all measured in that study this sediment was chosen based on its large molar p fe ratio and the high p concentrations in the stream in the static incubation experiment this sediment exhibited significant respiration rates indicating that anoxia was likely a natural iron rich glauconite sand used in this study was collected from a sunken lane in lubbeek in belgium 50 53 06 4 n 4 46 08 9 e it contains 167 g kg 1 fe 16 g kg 1 al 1 1 g kg 1 p the gs sample was ground and sieved over 2 mm before use the oxalate extractable fe and al contents were also measured to estimate the p sorption capacity of gs and the sedimentary p fe molar ratio after amendment flume construction eight flumes were constructed based on the design of li et al 2016 the flumes consist of 3 major parts the propulsion system sediment compartment and the container fig 1 the propulsion system drives a propeller that thrusts the water around and over the sediment in order to achieve a constant and adjustable laminar flow over the sediment the sediment compartment holds the sediment and guides the water through the system as efficient as possible via the triangular flow guide the container holds all these parts and acts as the water reservoir the propulsion system consists of an electric motor shaft suspension system and propeller the motor pichler boost 40 is powered by an externally modified pc feed and controlled through a timer card pci 6601 counter timer device national instruments this timer card is programmed in labview software in order to send the appropriate signal to the electronic speed controller esc connected to the motor the rotation speed of the motor and thus the water velocity can be easily changed in this setup a mechanical flow meter is used to measure the water velocity in the sediment compartment the driving shaft is 0 75 m long in order to allow the motor to be above the water level the long shaft is necessary to retain a low shaft angle about 20 in order to keep the thrust efficiency as high as possible montoya 2005 at the end of the shaft a 3 blade propeller is installed all components are made of inert stainless steel and pvc so no interaction with the experiment is possible the motor and shaft are attached to the wall of the box the sediment compartment is made of 10 mm thick pvc and consists of the sediment trench and the triangular flow guide which minimises the backflow of water the total length and width of sediment bed is 180 15 cm the outer container is made from 18 mm coated plywood and constructed with slats wood glue and screws it is 244 cm long 61

the flumes were tested with four treatments to test 1 effects of flow velocity on the do concentration and subsequent p release and 2 the use of iron rich glauconite sand to remediate p release the eight flumes were filled to obtain a water table height of 10 cm above the swi v 230 l four treatments were applied in duplicate in a full factorial design two flow velocities were applied 0 05 and 0 15 m s 1 and 1 5 kg of gs was added to half of the flumes 10 based on dry weight of the 5 cm sediment and was gently mixed within the top layer of the sediment 0 1 cm a daily dose of om 32 2 mg sodium glutamate l 1 day 1 was added to each flume to simulate a high biological oxygen demand bod water with a high microbial activity the total duration of the experiment was 28 days the water velocities

to a daily starting bod of 24 7 mg o2 l 1 i e representing water near wastewater discharges see discussion daily water samples were taken in duplicate 1 cm above the sediment and immediately filtered 0 45 µm and acidified 1 ultrapure hno3 simultaneously a water sample was taken through a dialysis membrane spectra por dialysis membrane 12 14 kda that had been suspended as 10 ml dialysis bags filled with tap water identical to the flumes at the sampling location for at least 24 hours the dialysis samples were also acidified the water samples were analysed for soluble reactive p srp using the malachite green method ohno and zibilske 1991 all other solutes of interest such as fe and mn were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms agilent 7700x agilent technologies several water parameters t do ph and electrical conductivity ec were also measured daily using a multiparameter probe eijkelkamp multiparameter ap 700 to better understand the p fluxes across the swi probes of diffusive gradient in thin films dgt were vertically deployed at 15 days after the start of the experiment the dgt probes are commonly used to indicate the concentration gradients at the swi ding et al 2015 one deoxygenated dgt probe was deployed in each flume for a 24 h period across the swi a dgt consists of a zero sink binding layer covered with a diffusive gel polyacrylamide through which solutes migrate before binding on the binding layer based on the final mass bound on the binding layer and the contact time of the dgt with the sediment or water the concentration of the solute can be calculated these probes allowed to make depth profiles of mobile p the dgt probes with active zone of 15 cm were prepared according to guan et al 2015 with a zr oxide binding layer rather than the traditional fe oxides this was done in order to prevent reduction of the binding layer in anoxic conditions after 24 h deployment with about 10 cm above and 5 cm below the swi the probes were dismantled and the binding gels were cut into slices of 3 mm wide each slice was individually eluted in 1 ml 0 5 m naoh the elution liquid was diluted and measured using the malachite green method this way a concentration depth profile for p could be constructed with a resolution of 3 mm most sediment characteristics were determined in a prior experiment cf supra however the oxalate extractable elements p fe al and mn were determined right before starting this experiment and again afterwards schwertmann 1964 the final samples were both top layer samples ca 1 cm deep and bulk samples data

sediment water p fluxes were calculated by two methods the first method is based on the changes in the srp concentrations in the overlying water over time the second method is based on the dgt p

linear regression on data between 0 0 5 cm below the swi see results statistical analyses were performed using the jmp pro version 14 0 0 the treatment effects on p and fe in solution and on the dgt labile p in the sediment pore water were analysed with general linear regression models with time and depth added as a random factor the treatment effects on the p fe molar ratio in the sediment after the experiment and on the sediment p fluxes were analysed with two way anova followed by tukey hsd post hoc test results sediment and water properties table 1 shows the reactive p and fe content measured by oxalate extraction the p fe molar ratio of the top 10 mm sediment theoretically reduces by the gs addition from 0 37 to 0 32 both ratios are 0 12 which is the threshold above which p is released under anoxic conditions see above suggesting little theoretical gs effects on p release table 2 shows the mean values of physical chemical parameters in the overlying water during the experiment the temperature was constant 20 and identical in all treatments little differences in ph values were observed among treatments being close to 9 during the entire experiment this demonstrates that gs amendment had no obvious impact on ph of the overlying water during the experiment the same amount of sodium glutamate solution was continuously added to each flume to simulate a high bod emission hence ec significantly increased over time p 0 005 but did not differ among treatments p 0 05 the do concentration under high flow velocity 6 mg o2 l 1 was significantly higher than that under low flow velocity 2 4 mg o2 l 1 the gs application to the sediment yielded a significantly higher do concentration compared to the control under low but not under higher flow velocities the reynolds numbers for the slow and fast treatment are 850 and 2550 respectively table 2 this indicates a better oxygen transport from the water surface towards the sediment in the fast flowing treatment srp and fe dynamics in the overlying water in fig 2 a the srp is shown as a function of time there was no significant difference in srp concentrations between filtrates 0 45 µm and dialysis samples filtrate p mg p l 1 1 039 dialysis p mg p l 1 0 007 fig s1 therefore only the filtrate data are used during further data analysis flow velocity and gs addition had both significant effects on p dynamics in the overlying water p 0 001 for both the highest srp concentration was observed in the control treatment under low flow velocity increasing strongly to 1 25 mg p l 1 over 25 days well above srp limits prevailing in the region from which the sediment was sampled 0 07 0 14 mg p l 1 increasing the flow velocity significantly reduced the srp concentration in solution by more than factor 3 in the control no gs treatment p 0 001 the gs addition also significantly reduced the srp concentration in the overlying water by more than factor 2 high flow or 3 low flow moreover a significant difference in srp was found between gs low flow and gs high flow p 0 01 which means the gs immobilisation ability was decreased by increasing flow velocity similar trend and treatment effects can be also found in total dissolved p concentrations tdp data not shown the fe release to the overlying water also increased initially followed by a decrease but with much lower concentrations than srp in the solution fig 2 b low flow velocity enhanced fe release but only in the control not in the gs treatment the gs addition did not increase the dissolved fe concentrations the occurrence of the p and fe peaks do not coincide in time the fe peak occurs after about 15 days while the p peak arrives after about 25 days dgt labile p in the sediment pore water the effect of flow velocity and gs addition on the vertical distribution of dgt labile p concentration at the swi is shown in fig 3 the graphs are ordered by decreasing p concentrations similar treatment effects were found in dgt labile p in the pore water as in the srp in the overlying water i e increased flow velocity and gs addition significantly reduced dgt labile p in the sediment pore water p 0 001 for both for the two flumes in the control low flow a sharp concentration gradient of dgt labile p was observed just below the swi followed by a maximum at depths greater than 28 mm 3 56 0 90 mg p l 1 increasing the flow velocity reduced the gradient near the swi and it lowered dgt labile p concentrations in the deeper sediment layers the gs additions either under low flow or high flow reduced the dgt labile p in the sediment with mean values of 1 29 0 48 mg l 1 under low flow and 0 68 0 33 mg l 1 under high flow respectively remarkably under high flow velocity the dgt labile p profile was characterised by the absence of a steep gradient at the swi remaining low and stable up to depths of 35 mm below the sediment this indicates that the resupply of labile p from the sediment to the pore water was inhibited by gs addition not only at the upper layer where the gs was added top 10 mm but also in deeper sediment layers sediment p flux the p fluxes were calculated both by using the surface water p concentrations and by using the dgt concentration gradients and fick s law of diffusion table 3 both calculation methods suggest similar treatment effects on the fluxes but the fluxes calculated with the dgt profile were a factor 2 4 smaller on average the two way anova analysis shows that both the flow velocity and gs addition have a significant effect on the p flux there is also a significant interaction effect between both variables showing that gs addition is more efficient at lower flow velocities sediment properties affected by treatment and time after the experiment surface and bulk sediment samples below the 1 cm surface that was amended were sampled and analysed fig 4 table s1 the p o x f e o x a l o x and calculated degree of p saturation dps are shown in table s1 the p fe molar ratio before and after treatment is shown in fig 4 after gs addition the concentrations of f e o x in the surface layer where the gs was added were larger than those where no gs was added the dps values in gs amended sediments were smaller than those without gs addition no differences in the p o x and a l o x were observed between treatments either in the surface samples or in the bulk samples the molar p fe ratio was generally lowered in the amended sediment compared to the control p 0 001 while the p fe ratio in the top layer was lower compared to that in the bulk sediment in the control treatments p 0 001 discussion effect of glutamate addition the goal of this research was to replicate p release in a dynamic system in a worst case scenario of high bod water initial attempts with the flumes used n2 purging of the water to lower the do however that method never lowered the do effectively on the long term and the technique of adding a high bod proved to be more efficient internal loading by reductive dissolution of fe iii minerals is strongest during summer when there is a large amount of microbial activity i e when the oxygen demand is large van dael et al 2020b to mimic this situation biodegradable dissolved om bdom in the form of na glutamate was added daily 10 4 mg c l 1 d 1 which corresponds with a biological oxygen demand bod of 24 7 mg o2 l 1 this concentration is environmentally relevant bod averages about 8 mg o2 l 1 in moderately polluted rivers wilhelm 2009 this shows that the conditions in this study correspond with a rather extreme oxygen depletion rate that will most likely only occur in streams with wastewater inflow and during warm low flow periods the addition of glutamate can be interpreted as om input from a large primary production during summer which stimulates the microbial biomass in the sediment the sodium na that is added together with the glutamate could also have affected the results assuming na is inert in a sediment water system total na concentration after 28 days should have linearly increased with 130 mg na l 1 i e with 5 7 mm the measured na concentration in solution increased from 3 5 mm after one day due to equilibration to 8 6 mm finally the initial strong na increase is most likely the result of equilibration between the pore water and the overlying water due to the daily na inputs the ec in the flumes rose linearly over time reaching values of 2500 µs cm 1 at the end of the experiment the average ec in flemish waters 2003 2017 is 1100 µs cm 1 with 2500 µs cm 1 the 95 percentile the average ec for the stream where the sediment was sampled is 1500 µs cm 1 this suggests that the final na concentrations and ec values are relatively high but not impossible compared to the field effects of flow velocity anoxic conditions in the sediment will lead to reduction of oxidised species such as no3 mn iv and fe iii the extent of reduction depends on the oxygen transport to the swi this oxygen transport is dependent on the flow velocity of the overlying water larger flow velocities and an increased oxygen transfer into the sediment should prevent fe reduction at the sediment surface and limit subsequent p release these hypotheses were clearly corroborated by the results the do concentration measured in the water phase was significantly larger in the fast flowing treatments with averages of 6 5 and 2 7 mg o2 l 1 for the fast and low flow treatments respectively table 2 these differences in do concentration are most likely due to the differences in turbulence between the two velocities re 850 and 2550 for the slow and high flow respectively generally flows where re 2000 are considered laminar meaning that there is less vertical solute transport in this case rhodes 2017 the suboxic concentrations in the water phase of the low flow treatment already indicate that the fe reduction front could reach the sediment surface and release phosphate even in dynamic systems the reason for this is the more laminar flow regime at lower flow velocities whereas in more turbulent systems the oxygen is transported rapidly due to more intensive water mixing a second effect is that the shear layer between the water and sediment the so called diffusive boundary layer will become thinner as the flow velocity increases higashino and stefan 2005 this layer is considered to have a completely laminar flow regime so solute transport happens exclusively via diffusion earlier research has shown that an increased flow velocity leads to a decrease in diffusive boundary layer thickness and hence an increased oxygen flux jørgensen and des marais 1990 jørgensen and revsbech 1985 the tested flow velocities in these studies were similar as in the current study and ranged 0 02 0 20 m s 1 leading to diffusive boundary layer thicknesses ranging 0 16 1 1 mm depending on the velocity and the roughness of the sediment surface rougher sediments leading to thicker boundary layers the difference in do concentration between the two flow velocities indeed led to differences in the dissolved p concentration in the water phase the srp concentrations were a factor 3 higher in the low flow velocity treatment compared to the high flow velocity fig 2 a table 3 the same is true for the dgt labile p concentrations in the sediments these should be close to pore water p concentration profiles in the sediment close to the surface the p concentration increases with depth but in the deeper sediment layers the p concentration reaches a more or less constant value fig 3 this value is about a factor 2 larger for the low flow velocities than for the high flow velocities fig 3 table 3 even though this confirms our hypotheses many other researchers found the opposite effect i e an increased p release with increasing flow velocities jarvie et al 2012 tong et al 2017 both these studies focussed on total p tp which increased with increasing flow velocities which was attributed to increased suspended particles containing p however tong et al 2017 also noted an effect of the velocity on the srp concentration at flow velocities 0 2 m s 1 they observed decreasing srp concentrations with increasing flow velocities larger velocities 0 2 m s 1 on the other hand led to an increase in soluble p concentrations this was also attributed to the increased suspended matter with increased flow velocities which would accelerate p exchange between sediment particles and the water phase the current study was focused on reductive dissolution of fe and release of bound p this means only filtered samples 0 45 µm were analysed in order to exclude particle bound p secondly the flow velocities used here are both 0 2 m s 1 simulating a summer period at these low velocities the effects are similar as observed by tong et al 2017 i e larger p release at the lowest flow velocities due to anoxic conditions at the swi leading to reductive dissolution the fact that both flow velocities were rather low in this study is probably the reason why the tdp was not greatly flow velocity dependent which was good since the goal of the study was to determine the effect of flow velocity on srp without interference of increased suspended particles our flow velocity dependent p release is also clearly affected by the use of high bod water the large bod ensures a large respiration rate enhancing reductive dissolution of fe and p the flow velocities selected in this study are both relatively low since the most critical period for high p concentrations in lowland systems are during low flow summer periods and those peaks mainly occur in small streams during these periods the flow velocities can indeed be as low as 0 1 m s 1 in field conditions van dael et al 2020a unpublished data vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2019 causing oxygen limitation similar to what was observed in this research for fe the same trend was expected as for p however while p concentrations reached values up to 1 2 mg p l 1 fe concentrations in the water phase remained low 0 2 mg fe l 1 furthermore there were no large differences in dissolved fe between the different treatments these results contrasts those of anaerobic batch incubations including the same sediment as used here where fe concentrations in the overlying water reached over 50 mg fe l 1 van dael et al 2020b most likely the conditions are less reducing compared to the static situation due to faster do exchange in the dynamic systems and rapid oxidation in the alkaline water ph 9 where the oxidation half life of fe ii to fe iii is 0 15 seconds in presence of 2 7 mg do l 1 average concentration in the slow flowing treatments baken et al 2015 this theory is confirmed by the p fe ratio of the control treatment which decreased during the experiment and was lower in the top layer than in the bulk sediment fig 4 table s1 this means that relatively more p than fe has been removed from the sediment and that diffusion of fe ii from the deep sediment layers towards the surface leads to fe accumulation it is clear that rapid re oxidation and precipitation of fe occurs while p remains in the water phase similar observations have been made in the field during summer high t and high ph fe from groundwater is immediately oxidised after surfacing van der grift et al 2014 this phenomenon could also explain why there is a time lag between the drop in p and fe concentrations fig 2a and b after fe re oxidation p could eventually be adsorbed again on the formed fe iii oxy hydroxides but this process is slower than fe oxidation itself effect of gs addition in this study the application of iron rich gs as amendment strongly reduced p concentrations in the overlying water and in the pore water which confirms that gs addition is useful to reduce p release from sediments even under anoxic conditions low flow velocity and high bod in the surface water the initial p fe ratio after gs amendment was 0 32 mol mol 1 and was not changed significantly after the experiment given the minor difference in this ratio between the control and gs treatment the effect of gs addition was expected to be limited in contrast the data clearly show a large effect of gs addition on the p concentration in the overlying water phosphate dynamics from the sediment to overlying water are dominated by two basic processes pore water diffusion induced by concentration gradients and resupply from the solid phase by dissolution yao et al 2016 the dgt p concentration in sediment represents both the dissolved p fraction in the pore water and the resupply from the solid phase hence it indicates the p release potential i e labile p ding et al 2015 zhang et al 1998a in the unamended sediment the labile p depth profiles had large concentration gradients at the swi fig 3 table 3 leading to a strong upwards diffusion of phosphate to the overlying water the gs addition drastically reduced these concentration gradients which is consistent with the reduction of srp in the overlying water factor 3 6 this indicates that immobilisation of p in the pore water by sufficient fe iii supply created a barrier at several millimetres below the swi thus inhibiting the upward migration of phosphate from sediment to the overlying water the dissimilarities in water composition between the control and gs treatment suggest that gs prevents p release using two different mechanisms on the one hand the increased amount of fe in gs increases the p binding capacity of the sediment the lower p fe molar ratio in the gs amended sediment demonstrates that a larger fe iii supply is able to bind p even though part of these fe iii compounds are still mobilised by fe reduction under low flow velocity fig 4 jensen et al 1992 smolders et al 2017 moreover the gs had a larger effect on p immobilisation than initially expected due to the higher affinity for p of the fe in the gs than the authigenic fe and was a more efficient sorbent than the authigenic fe oxy hydroxides on the other hand the addition of extra fe iii minerals can lead to fe iii being used as an e acceptor before the oxygen supply is exhausted this is reflected by the significantly higher do concentration in the gs amended treatment at low flow velocities table 2 the gs application is more efficient under low flow velocity which is reflected by the significant interaction term in the two way anova analysis table 3 the reason is that there is more anoxia and reductive dissolution in the low flow velocity treatment so in that case the addition of extra p sorption capacity is more important although even at a larger flow velocity the gs addition still lowered p release by a factor 2 in previous studies other materials at the same or even lower fe doses have shown better p immobilisation than gs examples are synthesised iron minerals such as magnetic microparticles funes et al 2017 and amorphous ferric hydroxide fuchs et al 2018 zou et al 2017 iron modified zeolite liu et al 2017 zhan et al 2019 drinking water residues wang et al 2013 and steel slag klimeski et al 2014 this can be explained because a large fraction of the fe 96 in gs is not available for p immobilisation not oxalate extractable however many of these materials are artificially synthesised or modified in the lab so large scale application would be limited considering the cost therefore naturally occurring iron rich gs is a potential low cost amendment to control internal loading and mitigate eutrophication for wide application in terms of p immobilisation efficiency redox resistance abundance and accessibility apart from that gs has been proven to be physically stable when used to reduce p losses from drained agricultural fields vandermoere et al 2018 gs compacts the surface sediment when added to the surface sediment layer probably as result of its high density gu et al 2019 this was observed at the end of the incubation experiment the gs addition increased sediment stability and consolidation which can possibly prevent sediment from resuspension and disturbance and is usually essential for the cultivation of aquatic macrophytes egemose et al 2010 fan et al 2017 in addition gs addition did not significantly enhance toxic trace metal concentrations in water cd cu zn cr and ni of course further research on potential side effects on organisms should be also investigated before real field experiments are undertaken p fluxes the sediment water p fluxes either calculated from solution srp or from the dgt data table 3 confirm the significant role of flow velocity and adding gs on the internal loading of p the fluxes found here coincide well with the p release fluxes found in several lakes urban et al 1997 and penn et al 2011 found p fluxes between 3 31 mg p m 2 d 1 which are of similar magnitude as the fluxes in the control flumes 13 60 mg p m 2 d 1 depending on flow velocity and on the method to determine the flux extrapolations to the field should be made with care since this is a simplified and controlled system that does not account for complex field conditions nevertheless we feel like a flume experiment is a necessary intermediate step between a static incubation and a field validation the difference between both flux calculation methods is significant the dgt data day 15 yield consistently smaller fluxes than the fluxes based on the rise in srp between days 3 24 this is probably related to a combination of factors first the dgt labile p concentrations are a lower estimate of the pore water p concentration because the flux from the solution to the dgt is faster than the resupply from the solid phase to the solution annan 2002 zhang et al 1998b the ratio between dgt labile p and the initial pore water p concentration is termed the r factor and has been modelled for soils the r factor is 0 1 0 8 and is large when the resupply is large the k d solid liquid distribution coefficient and is faster than the uptake by the dgt degryse et al 2009 the pore water based diffusive flux according to eq 5 is logically larger than the dgt based one as the pore water concentrations are larger the factor 2 4 difference between the dgt labile fluxes and srp fluxes is well in line with a r factor of 1 2 4 or 0 4 well in the middle of modelled values for soils second and probably smaller reason to explain the differences in fluxes is the time difference it is possible that initial fluxes of p are larger than final ones and that the fluxes around day 15 are already smaller than time averaged ones between days 3 24 conclusion this study yielded the first experimental evidence that increased flow velocities lead to better oxygen exchange between water and sediment which in turn limits the release of p from the sediment however this conclusion is only valid under certain conditions namely in periods of large oxygen depletion and flow velocities 0 2 m s 1 e g during dry warm summer periods in lowland systems the reductive dissolution of fe is likely an important pathway for p release under such conditions only limiting the use of surface water in agriculture during low flow periods might prevent the flow velocity from dropping too far and would be a good policy for preventing anoxia at the sediment water interface however these results should be corroborated by field observations and in situ measurements secondly this study showed that the use of glauconite sand 10 w w as a remediation strategy for p release vastly reduces the p concentration in the overlying water this material might be less effective in p immobilisation than some synthesised materials but it is significantly cheaper abundantly available and is proven to be stable under anoxic conditions this is why glauconite sand might be a viable option for future large scale use in the field mmc1 zip mmc2 docx declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17011,many lowland regions are afflicted with high phosphorus p peaks in rivers during the summer months static incubations of sediments have shown that reductive dissolution of ferric iron fe iii minerals in the sediment explain these p peaks this study was set up to identify if that mechanism also dominates in a dynamic system thereby testing the roles of water flow velocity and sediment fe p ratio decreasing flow velocity was suspected to lower the flux of dissolved oxygen do towards the sediment the role of the fe iii p ratio was tested by amending iron rich glauconite sand gs to the sediment in this manner testing possible remediation techniques eight flumes 1 80 m long were constructed with duplicates of four treatments of two laminar flow velocities over the sediment 0 05 m s 1 or 0 15 m s 1 that was either or not amended with gs 10 w w in all flumes a daily dose of sodium glutamate was added as a carbon source to mimic wastewater with high bod the flumes were operated for 28 days a decreased velocity lowered the steady state do concentration and enhanced the sediment water release of p by a factor 3 sediment amendment with gs reduced solution p by factors 3 low flow velocity and 2 high flow velocity this effect is related to a combination of increasing binding sites for p and of lowering the do consumption these experimental data suggest that previously unexplained summer peaks of p in lowland rivers are related to low flow events that limit the do flux the internal loading of p requires management of do in water and can be mitigated by enhancing sediment fe keywords phosphate release sediment water interactions flow velocity iron rich sand introduction european lowland rivers belgium the netherlands germany denmark etc are characterised by high phosphorus p concentration peaks during summer periods the annual average concentration in these regions is about 0 4 mg p l 1 which exceeds environmental limits by a factor 4 amery and vandecasteele 2015 umwelt bundesamt 2020 despite decreasing p emissions from agriculture the effect on the p concentration in surface waters is limited in flanders for example a decrease in total p freshwater emission of about 40 between 2007 and 2017 had no significant effect on the average dissolved p concentrations in the freshwater system van peteghem 2018 vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2016 likely due to the legacy p present in the sediments since p is often a limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems correll 1999 controlling the p concentration is a vital step for preventing eutrophication various methods have been applied to mitigate eutrophication cooke et al 1995 schoumans et al 2014 zamparas and zacharias 2014 including ex situ techniques such as sediment removal yu et al 2017 and in situ techniques like aeration chemical p inactivation such as aluminium or iron salts addition ghosh et al 2011 van dael et al 2020a recently geo engineering using solid p sorbents has been put forward as alternative to the rather drastic method of sediment removal it is generally less invasive practical to implement has a lower cost and importantly can act an immediate remediation strategy spears et al 2013 the statistical analysis of monitoring data has indicated that reductive dissolution of iron iii fe iii oxy hydroxides probably explains the summer p peaks in lowland rivers of flanders smolders et al 2017 under reducing conditions the dissolved oxygen do concentration is insufficient to supply electron e acceptors for organic matter om oxidation alternative e acceptors such as nitrate manganese mn iv and fe iii will be used in this case when fe iii oxy hydroxides reduce they start dissolving due to the much larger solubility of fe ii compared to fe iii macrae et al 2011 van der grift et al 2014 the p that was bound to the oxy hydroxides is released leading to increased p concentrations in surface waters this mechanism has long since been known in lakes where reductive conditions at the sediment water interface swi are more common than in lotic systems jensen et al 1992 mortimer 1941 sundby et al 1986 van dael et al 2020b the study of smolders et al 2017 was the first to recognise the possible importance of reductive dissolution as an important p release mechanism in streams however it was focussed on statistical data analysis and a static incubation so far there is no experimental evidence of this mechanism in dynamic systems the two main factors determining the extent of p release as a result of reductive dissolution are 1 the do concentration at the swi and 2 the molar ratio of oxalate extractable p and fe in the sediment the importance of a reduced do concentration is likely the main reason that this mechanism has not been considered in streams before but it does explain why the p peaks in streams only occur during summer months the dips in do concentration relate to the combination of a higher do demand and lower flow velocity on the one hand higher temperatures during summer lead to increased respiration rates and an increased do demand the om inputs during summer are larger due to an increase in primary production and an increased microbial activity typically the q10 values for om degradation by microorganisms range between 1 5 and 2 meyer et al 2018 on the other hand the lower flow velocities during summer lead to more laminar flow and slower do transport towards the swi higashino et al 2008 this also explains why summer p peaks are more pronounced in first and second order streams based on strahler classification than in higher order streams the flow velocity of smaller streams is influenced much more by seasonality than is the case for large rivers huggins and anderson 2005 the p fe ratio in the sediment indicates how much p will be released per unit of fe that is reduced this suggests that a lower p fe ratio will yield lower p release for the same amount of fe that is reduced field data showed a strong correlation between the occurrence of summer p peaks and the sediment p fe ratio only at high p fe ratios 0 12 mol mol 1 the fe iii reduction is large enough compared to the p concentration to release significant amounts of p that will impact the environment smolders et al 2017 in contrast at low p fe ratios the fe iii concentration in the sediment is in excess and will buffer the p concentration even if there is reduction of part of the fe iii minerals testing these factors under field conditions is often impractical for example due to inaccessibility of the stream or due to its size which would require a large experimental set up stream solute workshop 1990 furthermore there are many confounding factors when comparing multiple streams in a field trial or even within one stream summer and winter not only differ in temperature and associated do solubility but also differ in water flow velocities i e the effects of do and flow velocity cannot be disentangled flumes could be used to experimentally vary single factors in model streams and act as an intermediate step towards field studies examples of such studies are those made to measure the diffusion of do under different flow conditions higashino et al 2008 determining the fate of pharmaceuticals in streams li et al 2015 or investigating variations in macro benthos populations depending on flow velocities pereda briones et al 2018 this study was set up to identify if reductive dissolution of fe iii explains p release in a dynamic system thereby testing the role of water flow velocity which is suspected to control the flux of do towards the sediment the role of the fe iii p ratio was tested by amending iron rich glauconite sand gs to the sediment thereby testing the efficiency and stability under reducing conditions for future use as a cheap and easily available remediation material materials and methods sediment and gs characterisation the sediment was sampled from the devebeek in pittem flanders 50 58 50 5 n 3 16 29 3 e in total 180 l of sediment was collected from the top 5 cm layer with shovels and the sediment was stored wet with overlying water at 4 c until the beginning of the experiment before use the sediment was manually filtered by removing stones plastic and other waste branches leaves twigs and other material with dimensions exceeding 1 cm characterisation of the sediment was done in previous research by van dael et al 2020 oxalate extractable elements om mineral n and the cation exchange capacity cec were all measured in that study this sediment was chosen based on its large molar p fe ratio and the high p concentrations in the stream in the static incubation experiment this sediment exhibited significant respiration rates indicating that anoxia was likely a natural iron rich glauconite sand used in this study was collected from a sunken lane in lubbeek in belgium 50 53 06 4 n 4 46 08 9 e it contains 167 g kg 1 fe 16 g kg 1 al 1 1 g kg 1 p the gs sample was ground and sieved over 2 mm before use the oxalate extractable fe and al contents were also measured to estimate the p sorption capacity of gs and the sedimentary p fe molar ratio after amendment flume construction eight flumes were constructed based on the design of li et al 2016 the flumes consist of 3 major parts the propulsion system sediment compartment and the container fig 1 the propulsion system drives a propeller that thrusts the water around and over the sediment in order to achieve a constant and adjustable laminar flow over the sediment the sediment compartment holds the sediment and guides the water through the system as efficient as possible via the triangular flow guide the container holds all these parts and acts as the water reservoir the propulsion system consists of an electric motor shaft suspension system and propeller the motor pichler boost 40 is powered by an externally modified pc feed and controlled through a timer card pci 6601 counter timer device national instruments this timer card is programmed in labview software in order to send the appropriate signal to the electronic speed controller esc connected to the motor the rotation speed of the motor and thus the water velocity can be easily changed in this setup a mechanical flow meter is used to measure the water velocity in the sediment compartment the driving shaft is 0 75 m long in order to allow the motor to be above the water level the long shaft is necessary to retain a low shaft angle about 20 in order to keep the thrust efficiency as high as possible montoya 2005 at the end of the shaft a 3 blade propeller is installed all components are made of inert stainless steel and pvc so no interaction with the experiment is possible the motor and shaft are attached to the wall of the box the sediment compartment is made of 10 mm thick pvc and consists of the sediment trench and the triangular flow guide which minimises the backflow of water the total length and width of sediment bed is 180 15 cm the outer container is made from 18 mm coated plywood and constructed with slats wood glue and screws it is 244 cm long 61 cm wide and 35 cm high in order to fit all the other parts inside the box is lined with 1 2 mm thick epdm foil to waterproof it a schematic drawing of the design is shown in fig 1 experimental set up the flumes were tested with four treatments to test 1 effects of flow velocity on the do concentration and subsequent p release and 2 the use of iron rich glauconite sand to remediate p release the eight flumes were filled to obtain a water table height of 10 cm above the swi v 230 l four treatments were applied in duplicate in a full factorial design two flow velocities were applied 0 05 and 0 15 m s 1 and 1 5 kg of gs was added to half of the flumes 10 based on dry weight of the 5 cm sediment and was gently mixed within the top layer of the sediment 0 1 cm a daily dose of om 32 2 mg sodium glutamate l 1 day 1 was added to each flume to simulate a high biological oxygen demand bod water with a high microbial activity the total duration of the experiment was 28 days the water velocities applied cover the low end of the environmental range in flanders over 10 of monitored streams have a flow velocity 0 05 m s 1 vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2019 the daily dose of glutamate is equivalent to a daily starting bod of 24 7 mg o2 l 1 i e representing water near wastewater discharges see discussion daily water samples were taken in duplicate 1 cm above the sediment and immediately filtered 0 45 µm and acidified 1 ultrapure hno3 simultaneously a water sample was taken through a dialysis membrane spectra por dialysis membrane 12 14 kda that had been suspended as 10 ml dialysis bags filled with tap water identical to the flumes at the sampling location for at least 24 hours the dialysis samples were also acidified the water samples were analysed for soluble reactive p srp using the malachite green method ohno and zibilske 1991 all other solutes of interest such as fe and mn were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms agilent 7700x agilent technologies several water parameters t do ph and electrical conductivity ec were also measured daily using a multiparameter probe eijkelkamp multiparameter ap 700 to better understand the p fluxes across the swi probes of diffusive gradient in thin films dgt were vertically deployed at 15 days after the start of the experiment the dgt probes are commonly used to indicate the concentration gradients at the swi ding et al 2015 one deoxygenated dgt probe was deployed in each flume for a 24 h period across the swi a dgt consists of a zero sink binding layer covered with a diffusive gel polyacrylamide through which solutes migrate before binding on the binding layer based on the final mass bound on the binding layer and the contact time of the dgt with the sediment or water the concentration of the solute can be calculated these probes allowed to make depth profiles of mobile p the dgt probes with active zone of 15 cm were prepared according to guan et al 2015 with a zr oxide binding layer rather than the traditional fe oxides this was done in order to prevent reduction of the binding layer in anoxic conditions after 24 h deployment with about 10 cm above and 5 cm below the swi the probes were dismantled and the binding gels were cut into slices of 3 mm wide each slice was individually eluted in 1 ml 0 5 m naoh the elution liquid was diluted and measured using the malachite green method this way a concentration depth profile for p could be constructed with a resolution of 3 mm most sediment characteristics were determined in a prior experiment cf supra however the oxalate extractable elements p fe al and mn were determined right before starting this experiment and again afterwards schwertmann 1964 the final samples were both top layer samples ca 1 cm deep and bulk samples data

sediment water p fluxes were calculated by two methods the first method is based on the changes in the srp concentrations in the overlying water over time the second method is based on the dgt p

the highest see results the srp time plots per replicate were analysed with linear regression analyses the slope is identical to δ c δ t t 3 24 that was calculated for each replicate flume for the

linear regression on data between 0 0 5 cm below the swi see results statistical analyses were performed using the jmp pro version 14 0 0 the treatment effects on p and fe in solution and on the dgt labile p in the sediment pore water were analysed with general linear regression models with time and depth added as a random factor the treatment effects on the p fe molar ratio in the sediment after the experiment and on the sediment p fluxes were analysed with two way anova followed by tukey hsd post hoc test results sediment and water properties table 1 shows the reactive p and fe content measured by oxalate extraction the p fe molar ratio of the top 10 mm sediment theoretically reduces by the gs addition from 0 37 to 0 32 both ratios are 0 12 which is the threshold above which p is released under anoxic conditions see above suggesting little theoretical gs effects on p release table 2 shows the mean values of physical chemical parameters in the overlying water during the experiment the temperature was constant 20 and identical in all treatments little differences in ph values were observed among treatments being close to 9 during the entire experiment this demonstrates that gs amendment had no obvious impact on ph of the overlying water during the experiment the same amount of sodium glutamate solution was continuously added to each flume to simulate a high bod emission hence ec significantly increased over time p 0 005 but did not differ among treatments p 0 05 the do concentration under high flow velocity 6 mg o2 l 1 was significantly higher than that under low flow velocity 2 4 mg o2 l 1 the gs application to the sediment yielded a significantly higher do concentration compared to the control under low but not under higher flow velocities the reynolds numbers for the slow and fast treatment are 850 and 2550 respectively table 2 this indicates a better oxygen transport from the water surface towards the sediment in the fast flowing treatment srp and fe dynamics in the overlying water in fig 2 a the srp is shown as a function of time there was no significant difference in srp concentrations between filtrates 0 45 µm and dialysis samples filtrate p mg p l 1 1 039 dialysis p mg p l 1 0 007 fig s1 therefore only the filtrate data are used during further data analysis flow velocity and gs addition had both significant effects on p dynamics in the overlying water p 0 001 for both the highest srp concentration was observed in the control treatment under low flow velocity increasing strongly to 1 25 mg p l 1 over 25 days well above srp limits prevailing in the region from which the sediment was sampled 0 07 0 14 mg p l 1 increasing the flow velocity significantly reduced the srp concentration in solution by more than factor 3 in the control no gs treatment p 0 001 the gs addition also significantly reduced the srp concentration in the overlying water by more than factor 2 high flow or 3 low flow moreover a significant difference in srp was found between gs low flow and gs high flow p 0 01 which means the gs immobilisation ability was decreased by increasing flow velocity similar trend and treatment effects can be also found in total dissolved p concentrations tdp data not shown the fe release to the overlying water also increased initially followed by a decrease but with much lower concentrations than srp in the solution fig 2 b low flow velocity enhanced fe release but only in the control not in the gs treatment the gs addition did not increase the dissolved fe concentrations the occurrence of the p and fe peaks do not coincide in time the fe peak occurs after about 15 days while the p peak arrives after about 25 days dgt labile p in the sediment pore water the effect of flow velocity and gs addition on the vertical distribution of dgt labile p concentration at the swi is shown in fig 3 the graphs are ordered by decreasing p concentrations similar treatment effects were found in dgt labile p in the pore water as in the srp in the overlying water i e increased flow velocity and gs addition significantly reduced dgt labile p in the sediment pore water p 0 001 for both for the two flumes in the control low flow a sharp concentration gradient of dgt labile p was observed just below the swi followed by a maximum at depths greater than 28 mm 3 56 0 90 mg p l 1 increasing the flow velocity reduced the gradient near the swi and it lowered dgt labile p concentrations in the deeper sediment layers the gs additions either under low flow or high flow reduced the dgt labile p in the sediment with mean values of 1 29 0 48 mg l 1 under low flow and 0 68 0 33 mg l 1 under high flow respectively remarkably under high flow velocity the dgt labile p profile was characterised by the absence of a steep gradient at the swi remaining low and stable up to depths of 35 mm below the sediment this indicates that the resupply of labile p from the sediment to the pore water was inhibited by gs addition not only at the upper layer where the gs was added top 10 mm but also in deeper sediment layers sediment p flux the p fluxes were calculated both by using the surface water p concentrations and by using the dgt concentration gradients and fick s law of diffusion table 3 both calculation methods suggest similar treatment effects on the fluxes but the fluxes calculated with the dgt profile were a factor 2 4 smaller on average the two way anova analysis shows that both the flow velocity and gs addition have a significant effect on the p flux there is also a significant interaction effect between both variables showing that gs addition is more efficient at lower flow velocities sediment properties affected by treatment and time after the experiment surface and bulk sediment samples below the 1 cm surface that was amended were sampled and analysed fig 4 table s1 the p o x f e o x a l o x and calculated degree of p saturation dps are shown in table s1 the p fe molar ratio before and after treatment is shown in fig 4 after gs addition the concentrations of f e o x in the surface layer where the gs was added were larger than those where no gs was added the dps values in gs amended sediments were smaller than those without gs addition no differences in the p o x and a l o x were observed between treatments either in the surface samples or in the bulk samples the molar p fe ratio was generally lowered in the amended sediment compared to the control p 0 001 while the p fe ratio in the top layer was lower compared to that in the bulk sediment in the control treatments p 0 001 discussion effect of glutamate addition the goal of this research was to replicate p release in a dynamic system in a worst case scenario of high bod water initial attempts with the flumes used n2 purging of the water to lower the do however that method never lowered the do effectively on the long term and the technique of adding a high bod proved to be more efficient internal loading by reductive dissolution of fe iii minerals is strongest during summer when there is a large amount of microbial activity i e when the oxygen demand is large van dael et al 2020b to mimic this situation biodegradable dissolved om bdom in the form of na glutamate was added daily 10 4 mg c l 1 d 1 which corresponds with a biological oxygen demand bod of 24 7 mg o2 l 1 this concentration is environmentally relevant bod averages about 8 mg o2 l 1 in moderately polluted rivers wilhelm 2009 this shows that the conditions in this study correspond with a rather extreme oxygen depletion rate that will most likely only occur in streams with wastewater inflow and during warm low flow periods the addition of glutamate can be interpreted as om input from a large primary production during summer which stimulates the microbial biomass in the sediment the sodium na that is added together with the glutamate could also have affected the results assuming na is inert in a sediment water system total na concentration after 28 days should have linearly increased with 130 mg na l 1 i e with 5 7 mm the measured na concentration in solution increased from 3 5 mm after one day due to equilibration to 8 6 mm finally the initial strong na increase is most likely the result of equilibration between the pore water and the overlying water due to the daily na inputs the ec in the flumes rose linearly over time reaching values of 2500 µs cm 1 at the end of the experiment the average ec in flemish waters 2003 2017 is 1100 µs cm 1 with 2500 µs cm 1 the 95 percentile the average ec for the stream where the sediment was sampled is 1500 µs cm 1 this suggests that the final na concentrations and ec values are relatively high but not impossible compared to the field effects of flow velocity anoxic conditions in the sediment will lead to reduction of oxidised species such as no3 mn iv and fe iii the extent of reduction depends on the oxygen transport to the swi this oxygen transport is dependent on the flow velocity of the overlying water larger flow velocities and an increased oxygen transfer into the sediment should prevent fe reduction at the sediment surface and limit subsequent p release these hypotheses were clearly corroborated by the results the do concentration measured in the water phase was significantly larger in the fast flowing treatments with averages of 6 5 and 2 7 mg o2 l 1 for the fast and low flow treatments respectively table 2 these differences in do concentration are most likely due to the differences in turbulence between the two velocities re 850 and 2550 for the slow and high flow respectively generally flows where re 2000 are considered laminar meaning that there is less vertical solute transport in this case rhodes 2017 the suboxic concentrations in the water phase of the low flow treatment already indicate that the fe reduction front could reach the sediment surface and release phosphate even in dynamic systems the reason for this is the more laminar flow regime at lower flow velocities whereas in more turbulent systems the oxygen is transported rapidly due to more intensive water mixing a second effect is that the shear layer between the water and sediment the so called diffusive boundary layer will become thinner as the flow velocity increases higashino and stefan 2005 this layer is considered to have a completely laminar flow regime so solute transport happens exclusively via diffusion earlier research has shown that an increased flow velocity leads to a decrease in diffusive boundary layer thickness and hence an increased oxygen flux jørgensen and des marais 1990 jørgensen and revsbech 1985 the tested flow velocities in these studies were similar as in the current study and ranged 0 02 0 20 m s 1 leading to diffusive boundary layer thicknesses ranging 0 16 1 1 mm depending on the velocity and the roughness of the sediment surface rougher sediments leading to thicker boundary layers the difference in do concentration between the two flow velocities indeed led to differences in the dissolved p concentration in the water phase the srp concentrations were a factor 3 higher in the low flow velocity treatment compared to the high flow velocity fig 2 a table 3 the same is true for the dgt labile p concentrations in the sediments these should be close to pore water p concentration profiles in the sediment close to the surface the p concentration increases with depth but in the deeper sediment layers the p concentration reaches a more or less constant value fig 3 this value is about a factor 2 larger for the low flow velocities than for the high flow velocities fig 3 table 3 even though this confirms our hypotheses many other researchers found the opposite effect i e an increased p release with increasing flow velocities jarvie et al 2012 tong et al 2017 both these studies focussed on total p tp which increased with increasing flow velocities which was attributed to increased suspended particles containing p however tong et al 2017 also noted an effect of the velocity on the srp concentration at flow velocities 0 2 m s 1 they observed decreasing srp concentrations with increasing flow velocities larger velocities 0 2 m s 1 on the other hand led to an increase in soluble p concentrations this was also attributed to the increased suspended matter with increased flow velocities which would accelerate p exchange between sediment particles and the water phase the current study was focused on reductive dissolution of fe and release of bound p this means only filtered samples 0 45 µm were analysed in order to exclude particle bound p secondly the flow velocities used here are both 0 2 m s 1 simulating a summer period at these low velocities the effects are similar as observed by tong et al 2017 i e larger p release at the lowest flow velocities due to anoxic conditions at the swi leading to reductive dissolution the fact that both flow velocities were rather low in this study is probably the reason why the tdp was not greatly flow velocity dependent which was good since the goal of the study was to determine the effect of flow velocity on srp without interference of increased suspended particles our flow velocity dependent p release is also clearly affected by the use of high bod water the large bod ensures a large respiration rate enhancing reductive dissolution of fe and p the flow velocities selected in this study are both relatively low since the most critical period for high p concentrations in lowland systems are during low flow summer periods and those peaks mainly occur in small streams during these periods the flow velocities can indeed be as low as 0 1 m s 1 in field conditions van dael et al 2020a unpublished data vlaamse milieumaatschappij 2019 causing oxygen limitation similar to what was observed in this research for fe the same trend was expected as for p however while p concentrations reached values up to 1 2 mg p l 1 fe concentrations in the water phase remained low 0 2 mg fe l 1 furthermore there were no large differences in dissolved fe between the different treatments these results contrasts those of anaerobic batch incubations including the same sediment as used here where fe concentrations in the overlying water reached over 50 mg fe l 1 van dael et al 2020b most likely the conditions are less reducing compared to the static situation due to faster do exchange in the dynamic systems and rapid oxidation in the alkaline water ph 9 where the oxidation half life of fe ii to fe iii is 0 15 seconds in presence of 2 7 mg do l 1 average concentration in the slow flowing treatments baken et al 2015 this theory is confirmed by the p fe ratio of the control treatment which decreased during the experiment and was lower in the top layer than in the bulk sediment fig 4 table s1 this means that relatively more p than fe has been removed from the sediment and that diffusion of fe ii from the deep sediment layers towards the surface leads to fe accumulation it is clear that rapid re oxidation and precipitation of fe occurs while p remains in the water phase similar observations have been made in the field during summer high t and high ph fe from groundwater is immediately oxidised after surfacing van der grift et al 2014 this phenomenon could also explain why there is a time lag between the drop in p and fe concentrations fig 2a and b after fe re oxidation p could eventually be adsorbed again on the formed fe iii oxy hydroxides but this process is slower than fe oxidation itself effect of gs addition in this study the application of iron rich gs as amendment strongly reduced p concentrations in the overlying water and in the pore water which confirms that gs addition is useful to reduce p release from sediments even under anoxic conditions low flow velocity and high bod in the surface water the initial p fe ratio after gs amendment was 0 32 mol mol 1 and was not changed significantly after the experiment given the minor difference in this ratio between the control and gs treatment the effect of gs addition was expected to be limited in contrast the data clearly show a large effect of gs addition on the p concentration in the overlying water phosphate dynamics from the sediment to overlying water are dominated by two basic processes pore water diffusion induced by concentration gradients and resupply from the solid phase by dissolution yao et al 2016 the dgt p concentration in sediment represents both the dissolved p fraction in the pore water and the resupply from the solid phase hence it indicates the p release potential i e labile p ding et al 2015 zhang et al 1998a in the unamended sediment the labile p depth profiles had large concentration gradients at the swi fig 3 table 3 leading to a strong upwards diffusion of phosphate to the overlying water the gs addition drastically reduced these concentration gradients which is consistent with the reduction of srp in the overlying water factor 3 6 this indicates that immobilisation of p in the pore water by sufficient fe iii supply created a barrier at several millimetres below the swi thus inhibiting the upward migration of phosphate from sediment to the overlying water the dissimilarities in water composition between the control and gs treatment suggest that gs prevents p release using two different mechanisms on the one hand the increased amount of fe in gs increases the p binding capacity of the sediment the lower p fe molar ratio in the gs amended sediment demonstrates that a larger fe iii supply is able to bind p even though part of these fe iii compounds are still mobilised by fe reduction under low flow velocity fig 4 jensen et al 1992 smolders et al 2017 moreover the gs had a larger effect on p immobilisation than initially expected due to the higher affinity for p of the fe in the gs than the authigenic fe and was a more efficient sorbent than the authigenic fe oxy hydroxides on the other hand the addition of extra fe iii minerals can lead to fe iii being used as an e acceptor before the oxygen supply is exhausted this is reflected by the significantly higher do concentration in the gs amended treatment at low flow velocities table 2 the gs application is more efficient under low flow velocity which is reflected by the significant interaction term in the two way anova analysis table 3 the reason is that there is more anoxia and reductive dissolution in the low flow velocity treatment so in that case the addition of extra p sorption capacity is more important although even at a larger flow velocity the gs addition still lowered p release by a factor 2 in previous studies other materials at the same or even lower fe doses have shown better p immobilisation than gs examples are synthesised iron minerals such as magnetic microparticles funes et al 2017 and amorphous ferric hydroxide fuchs et al 2018 zou et al 2017 iron modified zeolite liu et al 2017 zhan et al 2019 drinking water residues wang et al 2013 and steel slag klimeski et al 2014 this can be explained because a large fraction of the fe 96 in gs is not available for p immobilisation not oxalate extractable however many of these materials are artificially synthesised or modified in the lab so large scale application would be limited considering the cost therefore naturally occurring iron rich gs is a potential low cost amendment to control internal loading and mitigate eutrophication for wide application in terms of p immobilisation efficiency redox resistance abundance and accessibility apart from that gs has been proven to be physically stable when used to reduce p losses from drained agricultural fields vandermoere et al 2018 gs compacts the surface sediment when added to the surface sediment layer probably as result of its high density gu et al 2019 this was observed at the end of the incubation experiment the gs addition increased sediment stability and consolidation which can possibly prevent sediment from resuspension and disturbance and is usually essential for the cultivation of aquatic macrophytes egemose et al 2010 fan et al 2017 in addition gs addition did not significantly enhance toxic trace metal concentrations in water cd cu zn cr and ni of course further research on potential side effects on organisms should be also investigated before real field experiments are undertaken p fluxes the sediment water p fluxes either calculated from solution srp or from the dgt data table 3 confirm the significant role of flow velocity and adding gs on the internal loading of p the fluxes found here coincide well with the p release fluxes found in several lakes urban et al 1997 and penn et al 2011 found p fluxes between 3 31 mg p m 2 d 1 which are of similar magnitude as the fluxes in the control flumes 13 60 mg p m 2 d 1 depending on flow velocity and on the method to determine the flux extrapolations to the field should be made with care since this is a simplified and controlled system that does not account for complex field conditions nevertheless we feel like a flume experiment is a necessary intermediate step between a static incubation and a field validation the difference between both flux calculation methods is significant the dgt data day 15 yield consistently smaller fluxes than the fluxes based on the rise in srp between days 3 24 this is probably related to a combination of factors first the dgt labile p concentrations are a lower estimate of the pore water p concentration because the flux from the solution to the dgt is faster than the resupply from the solid phase to the solution annan 2002 zhang et al 1998b the ratio between dgt labile p and the initial pore water p concentration is termed the r factor and has been modelled for soils the r factor is 0 1 0 8 and is large when the resupply is large the k d solid liquid distribution coefficient and is faster than the uptake by the dgt degryse et al 2009 the pore water based diffusive flux according to eq 5 is logically larger than the dgt based one as the pore water concentrations are larger the factor 2 4 difference between the dgt labile fluxes and srp fluxes is well in line with a r factor of 1 2 4 or 0 4 well in the middle of modelled values for soils second and probably smaller reason to explain the differences in fluxes is the time difference it is possible that initial fluxes of p are larger than final ones and that the fluxes around day 15 are already smaller than time averaged ones between days 3 24 conclusion this study yielded the first experimental evidence that increased flow velocities lead to better oxygen exchange between water and sediment which in turn limits the release of p from the sediment however this conclusion is only valid under certain conditions namely in periods of large oxygen depletion and flow velocities 0 2 m s 1 e g during dry warm summer periods in lowland systems the reductive dissolution of fe is likely an important pathway for p release under such conditions only limiting the use of surface water in agriculture during low flow periods might prevent the flow velocity from dropping too far and would be a good policy for preventing anoxia at the sediment water interface however these results should be corroborated by field observations and in situ measurements secondly this study showed that the use of glauconite sand 10 w w as a remediation strategy for p release vastly reduces the p concentration in the overlying water this material might be less effective in p immobilisation than some synthesised materials but it is significantly cheaper abundantly available and is proven to be stable under anoxic conditions this is why glauconite sand might be a viable option for future large scale use in the field mmc1 zip mmc2 docx declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17012,a new conceptual model to describe and understand the role of assimilable organic carbon aoc within drinking water distribution systems is proposed the impact of aoc on both drinking water biofilm and water quality was studied using bespoke pipe loop experimental facilities installed at three carefully selected operational water treatment works integrated physical chemical and biological monitoring was undertaken that highlights the central role of biofilms in aoc cycling forming the basis of the new conceptual model biofilms formed under high aoc conditions were found to pose the highest discoloration response generating a turbidity 4 3 ntu and iron 241 5 µg l response sufficient to have caused regulatory failures from only 20 m of pipe in only 12 months of operation this new knowledge of the role of biofilms in aoc cycling and ultimately impacts on water quality can be used to inform management and help ensure the supply of high quality biostable drinking water keywords drinking water distribution systems assimilable organic carbon microbiology biofilms discoloration 1 introduction the supply of microbially safe high quality drinking water is one of the most fundamental requirements and functions of every water utility in order to achieve this it is often said that the water in drinking water distribution systems dwds should be biologically stable although the exact definition is often unclear biological stability is generally regarded as qualities that minimise the deterioration of water quality between the treatment works and the customers tap assimilable organic carbon aoc a measure of the labile fraction of dissolved organic carbon is often suggested as part of biostability assessment but values are disputed and the roles and cycling of aoc within dwds are little understood 2 background the term regrowth has been used to describe the recovery of disinfectant injured cells whereas aftergrowth has been used to describe microbial growth in a distribution system characklis 1988 van der kooij 2003 in this study re growth includes both the recovery of disinfection damaged cells which have passed through the treatment works and the multiplication of organisms within the dwds itself aoc is easily utilised by heterotrophic bacteria for growth and is a significant contributor to biological instability within dwds nescerecka et al 2014 globally aoc is not routinely monitored within operational networks low concentrations of aoc have been demonstrated to limit microbial growth and therefore constitute biostable water at concentrations spanning 10 100 µg c l in dwds field studies van der kooij 1992 lechevallier et al 1996 and 10 110 µg c l within laboratory studies ohkouchi et al 2013 wang et al 2014 lechevallier et al 2015 however there is no global consensus as to the aoc concentration that constitutes biostable water the aoc concentrations representing biostabiltiy within drinking water 10 100 µg c l are thought to differ due to the presence absence of a disinfection residual the specific disinfection agent used and other a biotic parameters in the dwds such as hydraulic retention time pipe material dwds infrastructure presence of service reservoirs and temperature it is therefore critical to consider interactions between aoc and a disinfectant residual when assessing drinking water biostability although aoc has been demonstrated to contribute towards microbial re growth within dwds the majority of these studies have analysed the effects of aoc on heterotrophic bacteria escobar et al 2001 van der kooij 1992 and or coliforms within the bulk water and not microorganisms within biofilms biofilms within dwds can generate a decline in water quality disinfection residual and pipe infrastructure condition and generate a discolouration response when they mobilise and release materials such as inorganics into the bulk water the biofilm formation rate in drinking water has been shown to be sensitive to changes in aoc concentration within laboratory based studies that typically use biofilm annual reactors van der kooij et al 1995 sharp et al 2001 okabe et al 2002 whilst lab based experimental set ups go some way to understand the impact of aoc on biofilms within drinking water bench scale reactors do not accurately reflect the surface to volume ratio boundary later effect shear stress and other environmental conditions impacting microorganisms within full scale systems this study will therefore analyse the relationship between aoc and biofilm formation within fully operational drinking water supply systems the mobilisation of microorganisms and associated particles from biofilms can cause discolouration events husband and boxall 2010 and or microbial regulatory failures depending on the amount and composition of the detached material in this study discolouration is assessed using turbidity which is a measurement of water clarity obtained by determining the degree of light scattering due to suspended material biofilm mobilisation is either generated through daily background release or larger mobilisation events occurring after a change in environmental conditions such as an increase in the hydraulic shear stress it is not known how the aoc concentration within post treated water impacts the discoloration response posed by biofilms if they should become mobilised the behaviour of particulates within the dwds has been highlighted as being analogous to biofilm behaviour with the strength of the layers being dictated by the shear stress imposed on the pipe wall data generated in sharpe et al 2017 confirmed a positive linear relationship between shear stress and turbidity the same trend is anticipated here 3 material and methods this research aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between aoc concentration biofilms and drinking water stability by considering the planktonic and attached microbiology and integrating this with physical and chemical analysis by studying the effect of different aoc concentrations in the bulk water on biofilm growth and the subsequent response of biofilms to elevated shear stress flushing we seek to determine the role of biofilms in aoc cycling and the resulting impacts on bulk water quality 3 1 dwds pipe loop experimental facilities to explore the impact of aoc on dwds biofilms and the interaction with bulk water quality whilst maintaining representative in pipe conditions i e surface to volume ratios boundary layer exchange and shear stress mechanisms biofilms were developed in three purpose built full scale pipe loop experimental facilities a b and c for one year the pipe loop experimental facilities fig 1 were installed in the field at the exit of three water treatment works wtw each being fed with post treated water supplied directly from the works and containing distinct aoc concentrations the three sites were classified as either high aoc 300 µg c l medium aoc 245 µg c l or low aoc 73 µg c l table 1 each system replicated the hydraulic retention time water chemistry and microbiology of operational dwds whilst enabling laboratory level control of bulk water and biofilm sampling following the 12 month biofilm growth period the pipe loops were flushed to provide insight into the effect of aoc concentration on biofilm mobilisation into the bulk water and its impact on various water quality parameters each pipe loop had a different source water pipe loops a b surface water pipe loop c groundwater and disinfection residual type pipe loop a chlorine pipe loops b c chloramine table 1 raw water quality data is provided in supplementary table 1 while this difference in disinfection residual moves away from pure experimental design with a single parameter changed this is an unrealistic ambition using operational water treatment works furthermore although there were observed differences between sites there were also similarities between pipe loops to enable a two way comparison of environmental and operational factors the three experimental pipe loop facilities were purpose built for this study based on the successful design used by fish et al 2017 and douterelo et al 2018 the dwds experimental loops installed at each of the three sites met the same exact design specifications fig 1 each pipe loop consisted of a 10 m long length of high density polyethylene hdpe pe100 pipe with a 79 3 mm internal diameter hdpe was selected as it is frequently used in modern dwds fish et al 2020 husband et al 2008 drinking water was re circulated around the systems from an enclosed 30 l 0 03 m3 tank via a variable speed pump an independent system residence time of 24 h was set using a trickle feed and drain to provide representative water quality of each dwds and preserve a baseline nutrient supply and disinfection residual amongst other water quality parameters during the 12 month growth phase the pipe loop was run at conditioning flow rate of 0 4 l s calculated shear stress 0 03 nm 2 assuming pipe roughness coefficient of 0 075 mm this flow rate was selected as this was the average flow rate in 75 100 mm diameter pipes within uk dwds husband et al 2008 and has been used previously in full scale laboratory tests to develop drinking water biofilms douterelo et al 2014 fish et al 2017 the system flow rate was monitored using a siemens sitrans f m mag 6000 flow meter with flow being controlled by adjusting the control valve at the end of each loop and or the pump speed the partially closed final control valve ensured a system pressure of 1 8 bar 18 m was achieved in the pipe loops this and a continual upward gradient ensured pipe full conditions were maintained four straight sections 1 m long were included in each loop containing 12 apertures positioned 75 mm apart into which removable pennine water group pwg coupons deines et al 2010 were inserted fig 1 to provide a removable surface for biofilm sampling the coupons consisted of an outer curved coupon and a removable flat insert which enabled dual analysis of the same sample fig 1 component c the curvature of the coupon corresponds to that of the pipe to reduce distortion of boundary layer conditions such as turbulence and shear stress regime the insert piece had a flat surface designed for microscopy analyses deines et al 2010 3 2 growth phase during the growth phase biofilms were developed naturally no inoculum within each pipe loop facility for one year each loop was supplied with treated water at sites a b and c respectively and thus biofilm was grown under high medium of low aoc conditions to monitor flow remotely when not on site three wi fi enabled monitors were designed at the university of sheffield and installed at each of the three pipe loop sites the monitors used arduino technology to monitor and transmit flow data 3 2 1 disinfection of pipe loop facilities prior to beginning the year long growth phase each of the three pipe loops was disinfected for 24 h with a 20 mg l concentration of a sodium hypochlorite solution vwr international ltd uk 11 14 free chlorine which was re circulated within the system at a maximum flow rate of 5 0 l s each pipe loop was then flushed repeatedly at the maximum flow rate with post treated water from each wtw until the chlorine concentration decreased to that of the inlet water before use the pwg coupons were sterilised via sonication with a 2 w v sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution fish 2013 3 2 2 water quality sampling the quality of water circulating in each loop over the 12 months was monitored by collection of discrete bulk water samples every two weeks n 3 using sterile 500 ml sample bottles aurora scientific bristol u k once the distribution line was flushed and the flow reduced six volumes of 500 ml bulk water were collected from the sample tap marked in fig 1 3 2 3 biofilm sampling coupons for biofilm analysis were collected in triplicate during the growth phase at day 0 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month time periods day 0 samples were defined as coupons which were in the pipe loop for 90 min the outer coupons the non insert component of the coupon were used to determine the number of intact and damaged cells within the biofilm using flow cytometry the coupon inserts were used to visually assess biofilm volume using scanning electron microscopy sem these inserts were fixed in 5 formaldehyde solution and stored at 4 c prior to downstream analysis fisher scientific uk fish 2013 3 3 flushing phase 3 3 1 flushing process biofilm mobilisation and resulting impact on water quality was assessed by imposing a simulated flushing operation sequentially increasing the flow rate 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 l s and hence boundary shear stress in four steps 0 33 0 83 1 55 and 3 02 nm 2 flow rate was measured and recorded every 10 s due to the relatively short pipe length head loss was not sufficient for accurate measurement and hence shear stress was calculated via the darcy wiesbach equation assuming a pipe roughness of 0 075 mm which is representative of the roughness of pe100 hdpe pipe husband et al 2008 the trickle drain and feed were shut during the flushing phase to ensure accuracy in the assessment of any bulk water quality changes due to the mobilisation of material from the pipe wall 3 3 2 water quality discrete samples n 3 were collected after five turnovers at each flow rate when all mobilisation had occurred and the mobilised material was well mixed into the bulk water discrete samples from the flushing phase were analysed for the bulk water quality parameterslisted in table 2 turbidity data was also collected continuously throughout the flushing phase using an ati monitor table 2 connected to a tapping point just upstream of the control valve with a return to the system tank figure 1 the turbidity time series showed that stable turbidity levels were achieved within three turnovers with five turnovers being used to provide additional confidence 3 3 3 biofilm sampling biofilm samples coupons were taken post flush after the final flushing step and collected in triplicate coupons were positioned along either side of the pipe length with the exception of nine top or bottom positioned coupons which were used to determine if the coupon position within the pipe influenced the biofilm top and bottom positioned coupons outer coupons only were analysed to determine the number of intact and damaged cells within the biofilm using flow cytometry 3 4 water quality analysis 3 4 1 water quality sampling bulk water discrete samples from growth and flushing phases were analysed for the water quality parameters displayed in table 2 in addition continuous turbidity measurements were conducted using an online ati analytical technology inc uk turbidity logger 3 4 2 aoc aoc was analysed for all bulk water discrete samples from growth and flushing phases using the method developed and proven in pick et al 2019 the aoc methodology combined the known strain inoculum approach with a larger inoculum volume and flow cytometric enumeration to increase the speed and reproducibility of evaluating aoc concentration in summary 40 ml water samples were collected into glassware which has been rendered organic carbon free using the method described in pick et al 2019 samples were collected using the method outlined in section 3 2 2 and dechlorinated using sodium thiosulphate in the lab samples were pasteurised in a 70 c water bath for 30 min before being inoculated with 10 000 cfu ml of either pseudomonas fluorescens strain p 17 p 17 or spirillum strain nox nox into separate vials and incubated at 15 c samples were enumerated on days 6 7 and 8 using the flow cytometry protocol outlined in section 3 4 3 the averaged cell counts on day 6 7 and 8 were converted to aoc values using pre derived yield value of 4 1 106 cfu p 17 μg acetatec and 1 2 107 cfu nox μg acetate c van der kooij et al 1982 the two known strains cultures of p 17 atcc 49 642 and nox atcc 49 643 were acquired from the american type culture collection atcc the preparation of the stock cultures was performed as described in lechevallier et al 1993 and aggarwal et al 2015 aoc controls were performed including residual chlorine vials to check the chlorine content after dechlorination growth controls to determine if samples were limited by nutrients other than carbon blank controls to check for carbon contamination and yield controls to check the growth yield of the two bacterial strains 3 4 3 flow cytometry planktonic total tcc and intact cell count icc cells ml in the bulk water were measured using the flow cytometry method outlined in fish et al 2020 bulk water samples for flow cytometry analysis were collected using the sampling method outlined in section 3 2 2 into bottles pre treated with sodium thiosulphate 3 w v to dechlorinate the samples before analysis in summary 500 µl water samples were stained with 5 µl sybr green life sciences california usa for tcc 500 µl water samples were stained with 6 µl sybr green propidium iodine mixture life sciences california usa with a final concentration of 1x sybr green and 3 μm pi for icc samples were analysed using bd accuri c6 flow cytometer with autosampler bd accuri uk with a fixed gate plot as described in fish et al 2020 all appropriate negative controls were performed including negative controls for stains and calibration beads were run daily 3 5 biofilm analysis 3 5 1 scanning electron microscopy sem sem was used to provide a qualitative assessment of biofilm accumulation giving an indication of differences in surface coverage and the physical structure of the biofilms one 12 month insert was analysed from each loop with each biofilm sample being imaged at 1000x and 5000x magnification with a total of 50 images being taken per sample all sem sample preparation and imaging was undertaken at the biomedical science electron microscopy unit the university of sheffield and analysed as described in douterelo et al 2016 3 5 2 flow cytometry of biofilm samples biofilm suspensions were prepared for flow cytometry using the protocol published in fish et al 2020 the outer coupon was placed in a petri dish with 30 ml of sterile phosphate buffer and repeatedly brushed using a sterile toothbrush fish 2013 negative controls were run on the flow cytometer using phosphate buffer solution stained for tcc and icc a 0 5 ml volume of the biofilm suspension was stained and analysed in accordance with the bulk water flow cytometry protocol to convert the cell counts into cell concentrations icc mm2 or tcc mm2 the following equation was used i c c o r t c c c o u n t v o l u m e a n a l y s e d x t o t a l v o l u m e o f s a m p l e s a where the count is the total or intact cell count volume analysed is the volume of sample that was processed in the flow cytometer 50 µl the total volume of samples in this case was 30 ml 30 000 µl and sa is the surface area from which the biofilm was removed all the raw biofilm data were converted into icc mm2 or tcc mm2 preliminary experiments of technical replication showed no difference so only biological replicates were undertaken n 3 3 6 data analysis the normality of the data was analysed using the shapiro wilks test and parametric anova and tukey or non parametric tests kruskal wallis and two sample wilcoxon as appropriate to identify any differences in water quality parameters between experiments data collected during the flushing phase was plotted against shear stress and a linear model and regression analysis performed to identify relative changes each loop was analysed separately the r2 and p values were used to assess the fit of the linear model to the data and the significance of the gradient so as to determine which parameters responded significantly to the elevation in shear stress all statistical analysis and graphical plots were generated in r v3 5 2 r foundation for statistical computing platform 2018 with a significance level of 0 05 4 results 4 1 growth water quality results from repeated sampling of the bulk water quality in each of the pipe loops during the 12 month growth period are presented in table 3 the intended dominant difference between the sites was aoc with concentrations highest within pipe loop a mid range in pipe loop b and lowest in pipe loop c table 3 as these are operational sites other parameters also varied between the sites as shown in table 3 tcc and icc within the bulk water mirrored the aoc trend being consistently highest in pipe loop a throughout the growth period total organic nitrogen and phosphate within the bulk water supplying each pipe loop were not statistically different between the three sites table 3 4 2 biofilm visualisation sem images of 12 month biofilm samples in fig 2 show that the biofilms which accumulated in each pipe loop exhibited a distinct difference in both quantity and structure of biofilm between sites supplied by bulk water containing different aoc concentrations the eps matrix primarily made up of carbohydrates and proteins helps to form the physical structure of the biofilm visual qualitative assessment of these images suggests that the biofilm developed on coupons in pipe loop a supplied by water with the highest aoc concentration had more extensive biofilm coverage with a more open sponge like extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix compared to pipe loop b or pipe loop c where the eps is increasingly more closed or compact angular inorganic particles were visualised within sem images of biofilms from all three pipe loops 4 3 biofilm cell enumeration in all cases both the tcc and the icc of the biofilm increased during the 12 month growth phase and decreased during flushing due to an increase in the shear stress the greatest increase in both biofilm tcc and icc throughout the 12 month growth phase was seen in pipe loop a the pipe loop supplied with bulk water containing the highest concentration of aoc the rate of biofilm growth was different at each site with the greatest rate occurring in pipe loop a and the slowest rate in pipe loop c biofilm growth within pipe loop a appeared to slow after 6 months perhaps indicating that biofilm growth was starting to tend towards an equilibrium state whereas biofilm growth within the other two pipe loops was still increasing approximately linearly analysis of coupon position within each experimental pipe loop showed no significant difference with respect to the biofilm cell count or the biofilm appearance as assessed using sem imaging 4 4 flushing response 4 4 1 biofilm cells comparison of the final two points in fig 3 show the mobilisation of cellular material from the biofilm phase due to flushing following on from flushing the greatest loss of tcc from the biofilm was experienced within pipe loop a 60 decline in tcc as compared to 28 loss tcc within pipe loop b and 23 loss tcc within pipe loop c the greatest loss of icc occurred within pipe loop b 30 loss of icc in comparison to a 24 decline within pipe loop a and 18 decline within pipe loop c 4 4 2 aesthetics and inorganics all three pipe loops exhibited a positive turbidity iron and manganese response as the shear stress was raised fig 4 indicating the mobilisation of small particles and inorganic material from the pipe wall pipe loop a supplied by bulk water containing the highest aoc concentration exhibited the greatest turbidity response during flushing increasing from 0 27 to 4 75 ntu pipe loop a therefore generatedthe greatest discoloration response conversely pipe loop c supplied by post treated ground water containing the lowest aoc concentration experienced the smallest turbidity response increasing from 0 2 to 2 15 ntu the concentration of iron and manganese in the bulk water during flushing was highest in pipe loop a and lowest in pipe loop c all three sites contained relatively low iron mean 12 53 µg l standard deviation sd 1 27 µg l in pipe loop a mean 10 07 µg l sd 1 11 µg lin pipe loop b and mean 6 83 µg l sd 0 57 µg l in pipe loop c and manganese mean 8 67 µg l sd 0 55 µg l in pipe loop a mean 5 10 µg l sd 0 30 µg lin pipe loop b and mean 3 10 µg l sd 0 20 µg l in pipe loop c concentration prior to flushing pipe loop a exhibited the greatest increase in iron increase of 225 00 µg l and manganese increase of 33 90 µg l due to the simulated flushing the trends for increasing turbidity iron and manganese with increasing boundary shear stress are all linear fig 4 the gradient r2 and p values quantifying this for each of the pipe loop experimental facilities are listed in table 4 pipe loop a can be seen to have consistently the highest gradient value confirming the greatest turbidity iron and manganese was experienced within pipe loop a in contrast the smallest gradient can consistently be found within pipe loop c 4 4 3 bulk water cellular material the changes in bulk water cellular material is shown in fig 5 it should be noted that initial values are a function of the differences in the bulk water between the sites as observed throughout the growth phase table 3 of interest is the change from the initial values during flushing all three pipe loops exhibited an increase of both tcc and icc fig 5 a b within the bulk water tcc increased by the greatest extent within pipe loop a and pipe loop b increasing by 21 229 cells ml within pipe loop a and 20 595 cells ml within pipe loop b the bulk water within pipe loop c had the smallest increase in tcc during flushing with the tcc increasing by 6376 cells ml although pipe loop a contained the highest tcc within the bulk water at the end of and during the growth phase proportionally the change in tcc during flushing was greatest in pipe loop c having 25 times more cells in the bulk water by the end of flushing compared to the start in comparison pipe loop b exhibited an 11 fold increase in cells within the bulk water and pipe loop a only a two fold increase in cell mobilised into the bulk water the greatest increase in icc during flushing occurred within pipe loop a increase of 16 972 cells ml followed by pipe loop b increase of 10 687 cells ml and finally the smallest increase in icc within pipe loop c 4816 cells ml however as with tcc the change in icc relative to initial value was greatest in pipe loop c increasing by67 times with 20 times increase in pipe loop b and 12 times increase in pipe loop a this also reveals that the greatest proportion of cells being mobilised from the pipe wall were intact and not damaged dead as with turbidity and inorganic parameters the mobilisation of intact and damaged cells due to the increases in shear stress was visually linear in most cases fig 5 and table 5 despite the largest turbidity iron manganese and icc response being observed in pipe loop a the largest tcc gradient was found in pipe loop b the response of toc and aoc mobilisation into the bulk water during the flushing phase of pipe loops a b and c is plotted in fig 6 the behaviour of toc mirrored all other aforementioned water quality parameters turbidity iron manganese tcc and icc toc concentration was consistently highest within pipe loop a throughout the flushing phase and lowest in pipe loop c the greatest increase in toc within the bulk water was experienced within pipe loop a increase of 9 50 mg l followed by pipe loop b increase of 6 53 mg l and finally pipe loop c 4 53 mg l 4 4 4 organic carbon all bulk water samples collected during flushing including turbidity iron manganese tcc icc and toc exhibited a clear site effect the largest response in each of these parameters during flushing was consistently observed within pipe loop a characterised by a high aoc concentration with the smallest response being observed within pipe loop c characterised by a high low concentration the aoc ancova on raw data f 185 p 0 001 and toc ancova on raw data f 13 p 0 002 responses during flushing were found to be statistically different between sites despite this in comparison to other drinking water parameters the amount of aoc mobilised from the biofilm was surprisingly similar independent of the background aoc concentration during growth fig 6b as with cell counts the concentration of aoc at the end of the growth phase start of flushing were different across the three pipe loops with flushing starting from values consistent with those in table 3 however the increase in aoc concentration from pre to post flush was unexpectedly similar between sites with a 115 µg c l increase in aoc within pipe loop a 120 µg c l increase in aoc within pipe loop b and a 115 µg c l increase in aoc within pipe loop c linear trends in the mobilisation of toc and aoc as a function of increasing shear stress were observed fig 6 despite the largest toc gradient being experienced within pipe loop a the smallest aoc gradient was also experienced within pipe loop a table 6 the r2 value for aoc concentration within pipe loop a was considerably lower than other pipe loops suggesting the aoc response during flushing within pipe loop a was non linear 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of aoc on plank tonic growth and biofilm accumulation this study presents the first investigation of the interactions between aoc concentration and biofilms within an operational dwds environment the findings herein demonstrate that aoc influences the appearance fig 2 and cell count fig 3 of biofilms residing at the pipe wall this study found that the greatest growth of cells in the biofilm occurred when the aoc concentration within the bulk water was 300 µg c l as demonstrated in pipe loop a similar to the trends identified in the aoc data tcc and icc within the bulk water were also found to be highest in pipe loop a during the growth period this correlation could be due to higher aoc concentrations supporting planktonic re growth which indirectly seeds the biofilm and increases initial biofilm colonisation however as identified in supplementary figures 1 2 and 3 bulk water tcc and icc exhibited periodic spikes over short spaces of time indicating that tcc and icc were likely impacted by upstream events in the operational systems and therefore not consistently different between sites aoc was found to be more consistently different between sites and is therefore more likely to have been the key parameter shaping biofilm development biofilms affect water quality by the processes they mediate during growth bio corrosion and from ongoing exchange and mobilisation into the bulk water pick et al 2019 found that during dwds network sampling pipe dominated areas of the network exhibited a net decrease in the aoc concentration suggesting that aoc in the bulk water was being used to support microbial growth within the biofilm attached to the pipe wall crucially the aoc concentration in drinking water is impacted by interactions occurring in the bulk water and also those taking place in biofilms the increase in tcc and icc within the biofilm formed under the highest aoc concentration studied slowed between month 9 and month 12 suggesting that biofilms will mature faster at high aoc concentrations the rate of biofilm maturation is dependant on a host of factors including nutrient availability hydrodynamics rate of oxygen perfusion dunne 2002 this study found that even in pipe loop c where the aoc concentration was low although microbial regrowth within the biofilm was limited it did still occur pipe loop c had the lowest concentration of aoc 73 µg c l meaning it would be classed as biologically stable based on values cited in the literature 10 110 µg c l van der kooij 1992 lechevallier et al 1996 ohkouchi et al 2013 wang et al 2014 lechevallier et al 2015 similarly okabe et al 2004 found that biofilms still formed on pipe surfaces within a laboratory experiment which were exposed to drinking water containing an aoc concentration of 39 µg c l even when nutrient levels are extremely low within dwds non oligotrophs are able to survive in this environment by residing within biofilms where nutrients are elevated volk and lechevallier 1999 thus while biological stability is dependant on aoc concentration there is no universal aoc threshold for biological stability due to the interaction and influence of both planktonic and biofilm processes while aoc was intended as the dominant factor that differed between the sites studied here the disinfection residual was also different pipe loop a was supplied by chlorinated water whereas pipe loop b and pipe loop c were supplied with chloraminated water in this study the use of chlorine correlated with the highest bulk water tcc and icc load the highest aoc concentration and the greatest biofilm growth when comparing biofilm growth within the two sites with a monochloramine residual the greatest biofilm growth occurred in pipe loop b despite it having double the total chlorine concentration of pipe loop c table 3 this demonstrates that aoc has a greater effect than chlorine concentration on biofilm growth although the application of a disinfection residual is able to limit planktonic cell growth within dwds gillespie et al 2014 chlorine can oxidise the natural organic matter in drinking water to produce aoc that can support the growth of heterotrophic bacteria liu et al 2002 ramseier et al 2011 this highlights the need for water utilities to prioritise aoc reduction at the wtw rather than reliance on increasing disinfection residual within the dwds the aoc concentration was found to impact biofilm coverage and appearance as identified via sem imaging fig 2 biofilms formed under elevated aoc concentrations had a thicker spongier appearance supporting the theory that biofilm architecture is determined by environmental conditions such as carbon availability karthikeyan et al 2001 microscopy based studies have indicated that carbon concentration can affect biofilm physical structure with a carbon increase altering a thin open biofilm to a thicker structure supporting mushroom cell clusters stoodley et al 2001 biofilm physical structure can also facilitate the mass transfer of nutrients to microorganisms residing within the biofilm via water channels de beer and stoodley 1995 de beer et al 1996 whilst the impact of aoc concentration on eps production has yet to be explored the results presented here suggest that aoc concentration has an impact on biofilm physical structure 5 2 the impact of aoc on biofilm mobilsation and bulk water quality turbidity inorganic and cell count data all exhibited a linear increase in the bulk water due to increasing shear stress this observation shows that all biofilm and other material accumulated within the different pipe loops had material adhered with a range of strengths from the weakest to the most strongly adhered although these commonalities were observed the discoloration response varied between the three sites with a low aoc concentration 73 µg c l in the bulk water resulting in the lowest discoloration response and a high concentration of aoc defined as 300 µg c l in the bulk water resulting in the largest discoloration response fig 4 this study found that when bulk water aoc concentration is high sufficient iron can accumulate over the course of a year to generate an iron failure over 200 µg l dwi 2017 when flushing this therefore supports previous findings that biofilms are key drivers of discolouration within dwds husband et al 2016 and that this process is exasperated by an increased bulk water aoc concentration with increasing aoc concentration there was more material available within the biofilm which could then become mobilised during small scale daily mobilisation or during event induced mobilsation when the internal strength of the biofilm was exceeded by external shear forces picioreanu et al 2001 used 2d mathematical modelling and found that increased biofilm growth rate correlated with small scale regular release events possibly because microorganisms preferentially used energy in cell replication rather than eps production the biofilms exposed to bulk water containing a higher concentration of aoc in this study pipe loop a had a higher growth rate than those in pipe loop b or c forming more eps and incorporating greater amounts of inorganics and thus presenting a greater discolouration potential during the flushing phase biofilm samples within all three pipe loop samples exhibited a reduction of cells both total and intact confirming that cells were being mobilised into the bulk water the observed trends in tcc icc reduction from biofilm samples between sites were the same as the relationships observed between sites for the turbidity and metals data the largest tcc icc response occurred within pipe loop a containing highest aoc concentration within the bulk water this suggests that mobilisation of a greater concentration of microbial cells could cause an increased discolouration response however the greatest proportional change in planktonic tcc or icc occurred during flushing within pipe loop c the site with the lowest aoc concentration therefore the complex patterns presented herein demonstrate that there is no simple linear relationship between the amount of cell mobilisation and the discolouration response and that holistic biofilm analysis is required 5 3 conceptual model aoc release from the biofilm was examined herein for the first time and unexpectedly demonstrated that the rate of aoc release from the biofilm during flushing was the same across field sites independent of the aoc concentration within the bulk water all other measured drinking water parameters including toc exhibited a site specific effect during flushing these results suggest that complex cycling of aoc occurs in the biofilm in which excess aoc is potentially stored within the biofilm at times of elevated aoc concentration in the bulk water carbon and nutrients e g ammonium nitrates phosphates follow a gradient towards the pipe wall driven by the turbulence of the water as the biofilm eps matrix is often negatively charged a number of nutrients will concentrate at the biofilm surface and water channels can facilitate the mass transfer of nutrients carbon to microorganisms within the biofilm de beer and stoodley 1995 de beer et al 1996 trace substrates become trapped in the eps and are only mobilised during small background events or when the shear stress acting upon the biofilm exceeds the internal cohesive strength of the eps a conceptual model is presented in fig 7 illustrating the complex cycling of aoc in dwds based on the interpretations of data obtained in this study central is the idea that biofilms interact with the bulk water through daily background exchange and occasional larger mobilisation events occurring after a change in environmental conditions such as an increase in the hydraulic shear stress the aoc concentration within the bulk water not only impacts planktonic microbial growth but can also be used by microorganisms within the biofilm further contributing to microbial regrowth within the dwds the net effect of pipe dominated areas of a dwds is an increase in the aoc concentration as shown by the purple arrows into and out of the cross section of the conceptual diagram fig 7 pick et al 2019 observed an increasing aoc concentration within trunk mains and a decrease in aoc concentration with service reservoirs within dwds we theorise that aoc can be stored within the biofilm a process which is likely limited by ecological processes occurring within the biofilm providing a ratio of aoc storage aoc storage and subsequent release from the biofilm is likely a complex function of the physical composition of the biofilm in which the eps plays a key role and the ecological interactions occurring within the biofilm the current study focuses on the interactions between aoc and microbial cells further research is required to understand the interaction between additional biofilm characteristics e g architecture biochemistry and eps matrices properties and aoc cycling within dwds the comprehensive model provides a greater understanding of aoc cycling within drinking water essential in the management and maintenance of biological stability within dwds environments 6 conclusion this paper presents the first use of full scale dwds simulation experimental facilities at the outlet of wtw to study the impact of different aoc concentrations on biofilm and bulk water quality the aoc concentration within bulk water was found to dictate both the rate of biofilm growth and the discoloration response the biofilms posed when they are mobilised a high aoc concentration 300 µg c l in the bulk water resulted in the greatest growth of cells in the biofilm and the largest discolouration response as observed for turbidity iron and manganese new evidence of aoc cycling within the biofilm has advanced our understanding of how and why aoc concentration varies within dwds and the impacts this has on microbial re growth the rate of aoc release from the biofilm into the water column was found to be independent from bulk water aoc concentration this suggests the need to consider how aoc is used or incorporated into the biofilm a unifying conceptual model is presented that describes the complex aoc processes in dwds capturing both bulk water and previously overlooked biofilm processes this study found no universal aoc threshold for biological stability due to the interaction and influence of both planktonic and biofilm process ultimately the information gained in this study will enable better management of dwds environments to maintain the quality of drinking water from source to tap

17012,a new conceptual model to describe and understand the role of assimilable organic carbon aoc within drinking water distribution systems is proposed the impact of aoc on both drinking water biofilm and water quality was studied using bespoke pipe loop experimental facilities installed at three carefully selected operational water treatment works integrated physical chemical and biological monitoring was undertaken that highlights the central role of biofilms in aoc cycling forming the basis of the new conceptual model biofilms formed under high aoc conditions were found to pose the highest discoloration response generating a turbidity 4 3 ntu and iron 241 5 µg l response sufficient to have caused regulatory failures from only 20 m of pipe in only 12 months of operation this new knowledge of the role of biofilms in aoc cycling and ultimately impacts on water quality can be used to inform management and help ensure the supply of high quality biostable drinking water keywords drinking water distribution systems assimilable organic carbon microbiology biofilms discoloration 1 introduction the supply of microbially safe high quality drinking water is one of the most fundamental requirements and functions of every water utility in order to achieve this it is often said that the water in drinking water distribution systems dwds should be biologically stable although the exact definition is often unclear biological stability is generally regarded as qualities that minimise the deterioration of water quality between the treatment works and the customers tap assimilable organic carbon aoc a measure of the labile fraction of dissolved organic carbon is often suggested as part of biostability assessment but values are disputed and the roles and cycling of aoc within dwds are little understood 2 background the term regrowth has been used to describe the recovery of disinfectant injured cells whereas aftergrowth has been used to describe microbial growth in a distribution system characklis 1988 van der kooij 2003 in this study re growth includes both the recovery of disinfection damaged cells which have passed through the treatment works and the multiplication of organisms within the dwds itself aoc is easily utilised by heterotrophic bacteria for growth and is a significant contributor to biological instability within dwds nescerecka et al 2014 globally aoc is not routinely monitored within operational networks low concentrations of aoc have been demonstrated to limit microbial growth and therefore constitute biostable water at concentrations spanning 10 100 µg c l in dwds field studies van der kooij 1992 lechevallier et al 1996 and 10 110 µg c l within laboratory studies ohkouchi et al 2013 wang et al 2014 lechevallier et al 2015 however there is no global consensus as to the aoc concentration that constitutes biostable water the aoc concentrations representing biostabiltiy within drinking water 10 100 µg c l are thought to differ due to the presence absence of a disinfection residual the specific disinfection agent used and other a biotic parameters in the dwds such as hydraulic retention time pipe material dwds infrastructure presence of service reservoirs and temperature it is therefore critical to consider interactions between aoc and a disinfectant residual when assessing drinking water biostability although aoc has been demonstrated to contribute towards microbial re growth within dwds the majority of these studies have analysed the effects of aoc on heterotrophic bacteria escobar et al 2001 van der kooij 1992 and or coliforms within the bulk water and not microorganisms within biofilms biofilms within dwds can generate a decline in water quality disinfection residual and pipe infrastructure condition and generate a discolouration response when they mobilise and release materials such as inorganics into the bulk water the biofilm formation rate in drinking water has been shown to be sensitive to changes in aoc concentration within laboratory based studies that typically use biofilm annual reactors van der kooij et al 1995 sharp et al 2001 okabe et al 2002 whilst lab based experimental set ups go some way to understand the impact of aoc on biofilms within drinking water bench scale reactors do not accurately reflect the surface to volume ratio boundary later effect shear stress and other environmental conditions impacting microorganisms within full scale systems this study will therefore analyse the relationship between aoc and biofilm formation within fully operational drinking water supply systems the mobilisation of microorganisms and associated particles from biofilms can cause discolouration events husband and boxall 2010 and or microbial regulatory failures depending on the amount and composition of the detached material in this study discolouration is assessed using turbidity which is a measurement of water clarity obtained by determining the degree of light scattering due to suspended material biofilm mobilisation is either generated through daily background release or larger mobilisation events occurring after a change in environmental conditions such as an increase in the hydraulic shear stress it is not known how the aoc concentration within post treated water impacts the discoloration response posed by biofilms if they should become mobilised the behaviour of particulates within the dwds has been highlighted as being analogous to biofilm behaviour with the strength of the layers being dictated by the shear stress imposed on the pipe wall data generated in sharpe et al 2017 confirmed a positive linear relationship between shear stress and turbidity the same trend is anticipated here 3 material and methods this research aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between aoc concentration biofilms and drinking water stability by considering the planktonic and attached microbiology and integrating this with physical and chemical analysis by studying the effect of different aoc concentrations in the bulk water on biofilm growth and the subsequent response of biofilms to elevated shear stress flushing we seek to determine the role of biofilms in aoc cycling and the resulting impacts on bulk water quality 3 1 dwds pipe loop experimental facilities to explore the impact of aoc on dwds biofilms and the interaction with bulk water quality whilst maintaining representative in pipe conditions i e surface to volume ratios boundary layer exchange and shear stress mechanisms biofilms were developed in three purpose built full scale pipe loop experimental facilities a b and c for one year the pipe loop experimental facilities fig 1 were installed in the field at the exit of three water treatment works wtw each being fed with post treated water supplied directly from the works and containing distinct aoc concentrations the three sites were classified as either high aoc 300 µg c l medium aoc 245 µg c l or low aoc 73 µg c l table 1 each system replicated the hydraulic retention time water chemistry and microbiology of operational dwds whilst enabling laboratory level control of bulk water and biofilm sampling following the 12 month biofilm growth period the pipe loops were flushed to provide insight into the effect of aoc concentration on biofilm mobilisation into the bulk water and its impact on various water quality parameters each pipe loop had a different source water pipe loops a b surface water pipe loop c groundwater and disinfection residual type pipe loop a chlorine pipe loops b c chloramine table 1 raw water quality data is provided in supplementary table 1 while this difference in disinfection residual moves away from pure experimental design with a single parameter changed this is an unrealistic ambition using operational water treatment works furthermore although there were observed differences between sites there were also similarities between pipe loops to enable a two way comparison of environmental and operational factors the three experimental pipe loop facilities were purpose built for this study based on the successful design used by fish et al 2017 and douterelo et al 2018 the dwds experimental loops installed at each of the three sites met the same exact design specifications fig 1 each pipe loop consisted of a 10 m long length of high density polyethylene hdpe pe100 pipe with a 79 3 mm internal diameter hdpe was selected as it is frequently used in modern dwds fish et al 2020 husband et al 2008 drinking water was re circulated around the systems from an enclosed 30 l 0 03 m3 tank via a variable speed pump an independent system residence time of 24 h was set using a trickle feed and drain to provide representative water quality of each dwds and preserve a baseline nutrient supply and disinfection residual amongst other water quality parameters during the 12 month growth phase the pipe loop was run at conditioning flow rate of 0 4 l s calculated shear stress 0 03 nm 2 assuming pipe roughness coefficient of 0 075 mm this flow rate was selected as this was the average flow rate in 75 100 mm diameter pipes within uk dwds husband et al 2008 and has been used previously in full scale laboratory tests to develop drinking water biofilms douterelo et al 2014 fish et al 2017 the system flow rate was monitored using a siemens sitrans f m mag 6000 flow meter with flow being controlled by adjusting the control valve at the end of each loop and or the pump speed the partially closed final control valve ensured a system pressure of 1 8 bar 18 m was achieved in the pipe loops this and a continual upward gradient ensured pipe full conditions were maintained four straight sections 1 m long were included in each loop containing 12 apertures positioned 75 mm apart into which removable pennine water group pwg coupons deines et al 2010 were inserted fig 1 to provide a removable surface for biofilm sampling the coupons consisted of an outer curved coupon and a removable flat insert which enabled dual analysis of the same sample fig 1 component c the curvature of the coupon corresponds to that of the pipe to reduce distortion of boundary layer conditions such as turbulence and shear stress regime the insert piece had a flat surface designed for microscopy analyses deines et al 2010 3 2 growth phase during the growth phase biofilms were developed naturally no inoculum within each pipe loop facility for one year each loop was supplied with treated water at sites a b and c respectively and thus biofilm was grown under high medium of low aoc conditions to monitor flow remotely when not on site three wi fi enabled monitors were designed at the university of sheffield and installed at each of the three pipe loop sites the monitors used arduino technology to monitor and transmit flow data 3 2 1 disinfection of pipe loop facilities prior to beginning the year long growth phase each of the three pipe loops was disinfected for 24 h with a 20 mg l concentration of a sodium hypochlorite solution vwr international ltd uk 11 14 free chlorine which was re circulated within the system at a maximum flow rate of 5 0 l s each pipe loop was then flushed repeatedly at the maximum flow rate with post treated water from each wtw until the chlorine concentration decreased to that of the inlet water before use the pwg coupons were sterilised via sonication with a 2 w v sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution fish 2013 3 2 2 water quality sampling the quality of water circulating in each loop over the 12 months was monitored by collection of discrete bulk water samples every two weeks n 3 using sterile 500 ml sample bottles aurora scientific bristol u k once the distribution line was flushed and the flow reduced six volumes of 500 ml bulk water were collected from the sample tap marked in fig 1 3 2 3 biofilm sampling coupons for biofilm analysis were collected in triplicate during the growth phase at day 0 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month time periods day 0 samples were defined as coupons which were in the pipe loop for 90 min the outer coupons the non insert component of the coupon were used to determine the number of intact and damaged cells within the biofilm using flow cytometry the coupon inserts were used to visually assess biofilm volume using scanning electron microscopy sem these inserts were fixed in 5 formaldehyde solution and stored at 4 c prior to downstream analysis fisher scientific uk fish 2013 3 3 flushing phase 3 3 1 flushing process biofilm mobilisation and resulting impact on water quality was assessed by imposing a simulated flushing operation sequentially increasing the flow rate 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 5 0 l s and hence boundary shear stress in four steps 0 33 0 83 1 55 and 3 02 nm 2 flow rate was measured and recorded every 10 s due to the relatively short pipe length head loss was not sufficient for accurate measurement and hence shear stress was calculated via the darcy wiesbach equation assuming a pipe roughness of 0 075 mm which is representative of the roughness of pe100 hdpe pipe husband et al 2008 the trickle drain and feed were shut during the flushing phase to ensure accuracy in the assessment of any bulk water quality changes due to the mobilisation of material from the pipe wall 3 3 2 water quality discrete samples n 3 were collected after five turnovers at each flow rate when all mobilisation had occurred and the mobilised material was well mixed into the bulk water discrete samples from the flushing phase were analysed for the bulk water quality parameterslisted in table 2 turbidity data was also collected continuously throughout the flushing phase using an ati monitor table 2 connected to a tapping point just upstream of the control valve with a return to the system tank figure 1 the turbidity time series showed that stable turbidity levels were achieved within three turnovers with five turnovers being used to provide additional confidence 3 3 3 biofilm sampling biofilm samples coupons were taken post flush after the final flushing step and collected in triplicate coupons were positioned along either side of the pipe length with the exception of nine top or bottom positioned coupons which were used to determine if the coupon position within the pipe influenced the biofilm top and bottom positioned coupons outer coupons only were analysed to determine the number of intact and damaged cells within the biofilm using flow cytometry 3 4 water quality analysis 3 4 1 water quality sampling bulk water discrete samples from growth and flushing phases were analysed for the water quality parameters displayed in table 2 in addition continuous turbidity measurements were conducted using an online ati analytical technology inc uk turbidity logger 3 4 2 aoc aoc was analysed for all bulk water discrete samples from growth and flushing phases using the method developed and proven in pick et al 2019 the aoc methodology combined the known strain inoculum approach with a larger inoculum volume and flow cytometric enumeration to increase the speed and reproducibility of evaluating aoc concentration in summary 40 ml water samples were collected into glassware which has been rendered organic carbon free using the method described in pick et al 2019 samples were collected using the method outlined in section 3 2 2 and dechlorinated using sodium thiosulphate in the lab samples were pasteurised in a 70 c water bath for 30 min before being inoculated with 10 000 cfu ml of either pseudomonas fluorescens strain p 17 p 17 or spirillum strain nox nox into separate vials and incubated at 15 c samples were enumerated on days 6 7 and 8 using the flow cytometry protocol outlined in section 3 4 3 the averaged cell counts on day 6 7 and 8 were converted to aoc values using pre derived yield value of 4 1 106 cfu p 17 μg acetatec and 1 2 107 cfu nox μg acetate c van der kooij et al 1982 the two known strains cultures of p 17 atcc 49 642 and nox atcc 49 643 were acquired from the american type culture collection atcc the preparation of the stock cultures was performed as described in lechevallier et al 1993 and aggarwal et al 2015 aoc controls were performed including residual chlorine vials to check the chlorine content after dechlorination growth controls to determine if samples were limited by nutrients other than carbon blank controls to check for carbon contamination and yield controls to check the growth yield of the two bacterial strains 3 4 3 flow cytometry planktonic total tcc and intact cell count icc cells ml in the bulk water were measured using the flow cytometry method outlined in fish et al 2020 bulk water samples for flow cytometry analysis were collected using the sampling method outlined in section 3 2 2 into bottles pre treated with sodium thiosulphate 3 w v to dechlorinate the samples before analysis in summary 500 µl water samples were stained with 5 µl sybr green life sciences california usa for tcc 500 µl water samples were stained with 6 µl sybr green propidium iodine mixture life sciences california usa with a final concentration of 1x sybr green and 3 μm pi for icc samples were analysed using bd accuri c6 flow cytometer with autosampler bd accuri uk with a fixed gate plot as described in fish et al 2020 all appropriate negative controls were performed including negative controls for stains and calibration beads were run daily 3 5 biofilm analysis 3 5 1 scanning electron microscopy sem sem was used to provide a qualitative assessment of biofilm accumulation giving an indication of differences in surface coverage and the physical structure of the biofilms one 12 month insert was analysed from each loop with each biofilm sample being imaged at 1000x and 5000x magnification with a total of 50 images being taken per sample all sem sample preparation and imaging was undertaken at the biomedical science electron microscopy unit the university of sheffield and analysed as described in douterelo et al 2016 3 5 2 flow cytometry of biofilm samples biofilm suspensions were prepared for flow cytometry using the protocol published in fish et al 2020 the outer coupon was placed in a petri dish with 30 ml of sterile phosphate buffer and repeatedly brushed using a sterile toothbrush fish 2013 negative controls were run on the flow cytometer using phosphate buffer solution stained for tcc and icc a 0 5 ml volume of the biofilm suspension was stained and analysed in accordance with the bulk water flow cytometry protocol to convert the cell counts into cell concentrations icc mm2 or tcc mm2 the following equation was used i c c o r t c c c o u n t v o l u m e a n a l y s e d x t o t a l v o l u m e o f s a m p l e s a where the count is the total or intact cell count volume analysed is the volume of sample that was processed in the flow cytometer 50 µl the total volume of samples in this case was 30 ml 30 000 µl and sa is the surface area from which the biofilm was removed all the raw biofilm data were converted into icc mm2 or tcc mm2 preliminary experiments of technical replication showed no difference so only biological replicates were undertaken n 3 3 6 data analysis the normality of the data was analysed using the shapiro wilks test and parametric anova and tukey or non parametric tests kruskal wallis and two sample wilcoxon as appropriate to identify any differences in water quality parameters between experiments data collected during the flushing phase was plotted against shear stress and a linear model and regression analysis performed to identify relative changes each loop was analysed separately the r2 and p values were used to assess the fit of the linear model to the data and the significance of the gradient so as to determine which parameters responded significantly to the elevation in shear stress all statistical analysis and graphical plots were generated in r v3 5 2 r foundation for statistical computing platform 2018 with a significance level of 0 05 4 results 4 1 growth water quality results from repeated sampling of the bulk water quality in each of the pipe loops during the 12 month growth period are presented in table 3 the intended dominant difference between the sites was aoc with concentrations highest within pipe loop a mid range in pipe loop b and lowest in pipe loop c table 3 as these are operational sites other parameters also varied between the sites as shown in table 3 tcc and icc within the bulk water mirrored the aoc trend being consistently highest in pipe loop a throughout the growth period total organic nitrogen and phosphate within the bulk water supplying each pipe loop were not statistically different between the three sites table 3 4 2 biofilm visualisation sem images of 12 month biofilm samples in fig 2 show that the biofilms which accumulated in each pipe loop exhibited a distinct difference in both quantity and structure of biofilm between sites supplied by bulk water containing different aoc concentrations the eps matrix primarily made up of carbohydrates and proteins helps to form the physical structure of the biofilm visual qualitative assessment of these images suggests that the biofilm developed on coupons in pipe loop a supplied by water with the highest aoc concentration had more extensive biofilm coverage with a more open sponge like extracellular polymeric substance eps matrix compared to pipe loop b or pipe loop c where the eps is increasingly more closed or compact angular inorganic particles were visualised within sem images of biofilms from all three pipe loops 4 3 biofilm cell enumeration in all cases both the tcc and the icc of the biofilm increased during the 12 month growth phase and decreased during flushing due to an increase in the shear stress the greatest increase in both biofilm tcc and icc throughout the 12 month growth phase was seen in pipe loop a the pipe loop supplied with bulk water containing the highest concentration of aoc the rate of biofilm growth was different at each site with the greatest rate occurring in pipe loop a and the slowest rate in pipe loop c biofilm growth within pipe loop a appeared to slow after 6 months perhaps indicating that biofilm growth was starting to tend towards an equilibrium state whereas biofilm growth within the other two pipe loops was still increasing approximately linearly analysis of coupon position within each experimental pipe loop showed no significant difference with respect to the biofilm cell count or the biofilm appearance as assessed using sem imaging 4 4 flushing response 4 4 1 biofilm cells comparison of the final two points in fig 3 show the mobilisation of cellular material from the biofilm phase due to flushing following on from flushing the greatest loss of tcc from the biofilm was experienced within pipe loop a 60 decline in tcc as compared to 28 loss tcc within pipe loop b and 23 loss tcc within pipe loop c the greatest loss of icc occurred within pipe loop b 30 loss of icc in comparison to a 24 decline within pipe loop a and 18 decline within pipe loop c 4 4 2 aesthetics and inorganics all three pipe loops exhibited a positive turbidity iron and manganese response as the shear stress was raised fig 4 indicating the mobilisation of small particles and inorganic material from the pipe wall pipe loop a supplied by bulk water containing the highest aoc concentration exhibited the greatest turbidity response during flushing increasing from 0 27 to 4 75 ntu pipe loop a therefore generatedthe greatest discoloration response conversely pipe loop c supplied by post treated ground water containing the lowest aoc concentration experienced the smallest turbidity response increasing from 0 2 to 2 15 ntu the concentration of iron and manganese in the bulk water during flushing was highest in pipe loop a and lowest in pipe loop c all three sites contained relatively low iron mean 12 53 µg l standard deviation sd 1 27 µg l in pipe loop a mean 10 07 µg l sd 1 11 µg lin pipe loop b and mean 6 83 µg l sd 0 57 µg l in pipe loop c and manganese mean 8 67 µg l sd 0 55 µg l in pipe loop a mean 5 10 µg l sd 0 30 µg lin pipe loop b and mean 3 10 µg l sd 0 20 µg l in pipe loop c concentration prior to flushing pipe loop a exhibited the greatest increase in iron increase of 225 00 µg l and manganese increase of 33 90 µg l due to the simulated flushing the trends for increasing turbidity iron and manganese with increasing boundary shear stress are all linear fig 4 the gradient r2 and p values quantifying this for each of the pipe loop experimental facilities are listed in table 4 pipe loop a can be seen to have consistently the highest gradient value confirming the greatest turbidity iron and manganese was experienced within pipe loop a in contrast the smallest gradient can consistently be found within pipe loop c 4 4 3 bulk water cellular material the changes in bulk water cellular material is shown in fig 5 it should be noted that initial values are a function of the differences in the bulk water between the sites as observed throughout the growth phase table 3 of interest is the change from the initial values during flushing all three pipe loops exhibited an increase of both tcc and icc fig 5 a b within the bulk water tcc increased by the greatest extent within pipe loop a and pipe loop b increasing by 21 229 cells ml within pipe loop a and 20 595 cells ml within pipe loop b the bulk water within pipe loop c had the smallest increase in tcc during flushing with the tcc increasing by 6376 cells ml although pipe loop a contained the highest tcc within the bulk water at the end of and during the growth phase proportionally the change in tcc during flushing was greatest in pipe loop c having 25 times more cells in the bulk water by the end of flushing compared to the start in comparison pipe loop b exhibited an 11 fold increase in cells within the bulk water and pipe loop a only a two fold increase in cell mobilised into the bulk water the greatest increase in icc during flushing occurred within pipe loop a increase of 16 972 cells ml followed by pipe loop b increase of 10 687 cells ml and finally the smallest increase in icc within pipe loop c 4816 cells ml however as with tcc the change in icc relative to initial value was greatest in pipe loop c increasing by67 times with 20 times increase in pipe loop b and 12 times increase in pipe loop a this also reveals that the greatest proportion of cells being mobilised from the pipe wall were intact and not damaged dead as with turbidity and inorganic parameters the mobilisation of intact and damaged cells due to the increases in shear stress was visually linear in most cases fig 5 and table 5 despite the largest turbidity iron manganese and icc response being observed in pipe loop a the largest tcc gradient was found in pipe loop b the response of toc and aoc mobilisation into the bulk water during the flushing phase of pipe loops a b and c is plotted in fig 6 the behaviour of toc mirrored all other aforementioned water quality parameters turbidity iron manganese tcc and icc toc concentration was consistently highest within pipe loop a throughout the flushing phase and lowest in pipe loop c the greatest increase in toc within the bulk water was experienced within pipe loop a increase of 9 50 mg l followed by pipe loop b increase of 6 53 mg l and finally pipe loop c 4 53 mg l 4 4 4 organic carbon all bulk water samples collected during flushing including turbidity iron manganese tcc icc and toc exhibited a clear site effect the largest response in each of these parameters during flushing was consistently observed within pipe loop a characterised by a high aoc concentration with the smallest response being observed within pipe loop c characterised by a high low concentration the aoc ancova on raw data f 185 p 0 001 and toc ancova on raw data f 13 p 0 002 responses during flushing were found to be statistically different between sites despite this in comparison to other drinking water parameters the amount of aoc mobilised from the biofilm was surprisingly similar independent of the background aoc concentration during growth fig 6b as with cell counts the concentration of aoc at the end of the growth phase start of flushing were different across the three pipe loops with flushing starting from values consistent with those in table 3 however the increase in aoc concentration from pre to post flush was unexpectedly similar between sites with a 115 µg c l increase in aoc within pipe loop a 120 µg c l increase in aoc within pipe loop b and a 115 µg c l increase in aoc within pipe loop c linear trends in the mobilisation of toc and aoc as a function of increasing shear stress were observed fig 6 despite the largest toc gradient being experienced within pipe loop a the smallest aoc gradient was also experienced within pipe loop a table 6 the r2 value for aoc concentration within pipe loop a was considerably lower than other pipe loops suggesting the aoc response during flushing within pipe loop a was non linear 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of aoc on plank tonic growth and biofilm accumulation this study presents the first investigation of the interactions between aoc concentration and biofilms within an operational dwds environment the findings herein demonstrate that aoc influences the appearance fig 2 and cell count fig 3 of biofilms residing at the pipe wall this study found that the greatest growth of cells in the biofilm occurred when the aoc concentration within the bulk water was 300 µg c l as demonstrated in pipe loop a similar to the trends identified in the aoc data tcc and icc within the bulk water were also found to be highest in pipe loop a during the growth period this correlation could be due to higher aoc concentrations supporting planktonic re growth which indirectly seeds the biofilm and increases initial biofilm colonisation however as identified in supplementary figures 1 2 and 3 bulk water tcc and icc exhibited periodic spikes over short spaces of time indicating that tcc and icc were likely impacted by upstream events in the operational systems and therefore not consistently different between sites aoc was found to be more consistently different between sites and is therefore more likely to have been the key parameter shaping biofilm development biofilms affect water quality by the processes they mediate during growth bio corrosion and from ongoing exchange and mobilisation into the bulk water pick et al 2019 found that during dwds network sampling pipe dominated areas of the network exhibited a net decrease in the aoc concentration suggesting that aoc in the bulk water was being used to support microbial growth within the biofilm attached to the pipe wall crucially the aoc concentration in drinking water is impacted by interactions occurring in the bulk water and also those taking place in biofilms the increase in tcc and icc within the biofilm formed under the highest aoc concentration studied slowed between month 9 and month 12 suggesting that biofilms will mature faster at high aoc concentrations the rate of biofilm maturation is dependant on a host of factors including nutrient availability hydrodynamics rate of oxygen perfusion dunne 2002 this study found that even in pipe loop c where the aoc concentration was low although microbial regrowth within the biofilm was limited it did still occur pipe loop c had the lowest concentration of aoc 73 µg c l meaning it would be classed as biologically stable based on values cited in the literature 10 110 µg c l van der kooij 1992 lechevallier et al 1996 ohkouchi et al 2013 wang et al 2014 lechevallier et al 2015 similarly okabe et al 2004 found that biofilms still formed on pipe surfaces within a laboratory experiment which were exposed to drinking water containing an aoc concentration of 39 µg c l even when nutrient levels are extremely low within dwds non oligotrophs are able to survive in this environment by residing within biofilms where nutrients are elevated volk and lechevallier 1999 thus while biological stability is dependant on aoc concentration there is no universal aoc threshold for biological stability due to the interaction and influence of both planktonic and biofilm processes while aoc was intended as the dominant factor that differed between the sites studied here the disinfection residual was also different pipe loop a was supplied by chlorinated water whereas pipe loop b and pipe loop c were supplied with chloraminated water in this study the use of chlorine correlated with the highest bulk water tcc and icc load the highest aoc concentration and the greatest biofilm growth when comparing biofilm growth within the two sites with a monochloramine residual the greatest biofilm growth occurred in pipe loop b despite it having double the total chlorine concentration of pipe loop c table 3 this demonstrates that aoc has a greater effect than chlorine concentration on biofilm growth although the application of a disinfection residual is able to limit planktonic cell growth within dwds gillespie et al 2014 chlorine can oxidise the natural organic matter in drinking water to produce aoc that can support the growth of heterotrophic bacteria liu et al 2002 ramseier et al 2011 this highlights the need for water utilities to prioritise aoc reduction at the wtw rather than reliance on increasing disinfection residual within the dwds the aoc concentration was found to impact biofilm coverage and appearance as identified via sem imaging fig 2 biofilms formed under elevated aoc concentrations had a thicker spongier appearance supporting the theory that biofilm architecture is determined by environmental conditions such as carbon availability karthikeyan et al 2001 microscopy based studies have indicated that carbon concentration can affect biofilm physical structure with a carbon increase altering a thin open biofilm to a thicker structure supporting mushroom cell clusters stoodley et al 2001 biofilm physical structure can also facilitate the mass transfer of nutrients to microorganisms residing within the biofilm via water channels de beer and stoodley 1995 de beer et al 1996 whilst the impact of aoc concentration on eps production has yet to be explored the results presented here suggest that aoc concentration has an impact on biofilm physical structure 5 2 the impact of aoc on biofilm mobilsation and bulk water quality turbidity inorganic and cell count data all exhibited a linear increase in the bulk water due to increasing shear stress this observation shows that all biofilm and other material accumulated within the different pipe loops had material adhered with a range of strengths from the weakest to the most strongly adhered although these commonalities were observed the discoloration response varied between the three sites with a low aoc concentration 73 µg c l in the bulk water resulting in the lowest discoloration response and a high concentration of aoc defined as 300 µg c l in the bulk water resulting in the largest discoloration response fig 4 this study found that when bulk water aoc concentration is high sufficient iron can accumulate over the course of a year to generate an iron failure over 200 µg l dwi 2017 when flushing this therefore supports previous findings that biofilms are key drivers of discolouration within dwds husband et al 2016 and that this process is exasperated by an increased bulk water aoc concentration with increasing aoc concentration there was more material available within the biofilm which could then become mobilised during small scale daily mobilisation or during event induced mobilsation when the internal strength of the biofilm was exceeded by external shear forces picioreanu et al 2001 used 2d mathematical modelling and found that increased biofilm growth rate correlated with small scale regular release events possibly because microorganisms preferentially used energy in cell replication rather than eps production the biofilms exposed to bulk water containing a higher concentration of aoc in this study pipe loop a had a higher growth rate than those in pipe loop b or c forming more eps and incorporating greater amounts of inorganics and thus presenting a greater discolouration potential during the flushing phase biofilm samples within all three pipe loop samples exhibited a reduction of cells both total and intact confirming that cells were being mobilised into the bulk water the observed trends in tcc icc reduction from biofilm samples between sites were the same as the relationships observed between sites for the turbidity and metals data the largest tcc icc response occurred within pipe loop a containing highest aoc concentration within the bulk water this suggests that mobilisation of a greater concentration of microbial cells could cause an increased discolouration response however the greatest proportional change in planktonic tcc or icc occurred during flushing within pipe loop c the site with the lowest aoc concentration therefore the complex patterns presented herein demonstrate that there is no simple linear relationship between the amount of cell mobilisation and the discolouration response and that holistic biofilm analysis is required 5 3 conceptual model aoc release from the biofilm was examined herein for the first time and unexpectedly demonstrated that the rate of aoc release from the biofilm during flushing was the same across field sites independent of the aoc concentration within the bulk water all other measured drinking water parameters including toc exhibited a site specific effect during flushing these results suggest that complex cycling of aoc occurs in the biofilm in which excess aoc is potentially stored within the biofilm at times of elevated aoc concentration in the bulk water carbon and nutrients e g ammonium nitrates phosphates follow a gradient towards the pipe wall driven by the turbulence of the water as the biofilm eps matrix is often negatively charged a number of nutrients will concentrate at the biofilm surface and water channels can facilitate the mass transfer of nutrients carbon to microorganisms within the biofilm de beer and stoodley 1995 de beer et al 1996 trace substrates become trapped in the eps and are only mobilised during small background events or when the shear stress acting upon the biofilm exceeds the internal cohesive strength of the eps a conceptual model is presented in fig 7 illustrating the complex cycling of aoc in dwds based on the interpretations of data obtained in this study central is the idea that biofilms interact with the bulk water through daily background exchange and occasional larger mobilisation events occurring after a change in environmental conditions such as an increase in the hydraulic shear stress the aoc concentration within the bulk water not only impacts planktonic microbial growth but can also be used by microorganisms within the biofilm further contributing to microbial regrowth within the dwds the net effect of pipe dominated areas of a dwds is an increase in the aoc concentration as shown by the purple arrows into and out of the cross section of the conceptual diagram fig 7 pick et al 2019 observed an increasing aoc concentration within trunk mains and a decrease in aoc concentration with service reservoirs within dwds we theorise that aoc can be stored within the biofilm a process which is likely limited by ecological processes occurring within the biofilm providing a ratio of aoc storage aoc storage and subsequent release from the biofilm is likely a complex function of the physical composition of the biofilm in which the eps plays a key role and the ecological interactions occurring within the biofilm the current study focuses on the interactions between aoc and microbial cells further research is required to understand the interaction between additional biofilm characteristics e g architecture biochemistry and eps matrices properties and aoc cycling within dwds the comprehensive model provides a greater understanding of aoc cycling within drinking water essential in the management and maintenance of biological stability within dwds environments 6 conclusion this paper presents the first use of full scale dwds simulation experimental facilities at the outlet of wtw to study the impact of different aoc concentrations on biofilm and bulk water quality the aoc concentration within bulk water was found to dictate both the rate of biofilm growth and the discoloration response the biofilms posed when they are mobilised a high aoc concentration 300 µg c l in the bulk water resulted in the greatest growth of cells in the biofilm and the largest discolouration response as observed for turbidity iron and manganese new evidence of aoc cycling within the biofilm has advanced our understanding of how and why aoc concentration varies within dwds and the impacts this has on microbial re growth the rate of aoc release from the biofilm into the water column was found to be independent from bulk water aoc concentration this suggests the need to consider how aoc is used or incorporated into the biofilm a unifying conceptual model is presented that describes the complex aoc processes in dwds capturing both bulk water and previously overlooked biofilm processes this study found no universal aoc threshold for biological stability due to the interaction and influence of both planktonic and biofilm process ultimately the information gained in this study will enable better management of dwds environments to maintain the quality of drinking water from source to tap

17013,the nitrous oxides emission was measured over 7 months in the full scale aerobic granular sludge plant in dinxperlo the netherlands nitrous oxide concentrations were measured in the bulk liquid and the off gas of the nereda reactor combined with the batch wise operation of the reactor this gave a high information density and a better insight into n2o emission in general the average emission factor was 0 33 based on the total nitrogen concentration in the influent the yearly average emission factor was estimated to be between 0 25 and 0 30 the average emission factor is comparable to continuous activated sludge plants using flocculent sludge and it is low compared to other sequencing batch systems the variability in the emission factor increased when the reactor temperature was below 14 c showing higher emission factors during the winter period a change in the process control in the winter period reduced the variability reducing the emission factors to a level comparable to the summer period different process control might be necessary at high and low temperatures to obtain a consistently low nitrous oxide emission rainy weather conditions lowered the emission factor also in the dry weather flow batches following the rainy weather batches this was attributed to the first flush from the sewer at the start of rainy weather conditions resulting in a temporarily increased sludge loading graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nereda aerobic granular sludge nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions 1 introduction nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming a molecule of nitrous oxide has a 298 times greater effect on global warming than a molecule of carbon dioxide ipcc 2007 nitrous oxide can be produced as a by product of nitrification and denitrification processes kampschreur et al 2009 although in general only a small fraction of the influent ammonium is emitted as nitrous oxide the large greenhouse warming potential can make nitrous oxide emission the dominant factor in the carbon footprint of a wastewater treatment plant daelman et al 2015 desloover et al 2012 emission of nitrous oxide has been studied for many wastewater treatment process configurations under many process conditions showing a wide range of emission factors these emission factors defined as the amount of nitrous oxide emitted relative to the nitrogen load to the plant generally fall between 0 and 5 but higher values are also reported vasilaki et al 2019 several pathways are shown to be of importance for nitrous oxide production in the wastewater treatment process kampschreur et al 2008 wunderlin et al 2012 in the nitrification process the intermediate product hydroxylamine can be oxidized to nitrous oxide both biologically and chemically under oxygen limited conditions nitrifiers can denitrify nitrite to nitrous oxide the so called nitrifier denitrification pathway under anoxic conditions nitrous oxide can be produced by heterotrophic denitrifiers by imbalanced enzyme activity nitrite accumulation or lack of biodegradable cod wunderlin et al 2012 at the same time denitrification can be a sink for nitrous oxide when the reducing capacity of nitrous oxide exceeds the production capacity during denitrification conthe et al 2019 fluctuating influent concentrations and seasonal variations in full scale plants combined with the variety of pathways leading to nitrous oxide formation make it very complex to find the underlying processes that lead to elevated nitrous oxide emissions daelman et al 2015 2013 vasilaki et al 2019 research on nitrous oxide emissions has mainly focused on wastewater treatment processes with flocculent sludge and few laboratory studies have been performed with aerobic granular sludge jahn et al 2019 this is mainly because the aerobic granular sludge ags process is a relatively new wastewater treatment process the technology has been rapidly adopted over the last decade and currently almost 70 full scale aerobic granular sludge installations are operational or under construction these full scale aerobic granular sludge installations are all nereda installations which is a registered trademark of royal haskoningdhv for the nereda process only short term 2 weeks measurements were reported in a pilot reactor and the full scale reactor in epe the netherlands both showed an average nitrous oxide emission factor of about 0 7 of the total nitrogen in the influent roest et al 2012 which is comparable to conventional activated sludge plants however other studies have shown that to get reliable data on nitrous oxide emissions long term measurement campaigns are required daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 vasilaki et al 2019 there are several laboratory studies reporting on nitrous oxide formation in ags reactors these studies reported a wide range of emission factors from 1 lochmatter et al 2014 to 22 zhang et al 2015 due to the strong deviation from conditions in full scale reactors in these experiments it is uncertain how relevant the reported values are regarding full scale installations laboratory systems are very good at isolating a specific parameter but translation towards full scale wwtp s is challenging because of differences in influent composition process control and reactor design and operation because of the potentially significant contribution to the carbon footprint of full scale ags processes it is important to quantify the nitrous oxide emission factors hereto the nitrous oxide emission from a full scale nereda plant treating domestic wastewater was monitored for 7 consecutive months two different methods were used to measure the nitrous oxide emissions namely by measuring the nitrous oxide concentrations continuously in the water phase and by measuring it in the off gas during aeration the former has the advantage of showing nitrous oxide kinetics under anoxic conditions when the aeration is turned off the latter has the benefit of measuring the direct nitrous oxide emission without the need for a conversion algorithm combined with the dynamic behaviour of the repeated batch wise operated system a high information density could be obtained on the nitrous oxide behaviour from the plant the goal was to get better insight in the nitrous oxide emissions of the full scale ags process as well as to understand the major factors preventing and leading to elevated nitrous oxide emissions in full scale ags systems 2 methodology 2 1 plant description all the measurements took place at the dinxperlo wastewater treatment plant which is located in the municipality of aalten the netherlands fig 1 geohash u1hwgpzr the treatment plant is operated by the water authority waterschap rijn en ijssel and the plant was taken into operation in 2013 the influent consists mainly of domestic wastewater see table 1 and the plant is designed for 11 000 p e treating on average 3 100 m3 day 1 with a peak flow of 570 m3 h 1 it consists of 3 separate reactors of each 1 250 m3 current effluent requirements are cod of 125 mg l 1 total nitrogen of 15 mg l 1 total phosphorus of 2 mg l 1 and total suspended solids of 30 mg l 1 all yearly averaged values on top of this the effluent requirement for phosphorus is 1 mg l 1 in the summer and 3 mg l 1 in the winter the influent is collected in an influent buffer and then treated in one of the three nereda reactors the effluent is polished by means of a sand filter with the possibility of iron dosing to remove remaining phosphorus 2 2 nitrous oxide measurements the nitrous oxide emission from the reactor was measured by determining the nitrous oxide concentration in the off gas of the reactor during aeration fig 2 a polyethylene floating hood with a cross sectional area of 0 55 m2 was used to capture the air escaping the surface area of the reactor during aeration the inside of the hood was partially filled with polyurethane foam to reduce the headspace and limit the gas retention time to the analysers part of the off gas that passed through the hood was transported via a transparent hose and cooled to 4 c to remove the moisture the gas concentrations were measured in two online gas analysers rosemount nga 2000 mlt for oxygen and carbon dioxide servomex 4900 for methane and nitrous oxide calibration of the analysers was performed using gas cylinders containing known concentrations of the studied gases for accurate calculations the temperature pressure and relative humidity of the outside air were also measured using a micro sensor bosch bme280 the nitrous oxide concentrations were converted into mass fluxes using the method described by baeten baeten 2020 baeten et al 2021 additional to the nitrous oxide concentration in the off gas the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid was measured using a nitrous oxide sensor from unisense environment this sensor was placed one meter below the water surface of the reactor 2 3 size distribution the granule size distribution of the aerobic granular sludge in the reactors was measured by pouring a sample of the sludge over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 212 425 630 1000 1400 and 2000 µm a mixed sample of 100 ml was filtered for the determination of the total dry weight the obtained granular biomass of the different sieve fractions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 c until no change in weight was detected anymore 2 4 online measurements the reactor was equipped with probes for dissolved oxygen and temperature hach ldo redox potential hach redox water level endress hauser radar suspended solids hach solitax ts and nitrate hach nitratax ammonium and phosphate were continuously measured using a filter unit and auto sampling device hach filtrax amtax and phosphax the filter unit was situated 0 5 meter below the water surface sampling was done at an interval of 5 minutes 2 5 offline sampling samples for analyses of influent and effluent were collected using refrigerated auto samplers collecting 24 hours flow proportional samples for both influent and effluent the chemical analyses of cod tn nh4 n po4 3 p no3 n no2 n in the reactor were performed by using the appropriate hach lange cuvette kits 2 6 emission factors offline samples were taken every 14 days to calculate the emission factor a total nitrogen concentration in the influent ctn i per batch was needed therefore the total nitrogen concentration in the influent was calculated for every batch using the peak ammonium concentration during aeration measured by the analyser cnh4 max the remaining effluent ammonium concentration of the previous batch measured by the analyser cnh4 e and the exchange ratio er 1 c t n i c n h 4 max c n h 4 e 1 e r e r f a d s f o r g here the fads is the factor compensating for adsorption of ammonium to the granules bassin et al 2011 and forg is the ratio between total nitrogen and ammonium in the influent the combined effect of these two factors was found by correlating the estimated ctn with the actual values found by the 14 days offline sampling an average value of fads x forg of 1 79 was found with an r squared of 0 75 the emission factor was calculated by dividing the total outgoing load of nitrous oxide with the total incoming load of total nitrogen according to the following equation 2 e f m n 2 o c t n i v b a t c h here mn2o is the total mass of the nitrous oxide in the off gas of the batch expressed in mg n and vbatch is the batch size 2 7 simultaneous nitrification denitrification during the aerated phase part of the nitrified nitrogen is directly converted to nitrogen gas because of the anoxic conditions in the granule the average efficiency of simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd during aeration is expressed as 3 s n d 1 c n o 3 e c n o 3 min f a d s f o r g c n h 4 max c n h 4 e c n o r g here cno3 min is the minimum nitrate concentration at the start of the aeration phase cno3 e is the nitrate concentration at the end of the aeration phase and cn org is the estimated value of the organic nitrogen in the effluent for the latter a value of 1 5 mg l 1 is assumed 2 8 process control the aeration was controlled using a novel process control developed for aerobic granular sludge van dijk et al 2018 this control strategy targets a nitrate production rate to maximize simultaneous nitrification denitrification as a result dissolved oxygen levels in the reactor are minimized as is the energy consumption during dry weather conditions the reactors have a fixed cycle time of 6 hours when the flow increases due to rainy weather the cycle will adapt to treat the increased amount of water the feeding time will increase from 60 minutes to 75 minutes and the feed flow from the buffer increases from about 180 m3 h 1 to a maximum of 600 m3 h 1 as a result the cycle time will decrease to a minimum of 4 hours see fig 3 3 results 3 1 plant performance and operation the measurements were executed at the nereda installation of dinxperlo the netherlands when the trial started the plant was already in operation for four years and the reactors contained an aerobic granular sludge bed with a mlss concentration of 8 0 g l 1 the three reactors showed normal operation during the whole trial period the measurements were done in reactor 1 in table 1 the average influent and effluent quality during the measurement campaign is shown in fig 4 a typical batch from dinxperlo is shown the figure shows online measurements of the concentration of ammonium nitrate phosphate and dissolved oxygen during three cycles since these sensors were positioned at the top of the reactor and the reactor was plug flow fed from the bottom the measurements during feeding represent the effluent concentrations the cycle started with a feed phase where influent was added to the bottom of reactor and effluent was decanted from the top simultaneously after feeding the reaction phase started where the reactor was aerated the reactor was mixed by the aeration at the start of the aeration phase the concentrations of ammonium and phosphate appear to increase which was caused by the mixing of the bottom layer with influent water and top layer with the effluent water after the reaction phase the biomass was allowed to settle and the cycle restarted for the next batch 3 2 monthly average nitrous oxide emission the nitrous oxide emission through off gas from reactor 1 was measured from the 9th august 2017 to 18th march 2018 the water phase sensor was available from the 4th of october 2017 in this period the average nitrous oxide emission factor was 0 33 fig 5 shows the monthly average nitrous oxide emissions over the whole measuring period there was a distinct difference between the summer and autumn period compared to the winter period in december the nitrous oxide emission factor started to rise from an average of 0 22 in the first 4 months to a maximum of 0 64 in february in march the emissions dropped again to the pre december levels the average water temperature declined steadily over the same period from 20 6 c in august down to 9 7 c in march 2018 3 3 batch average nitrous oxide emission fig 6 shows the emission factors as well as the water temperature per batch the graphs show that in the period between august 2017 and mid december 2017 the emission factor for most batches was between 0 and 0 5 with a limited number of batches rising above 0 5 in this period the emission factor averaged to 0 22 starting from december 2017 the variability of the emission factors increased there were still many batches present with an emission factor of almost zero but the maximum values increased up to 2 in the period between december 2017 and the end of february 2018 the emission factor averaged to 0 42 starting from the last week of february 2018 this variability was again comparable to the period before december 2017 3 4 effect of organic loading rate n load the variability of the nitrous oxide emission factor and with that the total emission factor seems to be influenced by the maximum ammonium concentration in the batch fig 7 the maximum emission factor up to 2 was reached at ammonium concentrations between 5 and 10 mg l 1 but in this range many values close to zero were also measured at ammonium concentrations below 5 mg l 1 and above 10 mg l 1 only few emission factors above 1 were measured with most values between 0 and 0 5 3 5 effect of rain events fig 8 shows the effect of the flow to the wwtp on the nitrous oxide emission factor during dry weather flow conditions dwf the influent flow ranged between 0 and 150 m3 h averaging at 105 m3 h rain weather flow rwf conditions are characterized with an influent flow up to 600 m3 h rwf dwf ratio of 6 during dry weather flow the emission factor 0 40 was higher than during rain weather flow 0 13 although the total load of nitrogen transported to the wwtp will not differ much between dwf and rwf conditions the cycle time was shortened during rwf to handle the increased influent flow the cycle time for dwf batches was typically 6 hours while the cycle time for rwf batches was shortened to a minimum of 4 hours 3 6 effect of temperature temperature had some effect on the variability of the emission factor as shown in fig 9 temperatures above 14 c resulted for most batches in an emission factor between 0 and 0 5 while at temperatures below 14 c the emission factor varied between 0 and 2 it is uncertain whether this was solely related to temperature because in march the temperature was low average at 10 c while the emission factor did not show this increased variability 3 7 diurnal pattern the emission factor did not show a clear diurnal pattern in fig 10 the average emission factor per batch is shown as a function of the time of the day the same variability was present as in the previous graphs leading to a relatively high standard deviation the values of the batches starting between 3 00h and 16 00h showed a lower emission than the batches between 17 00h and 02 00h a problem in this analysis was the batch wise operation of the reactor the analysis was done based on the starting time of the batch which was several hours before the actual emission of nitrous oxide was measured due to the 6 hours cycle time during dwf out of 1043 batches analysed in this study only 19 started between 3 am and 4 am while 71 batches started 6 pm and 7 pm 3 8 dynamic nitrous oxide behaviour the complexity and dynamics of nitrous oxide emissions is illustrated in fig 11 net production of nitrous oxide as well as net consumption of nitrous oxide was visible in the online measurements the first batch started marker 1 without any nitrous oxide in the bulk liquid and therefore also no emission through the off gas at the start of the aeration phase at the start of the aeration the dissolved oxygen concentration increased and a first peak of nitrous oxide emission could be observed marker 2 also a simultaneous decrease of the nitrate concentration was observed caused by mixing of the nitrate remaining from the previous batch with newly fed influent low in nitrate when the dissolved oxygen concentration increased further the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid and off gas decreased again marker 2 to 3 in this period the nitrous oxide production rate was lower than the combined effect of stripping through the off gas and denitrification of nitrous oxide further on in the aeration phase the nitrous oxide concentration in both the bulk liquid and the off gas increased marker 3 towards the end of the aeration phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was lowered marker 4 and a sudden increase of the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid was seen hereafter the aeration and thus mixing was stopped allowing the biomass to settle marker 5 the reactor was ready to receive the next influent batch marker 5 during the feeding marker 5 to 6 the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid stayed constant because the sensor was situated at the top of the reactor and the sludge bed had settled to the bottom of the reactor there was no sludge present in the top layer and no biological processes occured in the top part of the reactor after this feeding phase the aeration phase started again and the nitrous oxide concentration dropped due to mixing before the production started again marker 7 halfway through the reaction phase the oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid was lowered marker 8 this led to a period where the production of nitrate was limited but ammonium was still being converted thus optimizing for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification after lowering of the oxygen concentration a similar although lower initial increase of the nitrous oxide could be seen marker 9 as was visible in the previous batch marker 2 at the end of this second batch the nitrous oxide was almost completely removed 10 the process control used here automatically balances nitrification and denitrification to optimize simultaneous nitrification and denitrification to get a maximum total nitrogen removal this was done by dynamically altering the dissolved oxygen set point and sometimes this resulted in a drop of the oxygen concentration in the reaction phase as previously described in fig 12 an example of this behaviour is shown this seems to trigger a nitrous oxide production response when the oxygen concentration dropped 1 the nitrous oxide production in the bulk liquid and the off gas increased 2 on the 24th of february the process control was changed to a fixed oxygen set point 2 5 mg l 1 during the reaction phase with the reaction phase being split up in an aeration phase and an unaerated post denitrification phase this had an immediate effect on the nitrous oxide production an example of a batch under this new process control is shown in fig 13 during the reaction phase almost no nitrous oxide was produced only when the aeration was stopped in the post denitrification phase some nitrous oxide was produced but this did not lead to any emission because the aeration was switched off and the nitrous oxide was denitrified before the end of the cycle this change led to a decrease of the emission factor to 0 15 during the three weeks this process control was used the nitrogen removal also changed slightly by the change in the process control the average ammonium effluent concentration was 10 higher 3 2 mg l 1 after the change compared to 2 9 mg l 1 before the change the average nitrate effluent concentration was similar under both process controls 5 3 mg l 1 the snd efficiency over the whole period was 69 15 it was 58 12 after the change compared to 70 15 before the change a typical rwf event is shown in fig 14 when the flow towards the wwtp increased because of rainy weather a first flush arrived at the wwtp increasing the ammonium load in the reactor the load in this batch was too high for the aeration capacity and the reduced aeration duration leaving some elevated levels of ammonium in the effluent the process control focussed mainly on nitrification aerating the system at maximum capacity little nitrous oxide is formed in this batch in the two batches hereafter the load returned to normal levels but still the focus was mainly on nitrification in these batches little nitrous oxide was formed when the rwf event was finished and the flow to the wwtp returned to normal the cycle times lengthened again but still the emission of nitrous oxides remained close to zero 4 discussion 4 1 long term nitrous oxide emissions this study is the first long term campaign measuring nitrous oxide emissions of a full scale ags reactor treating sewage a nereda reactor at the wastewater treatment plant of dinxperlo the netherlands was monitored for 7 consecutive months in this period an average emission factor of 0 33 was measured this means that 0 33 of the incoming nitrogen load was emitted as nitrous oxide with the off gas the daily averaged emission factor ranged from 0 02 to 1 58 these values are comparable to the values found in previous short term nereda research roest et al 2012 the average value found in the short term research 0 7 are higher than the average value found in the current research but the value of 0 7 is well within the variability of this long term study stressing the importance of long term research since the emission was measured for only 7 months the higher winter values contribute proportionately strong in the average value presented a 12 month yearly averaged emission factor is estimated to be in the range of 0 25 to 0 30 compared to conventional activated sludge cas systems the values obtained fall well within the reported ranges in literature for example in a study investigating seven cas plants in australia the emission factor ranged between 0 6 and 25 3 based on the kilograms of nitrogen denitrified foley et al 2010 another study performing short term measurements in 12 plants in the united states showed an emission factor ranging from 0 01 to 1 5 ahn et al 2010 more recently a long term measurement campaign in switzerland showed an emission factor for the cas system of 1 6 2 0 while a flocculent sludge sbr system showed an emission factor of 2 4 gruber et al 2020 an overview of the emission factors for different wastewater treatment systems adapted from vasilaki et al 2019 is shown fig 15 this underlines that the values found in this study are comparable to most other wastewater treatment systems but are considerably lower than the values generally reported for sequencing batch reactors sbr systems this is remarkable since the ags system used in this study is operated as an sbr this shows high emission factors are not intrinsic to sbr systems and that the correct process conditions can also lead to low emission factors 4 2 seasonal and diurnal variations for cas systems a strong seasonal effect has been reported for the emission factor daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 showing higher emissions at lower temperatures or increasing temperatures in early spring in this study a seasonal effect is also visible as can be seen in figs 5 and 9 the variability of the nitrous oxide emission increases when the water temperature drops below 14 c in december at temperatures above 14 c the emission factor per batch varies between 0 and 0 5 while below 14 c the emission factor ranges between 0 and 2 5 contradictorily march shows the lowest monthly emission factor 0 15 at the lowest average temperature of 9 7 c this difference may be caused by a change in process control in march daelman et al 2015 suggested this seasonal effect was primarily caused by an increase of no2 concentrations in early spring in the current study effluent nitrite concentrations were consistently low with an average value of 0 05 mg l 1 table 1 although nitrite concentrations were not measured during the cycle elevated levels of nitrite during the cycle would also at least partially have ended up in the effluent since this was not the case here no major effect of nitrite on the nitrous oxide emissions is expected the drop in the temperature in december was related to the inflow of melting snow and in 4 days the water temperature in the reactor dropped from 13 c to 8 c at these low temperatures of 8 c the nitrification rates dropped considerably but the ammonium effluent concentration was still below the consent value at the same time the nitrous oxide concentrations in both off gas and bulk liquid were almost zero or below the detection limit for several days until the temperature increased again above 9 c in the week before this event the variability of the emission factor was already increasing but after this event the variability of the emission factor of nitrous oxide further increased after the water temperature was recovered to temperatures above 10 c a diurnal pattern is observed in the data fig 10 the batches starting between 4h and 14h show a lower average emission factor than the batches starting between 15h and 3h the relation is not as clear as for cas systems daelman et al 2015 which is mainly caused by the fact that the ags reactor is a batch system running about 4 batches per day which does not give a high resolution over the day as in cas systems the lowest average emission is found between 3h and 15h it is uncertain what causes this but variations in batch loading may play a role since the reactors are operated with a fixed cycle time of 6 hours during dwf conditions the volumetric exchange ratio is lower if the total flow to the wastewater treatment plant is lower 4 3 nitrous oxide in the cycle nitrous oxide can be produced by both nitrification and by denitrification kampschreur et al 2008 wunderlin et al 2012 ammonia oxidising bacteria can produce nitrous oxide from oxidation of hydroxylamine and from denitrification of nitrite under oxygen deprived circumstances denitrification can be both a source and a sink for nitrous oxide conthe et al 2019 nitrous oxide is also an intermediate in the heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate at the same time nitrous oxide can be removed by denitrification conthe et al 2019 in aerobic granular sludge nitrification and denitrification happen simultaneously during the aeration phase which make it difficult to distinguish nitrous oxide production from nitrification and denitrification during the aeration phase de kreuk et al 2005 nevertheless there seems to be clear evidence that both processes contribute to the production of nitrous oxides in most batches there is no dissolved nitrous oxide present at the start of the cycle in these cycles nitrous oxide production coincides with the conversion of ammonium and the production of nitrate fig 11 at marker 3 often a peak of nitrous oxide at the start of the aeration phase is observed fig 11 at marker 2 this peak seems to be caused by denitrification of nitrate left over from the previous cycle because nitrification has not started yet it is not clear if nitrous oxide is produced by partial denitrification caused by lack of cod at the end of the previous cycle or by rapid denitrification on readily biodegradable cod from the fresh influent in both cases the increase of the nitrous oxide concentration is primarily caused by mixing of the reactor aeration and the decrease seems to be primarily caused by denitrification of nitrous oxides on readily biodegradable cod although in the latter case stripping of nitrous oxide also plays a role it is likely that denitrification acts more as a sink for nitrous oxide at the start of the cycle after feeding and that denitrification acts more as a source for nitrous oxide at the end of the cycle when most cod from the feeding phase both storage polymers in the sludge and cod in the bulk liquid is consumed that would implicate the nitrous oxide production observed when nitrification starts as a net production rate resulting from production by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrification by heterotrophic organisms understanding the mechanisms and when nitrous oxide production exceeds consumption could be important for the development of nitrous oxide emission control strategies the dissolved oxygen concentration is considered an important parameter to control nitrous oxide emissions and concentrations below 1 mg l 1 during nitrification would stimulate nitrifier denitrification due to oxygen limitation kampschreur et al 2009 oxygen limitation in biofilms is a well known factor even under higher oxygen concentrations ødegaard et al 1994 it is therefore not surprising that lower oxygen concentrations seem to result in higher nitrous oxide emissions in fig 11 and fig 12 an increase of the nitrous oxide emission can be seen if the dissolved oxygen concentration drops below 1 mg l 1 a decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration will also shift the process to denitrification because the size of the anoxic zone within the aerobic granules will increase de kreuk et al 2005 since this decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration mostly happens towards the end of the reaction phase denitrification might act more as a source than a sink of nitrous oxide as carbon availability is low this would result in a double effect on the nitrous oxide emission both the nitrifier pathway and the denitrifier pathway could increase nitrous oxide production in this situation a clear effect of rain events is shown in fig 14 rain events cause the batch size to increase because more water arrives at the wwtp in total 173 batches 18 were classified as rwf batches these batches had an average emission factor of 0 09 which is less than one third of the 0 33 found for all batches the reason for these lower emissions during rwf conditions is uncertain but there are several processes influencing the emission factor during rwf under rwf conditions the flow to the wwtp increases from 0 175 m3 h during dwf conditions to up to 600 m3 h under rwf conditions since the reactor is operated as a sequencing batch reactor the scheduling needs to be adapted to handle the increased inflow of wastewater chen et al 2020 this is done by decreasing the total cycle time and running more batches per day this leads to shorter more intense aeration phases with higher oxygen concentrations on average the aeration phase during rwf is 35 minutes shorter than during dwf secondly rwf batches can be split in two groups at the start of a rain event a first flush arrives at the wwtp due to the presence of pressure pipelines in the sewer the load exceeds the aeration capacity leading to incomplete nitrification and thus less potential for nitrous oxide production after this initial peak load the load returns to a more average value but the aeration remains relatively short and intense focussing on nitrification the lack of cycle time during rwf results in an increased nitrate effluent concentration 1 7 mg l 1 under dwf conditions and 4 4 mg l 1 under rwf conditions the total snd efficiency on average was 69 15 but was slightly lower during rwf 65 13 compared to dwf 70 15 but during dwf batches snd happens at lower dissolved oxygen concentrations it also appears that the rwf event influences the dwf batches following the rwf event fig 14 5 and 6 in these dwf batches nitrous oxide emissions are close to zero this might be the result of the first flush at the start of the rain event which results in a high sludge loading a high sludge load will result in higher storage polymer concentration in the granular biomass in this specific batch which might stretch out to the following batches this leads to more denitrification capability of the plant it appears that the denitrification process in these batches acts mainly as a sink for nitrous oxide denitrifying nitrous oxide at a higher rate than it is produced eventually the positive effect of the higher sludge loading will dissipate and normal nitrous oxide emissions will return the nitrous oxide concentrations in the bulk liquid are seldom higher than 0 3 mg l 1 and in most cases the concentration at the end of the cycle is close to zero this means that in most cycles the denitrification capacity of nitrous oxide is also present towards the end of the cycle this study observed nitrous oxide conversion rates up to 1 mg n2o n l 1 h 1 this rate is a net rate because it happens simultaneously with denitrification of nitrate which also can produce nitrous oxide as an intermediate product in most cases in less than 30 minutes of anoxic conditions all nitrous oxide in the bulk liquid is denitrified this suggests a high nitrous oxide conversion potential is present if the right conditions are met 4 4 effect of process control the nitrous oxide emission factors varied between 0 02 and 1 58 per day most of the batches being below 0 5 the emission of nitrous oxide might be lowered by changing the process control the decrease of the emission factor from 0 57 in february to 0 15 in march by changing the process control to a fixed aeration strategy is an example of this a more stable dissolve oxygen concentration during the aeration phase led to a remarkable decrease in the emission of nitrous oxide on the other hand the process control focusing on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification did not lead to elevated nitrous oxide emission in the summer period different process control strategies may be necessary during summer and winter conditions to limit nitrous oxide emission under all conditions it also seems that the production of nitrous oxide during the cycle is increasing when the do drops below 1 mg l 1 this could be easily prevented by adjusting the process control as to not allow for the oxygen to dip below the required set point another potential improvement relates to the initial peak at the start of the aeration fig 11 this initial peak could be prevented by adding a pre denitrification phase to the cycle aiming to remove this residual nitrate simultaneously removing the nitrous oxide formed during settling and feeding another option is to focus on post denitrification to prevent high amounts of residual nitrate to be present in the next cycle thereby limiting the nitrous oxide emission peak compared with a continuously fed activated sludge system an sbr system gives a much higher information density on the changes in nitrous oxide production and consumption this gives the possibility to develop effective process control strategies to minimize the nitrous oxide emissions a maximum nitrous oxide concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 and a net denitrification rate up to 1 mg l 1 h 1 was measured this would mean that a denitrification phase of 20 minutes should be enough to remove nitrous oxide from the water phase in most cases splitting the main aeration phase and adding one or more intermediate denitrification steps could be an effective measure to minimize nitrous oxide emission 4 5 difference with conventional sbr systems the ags reactor was operated as a sequencing batch reactor a comparison with flocculent sbr systems is therefore of interest as shown in fig 15 regular sbr systems have shown to have higher emission factors than continuously fed activated sludge systems high nitrous oxide emissions in sbrs are attributed to sudden changes in the concentrations of ammonium nitrate and nitrite within the cycle or to accumulated dissolved nitrous oxide during anoxic settling and decanting in the subsequent aerobic phase vasilaki et al 2019 these conventional sbr systems show emission factors up to 5 6 which is much higher than the value of 0 33 found in this study this might be caused by differences in process conditions the feeding in the ags process is strictly anaerobic which is achieved by plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor by this plug flow the nitrate remaining in the reactor from the previous cycle is pushed upwards while the reactor is filled with fresh influent from the bottom this limits the contact between sludge cod and nitrate preventing production of high levels of nitrous oxide during the feeding phase while anaerobic plug flow feeding is a requirement in ags systems it is uncommon in sbr systems for example in a study by rodriguez caballero et al 2015 the sbr reactors were alternatingly fed anoxically and aerobically resulting in an emission factor of 6 4 4 6 comparison water phase and gas phase measurement the nitrous oxide concentration was measured by two different methods firstly by measuring the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid by means of an online sensor and secondly by measuring the nitrous oxide concentrations in the off gas via a gas analyser the latter has the benefit of measuring the emission during aeration directly without the need for converting water phase concentration into emissions to the air the downside of the off gas method is the lack of information about what happens during the anaerobic and the anoxic phase when the aeration is turned off the water phase sensor gives direct insight into the production of nitrous oxide in the anoxic phase and the denitrification of nitrous oxide in the anoxic phase the water phase sensor thus provides information that otherwise would be lost or obscured by other nitrous oxide forming processes during aeration for the use in process control both methods can be used but the water phase sensor is likely more effective as it also gives information about the non aerated phases 5 conclusions a seven month measurement campaign of the emission of nitrous oxide was performed in the nereda reactor of dinxperlo the netherlands key findings include an average nitrous oxide emission factor of 0 33 0 0033 mg nitrous oxide n mg tninfluent was found over a 7 month measuring campaign spanning summer and winter the yearly average emission factor was estimated between 0 25 and 0 30 the emission factor was comparable with continuously fed activated sludge plants with low emissions and lower than values found for conventional sbr systems both nitrification and denitrification appeared to contribute to the nitrous oxide production denitrification acting both as a source and a sink for nitrous oxide post denitrification significantly reduced the nitrous oxide concentration in the reactor an increased variability of the emission factor was observed at low temperatures different process control between summer and winter could limit the emission factor in the winter period aeration on a fixed oxygen setpoint reduced the emission factor compared to aeration using variable oxygen setpoint a temporary increase of the sludge loading decreased the emission factor for several batches declaration of competing interest the

17013,the nitrous oxides emission was measured over 7 months in the full scale aerobic granular sludge plant in dinxperlo the netherlands nitrous oxide concentrations were measured in the bulk liquid and the off gas of the nereda reactor combined with the batch wise operation of the reactor this gave a high information density and a better insight into n2o emission in general the average emission factor was 0 33 based on the total nitrogen concentration in the influent the yearly average emission factor was estimated to be between 0 25 and 0 30 the average emission factor is comparable to continuous activated sludge plants using flocculent sludge and it is low compared to other sequencing batch systems the variability in the emission factor increased when the reactor temperature was below 14 c showing higher emission factors during the winter period a change in the process control in the winter period reduced the variability reducing the emission factors to a level comparable to the summer period different process control might be necessary at high and low temperatures to obtain a consistently low nitrous oxide emission rainy weather conditions lowered the emission factor also in the dry weather flow batches following the rainy weather batches this was attributed to the first flush from the sewer at the start of rainy weather conditions resulting in a temporarily increased sludge loading graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nereda aerobic granular sludge nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions 1 introduction nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming a molecule of nitrous oxide has a 298 times greater effect on global warming than a molecule of carbon dioxide ipcc 2007 nitrous oxide can be produced as a by product of nitrification and denitrification processes kampschreur et al 2009 although in general only a small fraction of the influent ammonium is emitted as nitrous oxide the large greenhouse warming potential can make nitrous oxide emission the dominant factor in the carbon footprint of a wastewater treatment plant daelman et al 2015 desloover et al 2012 emission of nitrous oxide has been studied for many wastewater treatment process configurations under many process conditions showing a wide range of emission factors these emission factors defined as the amount of nitrous oxide emitted relative to the nitrogen load to the plant generally fall between 0 and 5 but higher values are also reported vasilaki et al 2019 several pathways are shown to be of importance for nitrous oxide production in the wastewater treatment process kampschreur et al 2008 wunderlin et al 2012 in the nitrification process the intermediate product hydroxylamine can be oxidized to nitrous oxide both biologically and chemically under oxygen limited conditions nitrifiers can denitrify nitrite to nitrous oxide the so called nitrifier denitrification pathway under anoxic conditions nitrous oxide can be produced by heterotrophic denitrifiers by imbalanced enzyme activity nitrite accumulation or lack of biodegradable cod wunderlin et al 2012 at the same time denitrification can be a sink for nitrous oxide when the reducing capacity of nitrous oxide exceeds the production capacity during denitrification conthe et al 2019 fluctuating influent concentrations and seasonal variations in full scale plants combined with the variety of pathways leading to nitrous oxide formation make it very complex to find the underlying processes that lead to elevated nitrous oxide emissions daelman et al 2015 2013 vasilaki et al 2019 research on nitrous oxide emissions has mainly focused on wastewater treatment processes with flocculent sludge and few laboratory studies have been performed with aerobic granular sludge jahn et al 2019 this is mainly because the aerobic granular sludge ags process is a relatively new wastewater treatment process the technology has been rapidly adopted over the last decade and currently almost 70 full scale aerobic granular sludge installations are operational or under construction these full scale aerobic granular sludge installations are all nereda installations which is a registered trademark of royal haskoningdhv for the nereda process only short term 2 weeks measurements were reported in a pilot reactor and the full scale reactor in epe the netherlands both showed an average nitrous oxide emission factor of about 0 7 of the total nitrogen in the influent roest et al 2012 which is comparable to conventional activated sludge plants however other studies have shown that to get reliable data on nitrous oxide emissions long term measurement campaigns are required daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 vasilaki et al 2019 there are several laboratory studies reporting on nitrous oxide formation in ags reactors these studies reported a wide range of emission factors from 1 lochmatter et al 2014 to 22 zhang et al 2015 due to the strong deviation from conditions in full scale reactors in these experiments it is uncertain how relevant the reported values are regarding full scale installations laboratory systems are very good at isolating a specific parameter but translation towards full scale wwtp s is challenging because of differences in influent composition process control and reactor design and operation because of the potentially significant contribution to the carbon footprint of full scale ags processes it is important to quantify the nitrous oxide emission factors hereto the nitrous oxide emission from a full scale nereda plant treating domestic wastewater was monitored for 7 consecutive months two different methods were used to measure the nitrous oxide emissions namely by measuring the nitrous oxide concentrations continuously in the water phase and by measuring it in the off gas during aeration the former has the advantage of showing nitrous oxide kinetics under anoxic conditions when the aeration is turned off the latter has the benefit of measuring the direct nitrous oxide emission without the need for a conversion algorithm combined with the dynamic behaviour of the repeated batch wise operated system a high information density could be obtained on the nitrous oxide behaviour from the plant the goal was to get better insight in the nitrous oxide emissions of the full scale ags process as well as to understand the major factors preventing and leading to elevated nitrous oxide emissions in full scale ags systems 2 methodology 2 1 plant description all the measurements took place at the dinxperlo wastewater treatment plant which is located in the municipality of aalten the netherlands fig 1 geohash u1hwgpzr the treatment plant is operated by the water authority waterschap rijn en ijssel and the plant was taken into operation in 2013 the influent consists mainly of domestic wastewater see table 1 and the plant is designed for 11 000 p e treating on average 3 100 m3 day 1 with a peak flow of 570 m3 h 1 it consists of 3 separate reactors of each 1 250 m3 current effluent requirements are cod of 125 mg l 1 total nitrogen of 15 mg l 1 total phosphorus of 2 mg l 1 and total suspended solids of 30 mg l 1 all yearly averaged values on top of this the effluent requirement for phosphorus is 1 mg l 1 in the summer and 3 mg l 1 in the winter the influent is collected in an influent buffer and then treated in one of the three nereda reactors the effluent is polished by means of a sand filter with the possibility of iron dosing to remove remaining phosphorus 2 2 nitrous oxide measurements the nitrous oxide emission from the reactor was measured by determining the nitrous oxide concentration in the off gas of the reactor during aeration fig 2 a polyethylene floating hood with a cross sectional area of 0 55 m2 was used to capture the air escaping the surface area of the reactor during aeration the inside of the hood was partially filled with polyurethane foam to reduce the headspace and limit the gas retention time to the analysers part of the off gas that passed through the hood was transported via a transparent hose and cooled to 4 c to remove the moisture the gas concentrations were measured in two online gas analysers rosemount nga 2000 mlt for oxygen and carbon dioxide servomex 4900 for methane and nitrous oxide calibration of the analysers was performed using gas cylinders containing known concentrations of the studied gases for accurate calculations the temperature pressure and relative humidity of the outside air were also measured using a micro sensor bosch bme280 the nitrous oxide concentrations were converted into mass fluxes using the method described by baeten baeten 2020 baeten et al 2021 additional to the nitrous oxide concentration in the off gas the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid was measured using a nitrous oxide sensor from unisense environment this sensor was placed one meter below the water surface of the reactor 2 3 size distribution the granule size distribution of the aerobic granular sludge in the reactors was measured by pouring a sample of the sludge over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 212 425 630 1000 1400 and 2000 µm a mixed sample of 100 ml was filtered for the determination of the total dry weight the obtained granular biomass of the different sieve fractions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 c until no change in weight was detected anymore 2 4 online measurements the reactor was equipped with probes for dissolved oxygen and temperature hach ldo redox potential hach redox water level endress hauser radar suspended solids hach solitax ts and nitrate hach nitratax ammonium and phosphate were continuously measured using a filter unit and auto sampling device hach filtrax amtax and phosphax the filter unit was situated 0 5 meter below the water surface sampling was done at an interval of 5 minutes 2 5 offline sampling samples for analyses of influent and effluent were collected using refrigerated auto samplers collecting 24 hours flow proportional samples for both influent and effluent the chemical analyses of cod tn nh4 n po4 3 p no3 n no2 n in the reactor were performed by using the appropriate hach lange cuvette kits 2 6 emission factors offline samples were taken every 14 days to calculate the emission factor a total nitrogen concentration in the influent ctn i per batch was needed therefore the total nitrogen concentration in the influent was calculated for every batch using the peak ammonium concentration during aeration measured by the analyser cnh4 max the remaining effluent ammonium concentration of the previous batch measured by the analyser cnh4 e and the exchange ratio er 1 c t n i c n h 4 max c n h 4 e 1 e r e r f a d s f o r g here the fads is the factor compensating for adsorption of ammonium to the granules bassin et al 2011 and forg is the ratio between total nitrogen and ammonium in the influent the combined effect of these two factors was found by correlating the estimated ctn with the actual values found by the 14 days offline sampling an average value of fads x forg of 1 79 was found with an r squared of 0 75 the emission factor was calculated by dividing the total outgoing load of nitrous oxide with the total incoming load of total nitrogen according to the following equation 2 e f m n 2 o c t n i v b a t c h here mn2o is the total mass of the nitrous oxide in the off gas of the batch expressed in mg n and vbatch is the batch size 2 7 simultaneous nitrification denitrification during the aerated phase part of the nitrified nitrogen is directly converted to nitrogen gas because of the anoxic conditions in the granule the average efficiency of simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd during aeration is expressed as 3 s n d 1 c n o 3 e c n o 3 min f a d s f o r g c n h 4 max c n h 4 e c n o r g here cno3 min is the minimum nitrate concentration at the start of the aeration phase cno3 e is the nitrate concentration at the end of the aeration phase and cn org is the estimated value of the organic nitrogen in the effluent for the latter a value of 1 5 mg l 1 is assumed 2 8 process control the aeration was controlled using a novel process control developed for aerobic granular sludge van dijk et al 2018 this control strategy targets a nitrate production rate to maximize simultaneous nitrification denitrification as a result dissolved oxygen levels in the reactor are minimized as is the energy consumption during dry weather conditions the reactors have a fixed cycle time of 6 hours when the flow increases due to rainy weather the cycle will adapt to treat the increased amount of water the feeding time will increase from 60 minutes to 75 minutes and the feed flow from the buffer increases from about 180 m3 h 1 to a maximum of 600 m3 h 1 as a result the cycle time will decrease to a minimum of 4 hours see fig 3 3 results 3 1 plant performance and operation the measurements were executed at the nereda installation of dinxperlo the netherlands when the trial started the plant was already in operation for four years and the reactors contained an aerobic granular sludge bed with a mlss concentration of 8 0 g l 1 the three reactors showed normal operation during the whole trial period the measurements were done in reactor 1 in table 1 the average influent and effluent quality during the measurement campaign is shown in fig 4 a typical batch from dinxperlo is shown the figure shows online measurements of the concentration of ammonium nitrate phosphate and dissolved oxygen during three cycles since these sensors were positioned at the top of the reactor and the reactor was plug flow fed from the bottom the measurements during feeding represent the effluent concentrations the cycle started with a feed phase where influent was added to the bottom of reactor and effluent was decanted from the top simultaneously after feeding the reaction phase started where the reactor was aerated the reactor was mixed by the aeration at the start of the aeration phase the concentrations of ammonium and phosphate appear to increase which was caused by the mixing of the bottom layer with influent water and top layer with the effluent water after the reaction phase the biomass was allowed to settle and the cycle restarted for the next batch 3 2 monthly average nitrous oxide emission the nitrous oxide emission through off gas from reactor 1 was measured from the 9th august 2017 to 18th march 2018 the water phase sensor was available from the 4th of october 2017 in this period the average nitrous oxide emission factor was 0 33 fig 5 shows the monthly average nitrous oxide emissions over the whole measuring period there was a distinct difference between the summer and autumn period compared to the winter period in december the nitrous oxide emission factor started to rise from an average of 0 22 in the first 4 months to a maximum of 0 64 in february in march the emissions dropped again to the pre december levels the average water temperature declined steadily over the same period from 20 6 c in august down to 9 7 c in march 2018 3 3 batch average nitrous oxide emission fig 6 shows the emission factors as well as the water temperature per batch the graphs show that in the period between august 2017 and mid december 2017 the emission factor for most batches was between 0 and 0 5 with a limited number of batches rising above 0 5 in this period the emission factor averaged to 0 22 starting from december 2017 the variability of the emission factors increased there were still many batches present with an emission factor of almost zero but the maximum values increased up to 2 in the period between december 2017 and the end of february 2018 the emission factor averaged to 0 42 starting from the last week of february 2018 this variability was again comparable to the period before december 2017 3 4 effect of organic loading rate n load the variability of the nitrous oxide emission factor and with that the total emission factor seems to be influenced by the maximum ammonium concentration in the batch fig 7 the maximum emission factor up to 2 was reached at ammonium concentrations between 5 and 10 mg l 1 but in this range many values close to zero were also measured at ammonium concentrations below 5 mg l 1 and above 10 mg l 1 only few emission factors above 1 were measured with most values between 0 and 0 5 3 5 effect of rain events fig 8 shows the effect of the flow to the wwtp on the nitrous oxide emission factor during dry weather flow conditions dwf the influent flow ranged between 0 and 150 m3 h averaging at 105 m3 h rain weather flow rwf conditions are characterized with an influent flow up to 600 m3 h rwf dwf ratio of 6 during dry weather flow the emission factor 0 40 was higher than during rain weather flow 0 13 although the total load of nitrogen transported to the wwtp will not differ much between dwf and rwf conditions the cycle time was shortened during rwf to handle the increased influent flow the cycle time for dwf batches was typically 6 hours while the cycle time for rwf batches was shortened to a minimum of 4 hours 3 6 effect of temperature temperature had some effect on the variability of the emission factor as shown in fig 9 temperatures above 14 c resulted for most batches in an emission factor between 0 and 0 5 while at temperatures below 14 c the emission factor varied between 0 and 2 it is uncertain whether this was solely related to temperature because in march the temperature was low average at 10 c while the emission factor did not show this increased variability 3 7 diurnal pattern the emission factor did not show a clear diurnal pattern in fig 10 the average emission factor per batch is shown as a function of the time of the day the same variability was present as in the previous graphs leading to a relatively high standard deviation the values of the batches starting between 3 00h and 16 00h showed a lower emission than the batches between 17 00h and 02 00h a problem in this analysis was the batch wise operation of the reactor the analysis was done based on the starting time of the batch which was several hours before the actual emission of nitrous oxide was measured due to the 6 hours cycle time during dwf out of 1043 batches analysed in this study only 19 started between 3 am and 4 am while 71 batches started 6 pm and 7 pm 3 8 dynamic nitrous oxide behaviour the complexity and dynamics of nitrous oxide emissions is illustrated in fig 11 net production of nitrous oxide as well as net consumption of nitrous oxide was visible in the online measurements the first batch started marker 1 without any nitrous oxide in the bulk liquid and therefore also no emission through the off gas at the start of the aeration phase at the start of the aeration the dissolved oxygen concentration increased and a first peak of nitrous oxide emission could be observed marker 2 also a simultaneous decrease of the nitrate concentration was observed caused by mixing of the nitrate remaining from the previous batch with newly fed influent low in nitrate when the dissolved oxygen concentration increased further the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid and off gas decreased again marker 2 to 3 in this period the nitrous oxide production rate was lower than the combined effect of stripping through the off gas and denitrification of nitrous oxide further on in the aeration phase the nitrous oxide concentration in both the bulk liquid and the off gas increased marker 3 towards the end of the aeration phase the dissolved oxygen concentration was lowered marker 4 and a sudden increase of the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid was seen hereafter the aeration and thus mixing was stopped allowing the biomass to settle marker 5 the reactor was ready to receive the next influent batch marker 5 during the feeding marker 5 to 6 the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid stayed constant because the sensor was situated at the top of the reactor and the sludge bed had settled to the bottom of the reactor there was no sludge present in the top layer and no biological processes occured in the top part of the reactor after this feeding phase the aeration phase started again and the nitrous oxide concentration dropped due to mixing before the production started again marker 7 halfway through the reaction phase the oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid was lowered marker 8 this led to a period where the production of nitrate was limited but ammonium was still being converted thus optimizing for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification after lowering of the oxygen concentration a similar although lower initial increase of the nitrous oxide could be seen marker 9 as was visible in the previous batch marker 2 at the end of this second batch the nitrous oxide was almost completely removed 10 the process control used here automatically balances nitrification and denitrification to optimize simultaneous nitrification and denitrification to get a maximum total nitrogen removal this was done by dynamically altering the dissolved oxygen set point and sometimes this resulted in a drop of the oxygen concentration in the reaction phase as previously described in fig 12 an example of this behaviour is shown this seems to trigger a nitrous oxide production response when the oxygen concentration dropped 1 the nitrous oxide production in the bulk liquid and the off gas increased 2 on the 24th of february the process control was changed to a fixed oxygen set point 2 5 mg l 1 during the reaction phase with the reaction phase being split up in an aeration phase and an unaerated post denitrification phase this had an immediate effect on the nitrous oxide production an example of a batch under this new process control is shown in fig 13 during the reaction phase almost no nitrous oxide was produced only when the aeration was stopped in the post denitrification phase some nitrous oxide was produced but this did not lead to any emission because the aeration was switched off and the nitrous oxide was denitrified before the end of the cycle this change led to a decrease of the emission factor to 0 15 during the three weeks this process control was used the nitrogen removal also changed slightly by the change in the process control the average ammonium effluent concentration was 10 higher 3 2 mg l 1 after the change compared to 2 9 mg l 1 before the change the average nitrate effluent concentration was similar under both process controls 5 3 mg l 1 the snd efficiency over the whole period was 69 15 it was 58 12 after the change compared to 70 15 before the change a typical rwf event is shown in fig 14 when the flow towards the wwtp increased because of rainy weather a first flush arrived at the wwtp increasing the ammonium load in the reactor the load in this batch was too high for the aeration capacity and the reduced aeration duration leaving some elevated levels of ammonium in the effluent the process control focussed mainly on nitrification aerating the system at maximum capacity little nitrous oxide is formed in this batch in the two batches hereafter the load returned to normal levels but still the focus was mainly on nitrification in these batches little nitrous oxide was formed when the rwf event was finished and the flow to the wwtp returned to normal the cycle times lengthened again but still the emission of nitrous oxides remained close to zero 4 discussion 4 1 long term nitrous oxide emissions this study is the first long term campaign measuring nitrous oxide emissions of a full scale ags reactor treating sewage a nereda reactor at the wastewater treatment plant of dinxperlo the netherlands was monitored for 7 consecutive months in this period an average emission factor of 0 33 was measured this means that 0 33 of the incoming nitrogen load was emitted as nitrous oxide with the off gas the daily averaged emission factor ranged from 0 02 to 1 58 these values are comparable to the values found in previous short term nereda research roest et al 2012 the average value found in the short term research 0 7 are higher than the average value found in the current research but the value of 0 7 is well within the variability of this long term study stressing the importance of long term research since the emission was measured for only 7 months the higher winter values contribute proportionately strong in the average value presented a 12 month yearly averaged emission factor is estimated to be in the range of 0 25 to 0 30 compared to conventional activated sludge cas systems the values obtained fall well within the reported ranges in literature for example in a study investigating seven cas plants in australia the emission factor ranged between 0 6 and 25 3 based on the kilograms of nitrogen denitrified foley et al 2010 another study performing short term measurements in 12 plants in the united states showed an emission factor ranging from 0 01 to 1 5 ahn et al 2010 more recently a long term measurement campaign in switzerland showed an emission factor for the cas system of 1 6 2 0 while a flocculent sludge sbr system showed an emission factor of 2 4 gruber et al 2020 an overview of the emission factors for different wastewater treatment systems adapted from vasilaki et al 2019 is shown fig 15 this underlines that the values found in this study are comparable to most other wastewater treatment systems but are considerably lower than the values generally reported for sequencing batch reactors sbr systems this is remarkable since the ags system used in this study is operated as an sbr this shows high emission factors are not intrinsic to sbr systems and that the correct process conditions can also lead to low emission factors 4 2 seasonal and diurnal variations for cas systems a strong seasonal effect has been reported for the emission factor daelman et al 2015 gruber et al 2020 showing higher emissions at lower temperatures or increasing temperatures in early spring in this study a seasonal effect is also visible as can be seen in figs 5 and 9 the variability of the nitrous oxide emission increases when the water temperature drops below 14 c in december at temperatures above 14 c the emission factor per batch varies between 0 and 0 5 while below 14 c the emission factor ranges between 0 and 2 5 contradictorily march shows the lowest monthly emission factor 0 15 at the lowest average temperature of 9 7 c this difference may be caused by a change in process control in march daelman et al 2015 suggested this seasonal effect was primarily caused by an increase of no2 concentrations in early spring in the current study effluent nitrite concentrations were consistently low with an average value of 0 05 mg l 1 table 1 although nitrite concentrations were not measured during the cycle elevated levels of nitrite during the cycle would also at least partially have ended up in the effluent since this was not the case here no major effect of nitrite on the nitrous oxide emissions is expected the drop in the temperature in december was related to the inflow of melting snow and in 4 days the water temperature in the reactor dropped from 13 c to 8 c at these low temperatures of 8 c the nitrification rates dropped considerably but the ammonium effluent concentration was still below the consent value at the same time the nitrous oxide concentrations in both off gas and bulk liquid were almost zero or below the detection limit for several days until the temperature increased again above 9 c in the week before this event the variability of the emission factor was already increasing but after this event the variability of the emission factor of nitrous oxide further increased after the water temperature was recovered to temperatures above 10 c a diurnal pattern is observed in the data fig 10 the batches starting between 4h and 14h show a lower average emission factor than the batches starting between 15h and 3h the relation is not as clear as for cas systems daelman et al 2015 which is mainly caused by the fact that the ags reactor is a batch system running about 4 batches per day which does not give a high resolution over the day as in cas systems the lowest average emission is found between 3h and 15h it is uncertain what causes this but variations in batch loading may play a role since the reactors are operated with a fixed cycle time of 6 hours during dwf conditions the volumetric exchange ratio is lower if the total flow to the wastewater treatment plant is lower 4 3 nitrous oxide in the cycle nitrous oxide can be produced by both nitrification and by denitrification kampschreur et al 2008 wunderlin et al 2012 ammonia oxidising bacteria can produce nitrous oxide from oxidation of hydroxylamine and from denitrification of nitrite under oxygen deprived circumstances denitrification can be both a source and a sink for nitrous oxide conthe et al 2019 nitrous oxide is also an intermediate in the heterotrophic denitrification of nitrate at the same time nitrous oxide can be removed by denitrification conthe et al 2019 in aerobic granular sludge nitrification and denitrification happen simultaneously during the aeration phase which make it difficult to distinguish nitrous oxide production from nitrification and denitrification during the aeration phase de kreuk et al 2005 nevertheless there seems to be clear evidence that both processes contribute to the production of nitrous oxides in most batches there is no dissolved nitrous oxide present at the start of the cycle in these cycles nitrous oxide production coincides with the conversion of ammonium and the production of nitrate fig 11 at marker 3 often a peak of nitrous oxide at the start of the aeration phase is observed fig 11 at marker 2 this peak seems to be caused by denitrification of nitrate left over from the previous cycle because nitrification has not started yet it is not clear if nitrous oxide is produced by partial denitrification caused by lack of cod at the end of the previous cycle or by rapid denitrification on readily biodegradable cod from the fresh influent in both cases the increase of the nitrous oxide concentration is primarily caused by mixing of the reactor aeration and the decrease seems to be primarily caused by denitrification of nitrous oxides on readily biodegradable cod although in the latter case stripping of nitrous oxide also plays a role it is likely that denitrification acts more as a sink for nitrous oxide at the start of the cycle after feeding and that denitrification acts more as a source for nitrous oxide at the end of the cycle when most cod from the feeding phase both storage polymers in the sludge and cod in the bulk liquid is consumed that would implicate the nitrous oxide production observed when nitrification starts as a net production rate resulting from production by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and denitrification by heterotrophic organisms understanding the mechanisms and when nitrous oxide production exceeds consumption could be important for the development of nitrous oxide emission control strategies the dissolved oxygen concentration is considered an important parameter to control nitrous oxide emissions and concentrations below 1 mg l 1 during nitrification would stimulate nitrifier denitrification due to oxygen limitation kampschreur et al 2009 oxygen limitation in biofilms is a well known factor even under higher oxygen concentrations ødegaard et al 1994 it is therefore not surprising that lower oxygen concentrations seem to result in higher nitrous oxide emissions in fig 11 and fig 12 an increase of the nitrous oxide emission can be seen if the dissolved oxygen concentration drops below 1 mg l 1 a decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration will also shift the process to denitrification because the size of the anoxic zone within the aerobic granules will increase de kreuk et al 2005 since this decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration mostly happens towards the end of the reaction phase denitrification might act more as a source than a sink of nitrous oxide as carbon availability is low this would result in a double effect on the nitrous oxide emission both the nitrifier pathway and the denitrifier pathway could increase nitrous oxide production in this situation a clear effect of rain events is shown in fig 14 rain events cause the batch size to increase because more water arrives at the wwtp in total 173 batches 18 were classified as rwf batches these batches had an average emission factor of 0 09 which is less than one third of the 0 33 found for all batches the reason for these lower emissions during rwf conditions is uncertain but there are several processes influencing the emission factor during rwf under rwf conditions the flow to the wwtp increases from 0 175 m3 h during dwf conditions to up to 600 m3 h under rwf conditions since the reactor is operated as a sequencing batch reactor the scheduling needs to be adapted to handle the increased inflow of wastewater chen et al 2020 this is done by decreasing the total cycle time and running more batches per day this leads to shorter more intense aeration phases with higher oxygen concentrations on average the aeration phase during rwf is 35 minutes shorter than during dwf secondly rwf batches can be split in two groups at the start of a rain event a first flush arrives at the wwtp due to the presence of pressure pipelines in the sewer the load exceeds the aeration capacity leading to incomplete nitrification and thus less potential for nitrous oxide production after this initial peak load the load returns to a more average value but the aeration remains relatively short and intense focussing on nitrification the lack of cycle time during rwf results in an increased nitrate effluent concentration 1 7 mg l 1 under dwf conditions and 4 4 mg l 1 under rwf conditions the total snd efficiency on average was 69 15 but was slightly lower during rwf 65 13 compared to dwf 70 15 but during dwf batches snd happens at lower dissolved oxygen concentrations it also appears that the rwf event influences the dwf batches following the rwf event fig 14 5 and 6 in these dwf batches nitrous oxide emissions are close to zero this might be the result of the first flush at the start of the rain event which results in a high sludge loading a high sludge load will result in higher storage polymer concentration in the granular biomass in this specific batch which might stretch out to the following batches this leads to more denitrification capability of the plant it appears that the denitrification process in these batches acts mainly as a sink for nitrous oxide denitrifying nitrous oxide at a higher rate than it is produced eventually the positive effect of the higher sludge loading will dissipate and normal nitrous oxide emissions will return the nitrous oxide concentrations in the bulk liquid are seldom higher than 0 3 mg l 1 and in most cases the concentration at the end of the cycle is close to zero this means that in most cycles the denitrification capacity of nitrous oxide is also present towards the end of the cycle this study observed nitrous oxide conversion rates up to 1 mg n2o n l 1 h 1 this rate is a net rate because it happens simultaneously with denitrification of nitrate which also can produce nitrous oxide as an intermediate product in most cases in less than 30 minutes of anoxic conditions all nitrous oxide in the bulk liquid is denitrified this suggests a high nitrous oxide conversion potential is present if the right conditions are met 4 4 effect of process control the nitrous oxide emission factors varied between 0 02 and 1 58 per day most of the batches being below 0 5 the emission of nitrous oxide might be lowered by changing the process control the decrease of the emission factor from 0 57 in february to 0 15 in march by changing the process control to a fixed aeration strategy is an example of this a more stable dissolve oxygen concentration during the aeration phase led to a remarkable decrease in the emission of nitrous oxide on the other hand the process control focusing on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification did not lead to elevated nitrous oxide emission in the summer period different process control strategies may be necessary during summer and winter conditions to limit nitrous oxide emission under all conditions it also seems that the production of nitrous oxide during the cycle is increasing when the do drops below 1 mg l 1 this could be easily prevented by adjusting the process control as to not allow for the oxygen to dip below the required set point another potential improvement relates to the initial peak at the start of the aeration fig 11 this initial peak could be prevented by adding a pre denitrification phase to the cycle aiming to remove this residual nitrate simultaneously removing the nitrous oxide formed during settling and feeding another option is to focus on post denitrification to prevent high amounts of residual nitrate to be present in the next cycle thereby limiting the nitrous oxide emission peak compared with a continuously fed activated sludge system an sbr system gives a much higher information density on the changes in nitrous oxide production and consumption this gives the possibility to develop effective process control strategies to minimize the nitrous oxide emissions a maximum nitrous oxide concentration of 0 3 mg l 1 and a net denitrification rate up to 1 mg l 1 h 1 was measured this would mean that a denitrification phase of 20 minutes should be enough to remove nitrous oxide from the water phase in most cases splitting the main aeration phase and adding one or more intermediate denitrification steps could be an effective measure to minimize nitrous oxide emission 4 5 difference with conventional sbr systems the ags reactor was operated as a sequencing batch reactor a comparison with flocculent sbr systems is therefore of interest as shown in fig 15 regular sbr systems have shown to have higher emission factors than continuously fed activated sludge systems high nitrous oxide emissions in sbrs are attributed to sudden changes in the concentrations of ammonium nitrate and nitrite within the cycle or to accumulated dissolved nitrous oxide during anoxic settling and decanting in the subsequent aerobic phase vasilaki et al 2019 these conventional sbr systems show emission factors up to 5 6 which is much higher than the value of 0 33 found in this study this might be caused by differences in process conditions the feeding in the ags process is strictly anaerobic which is achieved by plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor by this plug flow the nitrate remaining in the reactor from the previous cycle is pushed upwards while the reactor is filled with fresh influent from the bottom this limits the contact between sludge cod and nitrate preventing production of high levels of nitrous oxide during the feeding phase while anaerobic plug flow feeding is a requirement in ags systems it is uncommon in sbr systems for example in a study by rodriguez caballero et al 2015 the sbr reactors were alternatingly fed anoxically and aerobically resulting in an emission factor of 6 4 4 6 comparison water phase and gas phase measurement the nitrous oxide concentration was measured by two different methods firstly by measuring the nitrous oxide concentration in the bulk liquid by means of an online sensor and secondly by measuring the nitrous oxide concentrations in the off gas via a gas analyser the latter has the benefit of measuring the emission during aeration directly without the need for converting water phase concentration into emissions to the air the downside of the off gas method is the lack of information about what happens during the anaerobic and the anoxic phase when the aeration is turned off the water phase sensor gives direct insight into the production of nitrous oxide in the anoxic phase and the denitrification of nitrous oxide in the anoxic phase the water phase sensor thus provides information that otherwise would be lost or obscured by other nitrous oxide forming processes during aeration for the use in process control both methods can be used but the water phase sensor is likely more effective as it also gives information about the non aerated phases 5 conclusions a seven month measurement campaign of the emission of nitrous oxide was performed in the nereda reactor of dinxperlo the netherlands key findings include an average nitrous oxide emission factor of 0 33 0 0033 mg nitrous oxide n mg tninfluent was found over a 7 month measuring campaign spanning summer and winter the yearly average emission factor was estimated between 0 25 and 0 30 the emission factor was comparable with continuously fed activated sludge plants with low emissions and lower than values found for conventional sbr systems both nitrification and denitrification appeared to contribute to the nitrous oxide production denitrification acting both as a source and a sink for nitrous oxide post denitrification significantly reduced the nitrous oxide concentration in the reactor an increased variability of the emission factor was observed at low temperatures different process control between summer and winter could limit the emission factor in the winter period aeration on a fixed oxygen setpoint reduced the emission factor compared to aeration using variable oxygen setpoint a temporary increase of the sludge loading decreased the emission factor for several batches declaration of competing interest the

17014,uv254 irradiation disinfection is a commonly used method to inactivate pathogenic viruses in water and wastewater treatment model prediction method can serve as a pre screening tool to quickly

calgua et al 2014 these results suggest the possible applicability of predicting the fluence based rate constants of virus infectivity loss so far few studies have been conducted to predict the genome damage rate constants of dna rna in viruses based on genomic information and to explore if the predicted values have good connection with the infectivity loss rate constants the aim of this study was to apply an improved base composition model to estimate the photolysis kinetics of viral genomes and to explore its feasibility to predict the infectivity loss for different types of viruses upon uv254 irradiation to achieve this purpose firstly a database containing the infectivity loss rate constants for 102 viruses was established based on the literature data secondly the prediction model developed by wigginton s group was improved qiao et al 2018 and the model parameters including ɛ254 and φ254 were collected from the literatures and justified to use for the prediction model thirdly to verify the feasibility of the model the prediction model was applied to estimate the photolysis rate constants of genome regions and was validated by comparing with the experimentally photolysis rate constants for genome regions obtained by using qpcr lastly the prediction model was applied to estimate the photolysis rate constants of entire viral genome and establish the correlations between predicted rate constants and viral infectivity loss rate constants potential applications of the results were discussed with respect to providing a prescreening tool on the virus control strategy and a basis for the selection of indicator virus in water and wastewater treatment one additional merit of this study is that the accumulated literature assessment of microbial inactivation data is valued

ε254 and φ254 values had great variation in different studies the slight changes in their values can cause great variation in the predicted rate constants due to the large number of bases in dna or rna qiao et al 2018 yoon et al 2018 the molar absorption coefficients for nucleic acids were generally reported at 260 nm ε260 and the ε260 values in the nearest neighbor model considering the interactions between neighbor bases were used to calculate ε254 values text s2 and table s1 tataurov et al 2008 the φ254 values obtained from the literatures had some variations this could be due to the different methods used in analyzing photoproducts e g spectroscopy or chromatography different target genome sequences e g short oligomers or full dna rna and so on we surveyed the literature results and chose to use the median or average φ254 values with details provided in text s2 and table s2 briefly eight φ254 values for tt dimer ranging from 0 012 to 0 032 have been found from the literatures despite the large variations five values from 0 019 to 0 022 were close to 0 020 the median value thus the median value of 0 020 was used as φ254 value for tt dimer for tc dimer only one value 0 015 was available from the study of douki 2006 in consideration of their well designed study and using liquid chromatograph to make the quantification to reduce the photoproducts interferences we feel appropriate to use 0 015 as the φ254 for tc dimer for ct cc and uu dimers average φ254 values were used which were 0 009 0 00067 and 0 0074 respectively the φ254 values for photohydrate in single and double stranded dna have been known to be different gorner 1994 grossman and rodgers 1968 gurzadyan et al 1993 the average φ254 values of 0 00087 and 0 00024 were used for c hydrate in ssdna and dsdna respectively unfortunately the information on u hydrate formation was very limited and the φ254 value of 0 00495 was used for u hydrate in both ssrna and dsrna it should be noted that the φ254 values for c hydrate and u hydrate are largely scattered table s2 which may result in inevitable errors in the prediction model the percentage of nucleic acid hydration or dimerization

and positive correlation respectively it is useful for assessing the model performance with values close to 1 indicating better performance here p corr 0 55 was considered acceptable and p corr 0 85 and 0 7 p corr 0 85 were considered good and fair performance respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 virus infectivity loss calculated from literature values in total the virus infectivity loss information from 115 papers were collected for 102 viruses including 2 dsrna viruses 65 ssrna viruses 33 dsdna viruses and 2 ssdna viruses with details listed in the supporting information figure s2 si excel notably the majority of waterborne viruses have ssrna and dsdna genomes calgua et al 2014 the fluence based virus infectivity loss rate constants k exp infectivity from the literatures are categorized into groups and presented in fig 1 a and table s3 please note that some circles are overlapped due to their close k exp infectivity values and the k exp infectivity value for each virus is listed in si excel the k exp infectivity values for the two dsrna viruses φ6 dsrna phage family and rotavirus reoviridae family were 0 067 cm2 mj 1 and 0 224 cm2 mj 1 respectively the k exp infectivity values for φx174 ssdna phage family and porcine parvovirus parvoviridae family ssdna viruses were 0 917 cm2 mj 1 and 1 020 cm2 mj 1 respectively k exp infectivity varied significantly in ssrna viruses 0 032 3 210 cm2 mj 1 and dsdna viruses 0 016 3 490 cm2 mj 1 with median values of 0 273 and 0 233 cm2 mj 1 respectively table s3 among the ssrna viruses viruses belonging to retroviridae family and ssrna phage had the lowest k exp infectivity 0 125 cm2 mj 1 dsdna viruses having the lowest k exp infectivity 0 473 cm2 mj 1 belong to adenoviridae and papovaviridae family fig 1a the required uv254 dose to achieve 2 log infectivity loss of various viruses were calculated with results shown in fig 1b a uv254 dose of 20 mj cm 2 is generally effective to inactive viruses belonging to diverse families but for viruses such as adenovirus type 5 and adenovirus type 41 adenoviridae family and jc polyomavirus and simian virus 40 papovaviridae family that were difficult to be inactivated a uv254 dose higher than 80 mj cm 2 was required to achieve 2 log infectivity loss a uv254 dose higher than 37 mj cm 2 was necessary for 2 log inactivation of ms2 an indicator virus it should be noted that the average value for the same virus from multiple inactivation tests was used as k exp infectivity as presented in si excel in fact the variation on the virus infectivity loss rate constants was observable which was dependent on the experimental conditions such as ph and buffer conditions for example adenovirus type 2 exhibited a higher inactivation rate at ph of 8 0 than ph of 7 0 baxter et al 2007 calgua et al 2014 and adenovirus type 5 was found to be inactivated 1 5 times faster at ph of 8 5 than at ph 7 0 baxter et al 2007 rattanakul et al 2015 individual virus in suspension may be induced to aggregate when the ph decreased due to the elimination of repulsive electrostatic force which increased the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants clark 1968 hoff and akin 1986 mattle et al 2011 additionally several studies have shown that better inactivation efficiency on coxsackievirus echovirus feline calicivirus and phage φx174 was observed in phosphate buffer solution than in sterilized estuarine water or tap water de roda husman et al 2004 gerba et al 2002 rockey et al 2020 rodríguez et al 2014 sommer et al 2001 in this study single k exp infectivity value for each virus was applied for simplification the k exp infectivity values were also compared for non enveloped viruses and enveloped viruses figure s3 the median values of k exp infectivity for non enveloped ssrna viruses and dsdna viruses were 0 198 and 0 068 cm2 mj 1 respectively and the corresponding enveloped ones were 0 661 and 1 064 cm2 mj 1 respectively although the non enveloped viruses seemed statistically to be more resistant to uv254 irradiation than the enveloped ones blazquez et al 2019 mohr et al 2009 ye et al 2018 the k exp infectivity values were rather scattered among the enveloped and non enveloped groups additionally for the same virus group but with varying genome sequences k exp infectivity also varied for example the k exp infectivity values for adenovirus type 1 and type 4 having 79 similar genome sequences was 0 0590 and 0 0887 cm2 mj 1 respectively the k exp infectivity values for adenovirus type 1 type 2 and type 5 were quite similar which were 0 0590 0 0576 and 0 0547 cm2 mj 1 respectively as they shared similar genome sequences 98 indentical supporting information si excel these results suggest that the possible applicability of predicting fluence based virus infectivity loss based on the geome sequences 3 2 validation of the prediction model using genome regions before going ahead to predict the fluence based photolysis rate constants for the whole genomes in viruses we firstly predicted the fluence based photolysis rate constants for genome regions and compared with the experimental ones obtained using qpcr whose results directly reflected the genome changes the photolysis rate constants for different genome regions from qpcr analysis were summarized in table s4 the tested genome regions in viruses had base numbers ranging from 81 to 1126 and the viral genomes were composed of ssrna phage ms2 human norovirus coxsackievirus b5 echovirus 11 and poliovirus 1 dsrna phage φ6 dsdna phage t3 and ssdna phage φx174 respectively fig 2 shows the relationship between the model predicted photolysis rate constants of genome regions k pred region and the experimentally measured ones using qpcr k exp region in general the model achieved fair performance for the genome regions in ssrna ssdna and dsdna viruses p corr 0 79 for ssrna and ssdna viruses k exp region exhibited good consistency with k pred region that majority 92 of the k pred region k exp region ratios for genome regions were in the range 1 2 to 2 for dsdna viruses the k pred region of two regions of phage t3 were 2 66 and 2 88 times of the k exp region respectively it should be noted that k exp region were obtained in buffered solution at ph 7 0 7 5 and the prediction model did not consider the solution chemistry according to qiao et al 2018 the photolysis rate constant of free dsrna genome region was affected the most by the presence of phosphate buffer possibly due to the more ordered structures than in ultrapure water additionally the k pred region for genome regions of dsrna virus phage φ6 was far from the k exp region si excel it could be due to the inappropriate φ254 values used in the prediction model eqs 2 3 as the parameters for dsrna table s2 were not extensively studied specifically the φ254 value for u hydrate for dsrna was not found from the literatures and the value from ssrna was used therefore prediction for infectivity loss rate constants of dsrna viruses was not made later in this study overall the results shown in fig 2 suggest that the prediction model works satisfying for different viral genomes ssrna dsdna and ssdna 3 3 prediction of photolysis rate constants of entire viral genomes as mentioned in the introduction viral genome damage has been reported to be the primary disinfection mechanism leading to the loss of virus infectivity upon uv254 irradiation ayala torres et al 2000 hegedüs et al 2003 pecson et al 2011 and applicability of the model for predicting the fluence based photolysis rate constants of genome regions was verified as described above and also in the previous studies he et al 2019 qiao et al 2018 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 thus the predicted fluence based photolysis rate constants of the whole viral genomes k pred genome were calculated using eqs 2 4 and compared with the virus infectivity loss rate constants k exp infectivity from the literatures the 2 dsrna viruses were not included due to the poor performance of the model data not shown fig 3 shows the k pred genome and k exp infectivity values for the ssrna ssdna and dsdna viruses for viruses with multiple infectivity loss rate constants the average values were used as k exp infectivity overall the prediction was considered satisfactory for the 100 viruses with p corr of 0 64 for ssrna viruses p corr 0 57 indicated acceptable performance and 69 of the k pred genome k exp infectivity ratios fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 for those ssrna viruses with low k exp infectivity values 0 20 cm2 mj 1 the k pred genome tended to be higher than k exp infectivity figure s5 as an indicator virus ms2 has been extensively studied and 41 infectivity loss rate constants have been collected si excel the k pred genome value was 0 282 cm2 mj 1 which was higher than the k exp infectivity value 0 125 cm2 mj 1 for the two ssdna viruses porcine parvovirus and phage φx174 k pred genome also showed close values with k exp infectivity k pred genome k exp infectivity 0 36 and 0 64 respectively for dsdna viruses the model achieved good performance p corr 0 90 and 73 of the k pred genome k exp infectivity ratios fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 dsdna viruses with low k exp infectivity values 0 10 cm2 mj 1 dominantly adenoviridae family had k pred genome k exp infectivity ratios higher than 3 this may be due to that the correction factor f as 30 used in the prediction model was inappropriate for adenoviridae family adenovirus has been reported to be the most resistant known human pathogen to uv disinfection linden et al 2007 thurston enriquez et al 2003 rodríguez also found that the reduction in viral infectivity was significantly lower than the amount of dna damage observed after exposure to uv254 rodríguez et al 2013 furthermore the virus infectivity rate constants were normalized by the number of bases in the entire viral genome k exp infectivity n and the photolysis rate constants of the regions were normalized by the number of bases tested in the qpcr amplicon k exp region n table s5 the median k exp region n values followed the order of ssdna 1 54 10 4 cm2 mj 1 base 1 ssrna 3 60 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 dsdna 3 42 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 which was consistent with qiao et al 2018 the k exp infectivity n values were also compared with k exp region n in order to identify the consistency between the viral infectivity and genome damages on a single base level as shown in fig 4 for ssrna k exp region n for the 42 ssrna regions was in the range of 1 62 10 5 to 1 27 10 4 cm2 mj 1 base 1 with a median value of 3 60 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 whereas k exp infectivity n was in the range of 6 81 10 6 to 1 84 10 4 cm2 mj 1 base 1 with the median value of k exp infectivity n was 4 58 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 statistically no difference existed between k exp region n and k exp infectivity n p 0 2 for dsdna the median value of k exp region n 3 42 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 was 10 times higher than that of k exp infectivity n 3 16 10 6 cm2 mj 1 base 1 the difference in k exp region n and k exp infectivity n for ssrna was much less than that of dsdna the numbers of dsrna and ssdna viruses were rather small and the limited datasets showed no statistically difference of k exp infectivity n and k exp region n p 0 05 it should be noted that the normalized rate constants k exp infectivity n and k exp region n were both based on the experimental data and the results also support that the virus infectivity loss rate constants are generally consistent with the genome photolysis rate constants for ssrna viruses but are much lower than the genome photolysis rates for dsdna viruses the dna repair mechanism may partially account for this observation hijnen et al 2006 it has been reported that the photolyases in cells can repair the damaged dna in the viruses li et al 2010 stuchebrukhov 2011 yi and he 2013 and this may result in recovery of viral infectivity kelner 1949 additionally many of the dsdna viruses had very long sequences 100k base pairs and the formation of a single photoproduct e g tt or tc dimer in dsdna may not necessarily affect its ability to infect the cells 3 4 limitations of the model there are some limitations of the prediction model firstly the values of quantum yields had very large variation in the literatures and the quantum yields for some reactions e g c hydration and u hydration are very limited additionally the quantum yields also varied with ph temperature and ionic strength but the datasets were very limited brown and johns 1968 douki 2006 gorner 1994 or not available and their changes at different testing conditions were not considered in the model precisely measuring quantum yields under water treatment related conditions is highly desirable secondly the model is a simplified one with theoretical calculations the photolysis reactions occurring in the dna and rna can be much more complicated and are affected by their sequences and conformation for example although tt was known to be photolyzed in dna the formation rates of tt cpd were highly dependent on the adjacent bases when tt was buried with two g in a sequence i e gttg tt became uv resistant and no tt cpd was formed kundu et al 2004 other than the formation of cpd 6 4 pp and photohydrate products upon uv irradiation strand breaks interstrand crosslinks and protein nucleic acid linkages also occur and they are not considered in the prediction model due to their low quantum yields gorner 1994 sinha and hader 2002 thirdly virus inactivation is complicated and the specific mechanisms that lead to virus inactivation are also unclear wigginton et al 2012 the loss of virus infection involves three essential virus functions the binding to the host cell injection of viral dna rna into the host cell and replication of dna rna mathieu et al 2019 wigginton et al 2012 thus the infectivity loss rate is a sum of the loss rate of binding genome injection and replication wigginton et al 2012 the damages of rna in ms2 were found to mainly reflect the loss of replication step the damages of viral proteins affected the loss in binding and injection functions wigginton et al 2012 although the damage rates of capsid proteins was generally small e g 0 0025 cm2 mj 1 for ms2 and 0 0017 0 0026 cm2 mj 1 for φ6 sigstam et al 2013 ye et al 2018 the loss in genome injection was observed e g 0 015 cm2 mj 1 for ms2 wigginton et al 2012 furthermore the model also can t predict the tailing effects during uv254 inactivation of viruses 3 5 implications we understand that the estimated infectivity loss rates have some deviation due to the limitation of the model and the complicated structures and photolysis mechanisms of viruses we believe that this prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of uv irradiation for emerging and unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment for example the predicted photolysis rate constants k pred of sars cov 2 nc 045512 ssrna virus based on eqs 2 3 was 3 168 cm2 mj 1 conservatively using 1 2k pred a uv dose of 3 mj cm 2 is able to achieve a 2 log removal without considering the uv attenuation in water according to the latest report from national emerging infectious disease laboratories neidl a uv c dose of 5 mj cm 2 achieved a 2 log removal of sars cov 2 techjuice news 2020 this agreed with our prediction that is to say the uv doses generally applied in water and wastewater treatment process 40 100 mj cm 2 are able to effectively inactivate sars cov 2 it should be noted that assessment of dose response data with infectivity assays will be the golden standard to protect human health by application of uv technology the prediction model is far from being applicable for calculations of field data on the inactivation of viruses in water treatment but is rather used as a prescreening tool and enable calculation the inactivation efficiency of operational uv disinfection for viruses in water the photodamage of genomes in dsdna viruses does not necessarily lead to the virus infectivity loss from the aspects of both photolysis rates of genomes and virus infectivity loss single strand nucleic acid was more photoreactive than the double strand lytle and sagripanti 2005 which is also supported by fig 3 in fact among the 13 viruses having the low infectivity loss rate constants 0 1 cm2 mj 1 8 were dsdna viruses including simian virus 40 5 2k base pairs 0 034 cm2 mj 1 and jc polyomavirus 5 1k base pairs 0 043 cm2 mj 1 adenovirus 34k 36k base pairs 0 049 0 088 cm2 mj 1 and so on see the supporting information si excel though the infectivity loss rate constants don t necessarily relate with genome length dsdna viruses with relatively short genome sizes e g 40k base pairs deserve attention due to their photoresistance this study has summarized the uv254 inactivation data for 102 viruses covering diverse virus families table s6 this accumulated literature data on the virus inactivation kinetics can be used in quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for the water industry and treatment design to determine the efficacy of a uv fluence in the inactivation of the range of reported viruses in addition this database may provide insights for the selection of potential non pathogenic surrogates for pathogenic viruses or emerging viruses in water treatment ms2 phage family is commonly used as an indicator virus to evaluate the degree of virus inactivation by uv254 disinfection based on the averaged ms2 infectivity loss rate constants of 0 125 cm2 mj 1 ranging from 0 066 to 0 319 cm2 mj 1 ms2 was more resistant than 82 of the 102 viruses fig 1 the viruses being more resistant than ms2 included phage φ6 dsrna and enterobacteria phage ga ssrna flaviviridae hepatitis c ssrna retroviridae viruses ssrna adenoviridae viruses dsdna and papovaviridae viruses dsdna thus suitable surrogates for accessing the inactivation of these viruses should be selected for further studies 4 conclusions the experimental infectivity loss rate constants k exp infectivity of 102 viruses i e 2 dsrna 65 ssrna 33 dsdna and 2 ssdna viruses upon uv254 irradiation collected from the literature varied in the range of 0 016 to 3 49 cm2 mj 1 in consideration of the viral genome damage as the primary disinfection mechanism leading to the loss of virus infectivity upon uv254 irradiation an improved base composition model was applied to predict the fluence based photolysis rate constants of viral genomes k pred genome and is used to estimate virus infectivity loss rate constants the model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to uv254 irradiation except dsrna viruses p corr 0 64 about 70 of the k pred genome values fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 of the k exp infectivity values due to the limitations of the model this prediction method is rather used as a

17014,uv254 irradiation disinfection is a commonly used method to inactivate pathogenic viruses in water and wastewater treatment model prediction method can serve as a pre screening tool to quickly estimate the effectiveness of uv254 irradiation on emerging or unculturable viruses in this study an improved prediction model was applied to estimate uv254 photolysis kinetics of viral genomes k pred genome based on the genome sequences and their photoreactivity and to correlate with the experimental virus infectivity loss kinetics k exp infectivity the uv254 inactivation data of 102 viruses including 2 dsrna 65 ssrna 33 dsdna and 2 ssdna viruses were collected from the published experimental data with k exp infectivity ranging from 0 016 to 3 49 cm2 mj 1 the model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to uv254 irradiation except dsrna viruses pearson s correlation coefficient 0 64 and 70 of k pred genome fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 times of k exp infectivity the positive deviation of the model often occurred for photoresistant viruses with low k exp infectivity less than 0 20 cm2 mj 1 e g adenovirus papovaviridae and retroviridae we also applied this model to predict the uv254 inactivation rate of sars cov 2 k pred genome 3 168 cm2 mj 1 and a uv dose of 3 mj cm 2 seemed to be able to achieve a 2 log removal by conservative calculation

behavior of nucleic acid components and composition of the genomes are gaining increasing interests virus inactivation tests were generally conducted using virus culture methods to examine the numbers of infectious viruses before and after treatment however culture experiments are difficult to carry out for emerging viruses with strong infectivity e g novel coronavirus sars cov 2 and unculturable virus e g norovirus for example handling sars cov 2 requires biosafety level 3 bsl 3 laboratories so far several models have been used to predict the fluence based genome photolysis rates upon uv254 irradiation lytle and sagripanti firstly proposed a genomic model to correlate with the uv susceptibility of viruses based on the genome size and composition lytle and sagripanti 2005 later kowalski s group developed a model to calculate the dimerization value based on the numbers of specific genome sequences and their dimer proportionality constants which showed good correlation with uv susceptibility of ssrna and dsdna viruses kowalski et al 2009 recently the molar absorption coefficient ɛ254 and quantum yields φ254 have been included in the prediction model as the two determining

the photolysis rate constants of the genome region were also found to have linear correlations with infectivity loss rate constants for dsdna viruses e g jc polyomaviruses and human adenoviruses 2 calgua et al 2014 these results suggest the possible applicability of predicting the fluence based rate constants of virus infectivity loss so far few studies have been conducted to predict the genome damage rate constants of dna rna in viruses based on genomic information and to explore if the predicted values have good connection with the infectivity loss rate constants the aim of this study was to apply an improved base composition model to estimate the photolysis kinetics of viral genomes and to explore its feasibility to predict the infectivity loss for different types of viruses upon uv254 irradiation to achieve this purpose firstly a database containing the infectivity loss rate constants for 102 viruses was established based on the literature data secondly the prediction model developed by wigginton s group was improved qiao et al 2018 and the model parameters including ɛ254 and φ254 were collected from the literatures and justified to use for the prediction model thirdly to verify the feasibility of the model the prediction model was applied to estimate the photolysis rate constants of genome regions and was validated by comparing with the experimentally photolysis rate constants for genome regions obtained by using qpcr lastly the prediction model was applied to estimate the photolysis rate constants of entire viral genome and establish the correlations between predicted rate constants and viral infectivity loss rate constants potential applications of the results were discussed with respect to providing a prescreening tool on the virus control strategy and a basis for the selection of indicator virus in water and wastewater treatment one additional merit of this study is that the accumulated literature assessment of microbial inactivation data is valued as input data for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for the water industry 2 methods 2 1 literature mining primary data on virus inactivation were collected by extracting data from published articles by searching the bibliographic databases i e scopus using the following phrases virus title abstract and key words and ultraviolet title abstract and key words and inactivation or susceptibility or resistance or sensitivity or survival or infectivity loss title abstract and key words in total 3581 articles have been collected figure s1 then we screened the abstract of each

extracted from studies if they adhered to all of the following criteria viruses were clearly labeled with accession numbers in national center for biotechnology information ncbi infectious viruses were enumerated using culture based methods first order kinetics eq 1 were reported or could be calculated using the reported data for the viruses with tailing effects the kinetic data before the tailing were used to obtain the first order kinetics for viruses with the ln linear equation not crossing the coordinate origin y intercept 0 the slope values were used as well finally 237 data records for 102 viruses in 115 articles were collected a complete list of data is provided in the supporting information si excel the following variables were extracted into standardized forms virus names corresponding accession numbers experimental conditions virus infectivity loss rate constants and numbers of bases or base pairs the viruses were classified based on their genome types ssrna dsrna ssdna and dsdna and structures enveloped and non enveloped the genome sequences of viruses were obtained from genbank in ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov in these published experiments the fluence based rate constants of virus infectivity loss k exp infectivity cm2 mj 1 was generally determined by using cell culture assays according to the following equation eq 1 1 ln c c 0 k exp infectivity d uv 254 where c0 and c are the concentrations of infectious viruses before and after uv254 exposure respectively and duv254 is the uv dose mj cm 2 the k exp infectivity information and the testing conditions such as ph temperature and the type of beam system were listed in si excel for a viruse with many inactivation tests and multiple infectivity loss rate constants the average value was used as k exp infectivity 2 2 the prediction model a base composition model developed by wigginton s group was applied to predict the fluence based photolysis rate constants of nucleic acids

kelner 1949 it is infeasible to make quantitative estimation of the repaired genomes thus a correction factor f is incorporated to simplify the situation eq 4 the f value was set as 30 with details provided in text s3 as such eq 4 is only used for prediction of the photolysis rate constants of whole genome of dsdna viruses for the prediction of the photolysis rate constants of other viruses and the genome regions eq 3 is used 4 k pred 1 f i n k pred i n i 1 f i n 2 303 ε 254 φ 254 u 254 n i the ε254 and φ254 were obtained from the literatures as listed in table 1 it should be noted that both ε254 and φ254 values had great variation in different studies the slight changes in their values can cause great variation in the predicted rate constants due to the large number of bases in dna or rna qiao et al 2018 yoon et al 2018 the molar absorption coefficients for nucleic acids were generally reported at 260 nm ε260 and the ε260 values in the nearest neighbor model considering the interactions between neighbor bases were used to calculate ε254 values text s2 and table s1 tataurov et al 2008 the φ254 values obtained from the literatures had some variations this could be due to the different methods used in analyzing photoproducts e g spectroscopy or chromatography different target genome sequences e g short oligomers or full dna rna and so on we surveyed the literature results and chose to use the median or average φ254 values with details provided in text s2 and table s2 briefly eight φ254 values for tt dimer ranging from 0 012 to 0 032 have been found from the literatures despite the large variations five values from 0 019 to 0 022 were close to 0 020 the median value thus the median value of 0 020 was used as φ254 value for tt dimer for tc dimer only one value 0 015 was available from the study of douki 2006 in consideration of their well designed study and using liquid chromatograph to make the quantification to reduce the photoproducts interferences we feel appropriate to use 0 015 as the φ254 for tc dimer for ct cc and uu dimers average φ254 values were used which were 0 009 0 00067 and 0 0074 respectively the φ254 values for photohydrate in single and double stranded dna have been known to be different gorner 1994 grossman and rodgers 1968 gurzadyan et al 1993 the average φ254 values of 0 00087 and 0 00024 were used for c hydrate in ssdna and dsdna respectively unfortunately the information on u hydrate formation was very limited and the φ254 value of 0 00495 was used for u hydrate in both ssrna and dsrna it should be noted that the φ254 values for c hydrate and u hydrate are largely scattered table s2 which may result in inevitable errors in the prediction model the percentage of nucleic acid hydration or dimerization

and positive correlation respectively it is useful for assessing the model performance with values close to 1 indicating better performance here p corr 0 55 was considered acceptable and p corr 0 85 and 0 7 p corr 0 85 were considered good and fair performance respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 virus infectivity loss calculated from literature values in total the virus infectivity loss information from 115 papers were collected for 102 viruses including 2 dsrna viruses 65 ssrna viruses 33 dsdna viruses and 2 ssdna viruses with details listed in the supporting information figure s2 si excel notably the majority of waterborne viruses have ssrna and dsdna genomes calgua et al 2014 the fluence based virus infectivity loss rate constants k exp infectivity from the literatures are categorized into groups and presented in fig 1 a and table s3 please note that some circles are overlapped due to their close k exp infectivity values and the k exp infectivity value for each virus is listed in si excel the k exp infectivity values for the two dsrna viruses φ6 dsrna phage family and rotavirus reoviridae family were 0 067 cm2 mj 1 and 0 224 cm2 mj 1 respectively the k exp infectivity values for φx174 ssdna phage family and porcine parvovirus parvoviridae family ssdna viruses were 0 917 cm2 mj 1 and 1 020 cm2 mj 1 respectively k exp infectivity varied significantly in ssrna viruses 0 032 3 210 cm2 mj 1 and dsdna viruses 0 016 3 490 cm2 mj 1 with median values of 0 273 and 0 233 cm2 mj 1 respectively table s3 among the ssrna viruses viruses belonging to retroviridae family and ssrna phage had the lowest k exp infectivity 0 125 cm2 mj 1 dsdna viruses having the lowest k exp infectivity 0 473 cm2 mj 1 belong to adenoviridae and papovaviridae family fig 1a the required uv254 dose to achieve 2 log infectivity loss of various viruses were calculated with results shown in fig 1b a uv254 dose of 20 mj cm 2 is generally effective to inactive viruses belonging to diverse families but for viruses such as adenovirus type 5 and adenovirus type 41 adenoviridae family and jc polyomavirus and simian virus 40 papovaviridae family that were difficult to be inactivated a uv254 dose higher than 80 mj cm 2 was required to achieve 2 log infectivity loss a uv254 dose higher than 37 mj cm 2 was necessary for 2 log inactivation of ms2 an indicator virus it should be noted that the average value for the same virus from multiple inactivation tests was used as k exp infectivity as presented in si excel in fact the variation on the virus infectivity loss rate constants was observable which was dependent on the experimental conditions such as ph and buffer conditions for example adenovirus type 2 exhibited a higher inactivation rate at ph of 8 0 than ph of 7 0 baxter et al 2007 calgua et al 2014 and adenovirus type 5 was found to be inactivated 1 5 times faster at ph of 8 5 than at ph 7 0 baxter et al 2007 rattanakul et al 2015 individual virus in suspension may be induced to aggregate when the ph decreased due to the elimination of repulsive electrostatic force which increased the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants clark 1968 hoff and akin 1986 mattle et al 2011 additionally several studies have shown that better inactivation efficiency on coxsackievirus echovirus feline calicivirus and phage φx174 was observed in phosphate buffer solution than in sterilized estuarine water or tap water de roda husman et al 2004 gerba et al 2002 rockey et al 2020 rodríguez et al 2014 sommer et al 2001 in this study single k exp infectivity value for each virus was applied for simplification the k exp infectivity values were also compared for non enveloped viruses and enveloped viruses figure s3 the median values of k exp infectivity for non enveloped ssrna viruses and dsdna viruses were 0 198 and 0 068 cm2 mj 1 respectively and the corresponding enveloped ones were 0 661 and 1 064 cm2 mj 1 respectively although the non enveloped viruses seemed statistically to be more resistant to uv254 irradiation than the enveloped ones blazquez et al 2019 mohr et al 2009 ye et al 2018 the k exp infectivity values were rather scattered among the enveloped and non enveloped groups additionally for the same virus group but with varying genome sequences k exp infectivity also varied for example the k exp infectivity values for adenovirus type 1 and type 4 having 79 similar genome sequences was 0 0590 and 0 0887 cm2 mj 1 respectively the k exp infectivity values for adenovirus type 1 type 2 and type 5 were quite similar which were 0 0590 0 0576 and 0 0547 cm2 mj 1 respectively as they shared similar genome sequences 98 indentical supporting information si excel these results suggest that the possible applicability of predicting fluence based virus infectivity loss based on the geome sequences 3 2 validation of the prediction model using genome regions before going ahead to predict the fluence based photolysis rate constants for the whole genomes in viruses we firstly predicted the fluence based photolysis rate constants for genome regions and compared with the experimental ones obtained using qpcr whose results directly reflected the genome changes the photolysis rate constants for different genome regions from qpcr analysis were summarized in table s4 the tested genome regions in viruses had base numbers ranging from 81 to 1126 and the viral genomes were composed of ssrna phage ms2 human norovirus coxsackievirus b5 echovirus 11 and poliovirus 1 dsrna phage φ6 dsdna phage t3 and ssdna phage φx174 respectively fig 2 shows the relationship between the model predicted photolysis rate constants of genome regions k pred region and the experimentally measured ones using qpcr k exp region in general the model achieved fair performance for the genome regions in ssrna ssdna and dsdna viruses p corr 0 79 for ssrna and ssdna viruses k exp region exhibited good consistency with k pred region that majority 92 of the k pred region k exp region ratios for genome regions were in the range 1 2 to 2 for dsdna viruses the k pred region of two regions of phage t3 were 2 66 and 2 88 times of the k exp region respectively it should be noted that k exp region were obtained in buffered solution at ph 7 0 7 5 and the prediction model did not consider the solution chemistry according to qiao et al 2018 the photolysis rate constant of free dsrna genome region was affected the most by the presence of phosphate buffer possibly due to the more ordered structures than in ultrapure water additionally the k pred region for genome regions of dsrna virus phage φ6 was far from the k exp region si excel it could be due to the inappropriate φ254 values used in the prediction model eqs 2 3 as the parameters for dsrna table s2 were not extensively studied specifically the φ254 value for u hydrate for dsrna was not found from the literatures and the value from ssrna was used therefore prediction for infectivity loss rate constants of dsrna viruses was not made later in this study overall the results shown in fig 2 suggest that the prediction model works satisfying for different viral genomes ssrna dsdna and ssdna 3 3 prediction of photolysis rate constants of entire viral genomes as mentioned in the introduction viral genome damage has been reported to be the primary disinfection mechanism leading to the loss of virus infectivity upon uv254 irradiation ayala torres et al 2000 hegedüs et al 2003 pecson et al 2011 and applicability of the model for predicting the fluence based photolysis rate constants of genome regions was verified as described above and also in the previous studies he et al 2019 qiao et al 2018 yoon et al 2017 yoon et al 2018 thus the predicted fluence based photolysis rate constants of the whole viral genomes k pred genome were calculated using eqs 2 4 and compared with the virus infectivity loss rate constants k exp infectivity from the literatures the 2 dsrna viruses were not included due to the poor performance of the model data not shown fig 3 shows the k pred genome and k exp infectivity values for the ssrna ssdna and dsdna viruses for viruses with multiple infectivity loss rate constants the average values were used as k exp infectivity overall the prediction was considered satisfactory for the 100 viruses with p corr of 0 64 for ssrna viruses p corr 0 57 indicated acceptable performance and 69 of the k pred genome k exp infectivity ratios fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 for those ssrna viruses with low k exp infectivity values 0 20 cm2 mj 1 the k pred genome tended to be higher than k exp infectivity figure s5 as an indicator virus ms2 has been extensively studied and 41 infectivity loss rate constants have been collected si excel the k pred genome value was 0 282 cm2 mj 1 which was higher than the k exp infectivity value 0 125 cm2 mj 1 for the two ssdna viruses porcine parvovirus and phage φx174 k pred genome also showed close values with k exp infectivity k pred genome k exp infectivity 0 36 and 0 64 respectively for dsdna viruses the model achieved good performance p corr 0 90 and 73 of the k pred genome k exp infectivity ratios fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 dsdna viruses with low k exp infectivity values 0 10 cm2 mj 1 dominantly adenoviridae family had k pred genome k exp infectivity ratios higher than 3 this may be due to that the correction factor f as 30 used in the prediction model was inappropriate for adenoviridae family adenovirus has been reported to be the most resistant known human pathogen to uv disinfection linden et al 2007 thurston enriquez et al 2003 rodríguez also found that the reduction in viral infectivity was significantly lower than the amount of dna damage observed after exposure to uv254 rodríguez et al 2013 furthermore the virus infectivity rate constants were normalized by the number of bases in the entire viral genome k exp infectivity n and the photolysis rate constants of the regions were normalized by the number of bases tested in the qpcr amplicon k exp region n table s5 the median k exp region n values followed the order of ssdna 1 54 10 4 cm2 mj 1 base 1 ssrna 3 60 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 dsdna 3 42 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 which was consistent with qiao et al 2018 the k exp infectivity n values were also compared with k exp region n in order to identify the consistency between the viral infectivity and genome damages on a single base level as shown in fig 4 for ssrna k exp region n for the 42 ssrna regions was in the range of 1 62 10 5 to 1 27 10 4 cm2 mj 1 base 1 with a median value of 3 60 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 whereas k exp infectivity n was in the range of 6 81 10 6 to 1 84 10 4 cm2 mj 1 base 1 with the median value of k exp infectivity n was 4 58 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 statistically no difference existed between k exp region n and k exp infectivity n p 0 2 for dsdna the median value of k exp region n 3 42 10 5 cm2 mj 1 base 1 was 10 times higher than that of k exp infectivity n 3 16 10 6 cm2 mj 1 base 1 the difference in k exp region n and k exp infectivity n for ssrna was much less than that of dsdna the numbers of dsrna and ssdna viruses were rather small and the limited datasets showed no statistically difference of k exp infectivity n and k exp region n p 0 05 it should be noted that the normalized rate constants k exp infectivity n and k exp region n were both based on the experimental data and the results also support that the virus infectivity loss rate constants are generally consistent with the genome photolysis rate constants for ssrna viruses but are much lower than the genome photolysis rates for dsdna viruses the dna repair mechanism may partially account for this observation hijnen et al 2006 it has been reported that the photolyases in cells can repair the damaged dna in the viruses li et al 2010 stuchebrukhov 2011 yi and he 2013 and this may result in recovery of viral infectivity kelner 1949 additionally many of the dsdna viruses had very long sequences 100k base pairs and the formation of a single photoproduct e g tt or tc dimer in dsdna may not necessarily affect its ability to infect the cells 3 4 limitations of the model there are some limitations of the prediction model firstly the values of quantum yields had very large variation in the literatures and the quantum yields for some reactions e g c hydration and u hydration are very limited additionally the quantum yields also varied with ph temperature and ionic strength but the datasets were very limited brown and johns 1968 douki 2006 gorner 1994 or not available and their changes at different testing conditions were not considered in the model precisely measuring quantum yields under water treatment related conditions is highly desirable secondly the model is a simplified one with theoretical calculations the photolysis reactions occurring in the dna and rna can be much more complicated and are affected by their sequences and conformation for example although tt was known to be photolyzed in dna the formation rates of tt cpd were highly dependent on the adjacent bases when tt was buried with two g in a sequence i e gttg tt became uv resistant and no tt cpd was formed kundu et al 2004 other than the formation of cpd 6 4 pp and photohydrate products upon uv irradiation strand breaks interstrand crosslinks and protein nucleic acid linkages also occur and they are not considered in the prediction model due to their low quantum yields gorner 1994 sinha and hader 2002 thirdly virus inactivation is complicated and the specific mechanisms that lead to virus inactivation are also unclear wigginton et al 2012 the loss of virus infection involves three essential virus functions the binding to the host cell injection of viral dna rna into the host cell and replication of dna rna mathieu et al 2019 wigginton et al 2012 thus the infectivity loss rate is a sum of the loss rate of binding genome injection and replication wigginton et al 2012 the damages of rna in ms2 were found to mainly reflect the loss of replication step the damages of viral proteins affected the loss in binding and injection functions wigginton et al 2012 although the damage rates of capsid proteins was generally small e g 0 0025 cm2 mj 1 for ms2 and 0 0017 0 0026 cm2 mj 1 for φ6 sigstam et al 2013 ye et al 2018 the loss in genome injection was observed e g 0 015 cm2 mj 1 for ms2 wigginton et al 2012 furthermore the model also can t predict the tailing effects during uv254 inactivation of viruses 3 5 implications we understand that the estimated infectivity loss rates have some deviation due to the limitation of the model and the complicated structures and photolysis mechanisms of viruses we believe that this prediction method can be used as a prescreening tool to assess the effectiveness of uv irradiation for emerging and unculturable viruses in water or wastewater treatment for example the predicted photolysis rate constants k pred of sars cov 2 nc 045512 ssrna virus based on eqs 2 3 was 3 168 cm2 mj 1 conservatively using 1 2k pred a uv dose of 3 mj cm 2 is able to achieve a 2 log removal without considering the uv attenuation in water according to the latest report from national emerging infectious disease laboratories neidl a uv c dose of 5 mj cm 2 achieved a 2 log removal of sars cov 2 techjuice news 2020 this agreed with our prediction that is to say the uv doses generally applied in water and wastewater treatment process 40 100 mj cm 2 are able to effectively inactivate sars cov 2 it should be noted that assessment of dose response data with infectivity assays will be the golden standard to protect human health by application of uv technology the prediction model is far from being applicable for calculations of field data on the inactivation of viruses in water treatment but is rather used as a prescreening tool and enable calculation the inactivation efficiency of operational uv disinfection for viruses in water the photodamage of genomes in dsdna viruses does not necessarily lead to the virus infectivity loss from the aspects of both photolysis rates of genomes and virus infectivity loss single strand nucleic acid was more photoreactive than the double strand lytle and sagripanti 2005 which is also supported by fig 3 in fact among the 13 viruses having the low infectivity loss rate constants 0 1 cm2 mj 1 8 were dsdna viruses including simian virus 40 5 2k base pairs 0 034 cm2 mj 1 and jc polyomavirus 5 1k base pairs 0 043 cm2 mj 1 adenovirus 34k 36k base pairs 0 049 0 088 cm2 mj 1 and so on see the supporting information si excel though the infectivity loss rate constants don t necessarily relate with genome length dsdna viruses with relatively short genome sizes e g 40k base pairs deserve attention due to their photoresistance this study has summarized the uv254 inactivation data for 102 viruses covering diverse virus families table s6 this accumulated literature data on the virus inactivation kinetics can be used in quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra for the water industry and treatment design to determine the efficacy of a uv fluence in the inactivation of the range of reported viruses in addition this database may provide insights for the selection of potential non pathogenic surrogates for pathogenic viruses or emerging viruses in water treatment ms2 phage family is commonly used as an indicator virus to evaluate the degree of virus inactivation by uv254 disinfection based on the averaged ms2 infectivity loss rate constants of 0 125 cm2 mj 1 ranging from 0 066 to 0 319 cm2 mj 1 ms2 was more resistant than 82 of the 102 viruses fig 1 the viruses being more resistant than ms2 included phage φ6 dsrna and enterobacteria phage ga ssrna flaviviridae hepatitis c ssrna retroviridae viruses ssrna adenoviridae viruses dsdna and papovaviridae viruses dsdna thus suitable surrogates for accessing the inactivation of these viruses should be selected for further studies 4 conclusions the experimental infectivity loss rate constants k exp infectivity of 102 viruses i e 2 dsrna 65 ssrna 33 dsdna and 2 ssdna viruses upon uv254 irradiation collected from the literature varied in the range of 0 016 to 3 49 cm2 mj 1 in consideration of the viral genome damage as the primary disinfection mechanism leading to the loss of virus infectivity upon uv254 irradiation an improved base composition model was applied to predict the fluence based photolysis rate constants of viral genomes k pred genome and is used to estimate virus infectivity loss rate constants the model had fairly good performance in predicting the virus susceptibility to uv254 irradiation except dsrna viruses p corr 0 64 about 70 of the k pred genome values fell in the range of 1 2 to 2 of the k exp infectivity values due to the limitations of the model this prediction method is rather used as a
