16080,the fate and formation of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have been investigated during wastewater treatment processes but studies for the entire urban wastewater system comprising the sewage transport and wastewater and sludge treatment processes are scarce this work performs an integrated assessment of the formation and fate of pfaas in the urban wastewater system together with their behavior in separate components of the system to achieve this pfaas were monitored over five weeks in a laboratory scale urban wastewater system comprising sewer reactors a wastewater treatment reactor and an anaerobic sludge digester the system was fed with real domestic wastewater the total mass of 11 pfaas flowing out of the laboratory wastewater system significantly p 0 05 increased by 112 14 mean standard error compared to that entering the system formation of pfaas was observed in all three biological processes of the system in anaerobic sewer process perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos exhibited significant formation p 0 05 with the mass flow increased by 79 24 109 31 and 57 17 respectively during the wastewater treatment process perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorododecanoic acid pfdoda demonstrated significant increase p 0 05 in their mass flows by 176 56 92 21 and 516 184 respectively in contrast only pfhxa was found to significantly p 0 05 increase by 130 40 during anaerobic digestion process the total mass of 11 pfaas discharged through the effluent 201 24 ng day 1

anaerobic digestion 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a class of organic pollutants characterised by the structure containing hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chains and can have functional end groups the unique properties of some pfas such as high chemical and thermal stability and high surface activity at low concentrations resulted in their widespread industrial and commercial applications since the 1950s buck et al 2012 consequently they are found ubiquitously in the environment ahrens et al 2010 gewurtz et al 2019 rankin et al 2016 humans eriksson et al 2017b olsen et al 2012 and biota de solla et al 2012 lam et al 2016 perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas are the most abundant subclass of pfas and extremely recalcitrant to degradation the functional end group of pfaas is typically either a carboxylic acid pfcas cnf2n 1coo or a sulfonic acid pfsas cnf2n 1so3 perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are examples of pfaas which are not only persistent but also bioaccumulative and toxic and thus have been included in the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants unep 2019 it has been shown that pfaas can form through the transformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances i e pfaa precursors ruan et al 2015 the urban wastewater system generally consists of the sewer network and the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp it plays an important role in the collection transport and transformation of pfas in the wastewater produced from various anthropogenic activities moreover it constitutes an important pathway of pfas to the environment formation of pfaas from precursors has been recognised as an issue due to the increased risk of pfaa contamination in the environment large amounts of studies monitored pfas in wastewater samples from wwtps and observed higher levels of pfaas in the effluent than those in the influent eriksson et al 2017a gallen et al 2018 houtz et al 2018 further studies have demonstrated the potential of pfaa precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps and n ethyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamido ethanols n etfose to form pfaas during activated sludge processes lee et al 2010 rhoads et al 2008 yu et al 2018 biotransformation of ftohs and fluorotelomer sulfonates fts have been extensively studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in laboratories hamid et al 2020 li et al 2018 wang et al 2011 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013b pfaas were observed as the end products of biotransformation monosubstituted paps monopaps and disubstituted paps dipaps were found to be degraded into ftohs via microbial hydrolysis which can be further transformed into pfaas lee et al 2010 lewis et al 2016 however very few studies investigated the formation of pfaas at different treatment stages in wwtps kibambe et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 the analysis of organic micropollutants omps in sewer networks is attracting increasing attention in the field of wastewater based epidemiology as the measurement of these substances in sewers could provide valuable information on population level chemical exposures arnold 2016 sewer networks have been recognised as biochemical reactors since complex processes occur in the five different phases e g water phase biofilm sediment air phase and walls hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 ren et al 2021 omps in wastewater can undergo a series of in sewer processes such as sorption ramin et al 2016 transformation degradation biotic and abiotic launay et al 2016 mccall et al 2016 thai et al 2014 and remobilisation of sewer deposits launay et al 2016 a better understanding of the fate and transformation of omps in sewers will facilitate more accurate estimation of human exposure until now to our best knowledge there have not been any studies exploring the fate and formation of pfaas in sewers there are gaps in the knowledge of the fate of pfaas along the entire urban wastewater system including mass flows of pfaas and their distribution in aqueous and solid phases addressing these gaps can aid in understanding the behavior of pfaas during each process and supporting water managers in developing strategies for mitigating pfaas in urban wastewater systems therefore the aim of this study was to examine the formation and fate of pfaas using a laboratory scale urban wastewater system another objective was to determine the contributions of precursors to pfaa formation in each component of the wastewater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents native and isotope labelled standards of pfas were purchased from wellington laboratories inc guelph ontario canada the mixture of native standards included 26 pfas perfluorobutanoic acid pfba perfluoropentanoic

laboratory scale wastewater system and monitoring campaigns the urban wastewater system was simulated by a laboratory reactor system adapted from rebosura et al 2020 it consisted of two completely sealed rising main sewer reactors installed in series sr a and sr b a primary sedimentation ps tank a sequencing batch reactor sbr with intermittent anoxic aerobic conditions activated sludge process a sludge thickener th and an anaerobic digester ad as shown in fig 1 the domestic wastewater was collected fortnightly from a residential pumping station in queensland australia and stored at 4 c prior to use as feed details of the set up and operation of the laboratory reactor system is presented in the supplementary data briefly 2 5 l of domestic wastewater was warmed to room temperature 22 c and then fed into the sewer reactors every 6 h the effluent of the sewer reactors flowed into the ps tank and settled for 6 h by gravity after settling the supernatant 2 l was fed into the sbr for biological treatment and the primary sludge 0 5 l was fed to the sludge thickener which also received the waste activated sludge was generated from the sbr the thickened waste sludge tws 50 ml from the sludge thickener was fed to the ad once a day and a volume of 50 ml of anaerobically digested sludge ads was discharged simultaneously the laboratory scale system had been operated for over 4 months and reached the pseudo steady state fig s1 before the monitoring of pfas commenced the sampling scheme for the pfas monitoring lasted for 5 weeks and is illustrated in table 1 wastewater 1 2 l sampling points 1 2 and 4 fig 1 and was 85 ml sampling point 3 were collected on the same day once a week the wastewater from sampling point 2 was taken before the commencement of the sedimentation process tws 50 ml sampling point 5 and ads 50 ml sampling point 6 were taken on two consecutive days each week in order to measure pfas in sludge and those merely in the liquid phase of sludge individually as will be further described 2 3 sample preparation and extraction wastewater and was samples were centrifuged at 4750 rpm for 20 min to separate the solid and liquid phases immediately after collection the pellets were freeze dried and ground to a fine powder and the supernatant was stored at 20 c the solid and liquid phases of wastewater from sampling points 1 and 2 were analysed separately for pfas for sampling point 3 sbr effluent pfas in the liquid phase ng l 1 were measured while pfas in the solid phase ng g 1 tss were not measured due to an inadequate amount of solids in this stream but the concentrations in the solid phase were assumed to be the same as in was sampling point 4 conversely for sampling point 4 was pfas in the solid phase were measured while the concentrations of pfas in the liquid phase were assumed to be the same as in the sbr effluent the assumptions are reasonable due to the short interval 45 min between the decanting of was sampling point 3 and the effluent sampling point 4 to obtain enough supernatant of sludge samples tws and ads were collected in two consecutive days per week and pre treated as follows one tws and one ads sample were centrifuged to obtain the supernatant stored at 20 c until analysed for dissolved pfas in sludge another tws and ads sample were directly freeze dried ground to a fine powder and aliquoted into duplicate samples 0 15 g each the liquid samples were thawed and spiked with 10 μl of a mixture of surrogate analytes isotope labelled internal standard mix at 0 2 mg l 1 prior to the solid phase extraction spe with strata x aw cartridges 100 mg 6 ml as described in a previous study nguyen et al 2019 the freeze dried solid samples were spiked with surrogates followed by ultrasonic solvent extraction use using two cycles of 1 ammonia methanol solution w w detailed extraction protocols for solid and liquid samples are provided in the supplementary data 2 4 analytical techniques 2 4 1 conventional parameters the dissolved sulfide in sewer reactors were analysed using ion chromatography ic with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 the dissolved methane formed in sewer reactors was measured and calculated based on protocols described by rebosura et al 2020 total suspended solids tss were determined following the standard method apha 2005 soluble and total chemical

followed by equilibration at 10 b for 2 min a 1 methanol in milliq water with 8 mm ammonium acetate b 95 methanol in milliq water with 8 mm ammonium acetate 2 5 quality assurance and quality control qa qc in order to provide quality control the duplicate samples native spikes inter batch samples samples from previous batch and procedural blanks milli q water were added into each batch and processed in the same way as the regular samples calibration standards were injected twice in each batch of samples quantification of pfas was performed using a linear regression analysis weighted by 1 x of the calibration curve with regression coefficients r2 higher than 0 993 detailed information on limits of detection lods limits of quantification loqs recoveries of native spikes and internal standards and relative standard deviation rsd of inter batch samples are described in table s2 2 6 data processing and statistical analysis 2 6 1 calculation of concentrations of pfas adsorbed on the solids of tws and ads the concentrations less than lods were treated as zero and values above lods but less than loqs were treated as half of the loqs during the calculation process pfas adsorbed onto solids of sludge were calculated by subtracting mass in the liquid phase from the total mass in sludge samples as formulated by eq 1 li et al 2021 1 c sp c s c l tss where csp is the concentration of pfas adsorbed onto the solid phase ng g 1 tss cs is the concentration of pfas in sludge samples ng l 1 sludge cl is the concentration of pfas in liquid samples ng l 1 supernatant tss is the total suspended solids concentration in sludge g l 1 the solid water distribution coefficient k d l kg 1 for sludge samples was calculated according to eq 2 2 k d c s p c l 1000 2 6 2 calculation of daily mass loads the mass loads of individual pfas were calculated by multiplying the concentrations of each pfas by the daily flow rates according to eq 3 3 m c l q c sp q tss where m is the mass load of individual pfas in the aqueous phase and adsorbed onto solids ng day 1 q is the flowrate l day 1 in the calculation of mass flows entering the sbr and the thickener via primary sludge c l and c sp measured in the ps prior to sedimentation were used the ps tank merely served for the separation of suspended particles by gravity with very short hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time in this study it has been demonstrated that physical settling of solids in wastewater is not likely to provide removal or formation of pfaas due to the lower hrt and minimal biological activity guerra et al 2014 yu et al 2009 2 6 3 statistical analysis to determine if there were significant differences between the concentrations or mass loads in different flows paired samples t test was performed at a 5 significance level using graph pad prism 9 version 9 0 0 graphpad software san diego california usa all data sets were checked for normal distribution using the kolmogorov smirnov test to determine if parametric or non parametric tests should be used several data were excluded for paired samples t test table s3 because they were determined to be outliers based on graphical observation and grubb s outlier test α 0 01 grubbs 1969 outliers were not included in the calculation of summary statistics the comparison results were reported when conducted on 4 or more pairs of observation and indicated with significance p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 or insignificance p 0 05 substitution of data below lods loqs may introduce an invasive pattern not present in the original data helsel 2011 to avoid the fabricated significance criteria such as proportion of substitution below 15 or significant differences in liquid or solid phases were used for scrutinising the true significance the error bars in the figures represent the standard error of the mean sem measuring how far the sample mean is from the true population mean sem was calculated as the standard deviation sd divided by the square root of the sample size sd of the pfas concentrations in wastewater and was samples was calculated based on all samples collected in 5 weeks n 5 given that the solids obtained by freeze drying tws and ads were analysed in duplicates for each sample the measurements were first averaged and the sd was calculated from the averaged results n 5 the duplicate differences were listed in table s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall mass flows and profiles of pfaas in the laboratory urban wastewater system nine pfcas c4 c12 and two pfsas c6 and c8 were detected in both wastewater and sludge samples three polyfluorinated compounds fosa n etfosaa and n mefosaa were mainly detected in sludge samples was tws and ads table s5 the average mass flows sem of 11 pfaas and their profiles in the laboratory wastewater system are shown in fig 2 pfaas entering the sewer reactors stream ① were mainly in the aqueous phase and only 7 of the mass load of pfaas was adsorbed on the solids of the domestic wastewater after passing through the sewer process with an average hrt of 3 6 h the total mass of the 11 pfaas significantly increased p 0 05 table s6 by 51 14 from 14 2 ng l 1 to 21 3 ng l 1 i e per litre of wastewater fed into sewer reactors per day indicating the formation of pfaas in sewer reactors of the total pfaas entering the ps tank stream ② approximately 20 of the mass was transferred to the sludge thickener with the primary sludge after biological wastewater treatment the 11 pfaas mass in the sbr effluent stream ④ and was stream ⑤ was 243 27 ng day 1 significantly higher 54 20 p 0 05 table s6 than that in the sbr influent stream ③ 167 25 ng day 1 it suggests that the formation of pfhxa pfoa and pfdoda in the sbr see section 3 3 contributed significantly to the total mass of the 11 pfaas in the two streams ④ and ⑤ exiting the sbr due to the higher affinity for solids long chain pfaas pfcas c 8 pfsas c 6 were dominant in sludge samples fig 2 b and more than 80 of the 11 pfaas in sludge was associated with the solid phase fig 2 a activated sludge wasted from the sbr was thickened with primary sludge stream ⑨ before feeding to the ad the overflow of the supernatant stream ⑧ in sludge thickener was discharged directly in this study leading to around 80 mass loss of the 11 pfaas in the thickener conversely to the laboratory system pfaas in the supernatant of a sludge thickener in practice would be transferred to the wastewater treatment units and discharged mainly with the final effluent considering the recycling of process water is common in full scale wwtps no statistically significant difference p 0 05 table s6 in the mass loads of the 11 pfaas was found between the tws stream ⑥ and ads stream ⑦ which indicates the anaerobic formation of pfhxa in the ad see section 3 4 contributed small portion of the total mass of 11 pfaas studies of biotransformation of pfaa precursors suggest that the formation of pfaas under anaerobic conditions is possible but at much lower levels compared with that observed in aerobic conditions zhang et al 2016 2013b when evaluating the net formation of pfaas through the entire process of the laboratory wastewater system the mass loads in the influent of the sewer reactors were compared with those in all streams exiting the system which included the sbr effluent the supernatant of the thickener and the ads the mass of the 11 pfaas exiting the system was significantly higher 112 14 p 0 05 than that entering the system with an increase of 152 13 ng day 1 table s6 or 15 2 1 3 ng l 1 i e litre of wastewater received per day it indicates that the formation of pfaas from precursors across the system aggregated and served as a significant contribution to the total mass of pfaas discharged to the environment furthermore the majority of the mass of pfaas were released through the sbr effluent as demonstrated by the 5 times higher mass loadings per day in the effluent than in the ads it is worth noting that long chain pfaas formed a high proportion 80 90 of the total pfaas in the ads and therefore may accumulate in the soil via land application of biosolids sepulvado et al 2011 washington et al 2010 3 2 formation and fate of pfaas in sewer reactors the mass flows of individual pfaas in the influent stream ① and effluent stream ② of the sewer reactors are presented in fig 3 a significant increase p 0 05 was observed in the mass loads of pfpea 79 24 pfhpa 109 31 and pfos 57 17 in the effluent of sewer reactors fig 3 a b indicating their formation from potential precursors in the sewer process in sewer transformation that led to the formation of chemicals has been reported previously for some drug metabolites e g benzoyl ecgonine morphine gao et al 2017 thai et al 2014 it was assumed that chemical hydrolysis could be attributable to the abiotic transformation of compounds with alkyl esters moreover the presence of sewer biofilms may also enhance the transformation degradation of chemicals sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma located in the anaerobic biofilms of rising main sewers could contribute to the biotransformation of micropollutants through co metabolism gonzalez gil et al 2017 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 kulandaivelu et al 2019 additionally the stratified microbial structure of sewer biofilms demonstrated by sun et al 2014 may impact the co metabolism of omps by srb and ma in this study the stability of biological activities in the sewer reactors was demonstrated by the stable dissolved sulfide concentration 11 1 mgs l 1 and dissolved methane concentration 18 1 mgcod l 1 in the effluent during the baseline monitoring and sampling period fig s1 further studies are required to identify the precursors that are present and the transformation pathways including biotic and abiotic transformation under anaerobic sewer conditions it should be noted that rising main sewer reactors were used in this study different transformation processes may take place in gravity sewers which requires further investigation in regards to pfaas such as pfoa pfna and pfda that showed consistent mass flows before and after the sewer process there were no significant differences between their aqueous concentrations in the influent and effluent however their concentrations in the solid phase of wastewater showed slight increase although not statistically significant the decrease of tss mainly caused by the loss of volatile suspended solids vss 37 9 of reduction fig s2 should account for the concentration phenomenon since desorbed pfaas from the decomposed solids can be adsorbed again by the remaining solids li et al 2021 3 3 formation and fate of pfaas in the sbr three pfaas i e pfhxa pfoa and pfdoda demonstrated significant increase p 0 05 in their mass by 176 56 92 21 and 516 184 respectively while the mass flows of other pfaa species remained consistent fig 4 a b after biological wastewater treatment process the results suggest that precursors transformation can contribute greatly to pfaas released from the effluent and or sludge meanwhile the increased mass of pfdoda 4 1 ng day 1 was substantially lower than that of pfhxa 29 5 ng day 1 and pfoa 20 3 ng day 1 which may attribute to 1 higher levels of precursors of pfhxa and pfoa in the raw wastewater and or 2 higher efficiency of transforming precursors of pfhxa and pfoa n etfosaa and n mefosaa were merely detected in the solid phase of was samples at concentrations of 1 6 0 2 and 2 1 0 5 ng g 1 tss respectively contributing to mass flows of 0 1 1 ng day 1 in the was and effluent table s7 the absence of n etfosaa and n mefosaa in the influent suggest they were likely formed from perfluorooctane sulfonamide precursors such as n etfose and n methyl fose n mefose in the biological treatment process rhoads et al 2008 schultz et al 2006 significantly increased p 0 05 levels of pfhxa and pfoa in the aqueous phase of the effluent were observed accompanied by their increased mass flows which is however not the case for pfdoda due to the strong affinity to solids the newly generated pfdoda tends to be adsorbed by sludge resulting in approximately 450 of increase p 0 05 in its concentration in the solid phase fig 4 d therefore the formation of pfaas especially for the long chain ones in full scale wwtps could be underestimated if assessed only by the concentration differences of pfaas in the aqueous phase of the effluent and influent this can explain the fewer cases reporting the formation of long chain pfaas c 9 compared to those of short chain ones during biological wastewater treatment processes in the literature arvaniti et al 2012 houtz et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 a reduction in the mass flow of other pfaas was not observed since pfaas are expected to be nonbiodegradable in the conventional activated sludge process sinclair and kannan 2006 the decrease p 0 05 in the aqueous concentration of pfba by 35 should be attributed to the sorption by activated sludge fig 4 c the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions is considered to govern the sorption of pfaas by sludge gagliano et al 2020 however hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role in the sorption of longer chain pfaas as demonstrated by the increased log k d values with increasing alkyl chain length for c6 c12 pfcas fig s3 the log k d values for pfcas with fluorinated chain length less than five pfba and pfpea did not show the similar trend with longer chain ones suggesting other interactions such as electrostatic attraction and or size effect could play a major role in their adsorption zhang et al 2013a 3 4 formation and fate of pfaas in the ad as the most commonly used sludge treatment process in large scale wwtps anaerobic digestion plays an important role not only in sludge stabilisation volume reduction and energy recovery via biogas production but also in the transformation of omps gonzalez gil et al 2019 2016 the mass of pfhxa and n mefosaa in sludge significantly increased by 130 40 and 124 42 p 0 05 respectively after anaerobic digestion fig 5 a suggesting their anaerobic formation from the corresponding precursors observations of increased mass flows or concentrations of pfaas in anaerobically digested sludge have been reported in full scale studies guerra et al 2014 schultz et al 2006 however only longer chain pfaas were found which were possibly formed from precursors and the short chain pfaas were not detected in the sludge samples in the two studies our previous mass balance based study has demonstrated that short chain rather than long chain pfaas were formed in the ad li et al 2021 an increase p 0 05 in the aqueous concentration of pfaas in the digested sludge was observed while the solid phase concentration remained consistent fig 5 b c in good agreement with our previous study li et al 2021 it is interesting to note that pfaas formed in the sbr pfhxa and pfoa and sewer reactors pfpea pfhpa and pfos were separate species which may suggest distinctive transformation pathways in the two processes the different chemical conditions and microbial consortia in rising main sewer reactors anaerobic and sbr intermittent anoxic aerobic may account for the transformation of varying precursors resulting in the formation of different pfaa species in sewer reactors and sbr pfhxa was formed both in the sbr and ad implying the similarity in the transformation process under anaerobic conditions however a more specific study may be required to confirm the transformation pathways in different processes co metabolism driven by enzymatic activities is suggested to be the major mechanism responsible for biotransformation of pfaa precursors and other omps in wwtp systems gonzalez gil et al 2019 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013b the highly complex microbial communities in anaerobic digestion sludge could produce diverse enzymes performing different functions for transforming pfaa precursors some of the enzymes are shared in the wastewater and sludge treatment processes moreover the precursors resistant to biotransformation in the upstream processes may be subject to anaerobic transformation in the ad given the longer hrt in ad 20 days compared to that in the sewer reactors 3 6 h and sbr approximately 1 day currently there is a knowledge gap regarding the enzymatic transformation of pfaa precursors in anaerobic digestion possibly due to the complexity of the biological systems and the lack of analytical techniques for identifying precursors transformation products tps and intermediates 4 conclusions this work provides the first investigation on the fate and formation of pfaas in a laboratory wastewater system and the major findings include the formation of pfaas from precursors is significant in the entire wastewater system and contributes substantially to the total mass of pfaas discharged from the system pfaas can be generated in the sewer system prior to the wastewater treatment demonstrated in this study for the first time a deeper understanding of the transformation pathways in different types of sewers may be helpful to facilitate the development of strategies for pfaa control in both the sewer process and the downstream treatment processes transformation of precursors in the biological wastewater treatment process could contribute greatly to the mass flow of longer chained pfaas pfdoda in the sludge as well as that of shorter chained pfaas pfhxa and pfoa in the treated effluent the majority of pfaas released to the environment is through the effluent which contained 5 times higher mass loadings than in the digested sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare

functional end groups the unique properties of some pfas such as high chemical and thermal stability and high surface activity at low concentrations resulted in their widespread industrial and commercial applications since the 1950s buck et al 2012 consequently they are found ubiquitously in the environment ahrens et al 2010 gewurtz et al 2019 rankin et al 2016 humans eriksson et al 2017b

pfaas is typically either a carboxylic acid pfcas cnf2n 1coo or a sulfonic acid pfsas cnf2n 1so3 perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are examples of pfaas which are not only persistent but also bioaccumulative and toxic and thus have been included in the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants unep 2019 it has been shown that pfaas can form through the transformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances i e pfaa precursors ruan et al 2015 the urban wastewater system generally consists of the sewer network and the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp it plays an important role in the collection transport and transformation of pfas in the wastewater produced from various anthropogenic activities moreover it constitutes an important pathway of pfas to the environment formation of pfaas from precursors has been recognised as an issue due to the increased risk of pfaa contamination in the environment large amounts of studies monitored pfas in wastewater samples from wwtps and observed higher levels of pfaas in the effluent than those in the influent eriksson et al 2017a gallen et al 2018 houtz et al 2018 further studies have demonstrated the potential of pfaa precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps and n ethyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamido ethanols n etfose to form pfaas during activated sludge processes lee et al 2010 rhoads et al 2008 yu et al 2018 biotransformation of ftohs and fluorotelomer sulfonates fts have been extensively studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in laboratories hamid et al 2020 li et al 2018 wang et al 2011 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013b pfaas were observed as the end products of biotransformation monosubstituted paps monopaps and disubstituted paps dipaps were found to be degraded into ftohs via microbial hydrolysis which can be further transformed into pfaas lee et al 2010 lewis et al 2016 however very few studies investigated the formation of pfaas at different treatment stages in wwtps kibambe et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 the analysis of organic micropollutants omps in sewer networks is attracting increasing attention in the field of wastewater based epidemiology as the measurement of these substances in sewers could provide valuable information on population level chemical exposures arnold 2016 sewer networks have been recognised as biochemical reactors since complex processes occur in the five different phases e g water phase biofilm sediment air phase and walls hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 ren et al 2021 omps in wastewater can undergo a series of in sewer processes such as sorption ramin et al 2016 transformation degradation biotic and abiotic launay et al 2016 mccall et al 2016 thai et al 2014 and remobilisation of sewer deposits launay et al 2016 a better understanding of the fate and transformation of omps in sewers will facilitate more accurate estimation of human exposure until now to our best knowledge there have not been any studies exploring the fate and formation of pfaas in sewers there are gaps in the knowledge of the fate of pfaas along the entire urban wastewater system including mass flows of pfaas and their distribution in aqueous and solid phases addressing these gaps can aid in understanding the behavior of pfaas during each process and supporting water managers in developing strategies for mitigating pfaas in urban wastewater systems therefore the aim of this study was to examine the formation and fate of pfaas using a laboratory scale urban wastewater system another objective was to determine the contributions of precursors to pfaa formation in each component of the wastewater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents native and isotope labelled standards of pfas were purchased from wellington laboratories inc guelph ontario canada the mixture of native standards included 26 pfas perfluorobutanoic acid pfba perfluoropentanoic

laboratory scale wastewater system and monitoring campaigns the urban wastewater system was simulated by a laboratory reactor system adapted from rebosura et al 2020 it consisted of two completely sealed rising main sewer reactors installed in series sr a and sr b a primary sedimentation ps tank a sequencing batch reactor sbr with intermittent anoxic aerobic conditions activated sludge process a sludge thickener th and an anaerobic digester ad as shown in fig 1 the domestic wastewater was collected fortnightly from a residential pumping station in queensland australia and stored at 4 c prior to use as feed details of the set up and operation of the laboratory reactor system is presented in the supplementary data briefly 2 5 l of domestic wastewater was warmed to room temperature 22 c and then fed into the sewer reactors every 6 h the effluent of the sewer reactors flowed into the ps tank and settled for 6 h by gravity after settling the supernatant 2 l was fed into the sbr for biological treatment and the primary sludge 0 5 l was fed to the sludge thickener which also received the waste activated sludge was generated from the sbr the thickened waste sludge tws 50 ml from the sludge thickener was fed to the ad once a day and a volume of 50 ml of anaerobically digested sludge ads was discharged simultaneously the laboratory scale system had been operated for over 4 months and reached the pseudo steady state fig s1 before the monitoring of pfas commenced the sampling scheme for the pfas monitoring lasted for 5 weeks and is illustrated in table 1 wastewater 1 2 l sampling points 1 2 and 4 fig 1 and was 85 ml sampling point 3 were collected on the same day once a week the wastewater from sampling point 2 was taken before the commencement of the sedimentation process tws 50 ml sampling point 5 and ads 50 ml sampling point 6 were taken on two consecutive days each week in order to measure pfas in sludge and those merely in the liquid phase of sludge individually as will be further described 2 3 sample preparation and extraction wastewater and was samples were centrifuged at 4750 rpm for 20 min to separate the solid and liquid phases immediately after collection the pellets were freeze dried and ground to a fine powder and the supernatant was stored at 20 c the solid and liquid phases of wastewater from sampling points 1 and 2 were analysed separately for pfas for sampling point 3 sbr effluent pfas in the liquid phase ng l 1 were measured while pfas in the solid phase ng g 1 tss were not measured due to an inadequate amount of solids in this stream but the concentrations in the solid phase were assumed to be the same as in was sampling point 4 conversely for sampling point 4 was pfas in the solid phase were measured while the concentrations of pfas in the liquid phase were assumed to be the same as in the sbr effluent the assumptions are reasonable due to the short interval 45 min between the decanting of was sampling point 3 and the effluent sampling point 4 to obtain enough supernatant of sludge samples tws and ads were collected in two consecutive days per week and pre treated as follows one tws and one ads sample were centrifuged to obtain the supernatant stored at 20 c until analysed for dissolved pfas in sludge another tws and ads sample were directly freeze dried ground to a fine powder and aliquoted into duplicate samples 0 15 g each the liquid samples were thawed and spiked with 10 μl of a mixture of surrogate analytes isotope labelled internal standard mix at 0 2 mg l 1 prior to the solid phase extraction spe with strata x aw cartridges 100 mg 6 ml as described in a previous study nguyen et al 2019 the freeze dried solid samples were spiked with surrogates followed by ultrasonic solvent extraction use using two cycles of 1 ammonia methanol solution w w detailed extraction protocols for solid and liquid samples are provided in the supplementary data 2 4 analytical techniques 2 4 1 conventional parameters the dissolved sulfide in sewer reactors were analysed using ion chromatography ic with a uv and conductivity detector dionex ics 2000 the dissolved methane formed in sewer

followed by equilibration at 10 b for 2 min a 1 methanol in milliq water with 8 mm ammonium acetate b 95 methanol in milliq water with 8 mm ammonium acetate 2 5 quality assurance and quality control qa qc in order to provide quality control the duplicate samples native spikes inter batch samples samples from previous batch and procedural blanks milli q water were added into each batch and processed in the same way as the regular samples calibration standards were injected twice in each batch of samples quantification of pfas was performed using a linear regression analysis weighted by 1 x of the calibration curve with regression coefficients r2 higher than 0 993 detailed information on limits of detection lods limits of quantification loqs recoveries of native spikes and internal standards and relative standard deviation rsd of inter batch samples are described in table s2 2 6 data processing and statistical analysis 2 6 1 calculation of concentrations of pfas adsorbed on the solids of tws and ads the concentrations less than lods were treated as zero and values above lods but less than loqs were treated as half of the loqs during the calculation process pfas adsorbed onto solids of sludge were calculated by subtracting mass in the liquid phase from the total mass in sludge samples as formulated by eq 1 li et al 2021 1 c sp c s c l tss where csp is the concentration of pfas adsorbed onto the solid phase ng g 1 tss cs is the concentration of pfas in sludge samples ng l 1 sludge cl is the concentration of pfas in liquid samples ng l 1 supernatant tss is the total suspended solids concentration in sludge g l 1 the solid water distribution coefficient k d l kg 1 for sludge samples was calculated according to eq 2 2 k d c s p c l 1000 2 6 2 calculation of daily mass loads the mass loads of individual pfas were calculated by multiplying the concentrations of each pfas by the daily flow rates according to eq 3 3 m c l q c sp q tss where m is the mass load of individual pfas in the aqueous phase and adsorbed onto solids ng day 1 q is the flowrate l day 1 in the calculation of mass flows entering the sbr and the thickener via primary sludge c l and c sp measured in the ps prior to sedimentation were used the ps tank merely served for the separation of suspended particles by gravity with very short hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time in this study it has been demonstrated that physical settling of solids in wastewater is not likely to provide removal or formation of pfaas due to the lower hrt and minimal biological activity guerra et al 2014 yu et al 2009 2 6 3 statistical analysis to determine if there were significant differences between the concentrations or mass loads in different flows paired samples t test was performed at a 5 significance level using graph pad prism 9 version 9 0 0 graphpad software san diego california usa all data sets were checked for normal distribution using the kolmogorov smirnov test to determine if parametric or non parametric tests should be used several data were excluded for paired samples t test table s3 because they were determined to be outliers based on graphical observation and grubb s outlier test α 0 01 grubbs 1969 outliers were not included in the calculation of summary statistics the comparison results were reported when conducted on 4 or more pairs of observation and indicated with significance p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 or insignificance p 0 05 substitution of data below lods loqs may introduce an invasive pattern not present in the original data helsel 2011 to avoid the fabricated significance criteria such as proportion of substitution below 15 or significant differences in liquid or solid phases were used for scrutinising the true significance the error bars in the figures represent the standard error of the mean sem measuring how far the sample mean is from the true population mean sem was calculated as the standard deviation sd divided by the square root of the sample size sd of the pfas concentrations in wastewater and was samples was calculated based on all samples collected in 5 weeks n 5 given that the solids obtained by freeze drying tws and ads were analysed in duplicates for each sample the measurements were first averaged and the sd was calculated from the averaged results n 5 the duplicate differences were listed in table s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall mass flows and profiles of pfaas in the laboratory urban wastewater system nine pfcas c4 c12 and two pfsas c6 and c8 were detected in both wastewater and sludge samples three polyfluorinated compounds fosa n etfosaa and n mefosaa were mainly detected in sludge samples was tws and ads table s5 the average mass flows sem of 11 pfaas and their profiles in the laboratory wastewater system are shown in fig 2 pfaas entering the sewer reactors stream ① were mainly in the aqueous phase and only 7 of the mass load of pfaas was adsorbed on the solids of the domestic wastewater after passing through the sewer process with an average hrt of 3 6 h the total mass of the 11 pfaas significantly increased p 0 05 table s6 by 51 14 from 14 2 ng l 1 to 21 3 ng l 1 i e per litre of wastewater fed into sewer reactors per day indicating the formation of pfaas in sewer reactors of the total pfaas entering the ps tank stream ② approximately 20 of the mass was transferred to the sludge thickener with the primary sludge after biological wastewater treatment the 11 pfaas mass in the sbr effluent stream ④ and was stream ⑤ was 243 27 ng day 1 significantly higher 54 20 p 0 05 table s6 than that in the sbr influent stream ③ 167 25 ng day 1 it suggests that the formation of pfhxa pfoa and pfdoda in the sbr see section 3 3 contributed significantly to the total mass of the 11 pfaas in the two streams ④ and ⑤ exiting the sbr due to the higher affinity for solids long chain pfaas pfcas c 8 pfsas c 6 were dominant in sludge samples fig 2 b and more than 80 of the 11 pfaas in sludge was associated with the solid phase fig 2 a activated sludge wasted from the sbr was thickened with primary sludge stream ⑨ before feeding to the ad the overflow of the supernatant stream ⑧ in sludge thickener was discharged directly in this study leading to around 80 mass loss of the 11 pfaas in the thickener conversely to the laboratory system pfaas in the supernatant of a sludge thickener in practice would be transferred to the wastewater treatment units and discharged mainly with the final effluent considering the recycling of process water is common in full scale wwtps no statistically significant difference p 0 05 table s6 in the mass loads of the 11 pfaas was found between the tws stream ⑥ and ads stream ⑦ which indicates the anaerobic formation of pfhxa in the ad see section 3 4 contributed small portion of the total mass of 11 pfaas studies of biotransformation of pfaa precursors suggest that the formation of pfaas under anaerobic conditions is possible but at much lower levels compared with that observed in aerobic conditions zhang et al 2016 2013b when evaluating the net formation of pfaas through the entire process of the laboratory wastewater system the mass loads in the influent of the sewer reactors were compared with those in all streams exiting the system which included the sbr effluent the supernatant of the thickener and the ads the mass of the 11 pfaas exiting the system was significantly higher 112 14 p 0 05 than that entering the system with an increase of 152 13 ng day 1 table s6 or 15 2 1 3 ng l 1 i e litre of wastewater received per day it indicates that the formation of pfaas from precursors across the system aggregated and served as a significant contribution to the total mass of pfaas discharged to the environment furthermore the majority of the mass of pfaas were released through the sbr effluent as demonstrated by the 5 times higher mass loadings per day in the effluent than in the ads it is worth noting that long chain pfaas formed a high proportion 80 90 of the total pfaas in the ads and therefore may accumulate in the soil via land application of biosolids sepulvado et al 2011 washington et al 2010 3 2 formation and fate of pfaas in sewer reactors the mass flows of individual pfaas in the influent stream ① and effluent stream ② of the sewer reactors are presented in fig 3 a significant increase p 0 05 was observed in the mass loads of pfpea 79 24 pfhpa 109 31 and pfos 57 17 in the effluent of sewer reactors fig 3 a b indicating their formation from potential precursors in the sewer process in sewer transformation that led to the formation of chemicals has been reported previously for some drug metabolites e g benzoyl ecgonine morphine gao et al 2017 thai et al 2014 it was assumed that chemical hydrolysis could be attributable to the abiotic transformation of compounds with alkyl esters moreover the presence of sewer biofilms may also enhance the transformation degradation of chemicals sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma located in the anaerobic biofilms of rising main sewers could contribute to the biotransformation of micropollutants through co metabolism gonzalez gil et al 2017 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 kulandaivelu et al 2019 additionally the stratified microbial structure of sewer biofilms demonstrated by sun et al 2014 may impact the co metabolism of omps by srb and ma in this study the stability of biological activities in the sewer reactors was demonstrated by the stable dissolved sulfide concentration 11 1 mgs l 1 and dissolved methane concentration 18 1 mgcod l 1 in the effluent during the baseline monitoring and sampling period fig s1 further studies are required to identify the precursors that are present and the transformation pathways including biotic and abiotic transformation under anaerobic sewer conditions it should be noted that rising main sewer reactors were used in this study different transformation processes may take place in gravity sewers which requires further investigation in regards to pfaas such as pfoa pfna and pfda that showed consistent mass flows before and after the sewer process there were no significant differences between their aqueous concentrations in the influent and effluent however their concentrations in the solid phase of wastewater showed slight increase although not statistically significant the decrease of tss mainly caused by the loss of volatile suspended solids vss 37 9 of reduction fig s2 should account for the concentration phenomenon since desorbed pfaas from the decomposed solids can be adsorbed again by the remaining solids li et al 2021 3 3 formation and fate of pfaas in the sbr three pfaas i e pfhxa pfoa and pfdoda demonstrated significant increase p 0 05 in their mass by 176 56 92 21 and 516 184 respectively while the mass flows of other pfaa species remained consistent fig 4 a b after biological wastewater treatment process the results suggest that precursors transformation can contribute greatly to pfaas released from the effluent and or sludge meanwhile the increased mass of pfdoda 4 1 ng day 1 was substantially lower than that of pfhxa 29 5 ng day 1 and pfoa 20 3 ng day 1 which may attribute to 1 higher levels of precursors of pfhxa and pfoa in the raw wastewater and or 2 higher efficiency of transforming precursors of pfhxa and pfoa n etfosaa and n mefosaa were merely detected in the solid phase of was samples at concentrations of 1 6 0 2 and 2 1 0 5 ng g 1 tss respectively contributing to mass flows of 0 1 1 ng day 1 in the was and effluent table s7 the absence of n etfosaa and n mefosaa in the influent suggest they were likely formed from perfluorooctane sulfonamide precursors such as n etfose and n methyl fose n mefose in the biological treatment process rhoads et al 2008 schultz et al 2006 significantly increased p 0 05 levels of pfhxa and pfoa in the aqueous phase of the effluent were observed accompanied by their increased mass flows which is however not the case for pfdoda due to the strong affinity to solids the newly generated pfdoda tends to be adsorbed by sludge resulting in approximately 450 of increase p 0 05 in its concentration in the solid phase fig 4 d therefore the formation of pfaas especially for the long chain ones in full scale wwtps could be underestimated if assessed only by the concentration differences of pfaas in the aqueous phase of the effluent and influent this can explain the fewer cases reporting the formation of long chain pfaas c 9 compared to those of short chain ones during biological wastewater treatment processes in the literature arvaniti et al 2012 houtz et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 a reduction in the mass flow of other pfaas was not observed since pfaas are expected to be nonbiodegradable in the conventional activated sludge process sinclair and kannan 2006 the decrease p 0 05 in the aqueous concentration of pfba by 35 should be attributed to the sorption by activated sludge fig 4 c the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions is considered to govern the sorption of pfaas by sludge gagliano et al 2020 however hydrophobic interactions play a dominant role in the sorption of longer chain pfaas as demonstrated by the increased log k d values with increasing alkyl chain length for c6 c12 pfcas fig s3 the log k d values for pfcas with fluorinated chain length less than five pfba and pfpea did not show the similar trend with longer chain ones suggesting other interactions such as electrostatic attraction and or size effect could play a major role in their adsorption zhang et al 2013a 3 4 formation and fate of pfaas in the ad as the most commonly used sludge treatment process in large scale wwtps anaerobic digestion plays an important role not only in sludge stabilisation volume reduction and energy recovery via biogas production but also in the transformation of omps gonzalez gil et al 2019 2016 the mass of pfhxa and n mefosaa in sludge significantly increased by 130 40 and 124 42 p 0 05 respectively after anaerobic digestion fig 5 a suggesting their anaerobic formation from the corresponding precursors observations of increased mass flows or concentrations of pfaas in anaerobically digested sludge have been reported in full scale studies guerra et al 2014 schultz et al 2006 however only longer chain pfaas were found which were possibly formed from precursors and the short chain pfaas were not detected in the sludge samples in the two studies our previous mass balance based study has demonstrated that short chain rather than long chain pfaas were formed in the ad li et al 2021 an increase p 0 05 in the aqueous concentration of pfaas in the digested sludge was observed while the solid phase concentration remained consistent fig 5 b c in good agreement with our previous study li et al 2021 it is interesting to note that pfaas formed in the sbr pfhxa and pfoa and sewer reactors pfpea pfhpa and pfos were separate species which may suggest distinctive transformation pathways in the two processes the different chemical conditions and microbial consortia in rising main sewer reactors anaerobic and sbr intermittent anoxic aerobic may account for the transformation of varying precursors resulting in the formation of different pfaa species in sewer reactors and sbr pfhxa was formed both in the sbr and ad implying the similarity in the transformation process under anaerobic conditions however a more specific study may be required to confirm the transformation pathways in different processes co metabolism driven by enzymatic activities is suggested to be the major mechanism responsible for biotransformation of pfaa precursors and other omps in wwtp systems gonzalez gil et al 2019 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013b the highly complex microbial communities in anaerobic digestion sludge could produce diverse enzymes performing different functions for transforming pfaa precursors some of the enzymes are shared in the wastewater and sludge treatment processes moreover the precursors resistant to biotransformation in the upstream processes may be subject to anaerobic transformation in the ad given the longer hrt in ad 20 days compared to that in the sewer reactors 3 6 h and sbr approximately 1 day currently there is a knowledge gap regarding the enzymatic transformation of pfaa precursors in anaerobic digestion possibly due to the complexity of the biological systems and the lack of analytical techniques for identifying precursors transformation products tps and intermediates 4 conclusions this work provides the first investigation on the fate and formation of pfaas in a laboratory wastewater system and the major findings include the formation of pfaas from precursors is significant in the entire wastewater system and contributes substantially to the total mass of pfaas discharged from the system pfaas can be generated in the sewer system prior to the wastewater treatment demonstrated in this study for the first time a deeper understanding of the transformation pathways in different types of sewers may be helpful to facilitate the development of strategies for pfaa control in both the sewer process and the downstream treatment processes transformation of precursors in the biological wastewater treatment process could contribute greatly to the mass flow of longer chained pfaas pfdoda in the sludge as well as that of shorter chained pfaas pfhxa and pfoa in the treated effluent the majority of pfaas released to the environment is through the effluent which contained 5 times higher mass loadings than in the digested sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16081,carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams widely exist in the ocean and constitute the central part of the refractory dissolved organic matter rdom pool although a consensus has been reached that microbial activity forms crams the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored to better understand the underlying genetic mechanisms driving the microbial transformation of cram a long term macrocosm experiment spanning 220 days was conducted in the aquatron tower tank at dalhousie university halifax canada with the supply of diatom derived dom as a carbon source the dom composition community structure and metabolic pathways were characterised using multi omics approaches the addition of diatom lysate introduced a mass of labile dom into the incubation seawater which led to a low degradation index ideg and refractory molecular lability boundary rmlb on days 1 and 18 the molecular compositions of the dom molecules in the later incubation period from day 120 to day 220 were more similar in composition to those on day 0 suggesting a rapid turnover of phytoplankton debris by microbial communities taxonomically while alpha proteobacteria dominated during the entire incubation period gamma proteobacteria became more sensitive and abundant than the other bacterial groups on days 1 and 18 recalcitrant measurements such as ideg and rmlb were closely related to the dom

positive correlation with crams were identified using a microbial ecological network approach the identified kegg modules produced the substrates such as the acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa which could participate in the mevalonate pathway to generate the precursor of cram analogues isopentenyl pp suggesting a potential generation pathway of cram analogues in bacteria and archaea

metagenomic sequencing has been widely utilised to explore natural and artificial ecosystem diversity and metabolic potential cao et al 2020 grossart et al 2020 sun et al 2021 takami et al 2012 microbial metabolic pathways can be characterised using metagenomic data and compared to the variation amongst different samples tringe et al 2005 changes in metabolic pathways can be detected when environmental conditions change gianoulis et al 2009 such functional changes are caused by the variation of the microbial community not by alteration at the transcriptomic level microbial kegg pathways are more sensitive than community structures in identifying the relationship between microbes and environmental factors dinsdale et al 2008 for example the spearman correlation analysis between the molecular characteristics of dom and metabolic pathways based on metagenomes revealed that anaerobic carbon fixation fermentation and methanogenesis significantly affected dom composition in the paddy soil li et al 2018 these studies suggest that metabolic processes predicted from metagenomes can provide insight into the functional transformations resulting from community variations which facilitates further exploration of the correspondence between metagenomic functions and environmental variables in this study to better understand the transformation of diatom derived dom at the molecular and genetic level a 220 day incubation experiment was conducted in the aquatron tower tank a macrocosm facility of 10 46 m in height 3 66 m in diameter and 117 1 m3 in water volume the aquatron tower tank is a large scale ecological facility that can minimise the bottle effect and offer sufficient samples for metagenomic studies lian et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the microbial metagenomes and dom compositions were characterized at different incubation times associations between the microbial community microbial metabolism and dom molecules were investigated to address the following questions 1 how do dom composition and characteristics change during the incubation process 2 what are the associations between microbial activity and dom transformation during incubation 3 what are the potential pathways used by microbes to convert the labile dom into the crams 2 method 2 1 preparation of dom from the diatom culture the diatom chaetoceros gracilis was obtained from the provasoli guillard national center for marine algae and microbiota and propagated at approximately 20 c under a light intensity of 50 µe m 2 s 1 in f 2 medium when the diatoms were cultured till the plateau phase in a 200 l spherical glass bottle number 6 the suspended cells were sonicated for 15 min at a resonance of 50 hz the filtered diatom lysate was then pumped into the aquatron tower tank 2

filtered through a filter membrane with a pore size of 5 µm and pumped into the tank the seawater 108 m3 was stabilised for 94 days to weaken the influence of labile doms in coastal seawater and obtain a stable incubation environment additional materials part 1 approximately 1000 l of diatom lysate toc concentration 925 µmc was added to the seawater toc concentration 95 µmc in the tank for the incubation experiment the mixed seawater was allowed to develop for 220 days at a temperature of 16 22 c salinity 31 54 31 56 psu and ph 7 95 8 00 in the aquatron tower tank 2 3 sample collection samples were collected on days 0 1 18 120 140 180 and 220 for the analysis of diversity of the microbial community functional genes and dom molecules a total of 50 l of seawater was collected from the tank s surface at each sampling time and filtered using 0 22 μm polycarbonate filter membranes whatman and stored at 80 c for dna extraction to analyse the chemical composition of dom 2 l of seawater

applied to explore the correlation amongst dom molecules microbial community kegg modules and the calculated dom parameters which was conducted by the rda function of the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 a monte carlo permutation test permu 999 was performed to detect the significance of the calculated dom parameters lin 2005 a network was constructed to show the relationship between the dom and microbial metabolism the dominant 1617 dom molecules average intensity of each molecule 10 000 and 112 kegg modules average relative abundance of each kegg module 1 were selected to construct the network spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the relative abundance of dom molecules and the relative abundance of kegg modules was calculated using the wgcna package pei et al 2017 dom molecules and kegg modules with correlations r 0 9 p 0 05 were set as nodes in the network the network was analysed using the igraph package ju et al 2016 3 results 3 1 transformation of microbial community bacteria and archaea accounted for 78 5 94 2 and 5 8 21 5 of the total prokaryotic community respectively the relative abundance of archaea gradually increased during the incubation period fig s6 changes in the community composition during the incubation period were evident fig 2 proteobacteria which constituted 56 of the total bacterial community was the dominant phylum other abundant bacterial taxa included actinobacteria 9 planctomycetes 2 bacteroidetes 2 and firmicutes 2 fig 2a on day 0 the bacterial community was dominated by alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria beta proteobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetes fig 2a the relative abundance of gamma proteobacteria gradually increased on days 1 and 18 and then decreased gradually towards the end of incubation fig 2a in contrast to gamma proteobacteria actinobacteria appeared to follow the opposite trend in general alpha proteobacteria remained the most dominant bacterial group throughout the entire incubation period despite some variations amongst the archaeal communities the predominant phylum was thaumarchaeota which accounted for 80 82 5 of the archaeal community at different incubation times fig 2b at the genus level two archaeal genera candidatus nitrosomarinus and nitrosopumilus thaumarchaeota accounted for 31 6 32 6 of the archaeal community interestingly the relative abundance of candidatus nitrosomarinus gradually increased as the incubation progressed but nitrosopumilus followed the opposite trend fig s7 3 2 conversions of dom molecules the composition of dom molecules was characterised based on the relative abundance of the 6837 formulas identified by fticr ms after the diatom lysate was added the magnitude weighted o cw dbew and dbe cw showed slight decrease on days 1 and 18 and h cw dbe ow and c w increased slightly table 1 the degree of unsaturation of dom molecules decreased on days 1 and 18 compared to days 120 140 180 and 220 the dom molecular formulas c16h32o2 and c18h36o2 were most abundant on days 1 and 18 fig s8 which represent potential fatty acids crams were the most abundant and constituted 67 76 of the total dom during incubation the mlbr and ideg were used to predict the dom resistance during the incubation times and it was discovered that the dom molecules were more refractory during days 120 to 220 table 1 interestingly these calculated dom parameters on day 0 were mostly consistent with those in the later incubation period suggesting a quick transformation upon the addition of labile doms the rda and pca results showed that the dom molecules were divided into three groups during the incubation process group 1 day 1 group 2 day 18 and group 3 days of 0 120 140 180 and 220 fig 3 a1 fig s9a significant correlations p 0 05 were observed between dom molecules and h cw r2 0 99 o cw r2 0 99 dbew r2 0 83 mlbr r2 0 99 and ideg r2 0 82 indicating that dom molecules were more recalcitrant in group3 than in other groups fig 3a1 the dom molecules in different groups largely reflected the differences in molecular composition during the incubation periods according to the eigenvalue of each dom molecule dom molecules in different groups were obtained and used to understand the transformation of the chemical and molecular compositions during incubation times analysis of the chemical element composition showed that the dom molecules in group 1 had a high h and n element contents which was consistent with the high h cw and chon content on day 1 in group 2 doms had a high c content which explains the high cho content and h cw value on day 18 in group 3 dom molecules showed a low h element character and high s content which was consistent with the high o cw dbew and chos content fig 3a2 and table 1 the van krevelen diagram showed that chon containing molecules were the most crucial for the dom composition in group 1 fig 3a3 and the dom formulas c17h22o7n2 and c18h22o8n2 were highly abundant on day 1 fig s8 the dominant molecules in group 2 were cho containing dom molecules and many molecules were potential lipid substances fig 3a3 for example formulas c16h32o2 and c18h36o2 were abundant on day 18 fig s8 the cho containing molecules in group 3 had a high o c ratio and low h c ratio compared with the other groups which were understood to be potential condensed aromatics it is noteworthy that a mass of s containing dom with high h c and o c ratios accumulated in group 3 fig 3a3 implying that special s containing organic matter accumulated with the turnover of diatom lysate 3 3 association between calculated dom parameters and microbial community and kegg modules the microbial community and function shifted during the incubation period and were more similar in the later phase days 120 to 220 fig s9b c o cw dbew mlbr and ideg showed a positive relationship with the bacterial community on days 0 120 140 180 and 220 and h cw had a positive relationship with the bacterial community on days 1 and 18 fig 3b1 these calculated dom parameters could explain 66 of the total variation in the bacterial community indicating that the microbial community was closely related to the change in dom molecules kegg modules are manually defined functional units of gene sets and the shift of kegg modules can be used to study changes in microbial functions rda analysis between the calculated dom parameters and kegg modules showed that o cw dbew mlbr ideg and h cw were closely related to the kegg modules fig 3b2 the first two axes explained 75 1 of the variation in microbial function recalcitrant measurements such as mlbr and ideg positively correlated with microbial community function on days 120 140 180 and 220 fig 3b2 indicating a potential connection between microbial function transformation and rdom generation 3 4 associations between kegg modules and dom formulas network analysis was used to explore and visualize the complex association between kegg modules and dom molecules crams and other doms direct connections were created as edges between the selected dom molecular formulas and network kegg modules coloured nodes fig 4 a in the network 472 dom molecules and 76 kegg modules were selected based on their high spearman s correlation coefficients r 0 9 p 0 05 these dom molecules are divided into two groups crams 340 molecules and other dom molecules 132 molecules the label size of the kegg module was proportional to the rank of the kegg module nodes the number of connections the complex network had 548 nodes and 4852 edges and the average degree and diameter were 17 7 and 15 respectively in the network each kegg module connects many crams and other dom molecules to explore the contribution of kegg module to the cram generation we calculated the proportion of cram by dividing the number of cram molecules that were positively negatively correlated with keggs by the number of kegg module connections kegg modules the proportion that positively correlated with cram is more than 60 was chosen to explore the potential cram generation pathways indicating that these kegg modules are likely to facilitate the process of cram generation the results showed that 11 kegg modules strongly positively correlated with the cram accumulation fig 4b these kegg modules included 1 beta oxidation m00087 and m00086 beta oxidation is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the cytosol of prokaryotes to generate acetyl coa which is used in biosynthesis and energy metabolism 2 phenylacetate degradation m00878 and trans cinnamate degradation m00545 phenylacetate and trans cinnamate are the major intermediates in the bacterial degradation of many aromatic compounds such as phenylalanine bacteria can oxidise phenylacetate and trans cinnamate to produce acetyl coa via m00878 and m00545 modules finally 3 leucine degradation m00036 leucine is one of the three main branched chain amino acids that can be completely converted into three acetyl coa through the leucine degradation pathway 4 purine degradation m00546 this pathway describes the degradation of xanthine to ammonia and contributes to amino acid metabolism 5 assimilatory nitrate reduction m00531 bacteria utilise nitrate and nitrite from the environment by reducing these nitrogen oxides to ammonium ions which are readily metabolised into organic molecules such as amino acids 6 mevalonate pathway of bacterial m00095 and archaea m00849 the mevalonate pathway is an essential metabolic pathway presented in both archaea and bacteria the mevalonate pathway begins with acetyl coa the sole carbon feedstock and ends with the production of isopentenyl pp which is used to biosynthesize various biomolecules such as steroids terpenoids and carotenoids 7 ethyl malonyl pathway m00373 bacteria utilise organic substances such as fatty acids and so on that are metabolised via acetyl coa the ethyl malonyl pathway converts acetyl coa a 2 carbon compound to a 4 carbon compound which is used in the citrate cycle to provide energy to the bacteria 8 cytochrome bc1 complex respiratory unit m00151 this module is a crucial component of bacterial energy metabolism the above kegg modules are involved in the production of acetyl coa and the mevalonate pathway is involved in the utilisation of acetyl coa for production of the terpenoid backbone for example the formula c19h24o9 m z 396 14 was the most abundant cram fig s10 and positively correlated with leucine phenylacetate and trans cinnamate degradation beta oxidation and the mevalonate pathway fig 4a leucine phenylacetate trans cinnamate degradation can produce acetyl coa which can be utilised to generate the terpenoid backbone via the mevalonate pathway in addition some important kegg modules related to gluconeogenesis m00003 glycolysis m00001 and m00002 pyruvate oxidation m00307 and the citrate cycle m00010 negatively correlated with the crams and these pathways were mostly involved in microbial energy metabolism 3 5 potential pathways for microbial production of cram microbial transport and secretion systems serve as conduits for material exchange between intracellular and extracellular environments dinsdale et al 2008 in our study the dominant membrane transport was the abc transport family which accounted for 2 1 of all genes followed by the bacterial secretion system 1 3 and pts 0 13 amongst abc transporters n p transporters especially those for branched chain amino acids were the most abundant accounting for 33 of the abc transport system the fructose transporter was the most dominant in the pts and sec srp was the most abundant in the secretion system fig s12 eleven kegg modules that positively correlated with cram fig 4 were concatenated to construct a putative schema for the biogenic origin of cram fig 5 three potential pathways were identified including the leucine fatty acid and phenylacetate pathways leucine from intracellular synthesis or extracellular transport was completely degraded to two 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa via the leucine degradation pathway and this process fixed two inorganic hco3 the 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa enters the mevalonate pathway directly to produce isopentenyl pp which is the exclusive precursor for the production of steroid terpenoid or carotenoid cram analogs via specific metabolic pathways such as monoterpenoid biosynthesis diterpenoid biosynthesis carotenoid biosynthesis indole diterpene alkaloid biosynthesis ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis kuzuyama 2017 kuzuyama et al 2002 okamura et al 2010 sever et al 2003 in addition leucine can also be degraded completely to three acetyl coa molecules which enter the mevalonate pathway to produce isopentenyl pp fatty acids are progressively oxidized to produce acetyl coa by beta oxidation which is the most abundant pathway acetyl coa is used by the mevalonate pathway to produce isopentenyl pp which enters those special metabolic pathways to generate cram analogues pang et al 2021 phenylacetate is degraded to acetyl coa and succinyl coa respectively acetyl coa may contribute to the production of cram analogues based on the mevalonate pathway and special metabolic pathways succinyl coa enters the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle to provide energy for microbial activity in addition assimilatory nitrate reduction and purine degradation could produce ammonia for amino acid synthesis and its degradation may contribute to acetyl coa production fig 5 and fig s13 in general microbes produce the cram though two key steps accumulation of original substrates such as acetyl coa and 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa and biosynthesis of cram analogues by the mevalonate pathway and special metabolic pathways fig 5 to further confirm cram generation at the molecular weight level network analysis showed that 217 cram were positively correlated with the kegg modules fig 4a and the h c and o c ratios ranged from 0 75 to 1 5 and 0 3 to 0 6 respectively fig s11a the molecular weights of these 217 crams m z ranged from 225 to 625 m z and most crams were concentrated between 325 and 500 m z fig s11b we found that the molecular weight interval was overlapped and interweaved between cram and compounds in the following pathways including steroid biosynthesis ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis indole diterpene alkaloid biosynthesis monoterpenoid biosynthesis diterpenoid biosynthesis and carotenoid biosynthesis fig s11 c d e f g and h suggesting a transformation of cram at the molecular level 3 6 microbes involved in the mevalonate pathway the mevalonate pathway is the key kegg module that converts acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa into precursors of cram in this study to identify the taxa in the mevalonate pathway the seven most abundant microbial lineages were extracted and analysed fig 6 the dominant microbes were alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria actinobacteria and thaumarchaeota fig 6a the dominant genera shifted with incubation time fig 6b upon the addition of the diatom lysate nitrosopumilus and nitrosarchaeum were abundant on days 1 and 18 but candidatus nitrosomarinus was dominant on days 120 140 180 and 220 other bacterial lineages became dominant at different times during the incubation period the cooperation between multiple kegg modules and the mevalonate pathway potentially contributes to the generation of cram to study the species connection between kegg modules and the mevalonate pathway kegg modules that produced acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa had the most similar species to the mevalonate pathway at the genus level fig 6c as a control the gluconeogenesis m00003 module had a strong negative correlation with cram in our study a total of 737 different genera were extracted from gluconeogenesis 480 from mevalonate pathway 586 from leucine degradation pathway 427 from branch chain amino acid transporter 570 from beta oxidation and 553 from phenylacetate degradation pathway approximately 45 of the genera involved in the gluconeogenesis was shared with the mevalonate pathway fig 6ca however the genera of the leucine degradation pathway fig 6cb beta oxidation fig 6cc and phenylacetate degradation pathway fig 6cd shared 62 65 and 64 of the mevalonate pathway respectively in addition 60 of the branch chain amino acid transporter genera were like those in the mevalonate pathway these results illustrate that the cram related kegg modules had a high probability occurrence in the genomes of the same species 4 discussion crams are recalcitrant dom molecules li et al 2019 koch et al 2006 in this study cram accounted for a large proportion 67 of all dom molecules during the incubation period suggesting a significant contribution to the accumulation of refractory dom therefore the biogenic origin of cram can further improve our understanding of the detailed process of rdom accumulation caused by microbial activity previous studies have reported that bacteria can transform distinct exogenous substrates such as trehalose lian et al 2021 cyanobacteria lysate zhao et al 2019 and synechococcus lysates zheng et al 2021 into the analogous composition of cram at the community level our results indicated a close connection between refractory dom generation and the microbial community and kegg modules not only at the community level but also at the genetic level recalcitrant measurements such as mlbr and ideg were found to be positively correlated with dom molecules bacterial and archaeal communities and kegg modules in the later period of the incubation experiment from 120 to 220 days indicating that microbial metabolism processes seem to be deeply involved in refractory dom generation therefore network analysis was applied to identify the kegg modules that are potentially engaged in cram generation eleven kegg modules were positively correlated with the cram fig 4 which seems to have contributed to cram generation based on these kegg modules we discovered that cram generation requires two steps first production of acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa and then transformation of acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa to the cram precursor isopentenyl pp fig 5 this study provides a new horizon for carbon cycling and the origin of the ocean rdom pool acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa is an important primary material for cram generation and participates in the mevalonate pathway to synthesise the steroids and terpenoids in prokaryotes bode et al 2003 siedenburg and jendrossek 2011 the acetyl coa family is prominent in facilitating carbon fixation transportation and cram generation in sar202 genomes in the abyssal zone landry et al 2017 acetyl coa is produced by a variety of metabolic processes bertsch et al 2015 khomyakova et al 2011 however a few key acetyl coa producing pathways such as beta oxidation leucine and phenylacetate and trans cinnamate degradation seem to contribute to the generation of cram in our study which is strongly related to the conversion of the organic matter in the cell interestingly glycolysis pyruvate oxidation and tca which are candidates for acetyl coa production negatively correlated with the cram generation fig 4 pyruvate oxidation is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa by the enzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which is the step that connects glycolysis and the tca cycle amador noguez et al 2010 fattal valevski 2011 su et al 2018 indicating that negative kegg modules are closely related to microbial energy metabolism activities the difference in acetyl coa producing pathways indicated that kegg modules related to organic transformation pathways favour the generation of cram compared to those related to energy metabolism pathways in addition abundant kegg modules were chosen for coupling analysis with cram in data processing and some low abundant kegg modules were discarded even though they were involved in acetyl coa production in this study the relative abundance of genes or kegg modules may differ depending on the habitat liu et al 2020 tanvir et al 2021 it is not surprising that other kegg modules that produce acetyl coa may be potential candidate pathways for cram generation in the future isopentenyl pp production appeared to be a key step in the mevalonate pathway for cram formation in our study acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa participates in the mevalonate pathway to produce isopentenyl pp which is an important precursor for the biosynthesise of the cram analogue steroid terpenoid or carotenoid through metabolic pathways such as steroid ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone indole diterpene alkaloid monoterpenoid diterpenoid and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways the weight m z of these metabolic pathways overlapped with that of cram which positively correlated with kegg modules fig s11 indicating that cram may be generated in these metabolic pathways alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria and thaumarchaeota were the dominant microbes involved in the mevalonate pathway previous studies have also found that these three microbial groups are abundant and essential for the transformation of labile dom into cram based on dom incubation experiments chen et al 2020 lian et al 2021 our study provides evidence that the mevalonate pathway is active in response to cram generation at the genetic level veen s analysis found that cram related kegg modules had a high probability of occurrence in the genomes of the same species indicating that the cooperation amongst different kegg modules was essential for cram generation the non mevalonate pathway is another kegg module that produces the precursor of cram isopentenyl pp eisenreich et al 2004 however there was no evidence in this study regarding non mevalonate pathway s participation in cram generation the non mevalonate pathway utilises pyruvate to generate isopentenyl pp unlike the mevalonate pathway our study showed that pyruvate oxidation negatively correlated with cram generation fig 4b which may play a vital role in providing energy to bacteria and archaea fattal valevski 2011 the primary role of pyruvate was to provide energy for microbial activity rather than cram generation therefore there is little connection between the non mevalonate pathway and cram production the leucine path was a highly efficient converter for cram generation in our study bacteria and archaea can degrade leucine into acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa which is used in the mevalonate pathway for the generation of cram analogues a previous study reported that leucine could be used to trace the refractory bacterial material accumulating in the ocean using the 14c age analysis broek et al 2019 which provides evidence that leucine is the main substrate in the biosynthesis of refractory dom in the ocean via microbial activity in this study branched chain amino acid transporters were the most abundant during the course of incubation leucine can be transferred to the cell interior by branched chain amino acid transporters haney and oxender 1992 indicating that extracellular leucine can be utilised to produce cram via the intracellular mevalonate pathway in the leucine degradation processes 3 methylcrotonyl coa carboxylase uses an atp molecule and hco3 to catalyse 3 methylcrotonyl coa into 3 methylglutaconyl coa höschle et al 2005 massey et al 1976 the inorganic carbon hco3 the largest oceanic carbon reservoir bartley and kah 2004 is fixed and transformed to acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa in the leucine degradation process which participates in the mevalonate pathway for cram generation our results indicate that bacteria and archaea have the potential to convert both labile leucine and inorganic hco3 into cram suggesting a potential relationship between the rdom reservoir and the dissolve inorganic carbon dic pool here a novel perspective is presented in which microbes could utilise the carbon from the dic pool to contribute to the rdom reservoir fatty acid oxidation greatly contributes to cram generation bacteria and archaea can oxidise fatty acids to produce a large amount of acetyl coa which can be used in the mevalonate pathway to produce cram analogues in our study the relative abundance of the beta oxidation pathway was the highest in the cram generation pathways lipids and unsaturated hydrocarbons which was predicted by h c and o c ratio accumulated in the incubation seawater at day 18 and disappeared on days 120 to 220 fig 3a3 fig s8 microbial community transcriptomes in seawater incubation experiment have shown that fatty acid oxidation is abundant and significantly related to the dom transformation mccarren et al 2010 during the incubation period dom molecules were more labile on days 1 and 18 than on days 0 120 140 180 and 220 the low ideg and mlbr on days 1 and 18 suggesting the introduction of labile dom from the diatom lysate the main dynamics of labile dom transformation is microbial activity lechtenfeld et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 a long term incubation experiment in the aquatron tower tank indicated that the diatom lysate debris was effectively transformed into relatively refractory dom during the incubation period during the later period of the incubation experiment days 120 220 many cho containing dom molecules were predicted to be analogues of condensed aromatics which had a low h c ratio and high o c ratio this unsaturated organic matter resisted microbial degradation rossel et al 2013 and was sequestrated in the seawater for thousands of years as a carbon sink it is worth noting that many s containing dom molecules accumulated on days 120 to 220 which contained a high h c and o c ratio fig a3 dissolved organic sulphur dos shows a higher content of hydrogen saturation and oxygen oxidation and forms a large pool of refractory dos reservoirs in the ocean ksionzek et al 2016 our study demonstrated that microbial transformation of the diatom lysate potentially contributed to the accumulation of refractory dos molecules in the ocean the incubation time in the incubation experiments varied in different studies such as the 15 days synechococcus incubation experiment zhao et al 2017 25 days synechococcus lysate incubation experiment zheng et al 2020 and 90 days incubation experiment in distinct exogenous substrates lian et al 2021 this study performed a long term incubation experiment for 220 days in the aquatron tower tank which is important for understanding the relationship between dom transformation and microbial metabolism at an ecological level with a high temporal resolution before adding the diatom lysate a 94 day stabilization stage was conducted to obtain a clean background for the incubation experiment in the aquatron tower tank 5 conclusion our study provides evidence at the genetic level that the cooperation of microbial metabolic pathways plays a vital role in cram generation we found that bacteria archaea can degrade labile dom such as leucine fatty acids and phenylacetate into acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa which participate in the mevalonate pathway to produce precursors of the cram analogues isopentenyl pp the leucine path is an effective converter for cram generation which can translate intra or extracellular leucine into cram and fix inorganic carbon hco3 suggesting a close relationship between the rdom reservoir and the dic pool in the ocean in addition many refractory s containing doms was accumulated in the latter period of the experiment indicating that microbial turnover of diatom lysate contributes not only to the rdom pool but also to the dos pool in the ocean availability of data and materials the raw sequence data was

16081,carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams widely exist in the ocean and constitute the central part of the refractory dissolved organic matter rdom pool although a consensus has been reached that microbial activity forms crams the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored to better understand the underlying genetic mechanisms driving the microbial transformation of cram a long term macrocosm experiment spanning 220 days was conducted in the aquatron tower tank at dalhousie university halifax canada with the supply of diatom derived dom as a carbon source the dom composition community structure and metabolic pathways were characterised using multi omics approaches the addition of diatom lysate introduced a mass of labile dom into the incubation seawater which led to a low degradation index ideg and refractory molecular lability boundary rmlb on days 1 and 18 the molecular compositions of the dom molecules in the later incubation period from day 120 to day 220 were more similar in composition to those on day 0 suggesting a rapid turnover of phytoplankton debris by microbial communities taxonomically while alpha proteobacteria dominated during the entire incubation period gamma proteobacteria became more sensitive and abundant than the other bacterial groups on days 1 and 18 recalcitrant measurements such as ideg and rmlb were closely related to the dom molecules bacterial community and kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes kegg modules suggesting close associations between rdom accumulation and microbial metabolism kegg modules that showed strong positive correlation with crams were identified using a microbial ecological network approach the identified kegg modules produced the substrates such as the acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa which could participate in the mevalonate pathway to generate the precursor of cram analogues isopentenyl pp suggesting a potential generation pathway of cram analogues in bacteria and archaea this study revealed the potential genetic and molecular processes involved in the microbial origin of cram analogues and thus indicated a vital ecological role of bacteria and archaea in rdom production this study also offered new perspectives on the carbon sequestration in the ocean graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatron tower tank refractory dissolved organic matter rdom microbial metagenome kegg modules cram production fticr ms 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is the largest reservoir of organic carbon in the ocean and is approximately equivalent to the reservoir of atmospheric co2 ogawa and h 2001 quéré et al 2014 approximately 94 of dom is refractory dom rdom which has been sequestered in the ocean for thousands of years dittmar et al 2008 hansell et al 2009 owing to its large inventory and long term stability the origin and fate of rdom in the ocean impacts global carbon cycling microbial activity is largely responsible for rdom production in the ocean jiao et al 2018 kaiser and benner 2008 refractory 2011 for example previous studies have shown that bacteria respond actively to the different additions such as cyanobacterial dom zhao et al 2019 synechococcus lysates zheng et al 2021 glucose lechtenfeld et al 2015 and sediment extraction lian et al 2021 wu et al 2018 suggesting a correlation between bacterial community composition and rdom generation in addition particulate organic matter pom is the second largest organic carbon pool in the ocean and can descend from surface waters to the seabed eppley et al 1979 pom can be respired by microbial activities during the sinking process and only a small fraction of pom escapes mineralization and reaches the sedimentary layer ducklow et al 2001 microbial activity is closely related to the carbon cycling in ocean dom is a large molecular mixture in aquatic environments shen and benner 2020 zhang 2017 owing to its molecular complexity a full structural elucidation of dom has been unattainable to date zark et al 2018 carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules crams defined as a diverse array of organic compounds enriched with carboxylated and fused alicyclic rings are the most abundant components of deep ocean dom that have been characterised and constitute a major part of the rdom pool in the ocean hertkorn et al 2006 cram account for 64 68 of the bulk dom below 200 m in the mariana trench li et al 2019 crams are derived from biomolecules with structural similarities to sterols and terpenoids arakawa et al 2017 woods et al 2012 isopentenyl diphosphate isopentenyl pp is the primary precusor substance for the biosynthesis of sterols and terpenoids hertkorn et al 2006 repeta 2015 which can be produced via the mevalonate or non mevalonate pathways kuzuyama et al 2002 liu et al 2013 carotenoid photodegradation products constitute a significant fraction of marine cram arakawa et al 2017 microbes can produce carotenoids using the key intermediate isopentenyl pp which indicates that isopentenyl pp is an important precursor for cram generation in the ocean hertkorn et al 2006 arakawa et al 2017 jiao et al 2018 ultra high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms has advanced the analytical capacity to characterise complex dom molecules not only in laboratory bacterial cultures koch et al 2014 zheng et al 2021 but also in seawater gonsior et al 2011 hertkorn et al 2013 thousands of dom molecules can be characterized with their detailed chemical compositions c h o n and s using fticr ms kramer et al 2004 some proxies have been developed to predict the characterisation of dom such as the double bond equivalent dbe h c ratio and degradation index ideg flerus et al 2012 hertkorn et al 2006 fticr ms has been used to characterise the changes in dom molecules in seawater and to understand the correlation between dom composition and microbial community succession chen et al 2020 2021 zhou et al 2021 correspondences between complex microbial populations and dom molecules have been explored showing that bacterial communities can utilise the labile dom molecules from the aquatic environments and convert them into relative refractory dom molecules osterholz et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 however current studies exploring the associations between microbial communities and dom compositions mainly rely on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing while the ability of the functional genes of microorganisms for this remains untapped as a culture independent technology shotgun metagenomic sequencing has been widely utilised to explore natural and artificial ecosystem diversity and metabolic potential cao et al 2020 grossart et al 2020 sun et al 2021 takami et al 2012 microbial metabolic pathways can be characterised using metagenomic data and compared to the variation amongst different samples tringe et al 2005 changes in metabolic pathways can be detected when environmental conditions change gianoulis et al 2009 such functional changes are caused by the variation of the microbial community not by alteration at the transcriptomic level microbial kegg pathways are more sensitive than community structures in identifying the relationship between microbes and environmental factors dinsdale et al 2008 for example the spearman correlation analysis between the molecular characteristics of dom and metabolic pathways based on metagenomes revealed that anaerobic carbon fixation fermentation and methanogenesis significantly affected dom composition in the paddy soil li et al 2018 these studies suggest that metabolic processes predicted from metagenomes can provide insight into the functional transformations resulting from community variations which facilitates further exploration of the correspondence between metagenomic functions and environmental variables in this study to better understand the transformation of diatom derived dom at the molecular and genetic level a 220 day incubation experiment was conducted in the aquatron tower tank a macrocosm facility of 10 46 m in height 3 66 m in diameter and 117 1 m3 in water volume the aquatron tower tank is a large scale ecological facility that can minimise the bottle effect and offer sufficient samples for metagenomic studies lian et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the microbial metagenomes and dom compositions were characterized at different incubation times associations between the microbial community microbial metabolism and dom molecules were investigated to address the following questions 1 how do dom composition and characteristics change during the incubation process 2 what are the associations between microbial activity and dom transformation during incubation 3 what are the potential pathways used by microbes to convert the labile dom into the crams 2 method 2 1 preparation of dom from the diatom culture the diatom chaetoceros gracilis was obtained from the provasoli guillard national center for marine algae and microbiota and propagated at approximately 20 c under a light intensity of 50 µe m 2 s 1 in f 2 medium when the diatoms were cultured till the plateau phase in a 200 l spherical glass bottle number 6 the suspended cells were sonicated for 15 min at a resonance of 50 hz the filtered diatom lysate was then pumped into the aquatron tower tank 2 2 incubation experiments in the aquatron tower tank the dom incubation experiment was performed in an aquatron tower tank dalhousie university halifax canada fig 1 coastal seawater halifax canada was filtered through a filter membrane with a pore size of 5 µm and pumped into the tank the seawater 108 m3 was stabilised for 94 days to weaken the influence of labile doms in coastal seawater and obtain a stable incubation environment additional materials part 1 approximately 1000 l of diatom lysate toc concentration 925 µmc was added to the seawater toc concentration 95 µmc in the tank for

samples were collected on days 0 1 18 120 140 180 and 220 for the analysis of diversity of the microbial community functional genes and dom molecules a total of 50 l of seawater was collected from the tank s surface at each sampling time and filtered using 0 22 μm polycarbonate filter membranes whatman and stored at 80 c for dna extraction to analyse the chemical composition of dom 2 l of seawater

applied to explore the correlation amongst dom molecules microbial community kegg modules and the calculated dom parameters which was conducted by the rda function of the vegan package oksanen et al 2007 a monte carlo permutation test permu 999 was performed to detect the significance of the calculated dom parameters lin 2005 a network was constructed to show the relationship between the dom and microbial metabolism the dominant 1617 dom molecules average intensity of each molecule 10 000 and 112 kegg modules average relative abundance of each kegg module 1 were selected to construct the network spearman s rank correlation coefficient between the relative abundance of dom molecules and the relative abundance of kegg modules was calculated using the wgcna package pei et al 2017 dom molecules and kegg modules with correlations r 0 9 p 0 05 were set as nodes in the network the network was analysed using the igraph package ju et al 2016 3 results 3 1 transformation of microbial community bacteria and archaea accounted for 78 5 94 2 and 5 8 21 5 of the total prokaryotic community respectively the relative abundance of archaea gradually increased during the incubation period fig s6 changes in the community composition during the incubation period were evident fig 2 proteobacteria which constituted 56 of the total bacterial community was the dominant phylum other abundant bacterial taxa included actinobacteria 9 planctomycetes 2 bacteroidetes 2 and firmicutes 2 fig 2a on day 0 the bacterial community was dominated by alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria beta proteobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetes fig 2a the relative abundance of gamma proteobacteria gradually increased on days 1 and 18 and then decreased gradually towards the end of incubation fig 2a in contrast to gamma proteobacteria actinobacteria appeared to follow the opposite trend in general alpha proteobacteria remained the most dominant bacterial group throughout the entire incubation period despite some variations amongst the archaeal communities the predominant phylum was thaumarchaeota which accounted for 80 82 5 of the archaeal community at different incubation times fig 2b at the genus level two archaeal genera candidatus nitrosomarinus and nitrosopumilus thaumarchaeota accounted for 31 6 32 6 of the archaeal community interestingly the relative abundance of candidatus nitrosomarinus gradually increased as the incubation progressed but nitrosopumilus followed the opposite trend fig s7 3 2 conversions of dom molecules the composition of dom molecules was characterised based on the relative abundance of the 6837 formulas identified by fticr ms after the diatom lysate was added the magnitude weighted o cw dbew and dbe cw showed slight decrease on days 1 and 18 and h cw dbe ow and c w increased slightly table 1 the degree of unsaturation of dom molecules decreased on days 1 and 18 compared to days 120 140 180 and 220 the dom molecular formulas c16h32o2 and c18h36o2 were most abundant on days 1 and 18 fig s8 which represent potential fatty acids crams were the most abundant and constituted 67 76 of the total dom during incubation the mlbr and ideg were used to predict the dom resistance during the incubation times and it was discovered that the dom molecules were more refractory during days 120 to 220 table 1 interestingly these calculated dom parameters on day 0 were mostly consistent with those in the later incubation period suggesting a quick transformation upon the addition of labile doms the rda and pca results showed that the dom molecules were divided into three groups during the incubation process group 1 day 1 group 2 day 18 and group 3 days of 0 120 140 180 and 220 fig 3 a1 fig s9a significant correlations p 0 05 were observed between dom molecules and h cw r2 0 99 o cw r2 0 99 dbew r2 0 83 mlbr r2 0 99 and ideg r2 0 82 indicating that dom molecules were more recalcitrant in group3 than in other groups fig 3a1 the dom molecules in different groups largely reflected the differences in molecular composition during the incubation periods according to the eigenvalue of each dom molecule dom molecules in different groups were obtained and used to understand the transformation of the chemical and molecular compositions during incubation times analysis of the chemical element composition showed that the dom molecules in group 1 had a high h and n element contents which was consistent with the high h cw and chon content on day 1 in group 2 doms had a high c content which explains the high cho content and h cw value on day 18 in group 3 dom molecules showed a low h element character and high s content which was consistent with the high o cw dbew and chos content fig 3a2 and table 1 the van krevelen diagram showed that chon containing molecules were the most crucial for the dom composition in group 1 fig 3a3 and the dom formulas c17h22o7n2 and c18h22o8n2 were highly abundant on day 1 fig s8 the dominant molecules in group 2 were cho containing dom molecules and many molecules were potential lipid substances fig 3a3 for example formulas c16h32o2 and c18h36o2 were abundant on day 18 fig s8 the cho containing molecules in group 3 had a high o c ratio and low h c ratio compared with the other groups which were understood to be potential condensed aromatics it is noteworthy that a mass of s containing dom with high h c and o c ratios accumulated in group 3 fig 3a3 implying that special s containing organic matter accumulated with the turnover of diatom lysate 3 3 association between calculated dom parameters and microbial community and kegg modules the microbial community and function shifted during the incubation period and were more similar in the later phase days 120 to 220 fig s9b c o cw dbew mlbr and ideg showed a positive relationship with the bacterial community on days 0 120 140 180 and 220 and h cw had a positive relationship with the bacterial community on days 1 and 18 fig 3b1 these calculated dom parameters could explain 66 of the total variation in the bacterial community indicating that the microbial community was closely related to the change in dom molecules kegg modules are manually defined functional units of gene sets and the shift of kegg modules can be used to study changes in microbial functions rda analysis between the calculated dom parameters and kegg modules showed that o cw dbew mlbr ideg and h cw were closely related to the kegg modules fig 3b2 the first two axes explained 75 1 of the variation in microbial function recalcitrant measurements such as mlbr and ideg positively correlated with microbial community function on days 120 140 180 and 220 fig 3b2 indicating a potential connection between microbial function transformation and rdom generation 3 4 associations between kegg modules and dom formulas network analysis was used to explore and visualize the complex association between kegg modules and dom molecules crams and other doms direct connections were created as edges between the selected dom molecular formulas and network kegg modules coloured nodes fig 4 a in the network 472 dom molecules and 76 kegg modules were selected based on their high spearman s correlation coefficients r 0 9 p 0 05 these dom molecules are divided into two groups crams 340 molecules and other dom molecules 132 molecules the label size of the kegg module was proportional to the rank of the kegg module nodes the number of connections the complex network had 548 nodes and 4852 edges and the average degree and diameter were 17 7 and 15 respectively in the network each kegg module connects many crams and other dom molecules to explore the contribution of kegg module to the cram generation we calculated the proportion of cram by dividing the number of cram molecules that were positively negatively correlated with keggs by the number of kegg module connections kegg modules the proportion that positively correlated with cram is more than 60 was chosen to explore the potential cram generation pathways indicating that these kegg modules are likely to facilitate the process of cram generation the results showed that 11 kegg modules strongly positively correlated with the cram accumulation fig 4b these kegg modules included 1 beta oxidation m00087 and m00086 beta oxidation is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the cytosol of prokaryotes to generate acetyl coa which is used in biosynthesis and energy metabolism 2 phenylacetate degradation m00878 and trans cinnamate degradation m00545 phenylacetate and trans cinnamate are the major intermediates in the bacterial degradation of many aromatic compounds such as phenylalanine bacteria can oxidise phenylacetate and trans cinnamate to produce acetyl coa via m00878 and m00545 modules finally 3 leucine degradation m00036 leucine is one of the three main branched chain amino acids that can be completely converted into three acetyl coa through the leucine degradation pathway 4 purine degradation m00546 this pathway describes the degradation of xanthine to ammonia and contributes to amino acid metabolism 5 assimilatory nitrate reduction m00531 bacteria utilise nitrate and nitrite from the environment by reducing these nitrogen oxides to ammonium ions which are readily metabolised into organic molecules such as amino acids 6 mevalonate pathway of bacterial m00095 and archaea m00849 the mevalonate pathway is an essential metabolic pathway presented in both archaea and bacteria the mevalonate pathway begins with acetyl coa the sole carbon feedstock and ends with the production of isopentenyl pp which is used to biosynthesize various biomolecules such as steroids terpenoids and carotenoids 7 ethyl malonyl pathway m00373 bacteria utilise organic substances such as fatty acids and so on that are metabolised via acetyl coa the ethyl malonyl pathway converts acetyl coa a 2 carbon compound to a 4 carbon compound which is used in the citrate cycle to provide energy to the bacteria 8 cytochrome bc1 complex respiratory unit m00151 this module is a crucial component of bacterial energy metabolism the above kegg modules are involved in the production of acetyl coa and the mevalonate pathway is involved in the utilisation of acetyl coa for production of the terpenoid backbone for example the formula c19h24o9 m z 396 14 was the most abundant cram fig s10 and positively correlated with leucine phenylacetate and trans cinnamate degradation beta oxidation and the mevalonate pathway fig 4a leucine phenylacetate trans cinnamate degradation can produce acetyl coa which can be utilised to generate the terpenoid backbone via the mevalonate pathway in addition some important kegg modules related to gluconeogenesis m00003 glycolysis m00001 and m00002 pyruvate oxidation m00307 and the citrate cycle m00010 negatively correlated with the crams and these pathways were mostly involved in microbial energy metabolism 3 5 potential pathways for microbial production of cram microbial transport and secretion systems serve as conduits for material exchange between intracellular and extracellular environments dinsdale et al 2008 in our study the dominant membrane transport was the abc transport family which accounted for 2 1 of all genes followed by the bacterial secretion system 1 3 and pts 0 13 amongst abc transporters n p transporters especially those for branched chain amino acids were the most abundant accounting for 33 of the abc transport system the fructose transporter was the most dominant in the pts and sec srp was the most abundant in the secretion system fig s12 eleven kegg modules that positively correlated with cram fig 4 were concatenated to construct a putative schema for the biogenic origin of cram fig 5 three potential pathways were identified including the leucine fatty acid and phenylacetate pathways leucine from intracellular synthesis or extracellular transport was completely degraded to two 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa via the leucine degradation pathway and this process fixed two inorganic hco3 the 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa enters the mevalonate pathway directly to produce isopentenyl pp which is the exclusive precursor for the production of steroid terpenoid or carotenoid cram analogs via specific metabolic pathways such as monoterpenoid biosynthesis diterpenoid biosynthesis carotenoid biosynthesis indole diterpene alkaloid biosynthesis ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis kuzuyama 2017 kuzuyama et al 2002 okamura et al 2010 sever et al 2003 in addition leucine can also be degraded completely to three acetyl coa molecules which enter the mevalonate pathway to produce isopentenyl pp fatty acids are progressively oxidized to produce acetyl coa by beta oxidation which is the most abundant pathway acetyl coa is used by the mevalonate pathway to produce isopentenyl pp which enters those special metabolic pathways to generate cram analogues pang et al 2021 phenylacetate is degraded to acetyl coa and succinyl coa respectively acetyl coa may contribute to the production of cram analogues based on the mevalonate pathway and special metabolic pathways succinyl coa enters the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle to provide energy for microbial activity in addition assimilatory nitrate reduction and purine degradation could produce ammonia for amino acid synthesis and its degradation may contribute to acetyl coa production fig 5 and fig s13 in general microbes produce the cram though two key steps accumulation of original substrates such as acetyl coa and 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa and biosynthesis of cram analogues by the mevalonate pathway and special metabolic pathways fig 5 to further confirm cram generation at the molecular weight level network analysis showed that 217 cram were positively correlated with the kegg modules fig 4a and the h c and o c ratios ranged from 0 75 to 1 5 and 0 3 to 0 6 respectively fig s11a the molecular weights of these 217 crams m z ranged from 225 to 625 m z and most crams were concentrated between 325 and 500 m z fig s11b we found that the molecular weight interval was overlapped and interweaved between cram and compounds in the following pathways including steroid biosynthesis ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone biosynthesis indole diterpene alkaloid biosynthesis monoterpenoid biosynthesis diterpenoid biosynthesis and carotenoid biosynthesis fig s11 c d e f g and h suggesting a transformation of cram at the molecular level 3 6 microbes involved in the mevalonate pathway the mevalonate pathway is the key kegg module that converts acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa into precursors of cram in this study to identify the taxa in the mevalonate pathway the seven most abundant microbial lineages were extracted and analysed fig 6 the dominant microbes were alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria actinobacteria and thaumarchaeota fig 6a the dominant genera shifted with incubation time fig 6b upon the addition of the diatom lysate nitrosopumilus and nitrosarchaeum were abundant on days 1 and 18 but candidatus nitrosomarinus was dominant on days 120 140 180 and 220 other bacterial lineages became dominant at different times during the incubation period the cooperation between multiple kegg modules and the mevalonate pathway potentially contributes to the generation of cram to study the species connection between kegg modules and the mevalonate pathway kegg modules that produced acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa had the most similar species to the mevalonate pathway at the genus level fig 6c as a control the gluconeogenesis m00003 module had a strong negative correlation with cram in our study a total of 737 different genera were extracted from gluconeogenesis 480 from mevalonate pathway 586 from leucine degradation pathway 427 from branch chain amino acid transporter 570 from beta oxidation and 553 from phenylacetate degradation pathway approximately 45 of the genera involved in the gluconeogenesis was shared with the mevalonate pathway fig 6ca however the genera of the leucine degradation pathway fig 6cb beta oxidation fig 6cc and phenylacetate degradation pathway fig 6cd shared 62 65 and 64 of the mevalonate pathway respectively in addition 60 of the branch chain amino acid transporter genera were like those in the mevalonate pathway these results illustrate that the cram related kegg modules had a high probability occurrence in the genomes of the same species 4 discussion crams are recalcitrant dom molecules li et al 2019 koch et al 2006 in this study cram accounted for a large proportion 67 of all dom molecules during the incubation period suggesting a significant contribution to the accumulation of refractory dom therefore the biogenic origin of cram can further improve our understanding of the detailed process of rdom accumulation caused by microbial activity previous studies have reported that bacteria can transform distinct exogenous substrates such as trehalose lian et al 2021 cyanobacteria lysate zhao et al 2019 and synechococcus lysates zheng et al 2021 into the analogous composition of cram at the community level our results indicated a close connection between refractory dom generation and the microbial community and kegg modules not only at the community level but also at the genetic level recalcitrant measurements such as mlbr and ideg were found to be positively correlated with dom molecules bacterial and archaeal communities and kegg modules in the later period of the incubation experiment from 120 to 220 days indicating that microbial metabolism processes seem to be deeply involved in refractory dom generation therefore network analysis was applied to identify the kegg modules that are potentially engaged in cram generation eleven kegg modules were positively correlated with the cram fig 4 which seems to have contributed to cram generation based on these kegg modules we discovered that cram generation requires two steps first production of acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa and then transformation of acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa to the cram precursor isopentenyl pp fig 5 this study provides a new horizon for carbon cycling and the origin of the ocean rdom pool acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa is an important primary material for cram generation and participates in the mevalonate pathway to synthesise the steroids and terpenoids in prokaryotes bode et al 2003 siedenburg and jendrossek 2011 the acetyl coa family is prominent in facilitating carbon fixation transportation and cram generation in sar202 genomes in the abyssal zone landry et al 2017 acetyl coa is produced by a variety of metabolic processes bertsch et al 2015 khomyakova et al 2011 however a few key acetyl coa producing pathways such as beta oxidation leucine and phenylacetate and trans cinnamate degradation seem to contribute to the generation of cram in our study which is strongly related to the conversion of the organic matter in the cell interestingly glycolysis pyruvate oxidation and tca which are candidates for acetyl coa production negatively correlated with the cram generation fig 4 pyruvate oxidation is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa by the enzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which is the step that connects glycolysis and the tca cycle amador noguez et al 2010 fattal valevski 2011 su et al 2018 indicating that negative kegg modules are closely related to microbial energy metabolism activities the difference in acetyl coa producing pathways indicated that kegg modules related to organic transformation pathways favour the generation of cram compared to those related to energy metabolism pathways in addition abundant kegg modules were chosen for coupling analysis with cram in data processing and some low abundant kegg modules were discarded even though they were involved in acetyl coa production in this study the relative abundance of genes or kegg modules may differ depending on the habitat liu et al 2020 tanvir et al 2021 it is not surprising that other kegg modules that produce acetyl coa may be potential candidate pathways for cram generation in the future isopentenyl pp production appeared to be a key step in the mevalonate pathway for cram formation in our study acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa participates in the mevalonate pathway to produce isopentenyl pp which is an important precursor for the biosynthesise of the cram analogue steroid terpenoid or carotenoid through metabolic pathways such as steroid ubiquinone and other terpenoid quinone indole diterpene alkaloid monoterpenoid diterpenoid and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways the weight m z of these metabolic pathways overlapped with that of cram which positively correlated with kegg modules fig s11 indicating that cram may be generated in these metabolic pathways alpha proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria and thaumarchaeota were the dominant microbes involved in the mevalonate pathway previous studies have also found that these three microbial groups are abundant and essential for the transformation of labile dom into cram based on dom incubation experiments chen et al 2020 lian et al 2021 our study provides evidence that the mevalonate pathway is active in response to cram generation at the genetic level veen s analysis found that cram related kegg modules had a high probability of occurrence in the genomes of the same species indicating that the cooperation amongst different kegg modules was essential for cram generation the non mevalonate pathway is another kegg module that produces the precursor of cram isopentenyl pp eisenreich et al 2004 however there was no evidence in this study regarding non mevalonate pathway s participation in cram generation the non mevalonate pathway utilises pyruvate to generate isopentenyl pp unlike the mevalonate pathway our study showed that pyruvate oxidation negatively correlated with cram generation fig 4b which may play a vital role in providing energy to bacteria and archaea fattal valevski 2011 the primary role of pyruvate was to provide energy for microbial activity rather than cram generation therefore there is little connection between the non mevalonate pathway and cram production the leucine path was a highly efficient converter for cram generation in our study bacteria and archaea can degrade leucine into acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa which is used in the mevalonate pathway for the generation of cram analogues a previous study reported that leucine could be used to trace the refractory bacterial material accumulating in the ocean using the 14c age analysis broek et al 2019 which provides evidence that leucine is the main substrate in the biosynthesis of refractory dom in the ocean via microbial activity in this study branched chain amino acid transporters were the most abundant during the course of incubation leucine can be transferred to the cell interior by branched chain amino acid transporters haney and oxender 1992 indicating that extracellular leucine can be utilised to produce cram via the intracellular mevalonate pathway in the leucine degradation processes 3 methylcrotonyl coa carboxylase uses an atp molecule and hco3 to catalyse 3 methylcrotonyl coa into 3 methylglutaconyl coa höschle et al 2005 massey et al 1976 the inorganic carbon hco3 the largest oceanic carbon reservoir bartley and kah 2004 is fixed and transformed to acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa in the leucine degradation process which participates in the mevalonate pathway for cram generation our results indicate that bacteria and archaea have the potential to convert both labile leucine and inorganic hco3 into cram suggesting a potential relationship between the rdom reservoir and the dissolve inorganic carbon dic pool here a novel perspective is presented in which microbes could utilise the carbon from the dic pool to contribute to the rdom reservoir fatty acid oxidation greatly contributes to cram generation bacteria and archaea can oxidise fatty acids to produce a large amount of acetyl coa which can be used in the mevalonate pathway to produce cram analogues in our study the relative abundance of the beta oxidation pathway was the highest in the cram generation pathways lipids and unsaturated hydrocarbons which was predicted by h c and o c ratio accumulated in the incubation seawater at day 18 and disappeared on days 120 to 220 fig 3a3 fig s8 microbial community transcriptomes in seawater incubation experiment have shown that fatty acid oxidation is abundant and significantly related to the dom transformation mccarren et al 2010 during the incubation period dom molecules were more labile on days 1 and 18 than on days 0 120 140 180 and 220 the low ideg and mlbr on days 1 and 18 suggesting the introduction of labile dom from the diatom lysate the main dynamics of labile dom transformation is microbial activity lechtenfeld et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 a long term incubation experiment in the aquatron tower tank indicated that the diatom lysate debris was effectively transformed into relatively refractory dom during the incubation period during the later period of the incubation experiment days 120 220 many cho containing dom molecules were predicted to be analogues of condensed aromatics which had a low h c ratio and high o c ratio this unsaturated organic matter resisted microbial degradation rossel et al 2013 and was sequestrated in the seawater for thousands of years as a carbon sink it is worth noting that many s containing dom molecules accumulated on days 120 to 220 which contained a high h c and o c ratio fig a3 dissolved organic sulphur dos shows a higher content of hydrogen saturation and oxygen oxidation and forms a large pool of refractory dos reservoirs in the ocean ksionzek et al 2016 our study demonstrated that microbial transformation of the diatom lysate potentially contributed to the accumulation of refractory dos molecules in the ocean the incubation time in the incubation experiments varied in different studies such as the 15 days synechococcus incubation experiment zhao et al 2017 25 days synechococcus lysate incubation experiment zheng et al 2020 and 90 days incubation experiment in distinct exogenous substrates lian et al 2021 this study performed a long term incubation experiment for 220 days in the aquatron tower tank which is important for understanding the relationship between dom transformation and microbial metabolism at an ecological level with a high temporal resolution before adding the diatom lysate a 94 day stabilization stage was conducted to obtain a clean background for the incubation experiment in the aquatron tower tank 5 conclusion our study provides evidence at the genetic level that the cooperation of microbial metabolic pathways plays a vital role in cram generation we found that bacteria archaea can degrade labile dom such as leucine fatty acids and phenylacetate into acetyl coa or 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coa which participate in the mevalonate pathway to produce precursors of the cram analogues isopentenyl pp the leucine path is an effective converter for cram generation which can translate intra or extracellular leucine into cram and fix inorganic carbon hco3 suggesting a close relationship between the rdom reservoir and the dic pool in the ocean in addition many refractory s containing doms was accumulated in the latter period of the experiment indicating that microbial turnover of diatom lysate contributes not only to the rdom pool but also to the dos pool in the ocean availability of data and materials the raw sequence data was

16082,thermal effluents from coastal nuclear power plants have led to undesirable pollution and subsequent ecological impacts on local marine ecosystems however despite the ecological importance we know little about the impacts on functionality of bacterioplankton subjected in systems with long term thermal pollution we used metagenomic sequencing to study of the effect of thermal pollution on bacterioplankton community metagenomics in summer in a subtropical bay located on the northern coast of the south china sea thermal pollution 15 y which resulted in an increase in the summer seawater temperature around 8 c and caused seawater temperature up to approximate 39 c significantly decreased bacterioplankton metabolic potentials in photosynthesis organic carbon synthesis and energy production the bacterioplankton community metagenomics underwent a significant change in its structure from synechococcus dominant autotrophy to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas dominated heterotrophy and significantly up regulated genes involved in organic compound degradation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction for the matter and energy acquisition under thermal pollution moreover the bacterioplankton community metagenomics showed an up regulation with heating of genes involved in dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins and proteins involved in other biological processes such as biofilm formation and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycan to adapt to the thermal environment collectively it indicates a functional regulation of bacterioplankton adaptation to high temperature stress which might advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of community adaptation to global extreme warming in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thermal pollution bacterioplankton metagenomics functional adaptation subtropical bay 1 introduction many coastal ecosystems are subjected to undesired environmental disturbance resulting from increasing anthropogenic activities cai et al 2021 one being thermal pollution caused by cooling water effluents from coastal nuclear power plants shiah et al 2005 hao et al 2016 ren et al 2019 an increasing number of coastal nuclear power plants make it pressing to study the impact of thermal pollution on the marine environment and ecology the influence of thermal pollution on aquatic ecosystems has become an important environmental issue in the field of coastal environmental protection van vliet et al 2012 issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 and thermal pollution tends to have a negative impact on the abundance and community structure of fish teixeira et al 2009 zooplankton jiang et al 2009 phytoplankton chuang et al 2009 li et al 2011 bacteria xiong et al 2016 ren et al 2019 as well as their habitats madden et al 2013 hesselschwerdt and wantzen 2018 muthukumar et al 2021 in the coastal environment bacterioplankton which included both free living and particle attached lifestyles plays an important role in ecosystem functioning falkowski et al 2008 wang et al 2020 due to the short generation time and frequent genetic drift of bacterioplankton its community functionality may evolve concurrently with seawater temperature changes thomas et al 2012 and thereby affect the resilience of other organisms to thermal pollution mori et al 2013 despite the importance of bacterioplankton functionality knowledge is poor of how thermal pollution affects the functional potential of bacterioplankton communities and their potential adaptation strategies fetzer et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that temperature is a basic environmental factor affecting bacterioplankton community assembly in aquatic ecosystems fuhrman et al 2008 high temperature can alter bacterioplankton community metagenomics matsumoto et al 2021 and lead to changes in the matter and energy metabolism of bacterioplankton communities o connor et al 2009 yvon durocher et al 2014 on the other hand the bacterioplankton can adopt molecular strategies that help them to cope with thermal stress for instance some bacteria can regulate membrane fluidity by affecting the unsaturation of the fatty acid chains of cell membranes koga 2012 kenkel et al 2013 unsaturated fatty acids are essential in bacterial biological membranes and the level of unsaturation in lipids controls the fluidity of membranes los and mironov 2015 another well known mechanism of thermal adaptation is the synthesis of heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins which play important roles in the conformational modifications e g folding refolding misfolding aggregation or degradation of proteins and benefit the homeostasis of proteins under high temperature stress bloom et al 2007 oksala et al 2014 in a community the bacterial taxa with specific molecular strategies for coping with high temperature stress may become dominant when facing long term thermal pollution the regulation of functional metabolism for biological community composed of unicellular organisms is a key determinant of their community assembly gottschalk 1986 this self regulation of bacterioplankton community might enable it to protect itself from thermal stress and enhance its ability to adapt however currently the researches about molecular adaptive mechanisms to high temperature stress are mainly based on isolated strains which might not be representative for the whole community of bacteria to thermal stress at community level we know little about the potential functional adaptation strategies of bacterioplankton to thermal pollution in consequence of thermal discharge from the cooling system of coastal nuclear power plants in a recent study ren et al 2019 found that thermal pollution had a significant influence on the assembly of marine bacterioplankton communities based on 16s rrna gene sequencing in a subtropical bay located on the northern coast of the south china sea and they found the bacterioplankton community compositions bccs were more sensitive to thermal pollution in summer than in winter however the bcc changes do not always signify the importance of a shift in the bacterioplankton community metagenomics under conditions of thermal pollution in subtropical summer seawater for the functional redundancy at community level louca et al 2018 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing it is believed that the bccs are less useful than functional metagenomics for predicting ecosystem functioning tringe et al 2005 here we aimed to determine the impact of thermal pollution on summer bacterioplankton community metagenomics and their potential adaptation strategies to do so we carried out metagenomic sequencing to study summer bacterioplankton communities under thermal pollution derived from the cooling water from two nuclear power stations the daya bay nuclear power station dnps and the lingao nuclear power station lnps in a subtropical bay daya bay located on the northern coast of the south china sea subjected to long term 15 y thermal pollution ren et al 2019 we hypothesized that 1 the functional regulation might be a key determinant of bacterioplankton community assembly in systems with long term thermal pollution 2 the bacterial taxa with specific molecular strategies for coping with high temperature stress might become dominant under long term thermal pollution 3 thermal pollution might also cause changes in the matter and energy metabolic pathways of bacterioplankton communities we believe that the results of our study will contribute importantly to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of community adaptation to global extreme warming in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sample collection and chemical determination the thermal discharge area is located in daya bay in the northern south china sea 22 5 n to 22 9 n 114 5 e to 114 9 e between shenzhen and huizhou in guangdong province near hong kong fig s1 the 1 800 mw daya bay nuclear power station dnps has been in operation since 1994 and discharges heated water at a rate of 2 9 107 m3 year hao et al 2016 another nuclear power station the lingao nuclear power station lnps located near dnps has been in operation since 2002 in the cooling system cooling water is drawn from intake points in a coastal water body heated water is released back into the same water body at a unified outlet site away from the intake points the thermal effluents in the discharge area have a mean velocity of about 0 08 m s wang et al 2014 hao et al 2016 in our study area daya bay the warmest months in the sampling year i e 2017 were june september having an average high temperature of approximate 31 0 c samples were

effluents mixed with the seawater after passing through the discharge canal fig s1 this hw site was set about 300 m away from the discharge canal to lower the potential stresses of the chemical factors such as chlorine saravanan et al 2008 the remaining site was set as natural control water nw and was located near the inflow area of the cooling system upstream of the thermal effluents shown as ss5 in ren et al 2019 fig s1 in each sampling site we set 6 replicates 5 l surface seawater was collected at each of 6 replicates and filtered through 0 2 m pore size isopore filters millipore

threshold of 80 to minimize bias caused by sequencing depth all singletons and otus occurring in less than two samples were excluded from the further analysis 2 3 metagenomics sequencing and analysis for the dna samples collected from both natural water nw and heated water hw caused by thermal pollution we randomly selected three to perform metagenomics sequencing a shotgun metagenomic library was

a minimum counting length of 200 bp and a minimum average coverage of 3 orfs open reading frames of the assembled countings 200 bp were identified by prodigal software hyatt et al 2010 these orfs were then annotated using diamond based on kegg databases buchfink et al 2015 bowtie was used to map raw reads to orfs langmead and salzberg 2012 the abundance of each orf was calculated as reads per

sampling regions i e nw and hw were further annotated using the online kegg databases https www genome jp kegg to avoid possible sequencing bias the bacterioplankton metabolic potential in this study was assessed by the relative abundance of rpkm in each sample 2 4 statistical analyses the differences in bacterioplankton taxonomy family genus and otu between the nw and hw samples were tested and

bacterioplankton taxa including synechococcus alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas and 306 key genes involving in biological biosynthesis and metabolism heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins genetic information processing and biofilm formation were selected to perform the taxa function relationship analysis the results showed that compared with alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas synechococcus had more specific genes in photosynthesis including the pathways related to photosystem i photosystem ii cytochrome b6 f complex photosynthethic electron transport and energy production and in carbon fixation of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle calvin cycle fig 5 but seldom had genes for coping with high temperature stress such as genes involved in dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycan as well as genes related to a set of pathways involved in biofilm formulation including the signaling pathway quorum sensing flagellar assembly bacterial chemotaxis bacterial secretion system polysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation in contrast to synechococcus bacterial taxa of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas not only had the genes for coping with high temperature stress but also had specific genes involved in organic compounds degradation nitrate nitrite transport dissimilatory nitrate reduction aerobic respiration and energy production fig 5 as the increased relative abundance of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas under thermal pollution their related gene abundance was also raised fig 5 4 discussion despite increasing interest in thermal affected microbial communities due to their importance in the study of climate change hutchins and fu 2017 cavicchioli et al 2019 much remains to be learned of how natural bacterioplankton communities respond to long term thermal stress we used the natural seawater approximate 31 c as references to investigate the changes of bacterioplankton biodiversity and functional potentials in the heated seawater caused by thermal pollution approximate 39 c thermal pollution has occurred in the studied area for more than 15 years and has thus had long term thermal impact on the marine ecology and environment we found that thermal pollution causing an increase in the summer seawater temperature around 8 c in comparison with the ambient seawater temperature significantly decreased the bacterioplankton metabolic potentials involved in photosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation carbon fixation dna replication rna polymerase and ribosomes and protein export in a summer subtropical bay fig 6 moreover likely to deal with the thermal stress the bacterioplankton community also adopted a set of adaption strategies in the metabolic pathways we observed that bacterioplankton community metagenomics significantly upregulated genes in dissimilatory nitrate reduction organic compounds degradation dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins two component response systems the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid and biofilm formation fig 6 4 1 thermal pollution significantly inhibited bacterioplankton photosynthesis and carbon fixation photosynthesis is an autotrophic process of photosynthetic bacteria such as cyanobacteria in which carbon dioxide is converted to complex organic compounds kolber et al 2000 previous studies focusing on the harmful effects of abiotic stresses on the photosynthesis of photosynthetic microorganisms revealed that abiotic stresses might promote the accumulation of ros and denature proteins and reduce the membrane fluidity thus causing irreversible damage to photosystems photosystem i photosystem ii and halting the cell growth of photosynthetic bacteria hongsthong et al 2008 latifi et al 2009 mackey et al 2015 pittera et al 2014 we observed that thermal pollution causing an increase in the summer seawater temperature around 8 c in comparison with the ambient seawater temperature significantly decreased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria and reduced the overall bacterioplankton community metagenomics in photosynthesis here the photosynthetic bacteria were primarily synechococcus cyanobacteria which accounts for a substantial fraction of marine primary production in coastal ecosystems flombaum et al 2013 high water temperature here approximate 39 c exceeding the optimum growth temperature of most bacteria probably acts as a stressor and might affect a wide range of cellular functions from the photosynthetic apparatus to metabolic reactions hongsthong et al 2009 pittera et al 2017 apart from high temperature chemical factors in thermal discharged water such as chlorine which are added to control biofouling on cooling system components may also impose a stress on bacterioplankton growth and various metabolic reactions poornima et al 2005 saravanan et al 2008 our study revealed that the bacterioplankton photosynthesis potentials involved in photosystem i e g psaa psab psad psae etc and photosystem ii e g psba psbc psbd psbf etc were significantly inhibited by thermal pollution resulting in an overall reduction of the synthase potentials of nadph and atp hongsthong et al 2009 the limited metabolic potentials in electron transport e g ferredoxin nadp reductase and energy production e g f type atpase might lower the co2 fixing ability and the synthesis of organic carbon in our study we found that the co2 fixation potentials by the rbcl and rbcs encoding calvin cycle and the ppdk and sdha encoding arnon buchanan cycle were both significantly decreased by thermal pollution the major components of bacterial biomass are macromolecules notably fatty acids proteins and nucleic acid pelikan et al 2021 previous studies found that the primary bacterioplankton metabolic potentials involved in these macromolecules were significantly down regulated at exposure to abiotic stressors reva et al 2006 liao et al 2019 corresponding results were recorded in our thermal pollution area we observed that the synthesis potentials of bio products such as fatty acids purine pyrimidine aminoacyl trna and cofactor were significantly decreased by thermal pollution the down regulation of the metabolic potentials of carbon fixation nadph nadh production and the synthesis of bio products under thermal pollution might affect their potential to further generate atp which is used for maintaining metabolic processes under stressful condition kvint et al 2003 in addition our study showed that bacterioplankton community metagenomics involved in dna replication rna polymerase ribosomes and protein export were reduced upon thermal pollution this result further confirms that long term thermal discharge may stress bacterial cellular growth hongsthong et al 2009 pittera et al 2017 leading to lower bacterial density under thermal stress fig s5a 4 2 thermal pollution shifted bacterioplankton functional structure from synechococcus dominated autotrophy to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas dominated heterotrophy likely reflecting the environmental filtering effect of thermal pollution on bacterioplankton community assembly we observed that the bacterioplankton community compositions changed from synechococcus in the natural seawater to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas in the heated seawater caused by thermal pollution compared with marine primary producers synechococcus flombaum et al 2013 heterotrophic bacteria alteromonas were found having a broader growth temperature between 10 and 43 c lópez pérez et al 2012 and are considered to be opportunistic copiotrophs i e r strategist multiplying fast which generally co occur with vibrio and pseudoalteromonas in marine ecosystems nelsona and wearb 2014 the composition shifts in bacterioplankton communities induced by thermal pollution from synechococcus dominance to alteromonas dominance might change the ecosystem function from a state of autotrophy to heterotrophy in the thermal region the genes bkda1 bkda2 bkdb asta astb huth huti etc in the amino acid degradation pathways were enriched besides there were higher abundancse of fatty acids purine pyrimidine cellobiose starch maltose and trehalose degradation genes such as celf encoding 6 phospho beta glucosidase bglb encoding beta glucosidase pula encoding pullulanase amya encoding alpha amylase and trea encoding alpha trehalase these increased abundances of genes in the organic compounds degradation were probably due to greater copy numbers of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas of which alteromonas prefers to exploit dissolved organic matter released by the detrital biomass and their degradation products as reported in a genome analysis yu et al 2013 nelsona and wearb 2014 shi et al 2017 an increased detrital biomass caused by effects of entrapment from the cooling system of the nuclear power plants van densen and hadderingh 1982 might therefore act as carbon and nitrogen sources for the bacterioplankton communities in the thermal discharge area apart from the increased degradation capacity of organic compounds in this study it was inferred that under thermal stress the bacterioplankton community probably complemented for the decreased influx potential of light energy through aerobic respiration of oxidative phosphorylation and nitrogen metabolism we found that bacterioplankton communities significantly increased their metabolic potentials in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathway dissimilatory nitrate reduction is used for respiration and for nitrogen assimilation into bacterial biomass van den berg et al 2015 it is reported that it comprises two different pathways including both denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra no3 no2 nh4 van den berg et al 2015 kuypers et al 2018 the reaction is catalyzed by either membrane bound nitrate reductase nar or periplasmic nitrate reductase nap moreno vivian et al 1999 nar reduces nitrate in the cytoplasm and releases protons into the periplasm and thereby directly contributes to energy conservation through the proton motive force van den berg et al 2015 in our study we observed that both nap e g napa and napb and nar e g narg narh and nari genes encoding dnra were significantly enriched in the thermal discharge area moreover there were higher abundances of gene nirs norc norb and nosz encoding denitrification pathways nevertheless denitrification and dnra are generally considered to be constrained to anaerobic conditions van den berg et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 in thermal discharge surface seawater where the temperature is high and oxygen levels slightly decreased ren et al 2019 the enhanced potentials of denitrification and dnra were probably due to the high abundances of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas of which pseudoalteromonas has an excellent no3 removal efficiency for their strong capacity in both processes of dnra and denitrification under aerobic conditions huang et al 2020 we therefore proposed that in this summer subtropical bay the bacterioplankton communities probably adapted to thermal pollution through the strategies of metabolic complementation in both matter and energy sources 4 3 bacterioplankton community adaptation to long term thermal pollution through the strategy of functional regulation for biological communities composed of unicellular organisms the regulation of functional metabolism is a key determinant of their community assembly gottschalk 1986 in our study the bacterioplankton community metagenomics underwent a significant change in its structure from synechococcus dominant to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas dominated under thermal pollution compared with synechococcus bacterial taxa alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas were found that had specific genes for coping with thermal stress such as genes involved in dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycan as well as genes related to a set of pathways involved in biofilm formulation this self regulation of bacterioplankton community metagenomics might enable it to protect itself from thermal stress and enhance its ability to adapt previous studies prove the necessity of dna modification and repair for the survival of bacterial isolates when exposed to high temperature stress hongsthong et al 2009 high temperature conditions and the potential effects of chemical factors such as chlorine might cause dna damage and thus induce endonuclease the mismatch repair protein or exodeoxyribonuclease in bacterial isolates to repair the damage resulting in an enhanced role in the dna repair pathways bauermeister et al 2012 similar results were observed at a community level in our study where we found that in order to adapt to thermal stress the bacterioplankton community metagenomics significantly up regulated genes such as nei encoding base excision repair lig1 encoding nucleotide excision repair mutl and muth encoding mismatch repair and ruva encoding homologous recombination moreover to cope with thermal stress the bacterioplankton metabolic potentials of heat shock proteins molecular chaperones and proteins of folding catalysts e g hsp15 hsp 90 secb fkpa cyclophilin and parvulin were significantly increased heat shock proteins molecular chaperones and proteins of folding catalysts play important roles in the conformational modifications e g folding refolding misfolding aggregation or degradation and the upregulated genes in heat shock molecular chaperones and proteins therefore benefit the homeostasis of proteins and the adaptability of the bacterioplankton under thermal stress kalmar and greensmith 2009 oksala et al 2014 thermal stress might also modulate membrane fluidity by affecting the unsaturation of the fatty acid chains of cell membranes kenkel et al 2013 unsaturated fatty acids are essential in bacterial biological membranes and the level of unsaturation in lipids controls the fluidity of membranes los and mironov 2015 in correspondence with this in this study we found that thermal stress increased the percent of the genes tesa tesb and ycia that encode enzymes to increase the biosynthesis of the saturated fatty acids los and mironov 2015 we suggested that the observed increase in the abundance of membrane lipid related genes was due to greater copy numbers of thermally tolerant ecotypes thomas et al 2012 for example we observed multiple copies of the unsaturated fatty acids synthesis genes in the genus alteromonas lópez pérez et al 2012 shi et al 2017 the formation of biofilm communities is probably another strategy for bacteria to improve their planktonic life under thermal stress rao 2010 the matrix biofilm might be efficient for bacterial hydrocarbon degradation and protect them from environmental stress and enhance their adaptation decho 2000 kent et al 2018 in this study we found that bacterioplankton community metagenomics upregulated the genes in a set of the functional potentials involved in biofilm formulation including the signaling pathway quorum sensing flagellar assembly bacterial chemotaxis bacterial secretion system polysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation under thermal stress among the processes of biofilm formation quorum sensing regulation regulates the initial transition from free living to attached states fei et al 2020 the alteration of lifestyle from free living to attached states and biofilm formation are probably components of marine bacterial adaptation to high temperature and slight declines in oxygen kent et al 2018 5 conclusions our study revealed that the functional regulation of bacterioplankton community metagenomics was a key determinant of their community assembly under long term thermal pollution 15 y from coastal nuclear power plants in summer in a subtropical bay bacterioplankton community under thermal pollution was significantly dominated by taxa alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas which had specific molecular strategies such as dna repair systems the heat shock response chaperones and proteins the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and biofilm formation to copy with thermal stress this self regulation of bacterioplankton community metagenomics might enable it to protect itself from thermal stress and enhance its ability to adapt but resulted in changes in the matter and energy metabolic pathways we observed that bacterioplankton metabolic pathways in organic compound degradation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction for the matter and energy acquisition were significantly up regulated under thermal pollution our findings are of significance for understanding marine microbial community ecology under future conditions of global warming considering the importance of bacterioplankton for the global matter cycle further exploration using for instance metatranscriptomic and

16082,thermal effluents from coastal nuclear power plants have led to undesirable pollution and subsequent ecological impacts on local marine ecosystems however despite the ecological importance we know little about the impacts on functionality of bacterioplankton subjected in systems with long term thermal pollution we used metagenomic sequencing to study of the effect of thermal pollution on bacterioplankton community metagenomics in summer in a subtropical bay located on the northern coast of the south china sea thermal pollution 15 y which resulted in an increase in the summer seawater temperature around 8 c and caused seawater temperature up to approximate 39 c significantly decreased bacterioplankton metabolic potentials in photosynthesis organic carbon synthesis and energy production the bacterioplankton community metagenomics underwent a significant change in its structure from synechococcus dominant autotrophy to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas dominated heterotrophy and significantly up regulated genes involved in organic compound degradation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction for the matter and energy acquisition under thermal pollution moreover the bacterioplankton community metagenomics showed an up regulation with heating of genes involved in dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins and proteins involved in other biological processes such as biofilm formation and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycan to adapt to the thermal environment collectively it indicates a functional regulation of bacterioplankton adaptation to high temperature stress which might advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of community adaptation to global extreme warming in aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thermal pollution bacterioplankton metagenomics functional adaptation subtropical bay 1 introduction many coastal ecosystems are subjected to undesired environmental disturbance resulting from increasing anthropogenic activities cai et al 2021 one being thermal pollution caused by cooling water effluents from coastal nuclear power plants shiah et al 2005 hao et al 2016 ren et al 2019 an increasing number of coastal nuclear power plants make it pressing to study the impact of thermal pollution on the marine environment and ecology the influence of thermal pollution on aquatic ecosystems has become an important environmental issue in the field of coastal environmental protection van vliet et al 2012 issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 and thermal pollution tends to have a negative impact on the abundance and community structure of fish teixeira et al 2009 zooplankton jiang et al 2009 phytoplankton chuang et al 2009 li et al 2011 bacteria xiong et al 2016 ren et al 2019 as well as their habitats madden et al 2013 hesselschwerdt and wantzen 2018 muthukumar et al 2021 in the coastal environment bacterioplankton which included both free living and particle attached lifestyles plays an important role in ecosystem functioning falkowski et al 2008 wang et al 2020 due to the short generation time and frequent genetic drift of bacterioplankton its community functionality may evolve concurrently with seawater temperature changes thomas et al 2012 and thereby affect the resilience of other organisms to thermal pollution mori et al 2013 despite the importance of bacterioplankton functionality knowledge is poor of how thermal pollution affects the functional potential of bacterioplankton communities and their potential adaptation strategies fetzer et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that temperature is a basic environmental factor affecting bacterioplankton community assembly in aquatic ecosystems fuhrman et al 2008 high temperature can alter bacterioplankton community metagenomics matsumoto et al 2021 and lead to changes in the matter and energy metabolism of bacterioplankton communities o connor et al 2009 yvon durocher et al 2014 on the other hand the bacterioplankton can adopt molecular strategies that help them to cope with thermal stress for instance some bacteria can regulate membrane fluidity by affecting the unsaturation of the fatty acid chains of cell membranes koga 2012 kenkel et al 2013 unsaturated fatty acids are essential in bacterial biological membranes and the level of unsaturation in lipids controls the fluidity of membranes los and mironov 2015 another well known mechanism of thermal adaptation is the synthesis of heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins which play important roles in the conformational modifications e g folding refolding misfolding aggregation or degradation of proteins and benefit the homeostasis of proteins under high temperature stress bloom et al 2007 oksala et al 2014 in a community the bacterial taxa with specific molecular strategies for coping with high temperature stress may become dominant when facing long term thermal pollution the regulation of functional metabolism for biological community composed of unicellular organisms is a key determinant of their community assembly gottschalk 1986 this self regulation of bacterioplankton community might enable it to protect itself from thermal stress and enhance its ability to adapt however currently the researches about molecular adaptive mechanisms to high temperature stress are mainly based on isolated strains which might not be representative for the whole community of bacteria to thermal stress at community level we know little about the potential functional adaptation strategies of bacterioplankton to thermal pollution in consequence of thermal discharge from the cooling system of coastal nuclear power plants in a recent study ren et al 2019 found that thermal pollution had a significant influence on the assembly of marine bacterioplankton communities based on 16s rrna gene sequencing in a subtropical bay located on the northern coast of the south china sea and they found the bacterioplankton community compositions bccs were more sensitive to thermal pollution in summer than in winter however the bcc changes do not always signify the importance of a shift in the bacterioplankton community metagenomics under conditions of thermal pollution in subtropical summer seawater for the functional redundancy at community level louca et al 2018 based on 16s rrna gene sequencing it is believed that the bccs are less useful than functional metagenomics for predicting ecosystem functioning tringe et al 2005 here we aimed to determine the impact of thermal pollution on summer bacterioplankton community metagenomics and their potential adaptation strategies to do so we carried out metagenomic sequencing to study summer bacterioplankton communities under thermal pollution derived from the cooling water from two nuclear power stations the daya bay nuclear power station dnps and the lingao nuclear power station lnps in a subtropical bay daya bay located on the northern coast of the south china sea subjected to long term 15 y thermal pollution ren et al 2019 we hypothesized that 1 the functional regulation might be a key determinant of bacterioplankton community assembly in systems with long term thermal pollution 2 the bacterial taxa with specific molecular strategies for coping with high temperature stress might become dominant under long term thermal pollution 3 thermal pollution might also cause changes in the matter and energy metabolic pathways of bacterioplankton communities we believe that the results of our study will contribute importantly to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of community adaptation to global extreme warming in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area sample collection and chemical determination the thermal discharge area is located in daya bay in the northern south china sea 22 5 n to 22 9 n 114 5 e to 114 9 e between shenzhen and huizhou in guangdong province near hong kong fig s1 the 1 800 mw daya bay nuclear power station dnps has been in operation since 1994 and discharges heated water at a rate of 2 9 107 m3 year hao et al 2016 another nuclear power station the lingao nuclear power station lnps located near dnps has been in operation since 2002 in the cooling system cooling water is drawn from intake points in a coastal water body heated water is released back into the same water body at a unified outlet site away from the intake points the thermal effluents in the discharge area have a mean velocity of about 0 08 m s wang et al 2014 hao et al 2016 in our study area daya bay the warmest months in the sampling year i e 2017 were june september having an average high temperature of approximate 31 0 c samples were collected on 28 july 2017 same as ren et al 2019 for this study we set two sampling sites one heated water site hw shown as ss1 in ren et al 2019 was located around the point where the thermal effluents mixed with the seawater after passing through the discharge canal fig s1 this hw site was set about 300 m away from the discharge canal to lower the potential stresses of the chemical factors such as chlorine saravanan et al 2008 the remaining site was set as natural control water nw and was located near the inflow area of the cooling system upstream of the thermal effluents shown as ss5 in ren et al 2019 fig s1 in each sampling site we set 6 replicates 5 l surface seawater was collected at each of 6 replicates and filtered through 0 2 m pore size isopore filters millipore billerica ma usa the filters were stored at 80 c until further analyses of the bacterioplankton communities which included both free living and particle attached lifestyles water temperature t

sequences were further aligned to the silva databases clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level and classified using the silva databases at the recommended bootstrap threshold of 80 to minimize bias caused by sequencing depth all singletons and otus occurring in less than two samples were excluded from the further analysis 2 3 metagenomics sequencing and analysis for the dna samples collected from both natural water nw and heated water hw caused by thermal pollution we randomly selected three to perform metagenomics sequencing a shotgun metagenomic library was constructed using the extracted genomic dna and sequenced using illumina hiseq platform quality trimming of raw sequence reads was performed by trimmomatic v 0 36 bolger et al 2014 with a leading or trailing bases quality score of 10 a four base window threshold of 20 and a minimum length of 20 bp de novo assembly of each sample sequence was conducted with spades v 3 8 2 bankevich et al 2012 with a minimum counting length of 200 bp and a minimum average coverage of 3 orfs open reading frames of the assembled countings 200 bp were identified by prodigal software hyatt et al 2010 these orfs were then annotated using diamond based on kegg databases buchfink et al 2015 bowtie was used to map raw reads to orfs langmead and salzberg 2012 the abundance of each orf was calculated as reads per

bacterioplankton taxa including synechococcus alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas and 306 key genes involving in biological biosynthesis and metabolism heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins genetic information processing and biofilm formation were selected to perform the taxa function relationship analysis the results showed that compared with alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas synechococcus had more specific genes in photosynthesis including the pathways related to photosystem i photosystem ii cytochrome b6 f complex photosynthethic electron transport and energy production and in carbon fixation of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle calvin cycle fig 5 but seldom had genes for coping with high temperature stress such as genes involved in dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycan as well as genes related to a set of pathways involved in biofilm formulation including the signaling pathway quorum sensing flagellar assembly bacterial chemotaxis bacterial secretion system polysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation in contrast to synechococcus bacterial taxa of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas not only had the genes for coping with high temperature stress but also had specific genes involved in organic compounds degradation nitrate nitrite transport dissimilatory nitrate reduction aerobic respiration and energy production fig 5 as the increased relative abundance of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas under thermal pollution their related gene abundance was also raised fig 5 4 discussion despite increasing interest in thermal affected microbial communities due to their importance in the study of climate change hutchins and fu 2017 cavicchioli et al 2019 much remains to be learned of how natural bacterioplankton communities respond to long term thermal stress we used the natural seawater approximate 31 c as references to investigate the changes of bacterioplankton biodiversity and functional potentials in the heated seawater caused by thermal pollution approximate 39 c thermal pollution has occurred in the studied area for more than 15 years and has thus had long term thermal impact on the marine ecology and environment we found that thermal pollution causing an increase in the summer seawater temperature around 8 c in comparison with the ambient seawater temperature significantly decreased the bacterioplankton metabolic potentials involved in photosynthesis oxidative phosphorylation carbon fixation dna replication rna polymerase and ribosomes and protein export in a summer subtropical bay fig 6 moreover likely to deal with the thermal stress the bacterioplankton community also adopted a set of adaption strategies in the metabolic pathways we observed that bacterioplankton community metagenomics significantly upregulated genes in dissimilatory nitrate reduction organic compounds degradation dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins two component response systems the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid and biofilm formation fig 6 4 1 thermal pollution significantly inhibited bacterioplankton photosynthesis and carbon fixation photosynthesis is an autotrophic process of photosynthetic bacteria such as cyanobacteria in which carbon dioxide is converted to complex organic compounds kolber et al 2000 previous studies focusing on the harmful effects of abiotic stresses on the photosynthesis of photosynthetic microorganisms revealed that abiotic stresses might promote the accumulation of ros and denature proteins and reduce the membrane fluidity thus causing irreversible damage to photosystems photosystem i photosystem ii and halting the cell growth of photosynthetic bacteria hongsthong et al 2008 latifi et al 2009 mackey et al 2015 pittera et al 2014 we observed that thermal pollution causing an increase in the summer seawater temperature around 8 c in comparison with the ambient seawater temperature significantly decreased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria and reduced the overall bacterioplankton community metagenomics in photosynthesis here the photosynthetic bacteria were primarily synechococcus cyanobacteria which accounts for a substantial fraction of marine primary production in coastal ecosystems flombaum et al 2013 high water temperature here approximate 39 c exceeding the optimum growth temperature of most bacteria probably acts as a stressor and might affect a wide range of cellular functions from the photosynthetic apparatus to metabolic reactions hongsthong et al 2009 pittera et al 2017 apart from high temperature chemical factors in thermal discharged water such as chlorine which are added to control biofouling on cooling system components may also impose a stress on bacterioplankton growth and various metabolic reactions poornima et al 2005 saravanan et al 2008 our study revealed that the bacterioplankton photosynthesis potentials involved in photosystem i e g psaa psab psad psae etc and photosystem ii e g psba psbc psbd psbf etc were significantly inhibited by thermal pollution resulting in an overall reduction of the synthase potentials of nadph and atp hongsthong et al 2009 the limited metabolic potentials in electron transport e g ferredoxin nadp reductase and energy production e g f type atpase might lower the co2 fixing ability and the synthesis of organic carbon in our study we found that the co2 fixation potentials by the rbcl and rbcs encoding calvin cycle and the ppdk and sdha encoding arnon buchanan cycle were both significantly decreased by thermal pollution the major components of bacterial biomass are macromolecules notably fatty acids proteins and nucleic acid pelikan et al 2021 previous studies found that the primary bacterioplankton metabolic potentials involved in these macromolecules were significantly down regulated at exposure to abiotic stressors reva et al 2006 liao et al 2019 corresponding results were recorded in our thermal pollution area we observed that the synthesis potentials of bio products such as fatty acids purine pyrimidine aminoacyl trna and cofactor were significantly decreased by thermal pollution the down regulation of the metabolic potentials of carbon fixation nadph nadh production and the synthesis of bio products under thermal pollution might affect their potential to further generate atp which is used for maintaining metabolic processes under stressful condition kvint et al 2003 in addition our study showed that bacterioplankton community metagenomics involved in dna replication rna polymerase ribosomes and protein export were reduced upon thermal pollution this result further confirms that long term thermal discharge may stress bacterial cellular growth hongsthong et al 2009 pittera et al 2017 leading to lower bacterial density under thermal stress fig s5a 4 2 thermal pollution shifted bacterioplankton functional structure from synechococcus dominated autotrophy to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas dominated heterotrophy likely reflecting the environmental filtering effect of thermal pollution on bacterioplankton community assembly we observed that the bacterioplankton community compositions changed from synechococcus in the natural seawater to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas in the heated seawater caused by thermal pollution compared with marine primary producers synechococcus flombaum et al 2013 heterotrophic bacteria alteromonas were found having a broader growth temperature between 10 and 43 c lópez pérez et al 2012 and are considered to be opportunistic copiotrophs i e r strategist multiplying fast which generally co occur with vibrio and pseudoalteromonas in marine ecosystems nelsona and wearb 2014 the composition shifts in bacterioplankton communities induced by thermal pollution from synechococcus dominance to alteromonas dominance might change the ecosystem function from a state of autotrophy to heterotrophy in the thermal region the genes bkda1 bkda2 bkdb asta astb huth huti etc in the amino acid degradation pathways were enriched besides there were higher abundancse of fatty acids purine pyrimidine cellobiose starch maltose and trehalose degradation genes such as celf encoding 6 phospho beta glucosidase bglb encoding beta glucosidase pula encoding pullulanase amya encoding alpha amylase and trea encoding alpha trehalase these increased abundances of genes in the organic compounds degradation were probably due to greater copy numbers of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas of which alteromonas prefers to exploit dissolved organic matter released by the detrital biomass and their degradation products as reported in a genome analysis yu et al 2013 nelsona and wearb 2014 shi et al 2017 an increased detrital biomass caused by effects of entrapment from the cooling system of the nuclear power plants van densen and hadderingh 1982 might therefore act as carbon and nitrogen sources for the bacterioplankton communities in the thermal discharge area apart from the increased degradation capacity of organic compounds in this study it was inferred that under thermal stress the bacterioplankton community probably complemented for the decreased influx potential of light energy through aerobic respiration of oxidative phosphorylation and nitrogen metabolism we found that bacterioplankton communities significantly increased their metabolic potentials in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathway dissimilatory nitrate reduction is used for respiration and for nitrogen assimilation into bacterial biomass van den berg et al 2015 it is reported that it comprises two different pathways including both denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra no3 no2 nh4 van den berg et al 2015 kuypers et al 2018 the reaction is catalyzed by either membrane bound nitrate reductase nar or periplasmic nitrate reductase nap moreno vivian et al 1999 nar reduces nitrate in the cytoplasm and releases protons into the periplasm and thereby directly contributes to energy conservation through the proton motive force van den berg et al 2015 in our study we observed that both nap e g napa and napb and nar e g narg narh and nari genes encoding dnra were significantly enriched in the thermal discharge area moreover there were higher abundances of gene nirs norc norb and nosz encoding denitrification pathways nevertheless denitrification and dnra are generally considered to be constrained to anaerobic conditions van den berg et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 in thermal discharge surface seawater where the temperature is high and oxygen levels slightly decreased ren et al 2019 the enhanced potentials of denitrification and dnra were probably due to the high abundances of alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas of which pseudoalteromonas has an excellent no3 removal efficiency for their strong capacity in both processes of dnra and denitrification under aerobic conditions huang et al 2020 we therefore proposed that in this summer subtropical bay the bacterioplankton communities probably adapted to thermal pollution through the strategies of metabolic complementation in both matter and energy sources 4 3 bacterioplankton community adaptation to long term thermal pollution through the strategy of functional regulation for biological communities composed of unicellular organisms the regulation of functional metabolism is a key determinant of their community assembly gottschalk 1986 in our study the bacterioplankton community metagenomics underwent a significant change in its structure from synechococcus dominant to alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas dominated under thermal pollution compared with synechococcus bacterial taxa alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas were found that had specific genes for coping with thermal stress such as genes involved in dna repair systems heat shock responsive chaperones and proteins and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycan as well as genes related to a set of pathways involved in biofilm formulation this self regulation of bacterioplankton community metagenomics might enable it to protect itself from thermal stress and enhance its ability to adapt previous studies prove the necessity of dna modification and repair for the survival of bacterial isolates when exposed to high temperature stress hongsthong et al 2009 high temperature conditions and the potential effects of chemical factors such as chlorine might cause dna damage and thus induce endonuclease the mismatch repair protein or exodeoxyribonuclease in bacterial isolates to repair the damage resulting in an enhanced role in the dna repair pathways bauermeister et al 2012 similar results were observed at a community level in our study where we found that in order to adapt to thermal stress the bacterioplankton community metagenomics significantly up regulated genes such as nei encoding base excision repair lig1 encoding nucleotide excision repair mutl and muth encoding mismatch repair and ruva encoding homologous recombination moreover to cope with thermal stress the bacterioplankton metabolic potentials of heat shock proteins molecular chaperones and proteins of folding catalysts e g hsp15 hsp 90 secb fkpa cyclophilin and parvulin were significantly increased heat shock proteins molecular chaperones and proteins of folding catalysts play important roles in the conformational modifications e g folding refolding misfolding aggregation or degradation and the upregulated genes in heat shock molecular chaperones and proteins therefore benefit the homeostasis of proteins and the adaptability of the bacterioplankton under thermal stress kalmar and greensmith 2009 oksala et al 2014 thermal stress might also modulate membrane fluidity by affecting the unsaturation of the fatty acid chains of cell membranes kenkel et al 2013 unsaturated fatty acids are essential in bacterial biological membranes and the level of unsaturation in lipids controls the fluidity of membranes los and mironov 2015 in correspondence with this in this study we found that thermal stress increased the percent of the genes tesa tesb and ycia that encode enzymes to increase the biosynthesis of the saturated fatty acids los and mironov 2015 we suggested that the observed increase in the abundance of membrane lipid related genes was due to greater copy numbers of thermally tolerant ecotypes thomas et al 2012 for example we observed multiple copies of the unsaturated fatty acids synthesis genes in the genus alteromonas lópez pérez et al 2012 shi et al 2017 the formation of biofilm communities is probably another strategy for bacteria to improve their planktonic life under thermal stress rao 2010 the matrix biofilm might be efficient for bacterial hydrocarbon degradation and protect them from environmental stress and enhance their adaptation decho 2000 kent et al 2018 in this study we found that bacterioplankton community metagenomics upregulated the genes in a set of the functional potentials involved in biofilm formulation including the signaling pathway quorum sensing flagellar assembly bacterial chemotaxis bacterial secretion system polysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation under thermal stress among the processes of biofilm formation quorum sensing regulation regulates the initial transition from free living to attached states fei et al 2020 the alteration of lifestyle from free living to attached states and biofilm formation are probably components of marine bacterial adaptation to high temperature and slight declines in oxygen kent et al 2018 5 conclusions our study revealed that the functional regulation of bacterioplankton community metagenomics was a key determinant of their community assembly under long term thermal pollution 15 y from coastal nuclear power plants in summer in a subtropical bay bacterioplankton community under thermal pollution was significantly dominated by taxa alteromonas vibrio and pseudoalteromonas which had specific molecular strategies such as dna repair systems the heat shock response chaperones and proteins the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and biofilm formation to copy with thermal stress this self regulation of bacterioplankton community metagenomics might enable it to protect itself from thermal stress and enhance its ability to adapt but resulted in changes in the matter and energy metabolic pathways we observed that bacterioplankton metabolic pathways in organic compound degradation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction for the matter and energy acquisition were significantly up regulated under thermal pollution our findings are of significance for understanding marine microbial community ecology under future conditions of global warming considering the importance of bacterioplankton for the global matter cycle further exploration using for instance metatranscriptomic and functional assay data should be implemented in combination with biogeochemical approaches author contribution lijuan ren and xingyu song made contributions to the design of the work lijuan ren and

16083,cethyltrimethylammonium chloride ctma is one of the most used quaternary ammonium compounds qacs in consumer products ctma and other qacs are only partially eliminated in municipal wastewater treatment and they can interact with bacteria in biological processes currently there is only limited information on the antimicrobial efficiency of ctma in matrices other than standard growth media and if and how ctma influences conventional chemical disinfection the results obtained in this study showed that the susceptibility of e coli to ctma was significantly enhanced in phosphate buffered saline lake water and wastewater compared to broth in broth a minimum inhibitory concentration mic of ctma of 20 mgl 1 was observed for e coli whereas a 4 log inactivation occurred for ctma concentrations of about 4 mgl 1 in buffered ultra purified water a lake water and wastewater effluent the impacts of the pre exposure and the presence of ctma on inactivation by ozone and monochloramine were tested with three different e coli strains ag100 with the efflux pump acrab intact ag100a with it deleted and ag100tet with it overexpressed pre exposure of e coli ag100 to ctma led to an increased susceptibility for ozone with second order inactivation rate constants 106 m 1s 1 increasing by a factor of about 1 5 an opposite trend was observed for monochloramine with second order inactivation rate constants 103 m 1s 1 decreasing by a factor of about 2 for e coli ag100tet the second order inactivation rate constant decreased by a factor of almost 2 and increased by a factor of about 1 5 for ozone and monochloramine respectively relative to the strain ag100 the simultaneous presence of ctma and ozone enhanced the second order inactivation rate constants for ctma concentrations of 2 5 mgl 1 by a factor of about 3 for monochloramine also an enhancement of the inactivation was observed which was at least additive but might also be synergistic enhancement by factors from about 2 to 4 5 were observed for ctma concentrations 2 5 mgl 1 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ozone monochloramine e coli susceptibility disinfection kinetics 1 introduction quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used compounds for different purposes gilbert and mcbain 2003 hegstad et al 2010 hora et al 2020 maillard et al 2013 mcdonnell and russell 1999 morrison et al 2019 such as disinfection but also as surfactants preservatives or biological stains some of them are commonly used in consumers products hegstad et al 2010 maillard et al 2013 mcdonnell and russell 1999 qacs are used because of their broad spectrum antimicrobial and surfactant like properties they contain an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon chain with a chain length between 12 and 18 carbons and a quaternary ammonium group the antimicrobial effect of qacs is linked to the hydrocarbon chain length with an optimum bactericidal effect with 12 14 carbons this is hypothesized to correspond to the length required to penetrate the bacterial cell membrane jennings et al 2016a 2016b minbiole et al 2016 morrison et al 2019 ctma for which the structure is provided in fig 1 possesses an alkyl chain composed of 16 carbons which is close to the ideal length to penetrate the bacterial membrane the widespread use of ctma in consumer products in addition to its presence in industrial products warrants further investigations on this compound hegstad et al 2010 furthermore in contrast to other qacs ctma is an individual compound and not a mixture and therefore more suitable for experiments under controlled conditions qacs act on bacteria by destabilization of the cell membrane formation of micelles of qacs and cell membrane components ultimately leading to membrane solubilization and cell lysis jennings et al 2016b low concentrations of qacs in the sub inhibitory range have been shown to promote resistance in bacteria thomas et al 2000 voumard et al 2020 additionally promotion of resistance to antibiotics has been observed in some cases buffet bataillon et al 2016 2012 hegstad et al 2010 but not in others the resistance mechanisms promoted below minimum inhibitory concentrations mics of qacs are mostly achieved by modifications of the outer and inner cell membrane the density and structure of porins and overexpression of efflux pumps including some that are specific for qacs buffet bataillon et al 2016 chapman 2003 fernandes et al 2003 jaglic and cervinkova 2012 levy 2002 loughlin et al 2002 moen et al 2012 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 2011 walsh et al 2003b the inclusion of qacs such as ctma in industrial products and personal care products pcps results in their inevitable direct release to the aquatic environment and the presence in sewage systems and wastewater hegstad et al 2010 hora et al 2020 kümmerer 2001 and their removal during wastewater treatment is often incomplete boethling 1984 hora et al 2020 pati and arnold 2020 tezel and pavlostathis 2015 concentrations of qacs were detected in the mgl 1 range in hospital wastewater effluents kümmerer 2001 in the µgl 1 to mgl 1 range in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp influents kreuzinger et al 2007 kümmerer 2001 and in the µgl 1 to ngl 1 range in wwtp effluents pati and arnold 2020 removal of qacs during wastewater treatment occurs mostly by sorption onto sludge hora et al 2020 östman et al 2018 2017 the sorptive properties of qacs also lead to an accumulation in sediments with patterns corresponding to the yearly use of qacs and the concentrations in sediments were found to be quite high from µg kg to mg kg li and brownawell 2010 pati and arnold 2020 zhang et al 2015 and up to the g kg range for sewage sludge li and brownawell 2010 this creates environmental reservoirs for these contaminants the accumulation and possible local release of qacs in water from these reservoirs is of concern because of potential resistance promotion among bacteria in these aquatic environments boethling 1984 buffet bataillon et al 2012 hegstad et al 2010 maillard 2007 typically qac concentrations in wastewater effluents are below the calculated mics and therefore below the toxicity level of bacteria which were determined to be in the range of 5 60 mgl 1 for e coli mazzola et al 2009 mcdonnell and russell 1999 walsh et al 2003a 0 5 75 mgl 1 for s aureus mazzola et al 2009 mcdonnell and russell 1999 and 5 500 mgl 1 for p aeruginosa mcdonnell and russell 1999 voumard et al 2020 walsh et al 2003b even though the mics determined under standard conditions are useful to assess the efficiency of biocides they do not necessarily indicate the potential toxicity of qacs in natural waters mics are typically determined in broth or in agar and depend on the growth of bacteria wiegand et al 2008 even though these conditions are ideal for bacteria they are not representative of natural and technical aquatic systems where nutrients can be limited temperatures are lower than the optimum for bacterial growth and other parameters such as ph can influence the susceptibility of bacteria therefore broth can represent the worst case scenario in terms of the efficiency of qacs and the required dose but may not be a good model for other matrices moreover the determination of mics could lead to an overestimation of the susceptibility of bacteria to a biocide in a natural environment chemical disinfectants such as chlorine ozone or chloramine are often used to inactivate microorganisms during water treatment sedlak and von gunten 2011 von gunten 2018 among these disinfection methods ozone has been shown to be most efficient von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with second order inactivation rate constants in the order of 106 m 1 s 1 for e coli hunt and mariñas 1999 1997 inactivation by ozone occurs by direct oxidation with ozone hunt and mariñas 1997 leading to damages of membranes and internal cell components and ultimately to cell death cho et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 world health organization 2004 additionally ozone also reacts with nucleic acids leading to mutations in the cell and an inhibition of dna replication and ultimately division of the cell von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for other widely used disinfectants the inactivation kinetics are significantly lower heeb et al 2017 one case in point is monochloramine which was introduced to reduce the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes sedlak and von gunten 2011 the mode of action of monochloramine on bacteria is mostly unknown but some reactivity was found with cysteine and methionine dodd 2012 heeb et al 2017 a slow reaction with dna and rna dodd 2012 but no reaction is expected with fatty acids and polysaccharides of the cell membrane dodd 2012 the required oxidant exposures ct values for the same extent of inactivation of bacteria for monochloramine are several orders of magnitude higher compared to ozone or free chlorine cho et al 2010 dodd 2012 kouame and haas 1991 ramseier et al 2011 world health organization 2004 the presence of ctma before or during chemical disinfection of water and wastewater may be an additional factor influencing the inactivation efficiency of microorganisms to this end it is currently unknown if additive and or synergistic effects could occur for systems in which chemical disinfectants and qacs are both present ozone has very low reactivity with saturated qacs which ctma is part of corless et al 1989 delanghe et al 1991 because the quaternary ammonium group has no lone electron pair and aliphatic compounds have very low reactivity but reactions with unsaturated qacs can occur corless et al 1989 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 qacs are also expected to have very low reactivity with monochloramine heeb et al 2017 this absence of reactions between ozone or monochloramine and qacs and in particular ctma enables a simultaneous presence and allows an evaluation of combinations of qacs with ozone or with monochloramine in comparison to scenarios with pre exposure of bacteria to qacs before a chemical disinfection ozone and monochloramine disinfection kinetics have been well studied with several bacteria including e coli a gram negative bacterium therefore reference data on inactivation are available berry et al 2010 2009 holder et al 2013 hunt and mariñas 1999 1997 jacangelo et al 1991 kouame and haas 1991 lee et al 2016 zuma et al 2009 moreover the effect of several qacs has been studied on this bacterium buffet bataillon et al 2016 mcdonnell and russell 1999 walsh et al 2003b 2003a the existence of reference data for the inactivation of e coli by ozone and monochloramine as well as some information on the effect of qacs on it make this bacterium particularly interesting to investigate the combined effect of ctma and ozone or monochloramine moreover different strains of e coli are available which allows to investigate different variations of the same bacteria for instance strains with different levels of activation in the efflux pump system martins et al 2011 viveiros et al 2005 are particularly relevant to study considering that the resistance to qacs is known to be linked to the efflux pump system buffet bataillon et al 2016 levy 2002 poole 2005 2002 moreover efflux pumps have been shown to play a role in the inactivation of e coli by monochloramine berry et al 2010 holder et al 2013 the impact of ctma resistance and of mechanisms involved in the qac resistance such as efflux pumps on the inactivation by ozone or monochloramine has not been or very poorly investigated previously as the bacterial resistance to biocides and to qacs such as ctma is becoming a health concern it is relevant to be investigated the aims of this study were to i investigate the susceptibility of e coli to ctma in broth buffered ultra purified water secondary municipal wastewater effluent and a surface water and ii to investigate the impacts of pre exposure or simultaneous presence of ctma on the inactivation kinetics of different strains of e coli by ozone and monochloramine 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains e coli ag100 ag100a and ag100tet were kindly provided by miguel viveiros instituto de higiene e medicina tropical

streaked on luria bertani lb sigma aldrich switzerland agar and stored at 4 c weekly for short term storage bacterial stocks were prepared by inoculating 2 3 colonies into lb or mueller hinton broth mhb 2 cation adjusted sigma aldrich switzerland and incubated overnight 12 16 h 37 c 180 rpm mhb was enriched with 100 mgl 1 kanamycin for ag100a and 10 mgl 1 tetracycline for ag100tet to maintain the ctma adaptation mhb was enriched with it for the pre exposed strains the ctma concentrations used were 35 mgl 1 for ag100 and 25 mgl 1 ag100a overnight cultures were washed three times by centrifugation 5000 rpm 4 c 15 min and re suspended in phosphate buffered saline pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 concentrations of the bacteria were adjusted with pbs using the optical density at 600 nm od600 to reach an absorbance of 1 1 1 3 in a 1 cm cuvette which was determined to correspond to a concentration of 108 cfuml 1 colony forming units bacteria were enumerated by serial dilution in pbs and spreading 100 µl on agar media plate count agar pca sigma aldrich the limit of quantification of bacteria with this method is 1 cfuml 1 and only plates with colonies between 3 and 300 cfuml 1 were considered for experiments with monochloramine thiosulfate final concentration 1 mm was added to the pbs for the first dilution to quench monochloramine 2 2 quaternary ammonium compound the disinfection agent used in this study was cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctma cas 112 02 7 ctma solutions sigma aldrich switzerland had a concentration of 25 wt in h2o with the highest purity available stock solutions of 10 000 mgl 1 ctma were prepared in pbs pbs solutions were sterilized by autoclaving them prior to the addition of ctma and the stock solutions were filtered by 0 2 µm filters filtropur s 0 2s sarstedt switzerland the filter sterilized solutions were then further diluted with pbs to reach the concentrations of interest the stock solutions were kept at room temperature and used within a week 2 3 susceptibility to ctma in different water matrices the susceptibility of e coli was tested with four different media mhb pbs water from lake geneva switzerland and a secondary wastewater effluent from the wastewater treatment plant in morges switzerland the characteristics of the different media are presented in table 1 sterility of the water after filtration whatman nitrocellulose membrane filters 0 2 µm merck switzerland was checked by plating them on agar plates the different water matrices were spiked with bacteria to reach an initial concentration of 106 cfuml 1 different doses of ctma were added to the reactors and the solutions were mixed for 1 h at 600 rpm room temperature after one hour an aliquot was taken and serial diluted in pbs to be plated on pca for colony enumeration 2 4 ozone generation ozone was produced with an ozone generator model cmg 3 3 or cmg 3 5 innovatec rheinbach germany from pure oxygen the resulting ozone oxygen mixture was bubbled in ultra purified water milli q at 20 c the temperature was controlled using a recirculating chiller model f 108 büchi labortechnik ag switzerland and a cylindrical reaction vessel with thermostatic jacket when the room temperature exceeded 25 c the ozone stock solutions reached concentrations ranging from 0 45 to 0 55 mm the ozone concentration in the stock solution was measured for each experiment by direct spectrophotometry in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 260 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 2 5 ozone exposure during the experiments ozone exposures were controlled by a previously described method wolf et al 2018 briefly the ozone stability and hence the ozone exposure was controlled by its reaction with trans cinnamic acid t ca in the presence of tert butanol t buoh to avoid interferences by hydroxyl radicals t ca is highly reactive with ozone with a second order rate constant k 7 6 105 m 1s 1 at 20 c wolf et al 2018 and it does not affect the viability of bacteria data not shown in the protocol used for this study the ozone dose was determined by the difference between the initial and the final t ca concentration which differed from the original protocol where the produced benzaldehyde concentration was used wolf et al 2018 this choice was based on the finding that there was an interaction between the bacteria and benzaldehyde data not shown a detailed description of the method is provided in text s1 supporting information si 50 ml reactors were prepared each day of experiment with a range of t ca concentrations 100 400 µm in pbs t buoh 20 mm was added as hyxdroxyl radical oh scavenger during ozonation a 500 µl aliquot was taken before the experiment to determine the initial t ca concentration bacteria were added to the reactors to reach an initial concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 a 100 µl aliquot was taken to obtain the initial bacterial concentration the reactors were then sealed and an aliquot of the ozone stock solution was injected by a syringe to reach a range of concentrations of 50 375 µm and mixed at 600 rpm for 2 3 min during the ozone injection a second syringe connected to a 0 2 µm filter was inserted to avoid overpressure in the reactors and contamination by microorganisms the syringe was removed immediately after the ozone injection after 5 10 min when ozone was fully depleted two aliquots were withdrawn from the reactors the first was subjected to hplc analysis for t ca quantification text s1 and text s2 si and the second was diluted in pbs for bacteria quantification 2 6 monochloramine stock solutions of nh2cl 2 mm were produced on each experimental day by mixing solutions of hocl 4 mm and nh4cl 6 mm in sterile pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 in a 1 1 5 cl n molar ratio the solutions were mixed for one hour to ensure completion of monochloramine formation the concentration of monochloramine was determined using a previously published method schreiber and mitch 2005 by direct spectrophotometry at 245 nm and 295 nm the equations and molar extinction coefficients used are provided in text s3 si the determined monochloramine concentrations were between 1 7 and 2 mm and in the µm range for dichloramine as the solutions were further diluted to reach µm concentrations for monochloramine dichloramine became negligible as with ozone 50 ml reactors were prepared on each experimental day in parallel to the monochloramine solution the reactors were filled with pbs and bacteria to reach a concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 a sample was taken prior to the addition of monochloramine to determine the exact initial concentration of bacteria monochloramine was added and the reactors were closed and mixed at 600 rpm for the duration of the experiment 100 µl aliquots were withdrawn from the reactors at different time intervals between 0 and 120 min and mixed with pbs and thiosulfate for 2 3 min to quench monochloramine the samples were then further diluted and plated on pca for counting to determine the nh2cl exposure monochloramine concentrations in the reactors were measured at the beginning 2 5 5 µm and at the end of the experiments 2 4 5 µm by the dpd method 2 7 dpd method the concentrations of monochloramine in the reactors were monitored at the beginning and at the end of the experiment using the dpd method rice et al 2005 1 5 ml of the solution was added to a cuvette containing 75 µl of a dpd solution 200 mgl 1 edta 2 mll 1 sulfuric acid 2 75 gl 1 n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd sulfate salt and 75 µl of a buffer solution 46 g l 1 kh2po4 24 gl 1 nah2po4 800 mgl 1 edta 20 mgl 1 hgcl2 the absorbance at 510 nm was read immediately for free chlorine measurements as a control for the theoretical absence of free chlorine and a few crystals of ki were added for the chloramine measurements 2 8 pre exposure to ctma and determination of mic tubes containing 10 ml of mhb with a range of ctma concentrations were inoculated with 100 µl of an overnight culture of e coli ag100 or ag100a diluted to obtain a final concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 in the tube at the beginning of the cycle the tubes were incubated at 37 c and 180 rpm for 48 h and growth was examined the lowest concentration not presenting growth was determined as the mic according to the determined mic a new series of 10 ml mhb tubes was prepared and inoculated with 10µl of the bacterial solution from the tube with the highest concentration presenting growth a summary of the concentrations and mics obtained is presented in table s1 si this step was repeated 10 times a purity check was added after each cycle by striking the inoculate on non specific agar plate count agar pca sigma aldrich switzerland 2 9 data modelling and analysis 2 9 1 ozone ozone inactivation followed pseudo first order kinetics and was modelled using a modified version of the chick watson model hunt and mariñas 1997 the model was modified to take into account the ozone exposure instead of the contact time table 2 eq 1 hunt and mariñas 1997 the modeling and analysis were performed using the software r the following packages were used dplyr scales lsmeans the visualization of the data and the creation of the graphs were performed with the packages ggplot2 and gridextra 2 9 2 monochloramine the non linear inactivation curves for e coli by monochloramine were modelled using a previously published model geeraerd et al 2005 the model is empirical and takes into account a lag phase and a tailing the model was designed for inactivation curves as a function of time table 2 eq 2 and was modified in this study to take into account the oxidant exposure instead of the contact time only table 2 eq 3 the modeling and analysis were also performed using r the package nlsmicrobio baty et al 2015 baty and delignetter muller 2013 containing the geeraerd model was used in addition to the models for ozone the data visualization and the plotting of the figures were done by the same packages as for ozone 3 results and discussion 3 1 biocidal efficiency of ctma in different water matrices an initial mic of 25 mgl 1 ctma was obtained for the e coli strain ag100 in mhb with an increasing trend for multiple exposures to sub inhibitory levels of ctma table s1 si to assess the dependence of the susceptibility on the water matrices the biocidal efficiency of ctma was tested with four different waters for an experimental time of 60 min at room temperature the corresponding results are presented in fig 2 in absence of ctma no or little inactivation is visible no inactivation was visible in mhb for concentrations of up to 10 mgl 1 in the three other waters 4 log inactivation was achieved at ctma concentrations of about 5 mgl 1 the significant differences between the experiments with mhb and the other water matrices show that the water matrix composition seems to be an important factor several factors have been identified to influence the survival and replication of bacteria in natural waters including light temperature ph grazing of zooplankton or other predators such as bacteriophages osmotic pressure resistance to starvation and the presence of low molecular weight toxins giannakis et al 2014 scheuerman et al 1988 as the control experiments showed no differences in the number of colonies after one hour parameters such as light ph temperature and osmotic pressure can be ruled out since they were similar for all tested waters no inactivation was observed in the blank lake water and ww experiments indicating no effect of zooplankton or bacteriophages the presence of low molecular weight toxins would only be possible in lake water and wastewater however due to the similar results in pbs it seems an unlikely option the possible remaining factors are a limitation of available nutrients and interaction between ctma and mhb the first hypothesis is related to starvation of the cells indeed all media have no or a limited nutrient level compared to mhb long term starvation of e coli has been shown to lead to an exponential decay of the viability of the cells schink et al 2019 to maintain viability the presence of nutrients is crucial and it has been demonstrated that adaptation was possible for e coli in nutrient deprived environments by e g the use of nutrients from dead cells schink et al 2019 however with the short time exposure in the experiments of this study 60 min adaptation and survival in presence of ctma was probably not possible in a nutrient deprived medium additionally the absence of starvation of the cells prior the experiment also reduced the probability of the nutrient limitation hypothesis without completely excluding it the second possibility is the interaction of ctma with some components of the mhb ctma and qacs in general are cationic surfactants which can form micelles in aqueous media breider et al 2018 if the interaction between ctma and bacteria is based on electrostatic attraction with the positive charged head of ctma and the negatively charged membrane lysis of the cell is a result of the penetration of the ctma tail in the membrane the formation of micelles would prevent the penetration step by blocking the tail inside the micelle thus inhibiting the action of ctma turbidity was observed in mhb at high concentrations of ctma in this study and was also reported previously thomas et al 2000 this could be an indication of the formation of micelles in contrast to the other solutions where no such effect was observed the formation of larger and more stable micelles in mhb and not in pbs lake water or wastewater effluent would explain the differences observed in the susceptibility of e coli to ctma in the different waters the use of mic to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to ctma and qacs in general is useful to determine the efficiency at the point of use where the qacs may be in contact with solutions agents promoting the growth of bacteria however based on the observation that the water matrix plays an important role standard mic tests are less representative of the efficiency qacs in natural and technical aquatic systems such as wastewaters 3 2 effect of a pre exposure to ctma on the inactivation kinetics of ag100 and ag100a by ozone and monochloramine strains of e coli ag100 and ag100a were pre exposed to ctma using a stepwise protocol the susceptibility to ctma decreased after this exposure fig s1 si consistent with previous findings that showed a decrease in the susceptibility to qacs after exposure to sub inhibitory concentrations of ctma for p aeruginosa voumard et al 2020 after pre exposure to ctma the inactivation kinetics of the e coli strains by ozone and monochloramine were investigated the corresponding results for ozone and monochloramine are provided in figs 3 and s2 si inactivation curves for ozone followed pseudo first order kinetics and therefore a modified chick watson approach was applied table 2 eq 1 the quality of the fit of the model was assessed with r2 values which were in the range of 0 72 0 95 table s2 si all the obtained second order rate constants for ozone are in the order of 106 m 1s 1 and summarized in fig 4 a and table s4 si for monochloramine the inactivation curves presented a lag phase and no tail fig 3b modeling was performed with a modified version of the empirical geeraerd model geeraerd et al 2005 table 2 eq 3 and fitting of the curves was assessed using r2 values which were in the range of 0 98 and 0 99 table s3 si for monochloramine the second order rate constant is calculated from the linear section of the inactivation plot all the obtained second order rate constants for monochloramine are in the order of 103 m 1s 1 and are summarized in fig 4b and table s3 si overall the obtained results differed between ozone and monochloramine pre exposed to ctma e coli ag100 and ag100a had a greater susceptibility to ozone with higher second order inactivation rate constants whereas the opposite trend was observed for monochloramine fig 4 moreover the overexpression of the acrab tolc efflux pump system in ag100tet led to a decreased and increased susceptibility to ozone and monochloramine respectively fig 4 overall the observed patterns are exactly opposite which indicates different modes of action for ozone and monochloramine ag100 ag100a and ag100tet differ by their expression of efflux pumps and antibiotic resistance kanamycin for ag100a and tetracycline for ag100tet the inactivation of the acrab tolc efflux pump system in ag100a had no effect on the inactivation kinetics by either ozone or monochloramine fig 4 this result indicates that a normal efflux is not involved in any resistance to ozone or monochloramine with no change in the susceptibility to both disinfectants in addition the kanamycin resistance of this strain is also not influencing the inactivation kinetics however the over expression of the same efflux pump system as in ag100tet has an impact on the kinetics of inactivation decreasing the second order rate constant by a factor of almost 2 for ozone and increasing it by a factor of 1 5 for monochloramine fig 4 tetracycline resistant bacteria were reported to have an increased susceptibility to chlorine in a previous study macauley et al 2006 it was suggested that the over expression of efflux pumps allowed more chlorine to interact with the bacterial cell membrane however it was not clear how this may happen macauley et al 2006 the results obtained here with monochloramine are consistent with this finding in the case of ozone the tetracycline resistance led to bacteria that are slightly more resistant previous studies on the ozonation of antibiotic resistant bacteria showed various results with either no differences in the susceptibility or a reduction in the susceptibility alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 heß and gallert 2015 oh et al 2014 rice et al 2005 however there is no evidence in the literature of a reduction in the susceptibility to ozone caused by efflux pumps the activation of efflux pumps is among the mechanisms of resistance to qacs buffet bataillon et al 2016 mc cay et al 2010 sundheim et al 1998 this was confirmed in the present study with the efflux of ethidium bromide a fluorescent substrate fig s3 si the decrease in the fluorescence of the colonies exposed to ctma confirmed the activation of multidrug efflux pumps following the exposure to ctma fig s3 si martins et al 2011 viveiros et al 2008 however the exact type of efflux pump is unknown furthermore the results differed between ag100tet and the pre exposed strains which indicates either that efflux pumps play no role in the susceptibility to ozone and monochloramine or that the type of efflux pump is crucial for monochloramine it has been shown that e coli with modifications of the expression of membrane proteins including a down regulation of the acre a multi drug efflux pump system led to a reduction in the susceptibility berry et al 2010 in another case the response of e coli to monochloramine showed an activation of genes belonging to the stress response mechanism including the activation of multidrug efflux systems holder et al 2013 these results show the complexity and the number of different mechanisms possible for the bacteria when responding to stress apart from the mechanisms of resistance membrane damages can also be the consequence of an exposure to ctma voumard et al 2020 bacteria pre exposed to ctma would have an alteration of the membrane and efflux pumps overexpressed as it was shown with ethidium bromide fig s3 si in the case of inactivation by ozone as the inactivation is very quick a membrane alteration could be the dominant factor and thus enhance the inactivation for monochloramine the inactivation is much slower with a difference of about 3 orders of magnitude for the second order rate constants compared to ozone fig 4 tables s2 and s3 si this lower reaction rate could allow the activated efflux pump system to pump out monochloramine thus reducing the inactivation overall the differences observed in the pre exposed strains compared to the other strains are caused by ctma but there might be multiple reasons of the observed changes it is interesting to note that the trends are opposite for ozone and monochloramine which indicates that this observation may be related to the different reactivities and properties of the applied chemical disinfectants 3 3 effect of the presence of ctma on the inactivation kinetics of ag100 by ozone and monochloramine since ctma has very low or no reactivity with ozone and monochloramine disinfection experiments can be performed in presence of ctma simultaneously with the selected chemical disinfectants qacs do not readily react with oxidants because the quaternary nitrogen does not have a lone electron pair the aliphatic chain also has a low reactivity with both ozone and nh2cl the use of a scavenger in the experiments prevent the reaction of hydroxyl radical which are formed during ozonation with the aliphatic chain of ctma therefore the ctma concentration will remain constant in the oxidation experiments this could be a possible situation in real water disinfection systems based on the data presented in fig 2 different concentrations of ctma in the range of 0 1 mgl 1 to 5 mgl 1 were selected for the combined experiments with ctma and chemical oxidants this range of qacs covers situations encountered in municipal hospital and industrial wastewaters with concentrations of up to 2 8 mgl 1 kreuzinger et al 2007 the concentrations in this study above the range detected in aquatic systems are not unrealistic and they were selected to investigate the combined effect of ctma and chemical oxidants over a wide range to better understand additive or synergistic effects inactivation curves for ozone and monochloramine are presented in figs 5 and s4 si and the corresponding second order rate constants obtained by the modified chick watson model and the modified geeraerd model are presented fig 6 the numerical values for the second order rate constants and the corresponding fitting parameters for each curve are provided in tables s4 and s5 si linearity was observed for ozone inactivation up to a concentration of 2 25 mgl 1 for higher concentrations the inactivation was too fast for the method used here to exhibit first order kinetics and the corresponding second order inactivation rate constants could not be determined and are therefore not presented in fig 6 a similar pattern for the second order inactivation rate constants of e coli was observed for the simultaneous presence of ctma and ozone or monochloramine fig 6 for low concentrations of ctma there is little influence on the inactivation kinetics for higher ctma concentrations the inactivation kinetics are enhanced resulting in higher second order inactivation rate constants an exponential type increase in the rate constant is visible for the inactivation by ozone in presence of ctma for concentrations 1 5 mgl 1 fig 6 this increase of inactivation efficiency is consistent with an additive or synergistic effect resulting from the combination of ozone with ctma there is only limited reactivity between ozone and ctma and therefore an antagonist effect is unlikely moreover ctma and ozone have different modes of action on the cell targeting different constituents while targeting different cell components they both act on the membrane leading to destabilization and permeation of it allowing an enhanced penetration of ozone inside the bacterial cell for monochloramine a gradual increase of the second order inactivation rate constants was observed for ctma concentrations between 2 5 and 5 mgl 1 in this case the curves showed similar patterns and the data shown in fig 5b could be modelled by the geeraerd model provided in table 2 therefore the individual contributions of ctma and monochloramine on the inactivation of e coli could be elucidated the inactivation curves representing the individual and combined contributions of monochloramine and ctma to the inactivation of e coli are shown in fig 7 to obtain similar levels of inactivation for the different ctma monochloramine combinations for the same time two different monochloramine concentrations were chosen 5 mgl 1 nh2cl for 2 and 2 5 mgl 1 of ctma and 2 5 mgl 1 nh2cl for 3 4 and 5 mgl 1 of ctma both concentrations of monochloramine led to similar levels of inactivation based on the monochloramine exposure fig s5 si at ctma concentrations 2 5 mgl 1 the inactivation curves are similar for monochloramine only and the combination of monochloramine with ctma demonstrating that monochloramine is the main contributor to inactivation at 3 mgl 1 ctma both monochloramine and ctma seem to contribute similarly to the inactivation for ctma concentrations 4mgl 1 the trend changes and inactivation seemed to be mostly controlled by ctma with only a minor effect of monochloramine these results indicate that there is at least an additive effect for the two disinfectants the mode of action of ctma and qacs in general is mainly the disruption of the cell membrane and the modes of action of ozone and monochloramine are based on reactions with various cell components a destabilization of the membrane enhances the penetration of ozone or monochloramine inside the cell allowing an enhanced inactivation moreover because ozone and monochloramine do not react with ctma a consumption of this qac is not expected during the reaction time of the experiment to investigate the combined effect the individual inactivation curves of ag100 for ctma 3 mgl 1 and monochloramine were added and compared to the combined experimentally observed inactivation a ctma concentration of 3 mgl 1 was chosen because of an apparent similar level of inactivation by individual treatment with monochloramine and ctma because the sampling times were different the curves were modelled using the geeraerd model and a good agreement between model and experiment was obtained for the individual treatments with monochloramine and ctma fig 8 the experimentally observed overall inactivation in the combined ctma monochloramine experiment is higher than calculated from the sum of the modelled curves for the individual inactivation experiments fig 8 this enhancement suggests a slight synergistic effect with not completely independent damages however the approximations of the modeling approach and the variation of the experimental data leave some uncertainty regarding synergism nevertheless it is clear from the data that there is no antagonistic effect and that the inactivation is faster and enhanced in presence of both ctma and monochloramine 4 conclusions the susceptibility of e coli to cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctma was investigated in different media mhb a common media used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics was compared to phosphate buffer saline pbs a secondary wastewater effluent and a lake water furthermore the impact of ctma on the inactivation kinetics of e coli by ozone and monochloramine was investigated for various strains of e coli ag100 ag100a ag100tet the main findings of this study are the susceptibility of e coli for ctma depends on the water quality and is higher in pbs secondary wastewater effluent and lake water than under standard conditions in mhb the standard determination of mic in broth is therefore not representative of natural and engineered aquatic systems and the assessment of the presence of qacs in the environment requires an alternative approach a pre exposure to ctma and the resulting reduction of susceptibility of e coli to ctma influences the inactivation kinetics by ozone and monochloramine the inactivation was enhanced for ozone and reduced for monochloramine this difference is due to different modes of action for ozone and monochloramine the role of the efflux pumps for the susceptibility to ozone or monochloramine could not be elucidated by the obtained results the different results obtained for strains expressing different types of efflux pumps ag100tet vs pre exposed strains indicates complex mechanisms which require further investigations the presence of mgl 1 of qacs during the inactivation by either ozone or monochloramine enhanced the inactivation of e coli the inactivation kinetics were at least additive for monochloramine and a potential synergistic effect needs to be confirmed by further investigations the combination of ozone with ctma resulted in non linear pseudo first order inactivation kinetics which could not be quantified nonetheless the presence of ctma led to enhanced inactivation compared to ozone alone natural waters and especially wastewater effluents contain a mixture of different qacs and other biocides the presence of these compounds during a chemical disinfection by ozone or monochloramine may enhance the inactivation of

16083,cethyltrimethylammonium chloride ctma is one of the most used quaternary ammonium compounds qacs in consumer products ctma and other qacs are only partially eliminated in municipal wastewater treatment and they can interact with bacteria in biological processes currently there is only limited information on the antimicrobial efficiency of ctma in matrices other than standard growth media and if and how ctma influences conventional chemical disinfection the results obtained in this study showed that the susceptibility of e coli to ctma was significantly enhanced in phosphate buffered saline lake water and wastewater compared to broth in broth a minimum inhibitory concentration mic of ctma of 20 mgl 1 was observed for e coli whereas a 4 log inactivation occurred for ctma concentrations of about 4 mgl 1 in buffered ultra purified water a lake water and wastewater effluent the impacts of the pre exposure and the presence of ctma on inactivation by ozone and monochloramine were tested with three different e coli strains ag100 with the efflux pump acrab intact ag100a with it deleted and ag100tet with it overexpressed pre exposure of e coli ag100 to ctma led to an increased susceptibility for ozone with second order inactivation rate constants 106 m 1s 1 increasing by a factor of about 1 5 an opposite trend was observed for monochloramine with second order inactivation rate constants 103 m 1s 1 decreasing by a factor of about 2 for e coli ag100tet the second order inactivation rate constant decreased by a factor of almost 2 and increased by a factor of about 1 5 for ozone and monochloramine respectively relative to the strain ag100 the simultaneous presence of ctma and ozone enhanced the second order inactivation rate constants for ctma concentrations of 2 5 mgl 1 by a factor of about 3 for monochloramine also an enhancement of the inactivation was observed which was at least additive but might also be synergistic enhancement by

susceptibility disinfection kinetics 1 introduction quaternary ammonium compounds are widely used compounds for different purposes gilbert and mcbain 2003 hegstad et al 2010 hora et al 2020 maillard et al 2013 mcdonnell and russell 1999 morrison et al 2019 such as disinfection but also as surfactants preservatives or biological stains some of them are commonly used in consumers products hegstad et al 2010 maillard et al 2013 mcdonnell and russell 1999 qacs are used because of their broad spectrum antimicrobial and surfactant like properties they contain an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon chain with a chain length between 12 and 18 carbons and a quaternary ammonium group the antimicrobial effect of qacs is linked to the hydrocarbon chain length with an optimum bactericidal effect with 12 14 carbons this is hypothesized to correspond to the length required to penetrate the bacterial cell membrane jennings et al 2016a 2016b minbiole et al 2016 morrison et al 2019 ctma for which the structure is provided in fig 1 possesses an alkyl chain composed of 16 carbons which is close to the ideal length to penetrate the bacterial membrane the widespread use of ctma in consumer products in addition to its presence in industrial products warrants further investigations on this compound hegstad et al 2010 furthermore in contrast to other qacs ctma is an individual compound and not a mixture and therefore more suitable for experiments under controlled conditions qacs act on bacteria by destabilization of the cell membrane formation of micelles of qacs and cell membrane components ultimately leading to membrane solubilization and cell lysis jennings et al 2016b low concentrations of qacs in the sub inhibitory range have been shown to promote resistance in bacteria thomas et al 2000 voumard et al 2020 additionally promotion of resistance to antibiotics has been observed in some cases buffet bataillon et al 2016 2012 hegstad et al 2010 but not in others the resistance

treatment occurs mostly by sorption onto sludge hora et al 2020 östman et al 2018 2017 the sorptive properties of qacs also lead to an accumulation in sediments with patterns corresponding to the

effluents are below the calculated mics and therefore below the toxicity level of bacteria which were determined to be in the range of 5 60 mgl 1 for e coli mazzola et al 2009 mcdonnell and russell 1999 walsh et al 2003a 0 5 75 mgl 1 for s aureus mazzola et al 2009 mcdonnell and russell 1999 and 5 500 mgl 1 for p aeruginosa mcdonnell and russell 1999 voumard et al 2020 walsh et al 2003b even though the mics determined under standard conditions are useful to assess the efficiency of biocides they do not necessarily indicate the potential toxicity of qacs in natural waters mics are typically determined in broth or in agar and depend on the growth of bacteria wiegand et al 2008 even though these conditions are ideal for bacteria they are not representative of natural and technical aquatic systems where nutrients can be limited temperatures are lower than the optimum for bacterial growth and other parameters such as ph can influence the susceptibility of bacteria therefore broth can represent the worst case scenario in terms of the efficiency of qacs and the required dose but may not be a good model for other matrices moreover the determination of mics could lead to an overestimation of the susceptibility of bacteria to a biocide in a natural environment chemical disinfectants such as chlorine ozone or chloramine are often used to inactivate microorganisms during water treatment sedlak and von gunten 2011 von gunten 2018 among these disinfection methods ozone has been shown to be most efficient von sonntag and von gunten 2012 with second order inactivation rate constants in the order of 106 m 1 s 1 for e coli hunt and mariñas 1999 1997 inactivation by ozone occurs by direct oxidation with ozone hunt and mariñas 1997 leading to damages of membranes and internal cell components and ultimately to cell death cho et al 2010 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 world health organization 2004 additionally ozone also reacts with nucleic acids leading to mutations in the cell and an inhibition of dna replication and ultimately division of the cell von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for other widely used disinfectants the inactivation kinetics are significantly lower heeb et al 2017 one case in point is monochloramine which was introduced to reduce the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes sedlak and von gunten 2011 the mode of action of monochloramine on bacteria is mostly unknown but some reactivity was found with cysteine and methionine dodd 2012 heeb et al 2017 a slow reaction with dna and rna dodd 2012 but no reaction is expected with fatty acids and polysaccharides of the cell membrane dodd 2012 the required oxidant exposures ct values for the same extent of inactivation of bacteria for monochloramine are several orders of magnitude higher compared to ozone or free chlorine cho et al 2010 dodd 2012 kouame and haas 1991 ramseier et al 2011 world health organization 2004 the presence of ctma before or during chemical disinfection of water and wastewater may be an additional factor influencing the inactivation efficiency of microorganisms to this end it is currently unknown if additive and or synergistic effects could occur for systems in which chemical disinfectants and qacs are both present ozone has very low reactivity with saturated qacs which ctma is part of corless et al 1989 delanghe et al 1991 because the quaternary ammonium group has no lone electron pair and aliphatic compounds have very low reactivity but reactions with unsaturated qacs can occur corless et al 1989 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 qacs are also expected to have very low reactivity with monochloramine heeb et al 2017 this absence of reactions between ozone or monochloramine and qacs and in particular ctma enables a simultaneous presence and allows an evaluation of combinations of qacs with ozone or with monochloramine in comparison to scenarios with pre exposure of bacteria to qacs before a chemical disinfection ozone and monochloramine disinfection kinetics have been well studied with several bacteria including e coli a gram negative bacterium therefore reference data on inactivation are available berry et al 2010 2009 holder et al 2013 hunt and mariñas 1999 1997 jacangelo et al 1991 kouame and haas 1991 lee et al 2016 zuma et al 2009 moreover the effect of several qacs has been studied on this bacterium buffet bataillon et al 2016 mcdonnell and russell 1999 walsh et al 2003b 2003a the existence of reference data for the inactivation of e coli by ozone and monochloramine as well as some information on the effect of qacs on it make this bacterium particularly interesting to investigate the combined effect of ctma and ozone or monochloramine moreover different strains of e coli are available which allows to investigate different variations of the same bacteria for instance strains with different levels of activation in the efflux pump system martins et al 2011 viveiros et al 2005 are particularly relevant to study considering that the resistance to qacs is known to be linked to the efflux pump system buffet bataillon et al 2016 levy 2002 poole 2005 2002 moreover efflux pumps have been shown to play a role in the inactivation of e coli by monochloramine berry et al 2010 holder et al 2013 the impact of ctma resistance and of mechanisms involved in the qac resistance such as efflux pumps on the inactivation by ozone or monochloramine has not been or very poorly investigated previously as the bacterial resistance to biocides and to qacs such as ctma is becoming a health concern it is relevant to be investigated the aims of this study were to i investigate the susceptibility of e coli to ctma in broth buffered ultra purified water secondary municipal wastewater effluent and a surface water and ii to investigate the impacts of pre exposure or simultaneous presence of ctma on the inactivation kinetics of different strains of e coli by ozone and monochloramine 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains e coli ag100 ag100a and ag100tet were kindly provided by miguel viveiros instituto de higiene e medicina tropical universidade nova de lisboa portugal characteristics of the strains are described elsewhere viveiros et al 2008 briefly ag100 has the efflux pump acrab intact ag100a has it deleted and ag100tet has it overexpressed martins et al 2011 bacteria were stored at 20 c in glycerol sigma aldrich switzerland and broth 20 glycerol for short term storage and at 80 c for long term storage frozen stocks were streaked on luria bertani lb sigma aldrich switzerland agar and stored at 4 c weekly for short term storage bacterial stocks were prepared by inoculating 2 3 colonies into lb or mueller hinton broth mhb 2 cation adjusted sigma aldrich switzerland and incubated overnight 12 16 h 37 c 180 rpm mhb was enriched with 100 mgl 1 kanamycin for ag100a and 10 mgl 1 tetracycline for ag100tet to maintain the ctma adaptation mhb was enriched with it for the pre exposed strains the ctma concentrations used were 35 mgl 1 for ag100 and 25 mgl 1 ag100a overnight cultures were washed three times by centrifugation 5000 rpm 4 c 15 min and re suspended in phosphate buffered saline pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 concentrations of the bacteria were adjusted with pbs using the optical density at 600 nm od600 to reach an absorbance of 1 1 1 3 in a 1 cm cuvette which was determined to correspond to a concentration of 108 cfuml 1 colony forming units bacteria were enumerated by serial dilution in pbs and spreading 100 µl on agar media plate count agar pca sigma aldrich the limit of quantification of bacteria with this method is 1 cfuml 1 and only plates with colonies between 3 and 300 cfuml 1 were considered for experiments with monochloramine thiosulfate final concentration 1 mm was added to the pbs for the first dilution to quench monochloramine 2 2 quaternary ammonium compound the disinfection agent used in this study was cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctma cas 112 02 7 ctma solutions sigma aldrich switzerland had a concentration of 25 wt in h2o with the highest purity available stock solutions of 10 000 mgl 1 ctma were prepared in pbs pbs solutions were sterilized by autoclaving them prior to the addition of ctma and the stock solutions were filtered by 0 2 µm filters filtropur s 0 2s sarstedt switzerland the filter sterilized solutions were then further diluted with pbs to reach the concentrations of interest the stock solutions were kept at room temperature and used within a week 2 3 susceptibility to ctma in different water matrices the susceptibility of e coli was tested with four different media mhb pbs water from lake geneva switzerland and a secondary wastewater effluent from the wastewater treatment plant in morges switzerland the characteristics of the different media are presented in table 1 sterility of the water after filtration whatman nitrocellulose membrane filters 0 2 µm merck switzerland was checked by plating them on agar plates the different water matrices were spiked with bacteria to reach an initial concentration of 106 cfuml 1 different doses of ctma were added to the reactors and the solutions were mixed for 1 h at 600 rpm room temperature after one hour an aliquot was taken and serial diluted in pbs to be plated on pca for colony enumeration 2 4 ozone generation ozone was produced with an ozone generator model cmg 3 3 or cmg 3 5 innovatec rheinbach germany from pure oxygen the resulting ozone oxygen mixture was bubbled in ultra purified water milli q at 20 c the temperature was controlled using a recirculating chiller model f 108 büchi labortechnik ag switzerland and a cylindrical reaction vessel with thermostatic jacket when the room temperature exceeded 25 c the ozone stock solutions reached concentrations ranging from 0 45 to 0 55 mm the ozone concentration in the stock solution was measured for each experiment by direct spectrophotometry in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 260 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 2 5 ozone exposure during the experiments ozone exposures were controlled by a previously described method wolf et al 2018 briefly the ozone stability and hence the ozone exposure was controlled by its reaction with trans cinnamic acid t ca in the presence of tert butanol t buoh to avoid interferences by hydroxyl radicals t ca is highly reactive with ozone with a second order rate constant k 7 6 105 m 1s 1 at 20 c wolf et al 2018 and it does not affect the viability of bacteria data not shown in the protocol used for this study the ozone dose was determined by the difference between the initial and the final t ca concentration which differed from the original protocol where the produced benzaldehyde concentration was used wolf et al 2018 this choice was based on the finding that there was an interaction between the bacteria and benzaldehyde data not shown a detailed description of the method is provided in text s1 supporting information si 50 ml reactors were prepared each day of experiment with a range of t ca concentrations 100 400 µm in pbs t buoh 20 mm was added as hyxdroxyl radical oh scavenger during ozonation a 500 µl aliquot was taken before the experiment to determine the initial t ca concentration bacteria were added to the reactors to reach an initial concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 a 100 µl aliquot was taken to obtain the initial bacterial concentration the reactors were then sealed and an aliquot of the ozone stock solution was injected by a syringe to reach a range of concentrations of 50 375 µm and mixed at 600 rpm for 2 3 min during the ozone injection a second syringe connected to a 0 2 µm filter was inserted to avoid overpressure in the reactors and contamination by microorganisms the syringe was removed immediately after the ozone injection after 5 10 min when ozone was fully depleted two aliquots were withdrawn from the reactors the first was subjected to hplc analysis for t ca quantification text s1 and text s2 si and the second was diluted in pbs for bacteria quantification 2 6 monochloramine stock solutions of nh2cl 2 mm were produced on each experimental day by mixing solutions of hocl 4 mm and nh4cl 6 mm in sterile pbs 10 mm ph 7 4 in a 1 1 5 cl n molar ratio the solutions were mixed for one hour to ensure completion of monochloramine formation the concentration of monochloramine was determined using a previously published method schreiber and mitch 2005 by direct spectrophotometry at 245 nm and 295 nm the equations and molar extinction coefficients used are provided in text s3 si the determined monochloramine concentrations were between 1 7 and 2 mm and in the µm range for dichloramine as the solutions were further diluted to reach µm concentrations for monochloramine dichloramine became negligible as with ozone 50 ml reactors were prepared on each experimental day in parallel to the monochloramine solution the reactors were filled with pbs and bacteria to reach a concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 a sample was taken prior to the addition of monochloramine to determine the exact initial concentration of bacteria monochloramine was added and the reactors were closed and mixed at 600 rpm for the duration of the experiment 100 µl aliquots were withdrawn from the reactors at different time intervals between 0 and 120 min and mixed with pbs and thiosulfate for 2 3 min to quench monochloramine the samples were then further diluted and plated on pca for counting to determine the nh2cl exposure monochloramine concentrations in the reactors were measured at the beginning 2 5 5 µm and at the end of the experiments 2 4 5 µm by the dpd method 2 7 dpd method the concentrations of monochloramine in the reactors were monitored at the beginning and at the end of the experiment using the dpd method rice et al 2005 1 5 ml of the solution was added to a cuvette containing 75 µl of a dpd solution 200 mgl 1 edta 2 mll 1 sulfuric acid 2 75 gl 1 n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd sulfate salt and 75 µl of a buffer solution 46 g l 1 kh2po4 24 gl 1 nah2po4 800 mgl 1 edta 20 mgl 1 hgcl2 the absorbance at 510 nm was read immediately for free chlorine measurements as a control for the theoretical absence of free chlorine and a few crystals of ki were added for the chloramine measurements 2 8 pre exposure to ctma and determination of mic tubes containing 10 ml of mhb with a range of ctma concentrations were inoculated with 100 µl of an overnight culture of e coli ag100 or ag100a diluted to obtain a final concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 in the tube at the beginning of the cycle the tubes were incubated at 37 c and 180 rpm for 48 h and growth was examined the lowest concentration not presenting growth was determined as the mic according to the determined mic a new series of 10 ml mhb tubes was prepared and inoculated with 10µl of the bacterial solution from the tube with the highest concentration presenting growth a summary of the concentrations and mics obtained is presented in table s1 si this step was repeated 10 times a purity check was added after each cycle by striking the inoculate on non specific agar plate count agar pca sigma aldrich switzerland 2 9 data modelling and analysis 2 9 1 ozone ozone inactivation followed pseudo first order kinetics and was modelled using a modified version of the chick watson model hunt and mariñas 1997 the model was modified to take into account the ozone exposure instead of the contact time table 2 eq 1 hunt and mariñas 1997 the modeling and analysis were performed using the software r the following packages were used dplyr scales lsmeans the visualization of the data and the creation of the graphs were performed with the packages ggplot2 and gridextra 2 9 2 monochloramine the non linear inactivation curves for e coli by monochloramine were modelled using a previously published model geeraerd et al 2005 the model is empirical and takes into account a lag phase and a tailing the model was designed for inactivation curves as a function of time table 2 eq 2 and was modified in this study to take into account the oxidant exposure instead of the contact time only table 2 eq 3 the modeling and analysis were also performed using r the package nlsmicrobio baty et al 2015 baty and delignetter muller 2013 containing the geeraerd model was used in addition to the models for ozone the data visualization and the plotting of the figures were done by the same packages as for ozone 3 results and discussion 3 1 biocidal efficiency of ctma in different water matrices an initial mic of 25 mgl 1 ctma was obtained for the e coli strain ag100 in mhb with an increasing trend for multiple exposures to sub inhibitory levels of ctma table s1 si to assess the dependence of the susceptibility on the water matrices the biocidal efficiency of ctma was tested with four different waters for an experimental time of 60 min at room temperature the corresponding results are presented in fig 2 in absence of ctma no or little inactivation is visible no inactivation was visible in mhb for concentrations of up to 10 mgl 1 in the three other waters 4 log inactivation was achieved at ctma concentrations of about 5 mgl 1 the significant differences between the experiments with mhb and the other water matrices show that the water matrix composition seems to be an important factor several factors have been identified to influence the survival and replication of bacteria in natural waters including light temperature ph grazing of zooplankton or other predators such as bacteriophages osmotic pressure resistance to starvation and the presence of low molecular weight toxins giannakis et al 2014 scheuerman et al 1988 as the control experiments showed no differences in the number of colonies after one hour parameters such as light ph temperature and osmotic pressure can be ruled out since they were similar for all tested waters no inactivation was observed in the blank lake water and ww experiments indicating no effect of zooplankton or bacteriophages the presence of low molecular weight toxins would only be possible in lake water and wastewater however due to the similar results in pbs it seems an unlikely option the possible remaining factors are a limitation of available nutrients and interaction between ctma and mhb the first hypothesis is related to starvation of the cells indeed all media have no or a limited nutrient level compared to mhb long term starvation of e coli has been shown to lead to an exponential decay of the viability of the cells schink et al 2019 to maintain viability the presence of nutrients is crucial and it has been demonstrated that adaptation was possible for e coli in nutrient deprived environments by e g the use of nutrients from dead cells schink et al 2019 however with the short time exposure in the experiments of this study 60 min adaptation and survival in presence of ctma was probably not possible in a nutrient deprived medium additionally the absence of starvation of the cells prior the experiment also reduced the probability of the nutrient limitation hypothesis without completely excluding it the second possibility is the interaction of ctma with some components of the mhb ctma and qacs in general are cationic surfactants which can form micelles in aqueous media breider et al 2018 if the interaction between ctma and bacteria is based on electrostatic attraction with the positive charged head of ctma and the negatively charged membrane lysis of the cell is a result of the penetration of the ctma tail in the membrane the formation of micelles would prevent the penetration step by blocking the tail inside the micelle thus inhibiting the action of ctma turbidity was observed in mhb at high concentrations of ctma in this study and was also reported previously thomas et al 2000 this could be an indication of the formation of micelles in contrast to the other solutions where no such effect was observed the formation of larger and more stable micelles in mhb and not in pbs lake water or wastewater effluent would explain the differences observed in the susceptibility of e coli to ctma in the different waters the use of mic to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to ctma and qacs in general is useful to determine the efficiency at the point of use where the qacs may be in contact with solutions agents promoting the growth of bacteria however based on the observation that the water matrix plays an important role standard mic tests are less representative of the efficiency qacs in natural and technical aquatic systems such as wastewaters 3 2 effect of a pre exposure to ctma on the inactivation kinetics of ag100 and ag100a by ozone and monochloramine strains of e coli ag100 and ag100a were pre exposed to ctma using a stepwise protocol the susceptibility to ctma decreased after this exposure fig s1 si consistent with previous findings that showed a decrease in the susceptibility to qacs after exposure to sub inhibitory concentrations of ctma for p aeruginosa voumard et al 2020 after pre exposure to ctma the inactivation kinetics of the e coli strains by ozone and monochloramine were investigated the corresponding results for ozone and monochloramine are provided in figs 3 and s2 si inactivation curves for ozone followed pseudo first order kinetics and therefore a modified chick watson approach was applied table 2 eq 1 the quality of the fit of the model was assessed with r2 values which were in the range of 0 72 0 95 table s2 si all the obtained second order rate constants for ozone are in the order of 106 m 1s 1 and summarized in fig 4 a and table s4 si for monochloramine the inactivation curves presented a lag phase and no tail fig 3b modeling was performed with a modified version of the empirical geeraerd model geeraerd et al 2005 table 2 eq 3 and fitting of the curves was assessed using r2 values which were in the range of 0 98 and 0 99 table s3 si for monochloramine the second order rate constant is calculated from the linear section of the inactivation plot all the obtained second order rate constants for monochloramine are in the order of 103 m 1s 1 and are summarized in fig 4b and table s3 si overall the obtained results differed between ozone and monochloramine pre exposed to ctma e coli ag100 and ag100a had a greater susceptibility to ozone with higher second order inactivation rate constants whereas the opposite trend was observed for monochloramine fig 4 moreover the overexpression of the acrab tolc efflux pump system in ag100tet led to a decreased and increased susceptibility to ozone and monochloramine respectively fig 4 overall the observed patterns are exactly opposite which indicates different modes of action for ozone and monochloramine ag100 ag100a and ag100tet differ by their expression of efflux pumps and antibiotic resistance kanamycin for ag100a and tetracycline for ag100tet the inactivation of the acrab tolc efflux pump system in ag100a had no effect on the inactivation kinetics by either ozone or monochloramine fig 4 this result indicates that a normal efflux is not involved in any resistance to ozone or monochloramine with no change in the susceptibility to both disinfectants in addition the kanamycin resistance of this strain is also not influencing the inactivation kinetics however the over expression of the same efflux pump system as in ag100tet has an impact on the kinetics of inactivation decreasing the second order rate constant by a factor of almost 2 for ozone and increasing it by a factor of 1 5 for monochloramine fig 4 tetracycline resistant bacteria were reported to have an increased susceptibility to chlorine in a previous study macauley et al 2006 it was suggested that the over expression of efflux pumps allowed more chlorine to interact with the bacterial cell membrane however it was not clear how this may happen macauley et al 2006 the results obtained here with monochloramine are consistent with this finding in the case of ozone the tetracycline resistance led to bacteria that are slightly more resistant previous studies on the ozonation of antibiotic resistant bacteria showed various results with either no differences in the susceptibility or a reduction in the susceptibility alexander et al 2016 czekalski et al 2016 heß and gallert 2015 oh et al 2014 rice et al 2005 however there is no evidence in the literature of a reduction in the susceptibility to ozone caused by efflux pumps the activation of efflux pumps is among the mechanisms of resistance to qacs buffet bataillon et al 2016 mc cay et al 2010 sundheim et al 1998 this was confirmed in the present study with the efflux of ethidium bromide a fluorescent substrate fig s3 si the decrease in the fluorescence of the colonies exposed to ctma confirmed the activation of multidrug efflux pumps following the exposure to ctma fig s3 si martins et al 2011 viveiros et al 2008 however the exact type of efflux pump is unknown furthermore the results differed between ag100tet and the pre exposed strains which indicates either that efflux pumps play no role in the susceptibility to ozone and monochloramine or that the type of efflux pump is crucial for monochloramine it has been shown that e coli with modifications of the expression of membrane proteins including a down regulation of the acre a multi drug efflux pump system led to a reduction in the susceptibility berry et al 2010 in another case the response of e coli to monochloramine showed an activation of genes belonging to the stress response mechanism including the activation of multidrug efflux systems holder et al 2013 these results show the complexity and the number of different mechanisms possible for the bacteria when responding to stress apart from the mechanisms of resistance membrane damages can also be the consequence of an exposure to ctma voumard et al 2020 bacteria pre exposed to ctma would have an alteration of the membrane and efflux pumps overexpressed as it was shown with ethidium bromide fig s3 si in the case of inactivation by ozone as the inactivation is very quick a membrane alteration could be the dominant factor and thus enhance the inactivation for monochloramine the inactivation is much slower with a difference of about 3 orders of magnitude for the second order rate constants compared to ozone fig 4 tables s2 and s3 si this lower reaction rate could allow the activated efflux pump system to pump out monochloramine thus reducing the inactivation overall the differences observed in the pre exposed strains compared to the other strains are caused by ctma but there might be multiple reasons of the observed changes it is interesting to note that the trends are opposite for ozone and monochloramine which indicates that this observation may be related to the different reactivities and properties of the applied chemical disinfectants 3 3 effect of the presence of ctma on the inactivation kinetics of ag100 by ozone and monochloramine since ctma has very low or no reactivity with ozone and monochloramine disinfection experiments can be performed in presence of ctma simultaneously with the selected chemical disinfectants qacs do not readily react with oxidants because the quaternary nitrogen does not have a lone electron pair the aliphatic chain also has a low reactivity with both ozone and nh2cl the use of a scavenger in the experiments prevent the reaction of hydroxyl radical which are formed during ozonation with the aliphatic chain of ctma therefore the ctma concentration will remain constant in the oxidation experiments this could be a possible situation in real water disinfection systems based on the data presented in fig 2 different concentrations of ctma in the range of 0 1 mgl 1 to 5 mgl 1 were selected for the combined experiments with ctma and chemical oxidants this range of qacs covers situations encountered in municipal hospital and industrial wastewaters with concentrations of up to 2 8 mgl 1 kreuzinger et al 2007 the concentrations in this study above the range detected in aquatic systems are not unrealistic and they were selected to investigate the combined effect of ctma and chemical oxidants over a wide range to better understand additive or synergistic effects inactivation curves for ozone and monochloramine are presented in figs 5 and s4 si and the corresponding second order rate constants obtained by the modified chick watson model and the modified geeraerd model are presented fig 6 the numerical values for the second order rate constants and the corresponding fitting parameters for each curve are provided in tables s4 and s5 si linearity was observed for ozone inactivation up to a concentration of 2 25 mgl 1 for higher concentrations the inactivation was too fast for the method used here to exhibit first order kinetics and the corresponding second order inactivation rate constants could not be determined and are therefore not presented in fig 6 a similar pattern for the second order inactivation rate constants of e coli was observed for the simultaneous presence of ctma and ozone or monochloramine fig 6 for low concentrations of ctma there is little influence on the inactivation kinetics for higher ctma concentrations the inactivation kinetics are enhanced resulting in higher second order inactivation rate constants an exponential type increase in the rate constant is visible for the inactivation by ozone in presence of ctma for concentrations 1 5 mgl 1 fig 6 this increase of inactivation efficiency is consistent with an additive or synergistic effect resulting from the combination of ozone with ctma there is only limited reactivity between ozone and ctma and therefore an antagonist effect is unlikely moreover ctma and ozone have different modes of action on the cell targeting different constituents while targeting different cell components they both act on the membrane leading to destabilization and permeation of it allowing an enhanced penetration of ozone inside the bacterial cell for monochloramine a gradual increase of the second order inactivation rate constants was observed for ctma concentrations between 2 5 and 5 mgl 1 in this case the curves showed similar patterns and the data shown in fig 5b could be modelled by the geeraerd model provided in table 2 therefore the individual contributions of ctma and monochloramine on the inactivation of e coli could be elucidated the inactivation curves representing the individual and combined contributions of monochloramine and ctma to the inactivation of e coli are shown in fig 7 to obtain similar levels of inactivation for the different ctma monochloramine combinations for the same time two different monochloramine concentrations were chosen 5 mgl 1 nh2cl for 2 and 2 5 mgl 1 of ctma and 2 5 mgl 1 nh2cl for 3 4 and 5 mgl 1 of ctma both concentrations of monochloramine led to similar levels of inactivation based on the monochloramine exposure fig s5 si at ctma concentrations 2 5 mgl 1 the inactivation curves are similar for monochloramine only and the combination of monochloramine with ctma demonstrating that monochloramine is the main contributor to inactivation at 3 mgl 1 ctma both monochloramine and ctma seem to contribute similarly to the inactivation for ctma concentrations 4mgl 1 the trend changes and inactivation seemed to be mostly controlled by ctma with only a minor effect of monochloramine these results indicate that there is at least an additive effect for the two disinfectants the mode of action of ctma and qacs in general is mainly the disruption of the cell membrane and the modes of action of ozone and monochloramine are based on reactions with various cell components a destabilization of the membrane enhances the penetration of ozone or monochloramine inside the cell allowing an enhanced inactivation moreover because ozone and monochloramine do not react with ctma a consumption of this qac is not expected during the reaction time of the experiment to investigate the combined effect the individual inactivation curves of ag100 for ctma 3 mgl 1 and monochloramine were added and compared to the combined experimentally observed inactivation a ctma concentration of 3 mgl 1 was chosen because of an apparent similar level of inactivation by individual treatment with monochloramine and ctma because the sampling times were different the curves were modelled using the geeraerd model and a good agreement between model and experiment was obtained for the individual treatments with monochloramine and ctma fig 8 the experimentally observed overall inactivation in the combined ctma monochloramine experiment is higher than calculated from the sum of the modelled curves for the individual inactivation experiments fig 8 this enhancement suggests a slight synergistic effect with not completely independent damages however the approximations of the modeling approach and the variation of the experimental data leave some uncertainty regarding synergism nevertheless it is clear from the data that there is no antagonistic effect and that the inactivation is faster and enhanced in presence of both ctma and monochloramine 4 conclusions the susceptibility of e coli to cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctma was investigated in different media mhb a common media used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics was compared to phosphate buffer saline pbs a secondary wastewater effluent and a lake water furthermore the impact of ctma on the inactivation kinetics of e coli by ozone and monochloramine was investigated for various strains of e coli ag100 ag100a ag100tet the main findings of this study are the susceptibility of e coli for ctma depends on the water quality and is higher in pbs secondary wastewater effluent and lake water than under standard conditions in mhb the standard determination of mic in broth is therefore not representative of natural and engineered aquatic systems and the assessment of the presence of qacs in the environment requires an alternative approach a pre exposure to ctma and the resulting reduction of susceptibility of e coli to ctma influences the inactivation kinetics by ozone and monochloramine the inactivation was enhanced for ozone and reduced for monochloramine this difference is due to different modes of action for ozone and monochloramine the role of the efflux pumps for the susceptibility to ozone or monochloramine could not be elucidated by the obtained results the different results obtained for strains expressing different types of efflux pumps ag100tet vs pre exposed strains indicates complex mechanisms which require further investigations the presence of mgl 1 of qacs during the inactivation by either ozone or monochloramine enhanced the inactivation of e coli the inactivation kinetics were at least additive for monochloramine and a potential synergistic effect needs to be confirmed by further investigations the combination of ozone with ctma resulted in non linear pseudo first order inactivation kinetics which could not be quantified nonetheless the presence of ctma led to enhanced inactivation compared to ozone alone natural waters and especially wastewater effluents contain a mixture of different qacs and other biocides the presence of these compounds during a chemical disinfection by ozone or monochloramine may enhance the inactivation of

16084,the validity and usefulness of implementing bacteriophages into water treatment systems as agents of targeted bacterial inactivation is yet to be determined while some concerns are still more purely biological in nature other concerns are still chiefly rooted in design feasibility this work investigated bacteriophage heteroaggregation a process whereby phages attach to non host background particles to explore different design options for water quality engineers especially tuning mixing velocity this was done by adapting batch mixing assays originally developed to study inert particle heteroaggregation to characterize bacteriophage and kaolinite heteroaggregation using modified smoluchowski parameters under different ionic strength conditions this work found that regardless of the ionic strength or the tested phage to kaolinite ratios heteroaggregation occurred rapidly and was likely driven by extended dlvo forces a model of bacteriophage kaolinite heteroaggregation was generated and showed promising correspondence with observed laboratory data this model along with other findings suggests that should bacteriophages be utilized as agents of host inactivation they ought to be used following particle separation processes to reduce the likelihood of phage scavenging through attachment to particulate matter rather than the targeted bacteria graphical abstract

attention from researchers since their discovery a bit more than a century ago d hérelle 1917 twort 1915 environmentally phages are the most abundant known biological entity on earth estimated at about 1031 phages globally and play key roles in recycling organic nutrients and maintaining microbial diversity fuhrma and suttle 1993 hendrix 2002 lindell et al 2004 wilhelm and suttle 1999 early on they were investigated for their potential as a proto antibiotics and though early excitement dissipated when actual antibiotics became available phages are still used in human disease therapy in some regions abedon et al 2011 bruynoghe and maisin 1921 sulakvelidze and morris 2001 as of late with the advent of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their discovery in water treatment facilities the use of phages as agents of targeted bacterial inactivation is becoming a more pressing interest in environmental and human health research choi et al 2011 martins et al 2004 however there are many hurdles to overcome in the incorporation of phage based processes into engineered systems like water treatment facilities goodridge 2004 like other environmental biological particles such as extracellular vesicles dna and bacteria there remain unanswered questions about how these particles move trough different environmental matrices and how best to predict their behavior chowdhury et al 2021 mcmillan et al 2021 withey et al 2005 one phenomenon of special consideration is aggregation the process whereby particles form clusters o melia 1980 aggregation in water treatment is typically accomplished through an initial chemical addition step to destabilize particles and enhance particle adhesion coagulation followed by a mixing step flocculation that brings destabilized particles into contact resulting in cluster or floc growth heteroaggregation is aggregation between particles of different types phages suspended in water may heteroaggregate with clays or other background material chrysikopoulos and syngouuna 2012 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2019 as well as make contact with their targeted bacteria the incorporation of phages into water treatment for the purposes of bacterial inactivation therefore requires a consideration of their potential heteroaggregation to predict phage availability and potential efficacy several models have been proposed for phage hetero aggregation and attachment to surfaces delbrück 1940 floyd and sharp 1978 1979 hicks et al 2020 katz et al 2018 storms and sauvageau 2015 storms et al 2012 however little to no work has been done to develop a quantitative assay that both mirrors the mechanical conditions of a water treatment system while also incorporating phage attachment to and break up from background particles such a conceptual framework would provide guidance to water quality engineers in engineering unit operations for inactivating bacteria using phages when it comes to non biological particles especially those on the nanoscale particles having at least one characteristic dimension at 100 nm or smaller methods have been developed to characterize their heteroaggregation behavior such as column studies and batch or mixing studies barton et al 2014 elimelech and o melia 1990b while column studies are much older and more familiar to researchers batch mixing studies were developed more recently so that the heteroaggregation of particles with soil could be studied more directly than with glass beads as are more typical with columns turner et al 2020 phages typically have nanoscale dimensions yap and rossmann 2014 therefore it would appear reasonable to adapt methods used for engineered nanoparticles to characterize phage heteroaggregation and address their use more directly especially since mixing assays resemble mechanically similar processes as those used in water treatment facilities such as flocculation basins to investigate phages as agents of targeted bacterial inactivation in an engineered system like a water treatment facility this work applies a batch mixing method developed to study the aggregation behavior of engineered nanoparticles barton et al 2014 this experimental method is used to characterize phage heteroaggregation with kaolinite particles a particle meant to act as a common inert environmental surface under different ionic strength conditions to construct a model for predicting how phage availability will respond to changes in velocity gradient a parameter water quality engineers can most directly manipulate to encourage or discourage particle removal the novelty of the work presented here is twofold 1 the adaptation of batch assays to model phage heteroaggregation with a modified form of smoluchowski 1917 aggregation theory and 2 the use of such models to comment upon how phages could be integrated into water treatment strategies 2 methods 2 1 materials and instruments bacteriophage t4 and host escherichia coli b were purchased from carolina

potentials were measured using a malvern nano zs nano series zetasizer using the intensity readings the structure of the kaolinite particles was not characterized though some biocolloidal particle interactions with kaolinite have been shown to depend partly on kaolinite structure vasiliadou et al 2011 2 2 batch assay procedure all batch studies were carried out in glass vials 2 5 cm in diameter and charged with 25 ml of background di water 10 mm nacl dissolved in di water or 10 mm mgso4 dissolved in di water mixing was carried out at 500 rpm in all trials unless otherwise noted using a corning pc 420d mixing and heating plate 120 vac 60 hz 5 9a 698 w at room temperature 25 c these ionic conditions were chosen to study the influence of monovalent and divalent cations on phage heteroaggregation information which could be important for any future phage implementation in treatment systems the background solutions are then charged with the appropriate mass of kaolinite for the conditions being tested followed by the addition of an appropriate volume of t4 to balance the fluid volume in the batch to 25 ml two different phage kaolinite ratios were tested 0 25 and 0 025 where the number concentration of t4 was held at 107 pfu ml with a kaolinite number concentration of either 4 107 or 4 108 kaolinite particles per ml respectively fig 1 offers a representation of the experimental batch setup to measure the change in free phage concentration 2 ml aliquots were taken from the batch at 2 5 15 30 60 300 and 600 s the free phage concentration at time 0 was taken to be the initial phage concentration present at the moment the suspension is charged with phage particles 107 pfu ml batches were found to have a ph between 6 5 and 7 2 3 plating procedure lone unaggregated phage particles were isolated from the background of samples taken at each timepoint by filtration using a 0 2 μ m polyether sulfone pes syringe filter the filtrate was collected into separate glass vials for each sample the filtrates were serially diluted using strong magnesium buffer sm buffer 100 mm nacl 8 mm mgso4 50 mm tris cl 1 m ph7 and balanced to 1 l using di water following the classical double layer agar technique dla rajnovic et al 2019 equal parts 200 μ l e coli b grown planktonically in lb lennox and incubated for approximately 24 h and diluted sample were mixed with 3 6 ml molten soft agar and plated onto a sterile lb lennox agar plate plates were incubated at 30 c for approximately 24 h before plaques were counted 2 4 modeling approach this work used a modified smoluchowski 1917 approach to modeling the aggregation of particles this will require the use of particle collision frequency calculations and experimentally determined attachment efficiency and aggregate break up constants in concert with kaolinite and phage population balances the change in the concentrations of kaolinite and phage particles is represented by eq 1 where unaggregated phage p and kaolinite k particles are lost through heteroaggregation to produce phage kaolinite heteroaggregates pk that may in turn break up phage phage and kaolinite kaolinite

accommodate for the influence of near field streamlines they were not used in constructing this model since the size ratio between phage t4 and kaolinite particles 0 01 is outside the bounds of some of their corrections moreover neither phage nor clay are in fact spherical and any corrections to the eqs 2 4 are therefore included in estimates of α 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle characterization phage t4 and kaolinite particle ζ potentials were used to assess their stability under the tested ionic conditions and results are shown in fig 2 both particles generally had negative ζ potentials under all the tested ph levels phage t4 displayed an isoelectric point iep of approximately 3 1 this is well within the range of some other t4 ζ potentials observed by aronino et al 2009 and childs and birnboim 1975 who reported ieps of 2 0 and 4 0 5 0 respectively michen and graule 2010 kaolinite trends were similar to those reported by yukselen aksoy and kaya 2003 under very similar ionic conditions these results suggest that t4 particles may be prone to rapid aggregation in each of the tested background suspension and that kaolinite particles may also be unstable when suspended in 10 mm mgso4 to determine the stability of each of these particles and to characterize their possible homoaggregation tendencies both particles were tested individually batch studies were carried out with t4 in each possible suspension in the absence of kaolinite and the amount of t4 particles recovered after 10 min of mixing the length of time used in all batch studies was taken to be an indication of how available phages were in to interact with background particles as opposed to being tightly aggregated fig 3 a shows the amount of phage recovery after 10 min in each suspension especially mgso4 nearly all t4 phages were recovered the greatest disparity between the number of phages introduced to the batch and the number of phages recovered was when phages were suspended in di water though the disparity observed was less than one order of magnitude thus in none of the tested conditions should one expect rapid t4 homoaggregation at least not to the degree that large amounts of phages would be unavailable to interact with background particles kaolinite stability was tested by suspending kaolinite particles in the selected background and then passed through a master sizer to observe any changes in the particle size over time data was collected for the change in the 10th 50th and 90th particle size percentile the 50th percentile of particle size was used as the refence particle size in calculations and is also the percentile shown in fig 3 b there was no significant or rapid change in any of the reported percentiles for any of the suspensions refer to the si for data concerning the percentiles not shown here although at the experimental ph values the ζ potentials calculated from electrophoretic mobilities for t4 and kaolinite at 10 mm mgso4 suggest instability there was no observed rapid aggregation of the particles the lack of autoaggregation suggests that the batch studies should be dominated by phage kaolinite heteroaggregation for this reason phage and kaolinite homoaggregation were not incorporated in the model formulation 3 2 batch experiment results fig 4 shows the results of the batch assays in this figure the phage concentration pfu ml plotted against time is transformed following the linearization method derived by barton et al 2014 this is to estimate the value of α as prescribed by their method which involves comparing the slopes of the linear portion of the curve prior to the establishment of an equilibrium being reached between particle particle attachment and break up considering first the batch studies using the higher phage kaolinite ratio fig 4 dotted lines the attachment of kaolinite particles to phages is rapid as seen by the loss of free phage particles on the order of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude within only the first 2 to 5 s of mixing this means surprisingly that attachment occurs so quickly under all of the ionic strength conditions there is little to no statistically significant slopes between the different sets to determine an α aggregation occurs so quickly that α can be assumed to have a value of unity though following the ten minutes of mixing the relative amounts of free phage recovered corresponds to the trends in ζ potentials where mixing with 10 mm mgso4 saw the greatest removal of free phage particles via heteroaggregation and water having the lowest observed removal of free phage particles this trend would be expected given the influences of classical dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey and overbeek 1948 looking at the other batch condition with a phage kaolinite ratio of 0 025 removal occurs at an even greater extent likely due to the magnitude greater presence of kaolinite particles these results also suggest that α is approximately 1 however unlike what was observed for the higher mixing ratio the final concentrations of free phage particles do not follow dlvo predicted trends as mixing with di water 10 mm mgso4 and 10 mm nacl yielded similar phage removals in both batch studies there was a rapid equilibrium reached between phage kaolinite attachment and break up as seen by the quickly established plateau observed in most of the batch experiments this could indicate that the ability to predict the available free phage concentration in this and similar suspensions is strongly dependent on determining the break up constant which can be accomplished using eq 1 and solving for k b while assuming that the equilibrium concentration of phage kaolinite aggregates can be approximated by the difference between the initial free phage concentration and the amount recovered in the equilibrium stage p e q eq 6 6 k b α β p k k p e q p 0 p e q in eq 6 the value of α β p k k is equal to the slope of the line in fig 4 prior to reaching equilibrium using the 0 s 2 s and 5 s datapoints refer again to barton et al 2014 for a mathematical description of how this is done using the data in fig 4 table 1 displays all the calculated values k b for each of the batch conditions these k b values show there is little difference in break up under the different ionic strengths though there is nearly a one order of magnitude difference between the two tested phage kaolinite ratios this would suggest that the ionic strength of the background has little influence on the rate of phage detachment from clays and further demonstrates that forces beyond dlvo need be considered to better understand how phages heteroaggregate such as hydrophobicity or unique evolutionary mechanisms as other researchers have observed in their studies of phage heteroaggregation and adsorption conley and wood 1975 katz et al 2018 richter et al 2021 szermer olearnik et al 2017 raw data phage concentrations used in this data analysis are available in the supplementary material 3 3 model results code was written using matlab r2019a academic license and carried out on a 2018 macbook pro laptop where eq 1 was solved using euler integration data from batch experiments conducted at the 0 025 phage kaolinite ratio was used to calibrate the model while the other batch phage kaolinite ratio was used for model validation this is because the values of k b found in the 0 025 case had a lower standard error all values used to calibrate the model including an α of 1 and experimental k b values used in the 0 025 ratio case were held constant between the calibration validation and only the initial kaolinite concentration was adjusted between the calibration and validation step eqs 2 5 were used to determine β a table showing all parameter values used in the calculation of β and a sample of the matlab code can be found in the si fig 5 shows the model predictions for the mgso4 trials the model output is represented by the line and the batch data by the datapoints in general the model shows agreement between the predicted and observed uptake of phage particles by kaolinite in the 0 025 phage kaolinite condition the model however does overpredict the phage uptake in the validation case showing an almost one order of magnitude difference between the predicted and observed final free phage concentration this discrepancy is due to the use of the same break up constant in the validations step as the calibration step however apart from the mild overprediction the success of the model shows that the attachment and break up constants found for this system could likely be applied to any similar systems so long as the particle sizes and surface chemistries aren t significantly altered conditions which could significantly alter α β and k b to further validate the model and explore how the model would represent outcomes of real engineered systems fig 6 shows the response of the model to a change in velocity gradient g in prior experiment g had an estimated value of 35 s 1 for this phase a batch study using the 0 25 phage kaolinite ratio was carried out at a lower mixing speed g 15 s 1 or half of the pervious trials with a 10 mm mgso4 background this condition was chosen for validation since the error associated with k b is greatest for this ratio under this salt condition see table 1 this would allow for a conservative worst case scenario in terms of examining model validity in predicting changes in free phage concentration using an α of 1 and the corresponding k b the model responded well to the change in g though it was approximately ½ of an order of magnitude off by overpredicting the number of free phages remaining in the suspension as with the previous model validation this discrepancy could be due to assumptions inherent within the model such as the assumption of a rectilinear representation of surface contacts the error of which would propagate both in the approximation of an α value and thus also in the k b value having validated the model with respect to g it would be worth further considering the model s general sensitivity towards changes in velocity gradient since this would be the parameter most under the influence of a water quality engineer fig 7 is a sensitivity analysis in response to changes in g using the same conditions as those shown in fig 6 for the rationale as presented for the model validation and where g is increased from 0 to 100 s 1 in 20 s 1 increments in general it seems that though phages could largely become unavailable to interact with host particles through heteroaggregation with inert background particles there are still 2 orders of magnitude difference in phage availability through tuning the velocity gradient based on these trials specifically in a situation of little to no mixing brownian motion and differential settling could still be routes of significant phage background attachment the strong attachment of phages to background particles suggest that the additions of salts or other coagulants would have little effect on altering phage availability thus these findings imply that should phages be incorporated into treatment facilities it would be best to implement them following the removal of background particles but prior to the other disinfecting procedures and that if phages are introduced following particle removal initial chemical conditioning could remain important especially for encouraging phage host attachment 4 conclusions the work presented here shows that the free phage concentration available to target bacteria will tend to be lower in the presence of background particles such as clay though this is intuitive at the ratios tested it was clear that several orders of magnitude of phages can be removed within only a few less than 5 seconds in considering how this might look in a more realistic water treatment system a further consideration would be the rate of phage propagation in the presence of its host depending on the phage and host type the rapid removal of phages from a suspension could be mitigated if the burst size of the host was great enough yet in future work it would still need to be determined if even in the presence of a host organism if phage removal would not occur too rapidly for phage populations to reach a certain size to achieve the desired bacterial inactivation for the given residence time this would involve weighing the phage s incubation period the time between host infection and host lysis against the residence time of the phages with their host prior to the incorporation of other bacterial inactivation processes or phage removal considering the model s sensitivity to changes in free phage concentration in response to tuning the velocity gradient engineers could have limited control over the removal of phages through background interactions and allow for more possible phage host mixing time overall this work demonstrates the value of using methods historically applied to the study of inert nanoparticle transport to study the transport of soft biological particles such as phages but perhaps also extracellular vesicles and dna though the distinctions between nanoparticles and biocolloids should not be trivialized the kind of methodological adaptation used in this study could prove meaningful

accommodate for the influence of near field streamlines they were not used in constructing this model since the size ratio between phage t4 and kaolinite particles 0 01 is outside the bounds of some of their corrections moreover neither phage nor clay are in fact spherical and any corrections to the eqs 2 4 are therefore included in estimates of α 3 results and discussion 3 1 particle characterization phage t4 and kaolinite particle ζ potentials were used to assess their stability under the tested ionic conditions and results are shown in fig 2 both particles generally had negative ζ potentials under all the tested ph levels phage t4 displayed an isoelectric point iep of approximately 3 1 this is well within the range of some other t4 ζ potentials observed by aronino et al 2009 and childs and birnboim 1975 who reported ieps of 2 0 and 4 0 5 0 respectively michen and graule 2010 kaolinite trends were similar to those reported by yukselen aksoy and kaya 2003 under very similar ionic conditions these results suggest that t4 particles may be prone to rapid aggregation in each of the tested background suspension and that kaolinite particles may also be unstable when suspended in 10 mm mgso4 to determine the stability of each of these particles and to characterize their possible homoaggregation tendencies both particles were tested individually batch studies were carried out with t4 in each possible suspension in the absence of kaolinite and the amount of t4 particles recovered after 10 min of mixing the length of time used in all batch studies was taken to be an indication of how available phages were in to interact with background particles as opposed to being tightly aggregated fig 3 a shows the amount of phage recovery after 10 min in each suspension especially mgso4 nearly all t4 phages were recovered the greatest disparity between the number of phages introduced to the batch and the number of phages recovered was when phages were suspended in di water though the disparity observed was less than one order of magnitude thus in none of the tested conditions should one expect rapid t4 homoaggregation at least not to the degree that large amounts of phages would be unavailable to interact with background particles kaolinite stability was tested by suspending kaolinite particles in the selected background and then passed through a master sizer to observe any changes in the particle size over time data was collected for the change in the 10th 50th and 90th particle size percentile the 50th percentile of particle size was used as the refence particle size in calculations and is also the percentile shown in fig 3 b there was no significant or rapid change in any of the reported percentiles for any of the suspensions refer to the si for data concerning the percentiles not shown here although at the experimental ph values the ζ potentials calculated from electrophoretic mobilities for t4 and kaolinite at 10 mm mgso4 suggest instability there was no observed rapid aggregation of the particles the lack of autoaggregation suggests that the batch studies should be dominated by phage kaolinite heteroaggregation for this reason phage and kaolinite homoaggregation were not incorporated in the model formulation 3 2 batch experiment results fig 4 shows the results of the batch assays in this figure the phage concentration pfu ml plotted against time is transformed following the linearization method derived by barton et al 2014 this is to estimate the value of α as prescribed by their method which involves comparing the slopes of the linear portion of the curve prior to the establishment of an equilibrium being reached between particle particle attachment and break up considering first the batch studies using the higher phage kaolinite ratio fig 4 dotted lines the attachment of kaolinite particles to phages is rapid as seen by the loss of free phage particles on the order of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude within only the first 2 to 5 s of mixing this means surprisingly that attachment occurs so quickly under all of the ionic strength conditions there is little to no statistically significant slopes between the different sets to determine an α aggregation occurs so quickly that α can be assumed to have a value of unity though following the ten minutes of mixing the relative amounts of free phage recovered corresponds to the trends in ζ potentials where mixing with 10 mm mgso4 saw the greatest removal of free phage particles via heteroaggregation and water having the lowest observed removal of free phage particles this trend would be expected given the influences of classical dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey and overbeek 1948 looking at the other batch condition with a phage kaolinite ratio of 0 025 removal occurs at an even greater extent likely due to the magnitude greater presence of kaolinite particles these results also suggest that α is approximately 1 however unlike what was observed for the higher mixing ratio the final concentrations of free phage particles do not follow dlvo predicted trends as mixing with di water 10 mm mgso4 and 10 mm nacl yielded similar phage removals in both batch studies there was a rapid equilibrium reached between phage kaolinite attachment and break up as seen by the quickly established plateau observed in most of the batch experiments this could indicate that the ability to predict the available free phage concentration in this and similar suspensions is strongly dependent on determining the break up constant which can be accomplished using eq 1 and solving for k b while assuming that the equilibrium concentration of phage kaolinite aggregates can be approximated by the difference between the initial free phage concentration and the amount recovered in the equilibrium stage p e q eq 6 6 k b α β p k k p e q p 0 p e q in eq 6 the value of α β p k k is equal to the slope of the line in fig 4 prior to reaching equilibrium using the 0 s 2 s and 5 s datapoints refer again to barton et al 2014 for a mathematical description of how this is done using the data in fig 4 table 1 displays all the calculated values k b for each of the batch conditions these k b values show there is little difference in break up under the different ionic strengths though there is nearly a one order of magnitude difference between the two tested phage kaolinite ratios this would suggest that the ionic strength of the background has little influence on the rate of phage detachment from clays and further demonstrates that forces beyond dlvo need be considered to better understand how phages heteroaggregate such as hydrophobicity or unique evolutionary mechanisms as other researchers have observed in their studies of phage heteroaggregation and adsorption conley and wood 1975 katz et al 2018 richter et al 2021 szermer olearnik et al 2017 raw data phage concentrations used in this data analysis are available in the supplementary material 3 3 model results code was written using matlab r2019a academic license and carried out on a 2018 macbook pro laptop where eq 1 was solved using euler integration data from batch experiments conducted at the 0 025 phage kaolinite ratio was used to calibrate the model while the other batch phage kaolinite ratio was used for model validation this is because the values of k b found in the 0 025 case had a lower standard error all values used to calibrate the model including an α of 1 and experimental k b values used in the 0 025 ratio case were held constant between the calibration validation and only the initial kaolinite concentration was adjusted between the calibration and validation step eqs 2 5 were used to determine β a table showing all parameter values used in the calculation of β and a sample of the matlab code can be found in the si fig 5 shows the model predictions for the mgso4 trials the model output is represented by the line and the batch data by the datapoints in general the model shows agreement between the predicted and observed uptake of phage particles by kaolinite in the 0 025 phage kaolinite condition the model however does overpredict the phage uptake in the validation case showing an almost one order of magnitude difference between the predicted and observed final free phage concentration this discrepancy is due to the use of the same break up constant in the validations step as the calibration step however apart from the mild overprediction the success of the model shows that the attachment and break up constants found for this system could likely be applied to any similar systems so long as the particle sizes and surface chemistries aren t significantly altered conditions which could significantly alter α β and k b to further validate the model and explore how the model would represent outcomes of real engineered systems fig 6 shows the response of the model to a change in velocity gradient g in prior experiment g had an estimated value of 35 s 1 for this phase a batch study using the 0 25 phage kaolinite ratio was carried out at a lower mixing speed g 15 s 1 or half of the pervious trials with a 10 mm mgso4 background this condition was chosen for validation since the error associated with k b is greatest for this ratio under this salt condition see table 1 this would allow for a conservative worst case scenario in terms of examining model validity in predicting changes in free phage concentration using an α of 1 and the corresponding k b the model responded well to the change in g though it was approximately ½ of an order of magnitude off by overpredicting the number of free phages remaining in the suspension as with the previous model validation this discrepancy could be due to assumptions inherent within the model such as the assumption of a rectilinear representation of surface contacts the error of which would propagate both in the approximation of an α value and thus also in the k b value having validated the model with respect to g it would be worth further considering the model s general sensitivity towards changes in velocity gradient since this would be the parameter most under the influence of a water quality engineer fig 7 is a sensitivity analysis in response to changes in g using the same conditions as those shown in fig 6 for the rationale as presented for the model validation and where g is increased from 0 to 100 s 1 in 20 s 1 increments in general it seems that though phages could largely become unavailable to interact with host particles through heteroaggregation with inert background particles there are still 2 orders of magnitude difference in phage availability through tuning the velocity gradient based on these trials specifically in a situation of little to no mixing brownian motion and differential settling could still be routes of significant phage background attachment the strong attachment of phages to background particles suggest that the additions of salts or other coagulants would have little effect on altering phage availability thus these findings imply that should phages be incorporated into treatment facilities it would be best to implement them following the removal of background particles but prior to the other disinfecting procedures and that if phages are introduced following particle removal initial chemical conditioning could remain important especially for encouraging phage host attachment 4 conclusions the work presented here shows that the free phage concentration available to target bacteria will tend to be lower in the presence of background particles such as clay though this is intuitive at the ratios tested it was clear that several orders of magnitude of phages can be removed within only a few less than 5 seconds in considering how this might look in a more realistic water treatment system a further consideration would be the rate of phage propagation in the presence of its host depending on the phage and host type the rapid removal of phages from a suspension could be mitigated if the burst size of the host was great enough yet in future work it would still need to be determined if even in the presence of a host organism if phage removal would not occur too rapidly for phage populations to reach a certain size to achieve the desired bacterial inactivation for the given residence time this would involve weighing the phage s incubation period the time between host infection and host lysis against the residence time of the phages with their host prior to the incorporation of other bacterial inactivation processes or phage removal considering the model s sensitivity to changes in free phage concentration in response to tuning the velocity gradient engineers could have limited control over the removal of phages through background interactions and allow for more possible phage host mixing time overall this work demonstrates the value of using methods historically applied to the study of inert nanoparticle transport to study the transport of soft biological particles such as phages but perhaps also extracellular vesicles and dna though the distinctions between nanoparticles and biocolloids should not be trivialized the kind of methodological adaptation used in this study could prove meaningful
