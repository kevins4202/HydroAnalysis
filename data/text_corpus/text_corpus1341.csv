6705,the hierarchy of one dimensional equations and numerical methods describing the motion of floods and disturbances in streams is studied critically reviewed and a number of results obtained initially the long wave equations are considered when presented in terms of discharge and cross sectional area they enable the development of simple fully nonlinear advection diffusion models whose only approximation is that disturbances be very long easily satisfied in most flood routing problems then making the approximation that changes in surface slope are relatively small such that diffusion terms in the equations are small various advection diffusion and muskingum models are derived several well known muskingum formulations are tested one is found to be in error the three families of governing equations the long wave equations and the advection diffusion and the muskingum approximations are linearised and analytical solutions obtained a dimensionless diffusion frequency number measures the accuracies of the approximate methods criteria for practical use are given which reveal when they have difficulties for streams of small slope for fast rising floods and or when shorter period waves are present in an inflow hydrograph they can probably be used in most flood routing problems with an idealised smooth inflow however the fact that they cannot be used for all problems requires a general alternative flood routing method for which it is recommended to use the long wave equations themselves written in terms of discharge and cross sectional area when a surprisingly simple physical stream model can be used an explicit finite difference numerical method is presented that can be used with different inflow specifications and downstream boundary conditions and is recommended for general use keywords advection diffusion approximate methods long wave equations muskingum numerical methods 1 introduction the one dimensional long wave equations are a good simple model of the complicated mechanics of flows and flood waves in rivers they incorporate the important physical features and are considered the foundation of flood routing however in that field much attention has been given to alternative approximate methods especially muskingum and advection diffusion methods the aims of this paper are to develop and explain different flood routing methods in light of recent research to relate and compare them to determine their accuracy limits and finally to show that a formulation of the long wave equations themselves in terms of discharge and area with an explicit numerical method has advantages those long wave equations are the basis of a hierarchy of approximations which is developed and studied here the fundamental one is that the disturbances be very long not just in the usual spatial sense which gives the name to the equations but in a rather longer time sense for which a criterion is given usually easily satisfied by flood waves but excluding waves such as those generated by rapid control gate movements two fully nonlinear advection diffusion equations are obtained either could be used for flood routing the next approximation made the usual flood routing one is that relative changes in surface slope are small which means that the effects of diffusion are relatively small this leads to two families of quasilinear approximations advection diffusion and muskingum methods four well known muskingum formulations are tested by analysing for consistency one has an incorrect diffusion coefficient to examine the accuracy of the different approximate schemes the long wave equations advection diffusion equations and muskingum equations are all linearised and analytical solutions obtained the effects of diffusion quantifying when the schemes are accurate for practical problems are able to be expressed in terms of a single non dimensional diffusion frequency number written in terms of the channel resistance parameter either discharge or depth stream slope thus quantifying what has always been found in practice that muskingum schemes give problems for small slopes but also quantifying the largely unsuspected effect of wave period in the inflow hydrograph both approximations advection diffusion and muskingum especially the latter are vulnerable to shorter period fluctuations as they are small diffusion approximations and rapidly rising floods and or shorter components present in a general input hydrograph have larger effective diffusion computational examples are presented showing how the advection diffusion and muskingum methods work well when the diffusion frequency number is small and are accurate enough for many flood propagation problems however it is easy to find problems where especially muskingum methods are not accurate in such cases it is desirable to have a simple flood routing method without any essential important restrictions such a method is available using the long wave equations themselves expressed in terms of discharge and cross sectional area the surprising result is shown that the equations can be solved approximately with relatively few geometric details paradoxically even fewer than the common approximate flood routing methods a simple explicit numerical scheme can be used small time steps must be used but the simplicity of the method means that any common flood routing problem can be quickly solved practical details for implementation are described including the incorporation of different boundary conditions the method is recommended as a relatively simple and reliable tool for flood routing problems 2 equations governing flood wave propagation the original muskingum method was based on a single reach lumped approach to volume conservation using concepts such as prism and wedge storage often termed hydrologic routing one can obtain the characteristic four point muskingum formula using such methods but the approximations for channel routing are severe and some of the concepts nebulous as described by koussis 2009 pp 46 47 in this work a hydraulic approach will be followed even in works of a hydrologic nature the bases for accuracy comparisons are from the hydraulic equations a full three dimensional model of a river would use the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics in three dimensions complete with boundary conditions over the irregular boundary were we able to specify that and if we were able to solve the equations that is not feasible we have to resort to modelling and the major approximation is that the flow in the river is a turbulent shear flow where we model the resistance of the bed on the flow empirically we integrate across the whole river section turning the problem into a one dimensional one if the river flows onto flood plains the approximate model becomes less satisfactory including the considerations of for example knight and shiono 1996 and to model it in detail becomes difficult this is probably the most important weakness of the one dimensional model secondary flows while affecting sediment motions would play a small role in flood dynamics if any wave disturbances were short enough the pressure in the flow would not be hydrostatic and the momentum equation should have boussinesq corrections including third derivatives of the surface elevation e g darvishi et al 2017 this would be important at the front face of a quickly rising flood where steepening might lead to surface undulations and even to a flash flood however usually flood waves are sufficiently slowly rising that this is not the case finally the effects of meandering can be described by a one dimensional approach incorporating stream curvature but this has been shown to be almost always unnecessary fenton 2015 we are left with the approximations that the stream is straight pressure is hydrostatic and resistance will be modelled by either a measured rating curve or by an empirical formula such as the gauckler manning equation these simplifications are accurate enough to give a model which is manageable and can adequately describe the propagation of most floods in real rivers from that a series of approximations will be made and examined 2 1 the long wave equations for our purposes the equations in terms of the integrated quantities of discharge q and cross sectional area a are more useful both theoretically and practically than those in terms of velocity and or surface elevation the straight channel equations are following fenton 2010 section 5 1 2018 section 3 5 3 but here expressing the resistance in terms of q r a the discharge of a steady uniform flow of that cross sectional area 1a a t q x q i 1b q t x β q 2 a ga b a x gas 1 q 2 q r 2 a β i u i q i where t is time x is a horizontal cartesian co ordinate along the line of the river and q i is the lateral inflow volume per unit time per unit length of river other quantities include β the boussinesq momentum coefficient slightly greater than unity g the gravitational acceleration b the surface width and s the local mean downstream slope of the stream bed the function q r a is the discharge as obtained from a rating curve area is always obtained as part of a rating measurement or calculated from familiar flow formulae 2 q r a measured for rated discharge 1 n a 5 3 p 2 3 a s gauckler manning c a 3 p a s 8 ga 3 λ p a s chezy weisbach where n is manning s coefficient p is the wetted perimeter which is a function of area a as shown c is the chézy coefficient and λ is the weisbach resistance coefficient the momentum contribution of inflow on the right of eq 1b is usually not included as it is small and poorly known in it β i is the boussinesq momentum coefficient of the inflow and u i is the x component of its velocity zero in the case of rain or seepage the use of the rating curve function q r a to characterise resistance is a departure from traditional practice and does something to unify hydrologic and hydraulic concepts it may have some practical use for often the rating curve function at least at discrete stations is measured and quite well known whereas resistance coefficients such as manning s are usually not well known and their usually assumed constant nature is an approximation a number of aspects and practical results of the computation of rating curves has been considered by fenton 2018a giving robust methods of approximating data it was concluded that it is nearly impossible to calculate the rising and falling limbs of the rating curve in a flood event because the resistance in the channel changes during such an event if the bed particles move in a manner unable to be predicted accurately however it was shown how maximum and minimum envelopes to ratings can also be calculated which could be used in the present work as a rational approximation to put bounds on calculations the long wave eqs 1 are actually simple in form with first order derivatives combined with nonlinear coefficients using a as presented instead of surface elevation has a big advantage for approximate flood routing the only places in those equations where the bathymetry appears are in the three often relatively weakly varying quantities surface width b wetted perimeter p and slope s in many cases the simple modelling assumption could be made that each is constant and that the wetted perimeter is approximately equal to the surface width this compares with approximate flood routing methods which require the computation of the wave speed in the form c d q r d a which in natural streams is difficult and possibly sensitive to fluctuations for the moment we only require the equations for theoretical purposes their application in flood routing computations will be described in section 4 1 and appendix a 2 2 a fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation in terms of area a it is a common belief that the first two terms in the momentum eq 1b the unsteady and fluid momentum contributions are of magnitude given by the square of the froude number of the flow that follows from the adoption of a physical length scale for disturbances in fact unsteady motion in a stream is determined by the variation with time of boundary conditions which in flood routing problems is given by the inflow hydrograph while physical length scales are determined by the governing equations fenton 2015 section 1 4 5 2018b section 3 7 3 showed theoretically and numerically that the first two momentum terms are of a magnitude 1 σ τ where σ τ is a dimensionless wave period in which σ 2 gs u u is the mean flow velocity and τ is a wave period imposed on the system by the inflow boundary conditions hence if the first two terms in the momentum equation are neglected as is commonly done one is actually making not a low froude number kinematic approximation but a very long wave or slow change approximation the intensified expression very long is necessary because we are already using a long wave theory in which the physical length of the waves is large enough that pressure is hydrostatic everywhere now it is required that the waves have a very long period in time so that 1 σ τ is small throughout the rest of this work very long will be used to mean that neglecting the first two terms in eq 1b as noted and also neglecting the inflow momentum term the equation can be re arranged to give an explicit expression for q 3 q q r a 1 1 sb a a x o 1 σ τ where q r a and b a have their functional dependence on area a shown explicitly and we have used the big o notation to show the size of the neglected terms this approximate momentum equation explicit in q can be used to eliminate it as a variable by substituting it into the mass conservation eq 1a to give a single partial differential equation in area a x t 4 a t x q r a 1 1 sb a a x q i o 1 σ τ performing the differentiation gives the fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation 5 a t d q r d a 1 a x q r a 2 1 x 1 sb a a x q i o 1 σ τ a similar expression has been given by cappelaere 1997 eqs 9 11 in terms of the water depth rather than area a that term is often ambiguous and poorly defined in rivers when it is not clear whether it is the local mean depth or the maximum depth at the thalweg whose position is usually not known accurately here throughout a will be used instead of such a quantity eq 5 could be solved numerically in this fully nonlinear form whose only approximation is that the waves be very long it would be convenient for problems where the upstream boundary condition was a stage hydrograph so that the variation of a with time was known there otherwise if inflow and or boundary conditions are expressed in terms of a discharge hydrograph or relationships or downstream discharge required as an output the formulation in terms of area a is not so convenient it is more general to use the following approach so that boundary conditions and or results can be specified and obtained in terms of either stage and or discharge the nonlinear equation obtained is simpler than eq 5 2 3 a general fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation the slow change routing equation consider the total volume of fluid upstream of a point x at a time t denoted by v x t 6 v x t x a x t d x see for example fenton and keller 2001 appendix b 2 3 from simple calculus the derivative of volume with respect to distance x gives the cross sectional area 7 a v x the time rate of change of v at a point is equal to the total rate upstream at which the volume is increasing which is that in the channel of interest beginning at x 0 x 0 x q i d x minus q the volume rate which is passing the point x and hence being no longer upstream hence 8 q v t x 0 x q i x d x with the definition of v in eq 6 as an indefinite integral the implication is that v is the total volume in the stream even including any fluid upstream of the initial point x 0 that is not a problem in practice as the integral actually does not have to be evaluated at the upstream boundary x 0 if a flow hydrograph q x 0 t is specified the boundary condition from eq 8 is then v x 0 t t q x 0 t if on the other hand we had considered v to be just the volume downstream of x 0 and used an integral from x 0 in its definition in eq 6 the boundary condition would be trivial v x 0 t t 0 but the inflow hydrograph would have to be included in the momentum equation which seems less intuitive substituting the definitions of a and q from eqs 7 and 8 shows that the mass conservation eq 1a is identically satisfied which is expected from a quantity like volume the simplified momentum eq 3 then gives an equation in the single dependent variable v that can be used for flood routing 9 v t q r v x 1 1 sb v x 2 v x 2 x 0 x q i x t d x o 1 σ τ where both q r and breadth b have been shown as functions of area a v x v x this is also a fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation in which the only approximation relative to the long wave equations has been that the variation with time is sufficiently slow its diffusive nature is clear from the second derivative even if under a square root sign boundary conditions involving discharge q or stage η can be incorporated using eqs 7 and 8 and the geometrical relationship between a and surface elevation η at a section of the stream eq 9 seems to have advantages over other approximate formulations including advection diffusion and muskingum formulations it is fully nonlinear only one quite explicit slow change approximation has been made and it can handle either discharge or stage boundary conditions and outputs fenton and keller 2001 used it for simulating flows in rivers and canals when it was incorrectly believed to be a low inertia model it has also been used for modelling of flows in irrigation ditches by barlow et al 2006 and by soroush et al 2013 who suggested the name slow change routing equation for upstream propagating waves also a slow flow limitation applies in those works it had some advantages in treating starting flows with an infinitesimal starting depth however it was found for stability that relatively small time steps or implicit methods must be used in this work it will later be shown that using the long wave equations themselves in terms of area a and discharge q together with an explicit finite difference scheme forward in time and with quadratic approximation in space is the simplest and most accurate method of flood routing a similar computational scheme can be developed for the slow change routing eq 9 however it has the finite limitation that waves be sufficiently long conditions slowly changing even though this is not particularly limiting in practice one may as well use the full equations with no such limit where that eq 9 and the concept of upstream volume are particularly useful for this work is that they allow the relatively simple and accurate passage between use of variables a and q in the development of the family of approximate routing equations which we are about to do conventional derivations usually involving surface elevation η have to go through difficult and not always clear approximations 2 4 the small diffusion approximation changes in surface slope are relatively small to obtain the types of equation in a single variable widely used for flood routing we make the next approximation that the magnitude of the quantity a x b a which is the derivative of the mean depth with respect to x is small compared with the slope s it can be shown that this means that changes in the slope of the free surface are relatively small compared with the mean surface or stream slope the approximate momentum eq 3 can then be written expanding the square root by the binomial theorem 10 q q r 1 1 bs a x q r 1 1 2 1 bs a x o 1 bs a x 2 and the neglected terms as shown by the big o notation will now be ignored consider this expression for q an approximate momentum equation now used in the term q x in the mass conservation eq 1a the equation governing disturbances becomes with no lateral inflow and neglecting derivatives of b and s 11 a t q x a t d q r d a 1 a x q r 2 bs 2 a x 2 0 an advection diffusion equation we see that the measure of the importance of the pressure or diffusion term in wave propagation is not simply the ratio of the first derivative term a x bs itself relative to 1 the explicit approximation we have made but the size of the second derivative term relative to that of the first derivative term if we had not included the a x bs term we would have no diffusion term at all hence we can think of it as a diffusion contribution and for convenience from now we will refer to approximations such as eq 10 as small diffusion approximations the question arises considering the two approximations that have been made are they connected and so might the satisfaction of one ensure that of the other the answer seems to be that they are not for the very long wave or slow change approximation 1 σ τ small is independent of the magnitude of a change while the small diffusion or small changes in surface slope approximation a x bs small is determined by that magnitude 2 5 small diffusion approximations advection diffusion equations now to obtain the types of equation in a single variable widely used for flood routing we make small diffusion approximations expanding the square roots in equations like 5 or 9 as a power series so that the governing equation appears as a linear combination of derivatives but where the coefficients of all those derivatives are nonlinear functions of the dependent variable throughout this work we will refer to such equations as quasilinear 2 5 1 advection diffusion equation in cross sectional area a considering the fully nonlinear eq 5 the small diffusion approximation is easily made by neglecting the diffusion terms under the square roots and the variation of sb a with x to give 12 a t c a a x ν a 2 a x 2 q i a well known conventional advection diffusion equation form where c a is the wave speed and ν a the diffusion coefficient 13 c a d q r a d a and ν a q r a 2 sb a we have used the non standard notation of showing the functional dependence a as subscripts it makes clearer the subsequent display of more complicated equations traditionally c has been called the kinematic wave speed but in view of the discovery mentioned in section 2 2 that the simplified momentum equation follows not from a neglect of dynamic terms but rather from a requirement that the wave motion have a very long period c is called here the very long wave speed 2 5 2 advection diffusion equation in upstream volume v other than a change in terminology from kinematic to a very long approximation the results in terms of a have contained no real surprises that is not the case if we make approximations considering volume v we re write the momentum eq 9 in terms of v by also making the small diffusion approximation expanding the square root as a power series and now neglecting lateral inflow to give 14 v t q r v x ν v x 2 v x 2 0 where the functional dependence of the diffusion coefficient ν v x is given by eq 13 if we write the second term as q r v x u r v x v x where u r v x is the mean fluid velocity remembering that v x is the area the equation becomes the advection diffusion equation 15 v t u r v x v x ν v x 2 v x 2 0 this reveals something interesting about the nature of the equations the advection velocity with which fluid volume is transported is the mean fluid velocity u r as we would expect physically however when in eq 12 we considered the area a which we have seen is the derivative of v with respect to x it was advected at a different velocity the very long wave speed c given by eq 13 this is also the speed at which a disturbance in surface elevation propagates it is interesting that this the most visible measurable and potentially dangerous quantity in a flood travels ahead of the substance of the flood the fluid volume todini 2007 went to some trouble to reconcile this ambiguity in developing his muskingum method to be described briefly below 2 5 3 advection diffusion equation in discharge q the two advection diffusion equations in a and v have been obtained relatively easily in particular the use of the single variable v which can be used to express both a and q eqs 7 8 has been very helpful now for completeness we consider obtaining a single equation in terms of discharge q and operations are rather more difficult differentiating eq 14 with respect to time t using the chain rule for differentiation and recognising that q r a c a 16 2 v t 2 c v x 2 v x t t ν v x 2 v x 2 0 derivatives of v can be eliminated using v t q and v x a eqs 7 and 8 17 q t c a q x ν a t a x ν a 2 q x 2 0 the area a still occurs in four places unlike the elimination of q above which was quite simple the obtaining of a in terms of q to eliminate it from the equation is a surprisingly long and complicated procedure and to do it we would have to follow a process such as that performed by price 1985 requiring several small diffusion approximations here we will go no further down that path we have already obtained a fully nonlinear advection diffusion eq 9 and a model quasilinear advection diffusion eq 14 or 15 both in terms of v which enables input of hydrographs and output of results in terms of discharge q it is simple however to obtain a linear advection diffusion equation in q by assuming that q and a deviate so little from values q 0 and a 0 of a steady uniform flow that the coefficients c a c 0 and ν a ν 0 are both constant given by uniform flow values so that eq 17 becomes 18a q t c 0 q x ν 0 2 q x 2 0 18b where c 0 d q r d a 0 and ν 0 q 0 2 sb 0 it is widely believed that this conventional advection diffusion equation is a good simple model of flood wave propagation to quote koussis 2009 p44 the linear ad vection diffusion equation is the simplest physically grounded flood routing model that adequately reproduces wave translation and attenuation and is important because its range of validity is wide while that statement is true it is worth summarising the situation more completely in view of the above in the approximate methods we are considering there is a fundamental limitation to waves that are very long and the well known advection diffusion routing equations are based on a small diffusion approximation giving quasilinear equations for both a and v with different advection velocities we have presented only a linear advection diffusion equation for discharge q there is nothing in that to contradict koussis statement however determinations of the range of validity have not been definitive and it may not be as wide as implied as will be seen below 2 6 small diffusion approximations muskingum equations it will be found that all equations in this section contain advective terms plus a diffusive term with combined x and t derivatives such that numerical approximation can be made by considering a computational rectangle in x t space such equations can be called quasi advection diffusion equations for simplicity here they will often be referred to as muskingum equations whereas finite difference expressions based on them will be called muskingum formulae 2 6 1 cunge 1969 cunge recognised that a simple advection equation is the first approximation to the long wave equations but that the actual physical diffusion could be mimicked by numerical diffusion using a four point box finite difference approximation to the equation which gave a muskingum formula consider the linear advection equation obtained by neglecting the diffusion term in eq 18a 19 q t c 0 q x 0 diffusion was introduced numerically also using four point finite difference approximations on a computational rectangle of dimensions δ x δ t in x t space this gave a muskingum scheme in the form 20a c 0 0 q i j c 1 0 q i 1 j c 0 1 q i j 1 c 1 1 q i 1 j 1 0 where 20b c 0 1 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν 0 c 0 c 1 1 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν 0 c 0 c 0 0 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν c 0 c 1 0 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν 0 c 0 where ν 0 is the linearised diffusion coefficient given by eq 18b the procedure described however gives a misleading picture and interpretation although it is not incorrect the consistency analysis that was performed to obtain the formulae used series operations in δ x and δ t to obtain an optimum value of a numerical interpolation parameter so as to match the physical diffusion the formula for that parameter contained δ x in the denominator which when used actually invalidates the results of the previous series operations however we can still determine what differential equation is actually being solved using this approach by performing a consistency analysis on the result we substitute the taylor series 21 q i i j j q i j i δ x q x i j j δ t q t i j 1 2 i δ x x j δ t t 2 q i j for i 0 and 1 and j 0 and 1 into eqs 20 corresponding to the four corners of the computational rectangle and perform series operations in δ x and δ t we find that the differential equation that muskingum cunge routing actually solves as do all muskingum methods when the equations are linearised is the linear muskingum equation 22 q t c 0 q x ν 0 c 0 2 q x t o δ x δ t the appearance of the mixed second derivative instead of a second derivative in x as in the advection diffusion eq 18a is hardly a surprise given the computational module of four points making a rectangle in x t space not enough to evaluate a second space derivative conventionally confronted with the muskingum equation people have justified its applicability by using the small diffusion approximation of neglecting the diffusion term to give t c 0 x and substituting into the mixed derivative in eq 22 to give a second derivative in x so that the equation approximates the advection diffusion one believed to be more valid although the process has been poorly quantified that is hardly necessary however for in the work of price we are about to describe briefly it was shown that a similar quasilinear muskingum equation for q is just as valid as advection diffusion equations 2 6 2 price 1985 price considered the long wave equations with a systematic repeated application of small diffusion approximations to eliminate a and to obtain a single quasilinear equation in discharge q the area and functions of it are deeply embedded in the equations and rather more effort was necessary to eliminate them than in the use of a and v above with the elimination of q the final result is what we call price s equation 23a q t c q x c t a c 2 q x cq i c t q 2 gas q i 23b where a q 2 bs 1 b ga c 2 β 2 c q a q 2 a 2 and where if β 1 part of the last term can be factorised as c q a 2 when the result is the same as eq 24 of price 1985 all quantities are functions of discharge q sometimes from quantities which are functions of area a that area here being obtained from the inverse formulation of the rating curve a q r 1 q price s symbol a has been used for the product of the diffusion coefficient ν q 2 bs and a term containing quantities which are proportional to the square of the froude number eq 23a is a quasilinear quasi advection diffusion equation with nonlinear coefficients and a mixed double differentiation first in x and then in t which can be numerically approximated by considering a computational rectangle in x t space the resulting finite difference expressions presented by price as his eqs 56 60 were recognised by him to be the same albeit nonlinear as those of earlier muskingum formulae 2 6 3 todini 2007 todini resolved ambiguities in propagation of total volume and of wave motion presenting a muskingum scheme in his eqs 46 53 later noting the typographical corrections to be made that in eq 52 in the notation of that work in the definition of c 1 that terms c t and d t in the numerator should actually be c t δ t and d t δ t respectively 2 6 4 price 2009 in this later work price rewrote the form of the time derivative contribution to the muskingum formulae his eqs 9 and 10 while mathematically equivalent to the original eqs 56 61 of price 1985 when approximated numerically with finite δ x and δ t the formulae are different from his original he noted that todini s formulation was essentially the same as his but that it did not include inertial terms or allowance for lateral inflow 2 6 5 perumal and price 2013 perumal and price 2013 presented another scheme their eqs 23 26 with different formulae for the coefficients 2 7 consistency analysis of the muskingum methods here we generalise the results of the quasilinear methods produced after cunge that have been mentioned price 1985 todini 2007 price 2009 perumal and price 2013 the equations have not been reproduced here as they are sometimes quite complicated each is in the form of a nonlinear muskingum formula which we write here symbolically in the same form as eq 20 for no lateral inflow 24 c 0 0 q i j c 1 0 q i 1 j c 0 1 q i j 1 c 1 1 q i 1 j 1 0 explicitly relating the values of discharge at the four corners of a computational rectangle but where the coefficients c 0 0 etc are nonlinear functions of the quantities ν q 2 sb possibly modified by inertial terms plus c d q d a and u q a at each point and sometimes combinations of such quantities all are functions of discharge that and area being related by the inverse of the rating curve or steady uniform flow formula a q r 1 q so that written mathematically we can compute the functional relationships b q u q c q and ν q in the different c coefficients the unknown q i 1 j 1 appears in several places quite implicitly and nonlinearly however its dominant occurrence is that explicitly shown multiplied by c 1 1 in eq 24 so for implementation of the schemes one can solve for it at each step by simple iteration as in each of the four cases the expression 24 is a nonlinear one to perform a consistency analysis to see to what differential equation the finite difference expressions correspond it is first necessary to linearise about a steady uniform flow q 0 we write 25 q i i j j q 0 ψ i i j j for i 0 1 and j 0 1 where ψ is the departure of discharge from the steady uniform value and is a small quantity now it is necessary to linearise all the functions used by writing them as taylor series for area a 26 a i i j j a 0 da dq 0 ψ i i j j o 2 where da dq 0 1 c 0 but for the other quantities only the lowest order expressions c q c 0 b q b 0 and ν q ν 0 are necessary substituting and performing the lengthy series operations using mathematical manipulation software neglecting all terms in 2 and higher at zeroeth order 0 the equations are satisfied identically at order the linearised equation was obtained in each of the four cases 27 c 0 0 ψ i j c 1 0 ψ i 1 j c 0 1 ψ i j 1 c 1 1 ψ i 1 j 1 0 where in three cases price 1985 todini 2007 price 2009 the coefficients c 0 0 etc were exactly the same as the equations from cunge s linear approach eqs 20 the subsequent consistency analysis as was done for that case showed that all three schemes do solve the linear muskingum eq 22 with an advection term plus a mixed derivative term with a coefficient ν 0 c 0 however using the formulae of perumal and price 2013 it was found instead that that coefficient appeared as ν 0 u 0 where u 0 is the mean flow velocity what this means is that when that muskingum equation is transformed by the small diffusion approximation into the advection diffusion equation the coefficient of diffusion is actually ν 0 c 0 u 0 too great by a factor c 0 u 0 which in the case of wide streams is about 5 3 this problem however did not show up in the computational results reported in the original paper perumal personal communication has suggested that they might have been obtained by assuming that the parameters were constant over a computational reach as the ability of the muskingum formulae to approximate the quasi advection diffusion equation depends on the precise implementation of the weights that useage would be quite enough to hide the incorrect diffusion 2 8 summary table 1 shows the hierarchy of approximations and equations that we have considered 3 accuracy of flood routing methods and quantifying the importance of diffusion a theoretical examination of the long wave equations and both main approximations the advection diffusion and muskingum methods will now be made it is necessary to linearise the equations 3 1 linear equations to linearise the long wave equations we use the upstream volume v introduced in 2 3 to convert the two equations to a single second order partial differential equation in terms of the single variable v here with zero lateral inflow such that q v t and a v x substituting into the mass conservation eq 1a shows that it is satisfied identically the momentum conservation eq 1b becomes 28 2 v t 2 2 β q a 2 v x t β q 2 a 2 ga b a 2 v x 2 gas 1 v t q r a 2 0 where for notational simplicity symbols q and a have been retained in coefficients of derivatives this formulation is not an advance for computational purposes as there are nonlinear occurrences of q and hence v t throughout for theoretical purposes however the equation is quite useful it is now linearised by considering relatively small disturbances about a uniform flow with area a 0 and discharge q 0 we substitute the series 29a v a 0 x q 0 t v a a 0 v x q q 0 v t and 29b q r a q 0 d q r d a 0 v x q 0 c 0 v x where v is a disturbance volume in which is a small quantity performing series operations to order and taking the coefficient of we obtain the linearised momentum equation a telegraph equation with a combination of first and second derivatives 30 σ 0 v t c 0 v x 2 v t 2 2 β u 0 2 v x t β u 0 2 ga 0 b 0 2 v x 2 0 where σ 0 is a resistance parameter which is the linearised value of the derivative of the resistance term in the momentum eq 1b with respect to discharge q 31 σ 0 q gas q 2 q r 2 a 0 2 ga 0 s q 0 2 gs u 0 without going into any detail here eq 30 can easily be used to support our assertion in 2 2 that the unsteady and inertial terms in the momentum equation are not of the order of the froude number squared but o 1 σ 0 τ where τ is wave period we note that the telegraph eq 30 is homogeneous linear in v and all coefficients are constant so that we can differentiate through with respect to t and using q q 0 v t from eq 29a and as q 0 is constant we can write the whole equation in terms of q instead of v introducing the dimensionless independent variables t σ 0 t and x σ 0 x c 0 such that the derivatives are 32 t σ 0 t and x σ 0 c 0 x the telegraph equation can be written in terms of dimensionless independent variables and coefficients 33 q t q x 2 q t 2 2 β α 2 q x t 1 α 2 f 2 1 β f 2 2 q x 2 0 where α c 0 u 0 which is 5 3 for a wide channel while β is slightly greater than 1 to allow for non uniformity of velocity over the cross section and for turbulence and f 2 u 0 2 g a 0 b 0 q 0 2 b 0 ga 0 3 is the square of the froude number as the variation of both parameters α and β is relatively minor it is interesting that the equation contains f 2 as the single important flow parameter the correspondingly transformed linear advection diffusion equation can be obtained similarly from eq 18a or simply extracted from eq 33 34 q t q x

for wave propagation for a solution to the linear equations we consider the propagation of a single wave periodic in time which could be considered to be one term of a fourier series in time describing the input hydrograph written in complex notation the solution for the whole channel is 37 q exp i κ x ω t where i 1 and ω is a real quantity which is the dimensionless radian frequency of the periodic motion it is the nature of the generally complex quantity κ that determines system behaviour in x as eqs 33 36 are homogeneous such that each term is linear in a derivative of q any constant multiplying the right side of eq 37 is arbitrary we have used a value of 1 we write κ κ r i κ i then the assumed solution eq 37 can be written 38 q exp κ i x exp i κ r x ω κ r t showing that the solution is an oscillatory wave propagating down the channel with velocity ω κ r and decaying in amplitude exponentially in x with a decay rate κ i substituting the solution given by eq 37 into the linearised equations the telegraph eq 33 corresponding to the long wave equations the advection diffusion eq 34 and price s muskingum eq 36 performing the differentiations and dividing through by common factors we obtain three polynomial equations where all variation with κ is as κ ω and where the effect of diffusion is isolated to a single parameter also containing the dimensionless frequency that we will call the diffusion frequency number 39 d ω α 2 f 2 the equations are from the long wave equations and linearised telegraph equation 40a 1 κ ω i d 1 β f 2 κ ω 2 α 2 f 2 2 α β f 2 κ ω 0 from the linear advection diffusion equation 40b 1 κ ω i d κ ω 2 0 from price s muskingum equation linearised with inertial terms 40c 1 κ ω i d κ ω 1 f 2 α 2 β 2 α 1 0 the first two equations are quadratic in the quantity κ ω while the third is linear some muskingum formulations do not include the inertial f 2 term shown in it explicit solutions to these equations can simply be written down and will not be shown here the diffusion frequency number d ω α 2 f 2 expresses the importance of diffusion on the propagation of any wave showing that it is greater for higher frequency contributions and slow flow large ω and small f 3 3 expressing the importance of diffusion in practice 3 3 1 diffusion frequency number as time variation is like ω t where t σ 0 t introduced before eq 32 then while t increases by a wave period τ ω t changes by 2 π so that 41 ω σ 0 τ 2 π and as σ 0 2 gs u 0 from eq 31 f 2 u 0 2 g a 0 b 0 and α 2 c 0 2 u 0 2 we obtain from eq 39 42 d 2 π τ ν 0 c 0 2 where ν 0 q 0 2 b 0 s is the linear diffusion coefficient introduced in eq 18b to express this in terms of channel quantities for practical purposes here we make a wide channel approximation and use the gauckler manning flow formula for a wide uniform stream 43 q 0 1 n h 0 5 3 s where q 0 is the discharge per unit width n is the manning resistance coefficient h 0 is flow depth and s is slope this gives from the wide channel versions of eqs 18b 44 c 0 dq dh 0 5 3 h 0 2 3 n s 5 3 q 0 2 5 n 3 5 s 3 10 and ν 0 q 0 2 sb 0 q 0 2 s substituting these into d given by eq 42 we obtain 45 d 9 π 25 n 6 5 q 0 1 5 s 8 5 τ we could use this to estimate the magnitude of d for any wave period τ present in an inflow hydrograph however to calculate an overall value of d for a flood event we choose q 0 q p the peak flood magnitude and a period τ 2 t p which is twice that of the time to rise to the peak t p as that rising limb often resembles half a cosine wave we then have the effective importance of diffusion for the overall flood event 46 d p 9 π 50 n 6 5 q p 1 5 s 8 5 t p usually the actual discharge q itself is known so we require an estimate of the width of the stream at the peak to calculate q p but in many cases width is known approximately enough we see that diffusion increases roughly linearly with resistance like n 6 5 and decreases with time to rise like 1 t p the effect of peak discharge is relatively weak at q p 1 5 however the effect of slope is like s 8 5 which is a very strong result this showing that for small slopes how diffusion is larger muskingum methods have often been reported to have had problems in such cases typically publications concerning muskingum methods have reported results for different values of resistance n and slope s but in most work only single values of peak discharge and t p have been considered apparently without realising that the latter has a finite effect more importantly however might be the effects of higher frequencies present in an inflow hydrograph giving values of d which might be several times or even many times that of the overall value d p which has not previously been considered 3 3 2 dimensionless period an anonymous referee has pointed out to the author that what here has been called the diffusion frequency number d can be related to the dimensionless period τ introduced by ponce et al 1978 eqns 2 5 47 τ u 0 s τ h 0 using the wide channel flow formula 43 with u 0 q 0 h 0 solving for h 0 and substituting we obtain the simple inverse relationship between d and τ 48 d 9 π 25 1 τ 1 τ that the dimensionless period τ is an expression of diffusion is not immediately obvious from its definition eq 47 as it superficially apparently contains no explicit advection diffusion related terms above we went in the reverse direction going to some trouble defining d in terms of advection and diffusion quantities but we have ended up showing that it too can be expressed in terms of the simple channel quantities to quantify the effects of diffusion we prefer to think in terms of dimensionless diffusion rather than dimensionless period its inverse 3 4 results for accuracy of the approximate methods in an earlier discussion the author fenton 2013 compared the accuracy of the muskingum approximation using advection diffusion results as the standard using linear theory only in the preparation of the present work did he realise that linear advection diffusion methods are also based on a small diffusion approximation here we more correctly present linear results for both advection diffusion and muskingum approximations using the long wave equations as the standard fig 1 shows comparisons between numerical solutions of the algebraic eqs 40 for the different theories plotted for several values of froude number between 0 1 and 0 5 using the wide channel value α 5 3 and β 1 part a shows results for the propagation speed in x t co ordinates it is 1 κ r using the notation above so in physical terms it is c 0 κ r α u 0 κ r and from this in fig 1 a we have plotted the dimensionless propagation speed divided by g depth giving α f κ r for small diffusion the results from the telegraph equation considered the standard show that speed is given by the very long wave speed c g depth α f 5 3 f while for large dimensionless diffusion not so long waves generated by fast gate movements for example the speeds tend to other values given by the classical result from long wave theory that ignores resistance this limit is not important for us here it can be seen that both muskingum methods and advection diffusion methods are accurate for small diffusion but there are limiting values of diffusion frequency number beyond which they should not be applied the coarsely spaced dotted lines show the limiting value of d for relative errors of less than 5 as calculated theoretically for small froude number in the following section the advection diffusion methods are accurate over a wider range than the muskingum methods fig 1 b shows results for the diminution in magnitude of the flood wave along the channel there is no fundamental distance scale in a routing problem but one can say that there is a time scale characterising a flood event the time to rise to the peak value so that in the expression exp κ i x a value of x has been used corresponding to the distance travelled by the flood wave during a period equal to the time to rise x t 1 κ r but where ω t π half a wave corresponds to the time to rise so we have plotted values of 49 exp ω κ i t κ r exp π κ i κ r for this quantity more important than wave speed fig 1 b shows that there is a well defined limit in d beyond which muskingum methods should not be applied the advection diffusion methods are accurate for small froude numbers over a wider range but for faster flows the limiting d is about the same as for muskingum 3 5 theoretical calculation of accuracy limits for approximate routing methods ponce et al 1978 obtained limits to applicability of the advection diffusion approximation in fact it is possible to establish such bounds for both advection diffusion and muskingum approaches quite systematically one can obtain power series solutions in d to the governing linearised eqs 40 by expanding the analytical solutions as power series or finding the coefficients in the power series by more direct methods the expressions can become unwieldy for simplicity in this section we use the wide channel value α 5 3 and β 1 from the solution of the linearised advection diffusion eq 40b 50 κ ω 1 i d 2 d 2 o d 3 to be compared with eq 40a from the linearised telegraph equation 51 κ ω 1 i 1 4 9 f 2 d 2 4 9 f 2 16 27 f 4 d 2 o d 3 both show that at zeroeth order the solution κ ω 1 such that κ r ω 1 and κ i 0 corresponding to a uniformly progressing wave now using this example we calculate the relative error in the wave speed by using the advection diffusion method with the result shown above that wave speed is proportional to 1 κ r we obtain using δ the symbol for the magnitude of the relative error 52 δ c ad c telegraph 1 κ r telegraph κ r ad 1 and from eqs 50 and 51 and then performing power series operations 53 δ 1 2 4 9 f 2 16 27 f 4 d 2 1 2 d 2 1 4 9 d 2 f 2 1 4 3 f 2 o d 3 this can be solved to give the criterion for d such that the relative error is less than δ such operations were repeated for the errors in wave magnitude and then for both wave speed and magnitude errors using muskingum methods when it was necessary to use higher order series for presentation here however results to leading order only in both d and froude number f were retained and shown here when the extra inertial terms in price s eq 23b are neglected and the result is the same as the other muskingum theories the results are given in table 2 such that for a relative error of less than δ in wave speed or magnitude d should be limited as shown it is surprising that there is such a variety of powers of δ and f these results are plotted as coarsely spaced dotted lines on fig 1 for a standard error value of δ 0 05 or 5 and it can be seen that in most of the four cases these formula seem to predict quite well where the two approximate theories have begun to deviate by about 5 from the long wave equation case in the case of the results for wave magnitude with the advection diffusion method it is not quite so clear as the accuracy boundary is very close to the result for f 0 1 from the last formula in the table and from the figure we see that the boundary for d is quite a strongly varying function of the froude number f in fact a simple and useful result can be obtained recalling from eq 39 that d ω α 2 f 2 and using the last limitation in table 2 factors of f 2 cancel and we find the simple frequency limitation ω 9 α 2 δ 4 π in our dimensionless co ordinates we obtain ω 2 π σ 0 τ from eq 41 and so for advection diffusion methods we obtain the simple accuracy limitation 54 1 σ 0 τ 9 α 2 δ 8 π 2 δ 3 after so much mathematics it is interesting that we have returned to the very long wave type of condition specified at the very beginning of this work as shown in the approximate momentum eq 3 that neglected terms are o 1 σ 0 τ our detailed calculations here have led to an equivalent surprisingly simple statement to express it in terms of channel and flood quantities we use the definition of σ 0 2 gs u 0 from eq 31 and for completeness we use the gauckler manning formula for flow resistance for uniform flow in a wide rectangular channel of discharge q 0 per unit width giving the criterion of eq 55a below for muskingum methods the slightly more demanding of the two criteria for δ 0 05 is that for the flood magnitude we use eq 45 for d to give the criterion for the use of muskingum methods eq 55b below the limitations on the use of the two approximate flood routing theories to limit the relative error in flood magnitude to less than δ are advection diffusion 55a 1 σ 0 τ u 0 2 gs τ q 0 2 5 2 gs 7 10 n 3 5 τ δ 3 muskingum 55b d 9 π 25 q 0 1 5 n 6 5 s 8 5 τ δ 3 π 1 3 the results have been presented in terms of the main physical characteristics of the channel and flood event with wave period τ in the denominators showing that they are also very long wave limits strangely the manning coefficient n has a different effect in the two cases again we see that in the muskingum case the slope s appears in the denominator with a large exponent of 8 5 leading to problems with muskingum methods for small slopes also and what has not been emphasised in the muskingum literature the wave period plays a role the limitations in eqs 55 are for the period τ of any wave in the input hydrograph if the overall flood wave is fast rising it will be more difficult to satisfy the inequalities accuracy will be diminished if there are fluctuations and hence short period waves present in all the above we obtained results for a single periodic wave of period τ and frequency ω 2 π τ in the case of the overall hydrograph we chose a period τ 2 t p which was twice that of the time to rise to the peak t p as that rising limb often resembles half a cosine wave we then had the effective importance of diffusion for such a smoothly varying flood event if one had an inflow hydrograph which was close to such an ideal one could calculate the importance of diffusion and if it were sufficiently small one could use advection diffusion or muskingum routing as they are both based on a small diffusion approximation however in the case of a general hydrograph input which could be represented by a fourier series in time with a number of frequencies present such that ω j j 2 π σ 0 t where t is the total length of hydrograph and 1 σ 0 t is the fundamental dimensionless frequency and j 1 2 is an integer which can be large then the effective diffusion of the higher frequency components becomes much larger and the application of low diffusion approximations such as advection diffusion and muskingum becomes questionable for general inflow hydrographs thereby throwing doubt on their utility as flood routing tools 4 flood routing methods 4 1 numerical solution of the long wave equations in view of the finite range of validity of advection diffusion and muskingum methods for flood routing especially for fast rising floods and for inflow hydrographs with fluctuations it is necessary to have available a method that has no such limitations the long wave equation formulation for flood routing problems indeed has no essential accuracy limitations other than the modelling limitations as set out in 2 especially for flood routing where detailed knowledge of the stream geometry may not be available the form of the equations in eq 1 is particularly suitable based on use of the discharge q and cross sectional area a as they allow the specification of stream geometry in a quite approximate sense the parameters necessary are possibly the rating curve relationship q r a which can be calculated from rating data fenton 2018a and if that is not known it can be calculated from eq 2 using a resistance coefficient like manning s n plus stream surface width b a and wetted perimeter p a however in many streams neither p nor b vary much and simple approximate values could be used this compares with the approximate flood routing methods which require the computation of c d q r d a non trivial for some river cross sections the long wave equations can be solved by an explicit forward time quadratic space ftqs scheme which is the simplest and most obvious method the use of the term quadratic space pertains to the use of quadratic variation with three point finite difference formulae for derivatives at the left middle or right end of the computational module see appendix a such an explicit scheme has hardly been used because liggett and cunge 1975 p111 mistakenly declared it unconditionally unstable and named it the unstable scheme this may have contributed to both the extensive use of complicated implicit methods for the long wave equations and to the proliferation of muskingum methods fenton 2014 section 6 found that the ftqs scheme was not unconditionally unstable and presented stability criteria and a figure showing that over a wide range of bed slopes and froude numbers the time step had limiting values in the range of 10 s to 300 s while that is very much smaller than the values allowed by muskingum methods or implicit long wave equation solvers in practice it seems not to be a problem as the scheme is simple and explicit as shown below computational costs seem to be roughly the same as for muskingum methods the author s suggestion is not to bother computing the stability limits from the theory but choosing a time step of say 30 s and if a computation does go unstable halve the time step and if necessary repeat the details of the computational scheme using discharge q and area a as dependent variables are set out in appendix a the common downstream condition for simple routing purposes is described where the computational domain is truncated at an arbitrary point in the stream and no computations are performed beyond that point often in simulations using the long wave equations an assumption is made that the stage there is given by normal depth as if uniform flow conditions existed beyond that point this is not quite correct and introduces finite errors diffusing upstream we advocate simply treating the downstream point as part of the stream which of course it is and computing the x derivatives using backwards differences the method has been found to work well as shown in fenton 2014 section 7 and fenton 2018b section 3 6 further evidence for the accuracy of the method is provided in a hidden manner in fig 2 explained in the accompanying description there this open boundary condition is similar to that of muskingum methods where also all information is assumed to come from upstream for more general boundary conditions a number of different cases are given in fenton 2018b section 3 6 in general applications as q is a dependent variable the discharge hydrograph q x i t at any point i is obtained as part of the computations which is sometimes enough for flood routing purposes however if one were given a stage hydrograph as input or needed one at any other point as output it would be necessary to know cross sectional details there to go between values of a and stage 4 2 numerical solution of the slow change routing equation eq 9 is a single equation in a single unknown the upstream volume v which may be more useful for theoretical or conceptual considerations such as in 2 than in routing applications the method uses the same stream information as the long wave equations and similarly simple assumptions can be made for the geometrical quantities of surface width b and wetted perimeter p ftqs approximation can be used including for evaluating the second derivative the details will not be presented here more sophisticated methods have been presented by barlow et al 2006 and by soroush et al 2013 even though this method works well and accurately over a wide range as will be seen there are finite limits to its accuracy for waves that are too short or variation too rapid the equation is of advection diffusion type and there are finite stability limits on the time step which are slightly more demanding than those for the ftqs solution of the long wave equations nevertheless it is a possibly useful alternative in a single variable in general the long wave equations themselves are to be preferred for flood routing purposes 4 3 small diffusion methods above a number of approximate equations have been presented found to have finite accuracy criteria below we will examine the performance of some of them including the quasilinear advection diffusion eq 14 and the four point muskingum formulae considered in 2 6 5 examples results from the various methods were calculated for a sequence of five different problems in the transition range of diffusion frequency number d where it went from sufficiently small for application of muskingum methods to large computational parameters are given in table 3 and the results shown in fig 2 the basis for comparison was provided by numerical solutions of the long wave equations the performances of the slow change routing equation quasilinear advection diffusion equation and various muskingum methods were tested as well as the proposed open downstream boundary condition the effects of channel cross section were ignored by considering an infinitely wide rectangular channel in the first rows of the table are given values of the two parameters measuring the applicability of a theory d p and σ 0 τ given by the peak discharge and τ given by twice the time to rise of the peak plus the limiting values of those parameters for the two approximate theories given in eq 55 two inflow hydrographs were used 1 a function mimicking an idealised hydrograph with a smooth relatively rapid rise but slower fall 56 q x 0 t q min q p q min t t p e 1 t t p 5 where q p and t p are the peak values of discharge

boussinesq coefficient used in the momentum equation was β 1 05 of interest are the computational steps used and the actual computer times shown in the table the muskingum methods were applied with customary large time steps of 900 or 1800 s whereas to ensure stability both explicit ftqs methods used a constant step of only 30 s which is derisorily small compared with those allowed by muskingum methods or implicit computational methods we did not experiment with changing the time step with that small value satisfactory results were obtained and the computational time as shown was roughly the same as for the muskingum methods we concluded that the finite stability criteria of the ftqs methods was not a problem the results in fig 2 show that the dependence of the accuracy of the muskingum methods on diffusion is much as predicted by the theoretical results shown in fig 1 the numerical values of the diffusion frequency number d p being shown in the first rows of table 3 it is interesting that results from three of the muskingum methods agreed very closely those of price 1985 todini 2007 and price 2009 this is somewhat surprising as the two price papers use different muskingum formulae price in the 2009 paper did note theoretical agreement between that and the todini formulae but that the latter contained no inertial unsteady terms which price 1985 went to some trouble to include unnecessarily it seems for these problems as suggested by the discovery reported in section 2 2 that the fundamental approximation is not a kinematic one but a slow variation one the fully nonlinear slow change routing equation is found to be quite accurate over the whole range tested and the quasilinear advection diffusion equation found to be more accurate than the linear analysis suggested only the muskingum methods performed poorly for larger diffusion cases a small diffusion d p 0 11 the diffusion is small enough that we expect muskingum results to be satisfactory and indeed the results from three of the muskingum methods reproduce the behaviour as modelled by the long wave equations very well indeed the extra diffusion by a factor of c 0 u 0 5 3 in the method of perumal and price 2013 noted in 2 7 seems to be borne out by the computations in this example the resistance is small with n 0 015 contributing to the smallness of d p but the counteracting all important bed slope is also quite small at s 0 0002 so that there would be many examples in practice of rather steeper rivers where d p would be smaller and muskingum results would be just as satisfactory results from the slow change routing eq 9 and the quasilinear advection diffusion equation agree closely with those from the long wave equations b slightly larger d p 0 29 errors using muskingum methods are beginning to be apparent and greater than 5 as we expect from the theoretical limit of d 0 22 c compound hydrograph d p 0 72 and secondary fluctuations with d 1 0 this shows the effects of increasing diffusion and those of higher frequency components a cosine wave with two fourier components as given by eq 57 was used giving two inflow maxima of 10 m 2 s 1 and an interim minimum of 8 m 2 s 1 the effective d of the secondary wave computed using the magnitude of the discharge fluctuation and of course with twice the frequency of the main flood was d 1 0 larger than that of the primary and the errors of the muskingum methods are now larger the advection diffusion methods are still quite accurate when such a secondary oscillation with twice the frequency of the fundamental was used as input in the low diffusion cases of a and b above there was no such deterioration in accuracy as even the d of the secondary oscillation was small enough in general however we expect there to be input signals showing rather higher frequencies than the simple ones used here and the effects on the small diffusion approximation methods especially muskingum to be strong d finite diffusion d p 1 4 now diffusion is sufficiently important that even for an input approximating a single wave the muskingum methods are not accurate enough the parameter values n 0 05 s 0 0001 t p 12 h are quite possible in routing problems results from the slow change routing eq 9 are generally quite accurate but now show some disagreement where change is not slow e large diffusion d p 8 6 with the same channel as d but a faster rising flood the strongly diffusive effects of shorter waves are clear no muskingum results have been shown the slow change routing eq 9 is still quite accurate surprisingly the quasilinear advection diffusion equation has not lost as much accuracy as linear theory would suggest for such a value of d this is in accordance with the findings of zoppou and o neill 1982 all figs 2 a e contain hidden extra results that in each two curves have been plotted for the long wave eqs 1 both visually coincident one was plotted from results at the end point of the computations in the stream the other was from the same point but taken from a computation that extended further for a total length of twice the first the coincidence of the results shows the satisfying performance of the method for treating the downstream point as an open boundary described in appendix a conventional use of an assumed uniform flow rating curve here gave finite errors 6 conclusions in the introduction the general structure of the paper was summarised here specific results are itemised the families of approximate flood routing methods muskingum and advection diffusion are based on two approximations one that waves have a very long period slow change the other that variations in the surface slope are relatively small this means that the apparent diffusion should be small the magnitude of that diffusion in any problem has been made explicit by a dimensionless diffusion frequency number from this criteria for practical use of the approximate methods are obtained which reveal when they have difficulties for large diffusion the effect of slope s on diffusion is strong with the effective diffusion varying like s 8 5 showing why streams of small slope have always caused problems for muskingum methods the effect on diffusion of the wave period τ of a component of the inflow hydrograph is like 1 τ such that also for faster rising flood waves diffusion is more important and the accuracy of muskingum and advection diffusion methods is degraded even if an overall inflow hydrograph were sufficiently slowly varying for the approximate theory to apply any fluctuations in it would cause shorter period waves to be present as harmonics whose accuracy of simulation might be quite poor all muskingum methods actually solve a quasi advection diffusion equation with a mixed second derivative term which is obvious from the four point computational module used price 1985 showed that this is a consistent small diffusion approximation to the problem expressing the equations in terms of discharge four muskingum formulations have been tested for consistency with the governing equation one has been found to have an incorrect diffusion coefficient in many practical problems both advection diffusion and muskingum methods are accurate enough with advection diffusion being more accurate however in view of the approximate methods not being accurate for all conditions it is desirable to have a simple flood routing method without any essential important restrictions such a method is available using the long wave equations themselves expressed in terms of discharge and cross sectional area surprisingly the equations can be solved approximately with relatively few geometric details paradoxically even fewer than the common approximate flood routing methods the presentation of the long wave equations has contained a novelty expressing the resistance in the equations in terms of a more hydrologically oriented quantity the discharge as a function of area obtained from a rating curve in rivers this is often what is known at one or more stations rather than values of resistance coefficients a simple explicit numerical scheme can be used using finite differences forward in time and quadratic in space time steps much smaller than those of muskingum methods must be used but the simplicity of the method means that any common flood routing problem can be solved quickly and accurately which is not guaranteed for the approximate routing methods declaration of interests none appendix a computational scheme for solving the long wave equations the following details are enough for typical simple flood routing problems the scheme is set out in greater detail in fenton 2018b section 3 6 which includes a number of different input and boundary conditions and the possible use of irregularly spaced computational points consider the forward difference approximation for the time derivative at a computational point x i t j a 1 f t i j f x i t j δ t f x i t j δ t and the quadratic approximations for the spatial derivatives at three equally spaced points in terms of the function values at those points are a 2a f x 0 3 f 0 4 f 1 f 2 2 δ x a 2b f x i f i 1 f i 1 2 δ x for i 1 2 n 1 a 2c f x n f n 2 4 f n 1 3 f n 2 δ x usually one just considers the centred approximation a 2b but here we are going to present expressions for boundary conditions which make use of the other two as well initial conditions the simplest method of obtaining initial conditions over a variable computational reach is to assume an approximate solution with constant discharge and something like linear free surface variation and compute until all waves generated by that incorrect solution have left the system and then use the results as the real initial conditions at every time level t perform the following operations to calculate the solution at the next time level t δ t upstream point i 0 where information is usually given as a function of time if the inflow hydrograph q x 0 t is known one can easily calculate q x 0 t δ t to calculate a x 0 t δ t one uses the mass conservation eq 1 with a t approximated by eq a 1 and q x obtained from eq a 2a using the values of q x i t at i 0 1 and 2 otherwise if the stage hydrograph is known giving a x 0 t one calculates a x 0 t δ t then for q x 0 t δ t one uses the momentum conservation eq 1b with q x

6705,the hierarchy of one dimensional equations and numerical methods describing the motion of floods and disturbances in streams is studied critically reviewed and a number of results obtained initially the long wave equations are considered when presented in terms of discharge and cross sectional area they enable the development of simple fully nonlinear advection diffusion models whose only approximation is that disturbances be very long easily satisfied in most flood routing problems then making the approximation that changes in surface slope are relatively small such that diffusion terms in the equations are small various advection diffusion and muskingum models are derived several well known muskingum formulations are tested one is found to be in error the three families of governing equations the long wave equations and the advection diffusion and the muskingum approximations are linearised and analytical solutions obtained a dimensionless diffusion frequency number measures the accuracies of the approximate methods criteria for practical use are given which reveal when they have difficulties for streams of small slope for fast rising floods and or when shorter period waves are present in an inflow hydrograph they can probably be used in most flood routing problems with an idealised smooth inflow however the fact that they cannot be used for all problems requires a general alternative flood routing method for which it is recommended to use the long wave equations themselves written in terms of discharge and cross sectional area when a surprisingly simple physical stream model can be used an explicit finite difference numerical method is presented that can be used with different inflow specifications and downstream boundary conditions and is recommended for general use keywords advection diffusion approximate methods long wave equations muskingum numerical methods 1 introduction the one dimensional long wave equations are a good simple model of the complicated mechanics of flows and flood waves in rivers they incorporate the important physical features and are considered the foundation of flood routing however in that field much attention has been given to alternative approximate methods especially muskingum and advection diffusion methods the aims of this paper are to develop and explain different flood routing methods in light of recent research to relate and compare them to determine their accuracy limits and finally to show that a formulation of the long wave equations themselves in terms of discharge and area with an explicit numerical method has advantages those long wave equations are the basis of a hierarchy of approximations which is developed and studied here the fundamental one is that the disturbances be very long not just in the usual spatial sense which gives the name to the equations but in a rather longer time sense for which a criterion is given usually easily satisfied by flood waves but excluding waves such as those generated by rapid control gate movements two fully nonlinear advection diffusion equations are obtained either could be used for flood routing the next approximation made the usual flood routing one is that relative changes in surface slope are small which means that the effects of diffusion are relatively small this leads to two families of quasilinear approximations advection diffusion and muskingum methods four well known muskingum formulations are tested by analysing for consistency one has an incorrect diffusion coefficient to examine the accuracy of the different approximate schemes the long wave equations advection diffusion equations and muskingum equations are all linearised and analytical solutions obtained the effects of diffusion quantifying when the schemes are accurate for practical problems are able to be expressed in terms of a single non dimensional diffusion frequency number written in terms of the channel resistance parameter either discharge or depth stream slope thus quantifying what has always been found in practice that muskingum schemes give problems for small slopes but also quantifying the largely unsuspected effect of wave period in the inflow hydrograph both approximations advection diffusion and muskingum especially the latter are vulnerable to shorter period fluctuations as they are small diffusion approximations and rapidly rising floods and or shorter components present in a general input hydrograph have larger effective diffusion computational examples are presented showing how the advection diffusion and muskingum methods work well when the diffusion frequency number is small and are accurate enough for many flood propagation problems however it is easy to find problems where especially muskingum methods are not accurate in such cases it is desirable to have a simple flood routing method without any essential important restrictions such a method is available using the long wave equations themselves expressed in terms of discharge and cross sectional area the surprising result is shown that the equations can be solved approximately with relatively few geometric details paradoxically even fewer than the common approximate flood routing methods a simple explicit numerical scheme can be used small time steps must be used but the simplicity of the method means that any common flood routing problem can be quickly solved practical details for implementation are described including the incorporation of different boundary conditions the method is recommended as a relatively simple and reliable tool for flood routing problems 2 equations governing flood wave propagation the original muskingum method was based on a single reach lumped approach to volume conservation using concepts such as prism and wedge storage often termed hydrologic routing one can obtain the characteristic four point muskingum formula using such methods but the approximations for channel routing are severe and some of the concepts nebulous as described by koussis 2009 pp 46 47 in this work a hydraulic approach will be followed even in works of a hydrologic nature the bases for accuracy comparisons are from the hydraulic equations a full three dimensional model of a river would use the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics in three dimensions complete with boundary conditions over the irregular boundary were we able to specify that and if we were able to solve the equations that is not feasible we have to resort to modelling and the major approximation is that the flow in the river is a turbulent shear flow where we model the resistance of the bed on the flow empirically we integrate across the whole river section turning the problem into a one dimensional one if the river flows onto flood plains the approximate model becomes less satisfactory including the considerations of for example knight and shiono 1996 and to model it in detail becomes difficult this is probably the most important weakness of the one dimensional model secondary flows while affecting sediment motions would play a small role in flood dynamics if any wave disturbances were short enough the pressure in the flow would not be hydrostatic and the momentum equation should have boussinesq corrections including third derivatives of the surface elevation e g darvishi et al 2017 this would be important at the front face of a quickly rising flood where steepening might lead to surface undulations and even to a flash flood however usually flood waves are sufficiently slowly rising that this is not the case finally the effects of meandering can be described by a one dimensional approach incorporating stream curvature but this has been shown to be almost always unnecessary fenton 2015 we are left with the approximations that the stream is straight pressure is hydrostatic and resistance will be modelled by either a measured rating curve or by an empirical formula such as the gauckler manning equation these simplifications are accurate enough to give a model which is manageable and can adequately describe the propagation of most floods in real rivers from that a series of approximations will be made and examined 2 1 the long wave equations for our purposes the equations in terms of the integrated quantities of discharge q and cross sectional area a are more useful both theoretically and practically than those in terms of velocity and or surface elevation the straight channel equations are following fenton 2010 section 5 1 2018 section 3 5 3 but here expressing the resistance in terms of q r a the discharge of a steady uniform flow of that cross sectional area 1a a t q x q i 1b q t x β q 2 a ga b a x gas 1 q 2 q r 2 a β i u i q i where t is time x is a horizontal cartesian co ordinate along the line of the river and q i is the lateral inflow volume per unit time per unit length of river other quantities include β the boussinesq momentum coefficient slightly greater than unity g the gravitational acceleration b the surface width and s the local mean downstream slope of the stream bed the function q r a is the discharge as obtained from a rating curve area is always obtained as part of a rating measurement or calculated from familiar flow formulae 2 q r a measured for rated discharge 1 n a 5 3 p 2 3 a s gauckler manning c a 3 p a s 8 ga 3 λ p a s chezy weisbach where n is manning s coefficient p is the wetted perimeter which is a function of area a as shown c is the chézy coefficient and λ is the weisbach resistance coefficient the momentum contribution of inflow on the right of eq 1b is usually not included as it is small and poorly known in it β i is the boussinesq momentum coefficient of the inflow and u i is the x component of its velocity zero in the case of rain or seepage the use of the rating curve function q r a to characterise resistance is a departure from traditional practice and does something to unify hydrologic and hydraulic concepts it may have some practical use for often the rating curve function at least at discrete stations is measured and quite well known whereas resistance coefficients such as manning s are usually not well known and their usually assumed constant nature is an approximation a number of aspects and practical results of the computation of rating curves has been considered by fenton 2018a giving robust methods of approximating data it was concluded that it is nearly impossible to calculate the rising and falling limbs of the rating curve in a flood event because the resistance in the channel changes during such an event if the bed particles move in a manner unable to be predicted accurately however it was shown how maximum and minimum envelopes to ratings can also be calculated which could be used in the present work as a rational approximation to put bounds on calculations the long wave eqs 1 are actually simple in form with first order derivatives combined with nonlinear coefficients using a as presented instead of surface elevation has a big advantage for approximate flood routing the only places in those equations where the bathymetry appears are in the three often relatively weakly varying quantities surface width b wetted perimeter p and slope s in many cases the simple modelling assumption could be made that each is constant and that the wetted perimeter is approximately equal to the surface width this compares with approximate flood routing methods which require the computation of the wave speed in the form c d q r d a which in natural streams is difficult and possibly sensitive to fluctuations for the moment we only require the equations for theoretical purposes their application in flood routing computations will be described in section 4 1 and appendix a 2 2 a fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation in terms of area a it is a common belief that the first two terms in the momentum eq 1b the unsteady and fluid momentum contributions are of magnitude given by the square of the froude number of the flow that follows from the adoption of a physical length scale for disturbances in fact unsteady motion in a stream is determined by the variation with time of boundary conditions which in flood routing problems is given by the inflow hydrograph while physical length scales are determined by the governing equations fenton 2015 section 1 4 5 2018b section 3 7 3 showed theoretically and numerically that the first two momentum terms are of a magnitude 1 σ τ where σ τ is a dimensionless wave period in which σ 2 gs u u is the mean flow velocity and τ is a wave period imposed on the system by the inflow boundary conditions hence if the first two terms in the momentum equation are neglected as is commonly done one is actually making not a low froude number kinematic approximation but a very long wave or slow change approximation the intensified expression very long is necessary because we are already using a long wave theory in which the physical length of the waves is large enough that pressure is hydrostatic everywhere now it is required that the waves have a very long period in time so that 1 σ τ is small throughout the rest of this work very long will be used to mean that neglecting the first two terms in eq 1b as noted and also neglecting the inflow momentum term the equation can be re arranged to give an explicit expression for q 3 q q r a 1 1 sb a a x o 1 σ τ where q r a and b a have their functional dependence on area a shown explicitly and we have used the big o notation to show the size of the neglected terms this approximate momentum equation explicit in q can be used to eliminate it as a variable by substituting it into the mass conservation eq 1a to give a single partial differential equation in area a x t 4 a t x q r a 1 1 sb a a x q i o 1 σ τ performing the differentiation gives the fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation 5 a t d q r d a 1 a x q r a 2 1 x 1 sb a a x q i o 1 σ τ a similar expression has been given by cappelaere 1997 eqs 9 11 in terms of the water depth rather than area a that term is often ambiguous and poorly defined in rivers when it is not clear whether it is the local mean depth or the maximum depth at the thalweg whose position is usually not known accurately here throughout a will be used instead of such a quantity eq 5 could be solved numerically in this fully nonlinear form whose only approximation is that the waves be very long it would be convenient for problems where the upstream boundary condition was a stage hydrograph so that the variation of a with time was known there otherwise if inflow and or boundary conditions are expressed in terms of a discharge hydrograph or relationships or downstream discharge required as an output the formulation in terms of area a is not so convenient it is more general to use the following approach so that boundary conditions and or results can be specified and obtained in terms of either stage and or discharge the nonlinear equation obtained is simpler than eq 5 2 3 a general fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation the slow change routing equation consider the total volume of fluid upstream of a point x at a time t denoted by v x t 6 v x t x a x t d x see for example fenton and keller 2001 appendix b 2 3 from simple calculus the derivative of volume with respect to distance x gives the cross sectional area 7 a v x the time rate of change of v at a point is equal to the total rate upstream at which the volume is increasing which is that in the channel of interest beginning at x 0 x 0 x q i d x minus q the volume rate which is passing the point x and hence being no longer upstream hence 8 q v t x 0 x q i x d x with the definition of v in eq 6 as an indefinite integral the implication is that v is the total volume in the stream even including any fluid upstream of the initial point x 0 that is not a problem in practice as the integral actually does not have to be evaluated at the upstream boundary x 0 if a flow hydrograph q x 0 t is specified the boundary condition from eq 8 is then v x 0 t t q x 0 t if on the other hand we had considered v to be just the volume downstream of x 0 and used an integral from x 0 in its definition in eq 6 the boundary condition would be trivial v x 0 t t 0 but the inflow hydrograph would have to be included in the momentum equation which seems less intuitive substituting the definitions of a and q from eqs 7 and 8 shows that the mass conservation eq 1a is identically satisfied which is expected from a quantity like volume the simplified momentum eq 3 then gives an equation in the single dependent variable v that can be used for flood routing 9 v t q r v x 1 1 sb v x 2 v x 2 x 0 x q i x t d x o 1 σ τ where both q r and breadth b have been shown as functions of area a v x v x this is also a fully nonlinear advection diffusion equation in which the only approximation relative to the long wave equations has been that the variation with time is sufficiently slow its diffusive nature is clear from the second derivative even if under a square root sign boundary conditions involving discharge q or stage η can be incorporated using eqs 7 and 8 and the geometrical relationship between a and surface elevation η at a section of the stream eq 9 seems to have advantages over other approximate formulations including advection diffusion and muskingum formulations it is fully nonlinear only one quite explicit slow change approximation has been made and it can handle either discharge or stage boundary conditions and outputs fenton and keller 2001 used it for simulating flows in rivers and canals when it was incorrectly believed to be a low inertia model it has also been used for modelling of flows in irrigation ditches by barlow et al 2006 and by soroush et al 2013 who suggested the name slow change routing equation for upstream propagating waves also a slow flow limitation applies in those works it had some advantages in treating starting flows with an infinitesimal starting depth however it was found for stability that relatively small time steps or implicit methods must be used in this work it will later be shown that using the long wave equations themselves in terms of area a and discharge q together with an explicit finite difference scheme forward in time and with quadratic approximation in space is the simplest and most accurate method of flood routing a similar computational scheme can be developed for the slow change routing eq 9 however it has the finite limitation that waves be sufficiently long conditions slowly changing even though this is not particularly limiting in practice one may as well use the full equations with no such limit where that eq 9 and the concept of upstream volume are particularly useful for this work is that they allow the relatively simple and accurate passage between use of variables a and q in the development of the family of approximate routing equations which we are about to do conventional derivations usually involving surface elevation η have to go through difficult and not always clear approximations 2 4 the small diffusion approximation changes in surface slope are relatively small to obtain the types of equation in a single variable widely used for flood routing we make the next approximation that the magnitude of the quantity a x b a which is the derivative of the mean depth with respect to x is small compared with the slope s it can be shown that this means that changes in the slope of the free surface are relatively small compared with the mean surface or stream slope the approximate momentum eq 3 can then be written expanding the square root by the binomial theorem 10 q q r 1 1 bs a x q r 1 1 2 1 bs a x o 1 bs a x 2 and the neglected terms as shown by the big o notation will now be ignored consider this expression for q an approximate momentum equation now used in the term q x in the mass conservation eq 1a the equation governing disturbances becomes with no lateral inflow and neglecting derivatives of b and s 11 a t q x a t d q r d a 1 a x q r 2 bs 2 a x 2 0 an advection diffusion equation we see that the measure of the importance of the pressure or diffusion term in wave propagation is not simply the ratio of the first derivative term a x bs itself relative to 1 the explicit approximation we have made but the size of the second derivative term relative to that of the first derivative term if we had not included the a x bs term we would have no diffusion term at all hence we can think of it as a diffusion contribution and for convenience from now we will refer to approximations such as eq 10 as small diffusion approximations the question arises considering the two approximations that have been made are they connected and so might the satisfaction of one ensure that of the other the answer seems to be that they are not for the very long wave or slow change approximation 1 σ τ small is independent of the magnitude of a change while the small diffusion or small changes in surface slope approximation a x bs small is determined by that magnitude 2 5 small diffusion approximations advection diffusion equations now to obtain the types of equation in a single variable widely used for flood routing we make small diffusion approximations expanding the square roots in equations like 5 or 9 as a power series so that the governing equation appears as a linear combination of derivatives but where the coefficients of all those derivatives are nonlinear functions of the dependent variable throughout this work we will refer to such equations as quasilinear 2 5 1 advection diffusion equation in cross sectional area a considering the fully nonlinear eq 5 the small diffusion approximation is easily made by neglecting the diffusion terms under the square roots and the variation of sb a with x to give 12 a t c a a x ν a 2 a x 2 q i a well known conventional advection diffusion equation form where c a is the wave speed and ν a the diffusion coefficient 13 c a d q r a d a and ν a q r a 2 sb a we have used the non standard notation of showing the functional dependence a as subscripts it makes clearer the subsequent display of more complicated equations traditionally c has been called the kinematic wave speed but in view of the discovery mentioned in section 2 2 that the simplified momentum equation follows not from a neglect of dynamic terms but rather from a requirement that the wave motion have a very long period c is called here the very long wave speed 2 5 2 advection diffusion equation in upstream volume v other than a change in terminology from kinematic to a very long approximation the results in terms of a have contained no real surprises that is not the case if we make approximations considering volume v we re write the momentum eq 9 in terms of v by also making the small diffusion approximation expanding the square root as a power series and now neglecting lateral inflow to give 14 v t q r v x ν v x 2 v x 2 0 where the functional dependence of the diffusion coefficient ν v x is given by eq 13 if we write the second term as q r v x u r v x v x where u r v x is the mean fluid velocity remembering that v x is the area the equation becomes the advection diffusion equation 15 v t u r v x v x ν v x 2 v x 2 0 this reveals something interesting about the nature of the equations the advection velocity with which fluid volume is transported is the mean fluid velocity u r as we would expect physically however when in eq 12 we considered the area a which we have seen is the derivative of v with respect to x it was advected at a different velocity the very long wave speed c given by eq 13 this is also the speed at which a disturbance in surface elevation propagates it is interesting that this the most visible measurable and potentially dangerous quantity in a flood travels ahead of the substance of the flood the fluid volume todini 2007 went to some trouble to reconcile this ambiguity in developing his muskingum method to be described briefly below 2 5 3 advection diffusion equation in discharge q the two advection diffusion equations in a and v have been obtained relatively easily in particular the use of the single variable v which can be used to express both a and q eqs 7 8 has been very helpful now for completeness we consider obtaining a single equation in terms of discharge q and operations are rather more difficult differentiating eq 14 with respect to time t using the chain rule for differentiation and recognising that q r a c a 16 2 v t 2 c v x 2 v x t t ν v x 2 v x 2 0 derivatives of v can be eliminated using v t q and v x a eqs 7 and 8 17 q t c a q x ν a t a x ν a 2 q x 2 0 the area a still occurs in four places unlike the elimination of q above which was quite simple the obtaining of a in terms of q to eliminate it from the equation is a surprisingly long and complicated procedure and to do it we would have to follow a process such as that performed by price 1985 requiring several small diffusion approximations here we will go no further down that path we have already obtained a fully nonlinear advection diffusion eq 9 and a model quasilinear advection diffusion eq 14 or 15 both in terms of v which enables input of hydrographs and output of results in terms of discharge q it is simple however to obtain a linear advection diffusion equation in q by assuming that q and a deviate so little from values q 0 and a 0 of a steady uniform flow that the coefficients c a c 0 and ν a ν 0 are both constant given by uniform flow values so that eq 17 becomes 18a q t c 0 q x ν 0 2 q x 2 0 18b where c 0 d q r d a 0 and ν 0 q 0 2 sb 0 it is widely believed that this conventional advection diffusion equation is a good simple model of flood wave propagation to quote koussis 2009 p44 the linear ad vection diffusion equation is the simplest physically grounded flood routing model that adequately reproduces wave translation and attenuation and is important because its range of validity is wide while that statement is true it is worth summarising the situation more completely in view of the above in the approximate methods we are considering there is a fundamental limitation to waves that are very long and the well known advection diffusion routing equations are based on a small diffusion approximation giving quasilinear equations for both a and v with different advection velocities we have presented only a linear advection diffusion equation for discharge q there is nothing in that to contradict koussis statement however determinations of the range of validity have not been definitive and it may not be as wide as implied as will be seen below 2 6 small diffusion approximations muskingum equations it will be found that all equations in this section contain advective terms plus a diffusive term with combined x and t derivatives such that numerical approximation can be made by considering a computational rectangle in x t space such equations can be called quasi advection diffusion equations for simplicity here they will often be referred to as muskingum equations whereas finite difference expressions based on them will be called muskingum formulae 2 6 1 cunge 1969 cunge recognised that a simple advection equation is the first approximation to the long wave equations but that the actual physical diffusion could be mimicked by numerical diffusion using a four point box finite difference approximation to the equation which gave a muskingum formula consider the linear advection equation obtained by neglecting the diffusion term in eq 18a 19 q t c 0 q x 0 diffusion was introduced numerically also using four point finite difference approximations on a computational rectangle of dimensions δ x δ t in x t space this gave a muskingum scheme in the form 20a c 0 0 q i j c 1 0 q i 1 j c 0 1 q i j 1 c 1 1 q i 1 j 1 0 where 20b c 0 1 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν 0 c 0 c 1 1 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν 0 c 0 c 0 0 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν c 0 c 1 0 δ x c 0 δ t 2 ν 0 c 0 where ν 0 is the linearised diffusion coefficient given by eq 18b the procedure described however gives a misleading picture and interpretation although it is not incorrect the consistency analysis that was performed to obtain the formulae used series operations in δ x and δ t to obtain an optimum value of a numerical interpolation parameter so as to match the physical diffusion the formula for that parameter contained δ x in the denominator which when used actually invalidates the results of the previous series operations however we can still determine what differential equation is actually being solved using this approach by performing a consistency analysis on the result we substitute the taylor series 21 q i i j j q i j i δ x q x i j j δ t q t i j 1 2 i δ x x j δ t t 2 q i j for i 0 and 1 and j 0 and 1 into eqs 20 corresponding to the four corners of the computational rectangle and perform series operations in δ x and δ t we find that the differential equation that muskingum cunge routing actually solves as do all muskingum methods when the equations are linearised is the linear muskingum equation 22 q t c 0 q x ν 0 c 0 2 q x t o δ x δ t the appearance of the mixed second derivative instead of a second derivative in x as in the advection diffusion eq 18a is hardly a surprise given the computational module of four points making a rectangle in x t space not enough to evaluate a second space derivative conventionally confronted with the muskingum equation people have justified its applicability by using the small diffusion approximation of neglecting the diffusion term to give t c 0 x and substituting into the mixed derivative in eq 22 to give a second derivative in x so that the equation approximates the advection diffusion one believed to be more valid although the process has been poorly quantified that is hardly necessary however for in the work of price we are about to describe briefly it was shown that a similar quasilinear muskingum equation for q is just as valid as advection diffusion equations 2 6 2 price 1985 price considered the long wave equations with a systematic repeated application of small diffusion approximations to eliminate a and to obtain a single quasilinear equation in discharge q the area and functions of it are deeply embedded in the equations and rather more effort was necessary to eliminate them than in the use of a and v above with the elimination of q the final result is what we call price s equation 23a q t c q x c t a c 2 q x cq i c t q 2 gas q i 23b where a q 2 bs 1 b ga c 2 β 2 c q a q 2 a 2 and where if β 1 part of the last term can be factorised as c q a 2 when the result is the same as eq 24 of price 1985 all quantities are functions of discharge q sometimes from quantities which are functions of area a that area here being obtained from the inverse formulation of the rating curve a q r 1 q price s symbol a has been used for the product of the diffusion coefficient ν q 2 bs and a term containing quantities which are proportional to the square of the froude number eq 23a is a quasilinear quasi advection diffusion equation with nonlinear coefficients and a mixed double differentiation first in x and then in t which can be numerically approximated by considering a computational rectangle in x t space the resulting finite difference expressions presented by price as his eqs 56 60 were recognised by him to be the same albeit nonlinear as those of earlier muskingum formulae 2 6 3 todini 2007 todini resolved ambiguities in propagation of total volume and of wave motion presenting a muskingum scheme in his eqs 46 53 later noting the typographical corrections to be made that in eq 52 in the notation of that work in the definition of c 1 that terms c t and d t in the numerator should actually be c t δ t and d t δ t respectively 2 6 4 price 2009 in this later work price rewrote the form of the time derivative contribution to the muskingum formulae his eqs 9 and 10 while mathematically equivalent to the original eqs 56 61 of price 1985 when approximated numerically with finite δ x and δ t the formulae are different from his original he noted that todini s formulation was essentially the same as his but that it did not include inertial terms or allowance for lateral inflow 2 6 5 perumal and price 2013 perumal and price 2013 presented another scheme their eqs 23 26 with different formulae for the coefficients 2 7 consistency analysis of the muskingum methods here we generalise the results of the quasilinear methods produced after cunge that have been mentioned price 1985 todini 2007 price 2009 perumal and price 2013 the equations have not been reproduced here as they are sometimes quite complicated each is in the form of a nonlinear muskingum formula which we write here symbolically in the same form as eq 20 for no lateral inflow 24 c 0 0 q i j c 1 0 q i 1 j c 0 1 q i j 1 c 1 1 q i 1 j 1 0 explicitly relating the values of discharge at the four corners of a computational rectangle but where the coefficients c 0 0 etc are nonlinear functions of the quantities ν q 2 sb possibly modified by inertial terms plus c d q d a and u q a at each point and sometimes combinations of such quantities all are functions of discharge that and area being related by the inverse of the rating curve or steady uniform flow formula a q r 1 q so that written mathematically we can compute the functional relationships b q u q c q and ν q in the different c coefficients the unknown q i 1 j 1 appears in several places quite implicitly and nonlinearly however its dominant occurrence is that explicitly shown multiplied by c 1 1 in eq 24 so for implementation of the schemes one can solve for it at each step by simple iteration as in each of the four cases the expression 24 is a nonlinear one to perform a consistency analysis to see to what differential equation the finite difference expressions correspond it is first necessary to linearise about a steady uniform flow q 0 we write 25 q i i j j q 0 ψ i i j j for i 0 1 and j 0 1 where ψ is the departure of discharge from the steady uniform value and is a small quantity now it is necessary to linearise all the functions used by writing them as taylor series for area a 26 a i i j j a 0 da dq 0 ψ i i j j o 2 where da dq 0 1 c 0 but for the other quantities only the lowest order expressions c q c 0 b q b 0 and ν q ν 0 are necessary substituting and performing the lengthy series operations using mathematical manipulation software neglecting all terms in 2 and higher at zeroeth order 0 the equations are satisfied identically at order the linearised equation was obtained in each of the four cases 27 c 0 0 ψ i j c 1 0 ψ i 1 j c 0 1 ψ i j 1 c 1 1 ψ i 1 j 1 0 where in three cases price 1985 todini 2007 price 2009 the coefficients c 0 0 etc were exactly the same as the equations from cunge s linear approach eqs 20 the subsequent consistency analysis as was done for that case showed that all three schemes do solve the linear muskingum eq 22 with an advection term plus a mixed derivative term with a coefficient ν 0 c 0 however using the formulae of perumal and price 2013 it was found instead that that coefficient appeared as ν 0 u 0 where u 0 is the mean flow velocity what this means is that when that muskingum equation is transformed by the small diffusion approximation into the advection diffusion equation the coefficient of diffusion is actually ν 0 c 0 u 0 too great by a factor c 0 u 0 which in the case of wide streams is about 5 3 this problem however did not show up in the computational results reported in the original paper perumal personal communication has suggested that they might have been obtained by assuming that the parameters were constant over a computational reach as the ability of the muskingum formulae to approximate the quasi advection diffusion equation depends on the precise implementation of the weights that useage would be quite enough to hide the incorrect diffusion 2 8 summary table 1 shows the hierarchy of approximations and equations that we have considered 3 accuracy of flood routing methods and quantifying the importance of diffusion a theoretical examination of the long wave equations and both main approximations the advection diffusion and muskingum methods will now be made it is necessary to linearise the equations 3 1 linear equations to linearise the long wave equations we use the upstream volume v introduced in 2 3 to convert the two equations to a single second order partial differential equation in terms of the single variable v here with zero lateral inflow such that q v t and a v x substituting into the mass conservation eq 1a shows that it is satisfied identically the momentum conservation eq 1b becomes 28 2 v t 2 2 β q a 2 v x t β q 2 a 2 ga b a 2 v x 2 gas 1 v t q r a 2 0 where for notational simplicity symbols q and a have been retained in coefficients of derivatives this formulation is not an advance for computational purposes as there are nonlinear occurrences of q and hence v t throughout for theoretical purposes however the equation is quite useful it is now linearised by considering relatively small disturbances about a uniform flow with area a 0 and discharge q 0 we substitute the series 29a v a 0 x q 0 t v a a 0 v x q q 0 v t and 29b q r a q 0 d q r d a 0 v x q 0 c 0 v x where v is a disturbance volume in which is a small quantity performing series operations to order and taking the coefficient of we obtain the linearised momentum equation a telegraph equation with a combination of first and second derivatives 30 σ 0 v t c 0 v x 2 v t 2 2 β u 0 2 v x t β u 0 2 ga 0 b 0 2 v x 2 0 where σ 0 is a resistance parameter which is the linearised value of the derivative of the resistance term in the momentum eq 1b with respect to discharge q 31 σ 0 q gas q 2 q r 2 a 0 2 ga 0 s q 0 2 gs u 0 without going into any detail here eq 30 can easily be used to support our assertion in 2 2 that the unsteady and inertial terms in the momentum equation are not of the order of the froude number squared but o 1 σ 0 τ where τ is wave period we note that the telegraph eq 30 is homogeneous linear in v and all coefficients are constant so that we can differentiate through with respect to t and using q q 0 v t from eq 29a and as q 0 is constant we can write the whole equation in terms of q instead of v introducing the dimensionless independent variables t σ 0 t and x σ 0 x c 0 such that the derivatives are 32 t σ 0 t and x σ 0 c 0 x the telegraph equation can be written in terms of dimensionless independent variables and coefficients 33 q t q x 2 q t 2 2 β α 2 q x t 1 α 2 f 2 1 β f 2 2 q x 2 0 where α c 0 u 0 which is 5 3 for a wide channel while β is slightly greater than 1 to allow for non uniformity of velocity over the cross section and for turbulence and f 2 u 0 2 g a 0 b 0 q 0 2 b 0 ga 0 3 is the square of the froude number as the variation of both parameters α and β is relatively minor it is interesting that the equation contains f 2 as the single important flow parameter the correspondingly transformed linear advection diffusion equation can be obtained similarly from eq 18a or simply extracted from eq 33 34 q t q x

price s eq 23 when linearised and written in the dimensionless variables is similar to that but also contains inertia terms 36 q t q x 1 α 2 f 2 1 f 2 α 2 β 2 α 1 2 q x t 0 3 2 analytical solutions for wave propagation for a solution to the linear equations we consider the propagation of a single wave periodic in time which could be considered to be one term of a fourier series in time describing the input hydrograph written in complex notation the solution for the whole channel is 37 q exp i κ x ω t where i 1 and ω is a real quantity which is the dimensionless radian frequency of the periodic motion it is the nature of the generally complex quantity κ that determines system behaviour in x as eqs 33 36 are homogeneous such that each term is linear in a derivative of q any constant multiplying the right side of eq 37 is arbitrary we have used a value of 1 we write κ κ r i κ i then the assumed solution eq 37 can be written 38 q exp κ i x exp i κ r x ω κ r t showing that the solution is an oscillatory wave propagating down the channel with velocity ω κ r and decaying in amplitude exponentially in x with a decay rate κ i substituting the solution given by eq 37 into the linearised equations the telegraph eq 33 corresponding to the long wave equations the advection diffusion eq 34 and price s muskingum eq 36 performing the differentiations and dividing through by common factors we obtain three polynomial equations where all variation with κ is as κ ω and where the effect of diffusion is isolated to a single parameter also containing the dimensionless frequency that we will call the diffusion frequency number 39 d ω α 2 f 2 the equations are from the long wave equations and linearised telegraph equation 40a 1 κ ω i d 1 β f 2 κ ω 2 α 2 f 2 2 α β f 2 κ ω 0 from the linear advection diffusion equation 40b 1 κ ω i d κ ω 2 0 from price s muskingum equation linearised with inertial terms 40c 1 κ ω i d κ ω 1 f 2 α 2 β 2 α 1 0 the first two equations are quadratic in the quantity κ ω while the third is linear some muskingum formulations do not include the inertial f 2 term shown in it explicit solutions to these equations can simply be written down and will not be shown here the diffusion frequency number d ω α 2 f 2 expresses the importance of diffusion on the propagation of any wave showing that it is greater for higher frequency contributions and slow flow large ω and small f 3 3 expressing the importance of diffusion in practice 3 3 1 diffusion frequency number as time variation is like ω t where t σ 0 t introduced before eq 32 then while t increases by a wave period τ ω t changes by 2 π so that 41 ω σ 0 τ 2 π and as σ 0 2 gs u 0 from eq 31 f 2 u 0 2 g a 0 b 0 and α 2 c 0 2 u 0 2 we obtain from eq 39 42 d 2 π τ ν 0 c 0 2 where ν 0 q 0 2 b 0 s is the linear diffusion coefficient introduced in eq 18b to express this in terms of channel quantities for practical purposes here we make a wide channel approximation and use the gauckler manning flow formula for a wide uniform stream 43 q 0 1 n h 0 5 3 s where q 0 is the discharge per unit width n is the manning resistance coefficient h 0 is flow depth and s is slope this gives from the wide channel versions of eqs 18b 44 c 0 dq dh 0 5 3 h 0 2 3 n s 5 3 q 0 2 5 n 3 5 s 3 10 and ν 0 q 0 2 sb 0 q 0 2 s substituting these into d given by eq 42 we obtain 45 d 9 π 25 n 6 5 q 0 1 5 s 8 5 τ we could use this to estimate the magnitude of d for any wave period τ present in an inflow hydrograph however to calculate an overall value of d for a flood event we choose q 0 q p the peak flood magnitude and a period τ 2 t p which is twice that of the time to rise to the peak t p as that rising limb often resembles half a cosine wave we then have the effective importance of diffusion for the overall flood event 46 d p 9 π 50 n 6 5 q p 1 5 s 8 5 t p usually the actual discharge q itself is known so we require an estimate of the width of the stream at the peak to calculate q p but in many cases width is known approximately enough we see that diffusion increases roughly linearly with resistance like n 6 5 and decreases with time to rise like 1 t p the effect of peak discharge is relatively weak at q p 1 5 however the effect of slope is like s 8 5 which is a very strong result this showing that for small slopes how diffusion is larger muskingum methods have often been reported to have had problems in such cases typically publications concerning muskingum methods have reported results for different values of resistance n and slope s but in most work only single values of peak discharge and t p have been considered apparently without realising that the latter has a finite effect more importantly however might be the effects of higher frequencies present in an inflow hydrograph giving values of d which might be several times or even many times that of the overall value d p which has not previously been considered 3 3 2 dimensionless period an anonymous referee has pointed out to the author that what here has been called the diffusion frequency number d can be related to the dimensionless period τ introduced by ponce et al 1978 eqns 2 5 47 τ u 0 s τ h 0 using the wide channel flow formula 43 with u 0 q 0 h 0 solving for h 0 and substituting we obtain the simple inverse relationship between d and τ 48 d 9 π 25 1 τ 1 τ that the dimensionless period τ is an expression of diffusion is not immediately obvious from its definition eq 47 as it superficially apparently contains no explicit advection diffusion related terms above we went in the reverse direction going to some trouble defining d in terms of advection and diffusion quantities but we have ended up showing that it too can be expressed in terms of the simple channel quantities to quantify the effects of diffusion we prefer to think in terms of dimensionless diffusion rather than dimensionless period its inverse 3 4 results for accuracy of the approximate methods in an earlier discussion the author fenton 2013 compared the accuracy of the muskingum approximation using advection diffusion results as the standard using linear theory only in the preparation of the present work did he realise that linear advection diffusion methods are also based on a small diffusion approximation here we more correctly present linear results for both advection diffusion and muskingum approximations using the long wave equations as the standard fig 1 shows comparisons between numerical solutions of the algebraic eqs 40 for the different theories plotted for several values of froude number between 0 1 and 0 5 using the wide channel value α 5 3 and β 1 part a shows results for the propagation speed in x t co ordinates it is 1 κ r using the notation above so in physical terms it is c 0 κ r α u 0 κ r and from this in fig 1 a we have plotted the dimensionless propagation speed divided by g depth giving α f κ r for small diffusion the results from the telegraph equation considered the standard show that speed is given by the very long wave speed c g depth α f 5 3 f while for large dimensionless diffusion not so long waves generated by fast gate movements for example the speeds tend to other values given by the classical result from long wave theory that ignores resistance this limit is not important for us here it can be seen that both muskingum methods and advection diffusion methods are accurate for small diffusion but there are limiting values of diffusion frequency number beyond which they should not be applied the coarsely spaced dotted lines show the limiting value of d for relative errors of less than 5 as calculated theoretically for small froude number in the following section the advection diffusion methods are accurate over a wider range than the muskingum methods fig 1 b shows results for the diminution in magnitude of the flood wave along the channel there is no fundamental distance scale in a routing problem but one can say that there is a time scale characterising a flood event the time to rise to the peak value so that in the expression exp κ i x a value of x has been used corresponding to the distance travelled by the flood wave during a period equal to the time to rise x t 1 κ r but where ω t π half a wave corresponds to the time to rise so we have plotted values of 49 exp ω κ i t κ r exp π κ i κ r for this quantity more important than wave speed fig 1 b shows that there is a well defined limit in d beyond which muskingum methods should not be applied the advection diffusion methods are accurate for small froude numbers over a wider range but for faster flows the limiting d is about the same as for muskingum 3 5 theoretical calculation of accuracy limits for approximate routing methods ponce et al 1978 obtained limits to applicability of the advection diffusion approximation in fact it is possible to establish such bounds for both advection diffusion and muskingum approaches quite systematically one can obtain power series solutions in d to the governing linearised eqs 40 by expanding the analytical solutions as power series or finding the coefficients in the power series by more direct methods the expressions can become unwieldy for simplicity in this section we use the wide channel value α 5 3 and β 1 from the solution of the linearised advection diffusion eq 40b 50 κ ω 1 i d 2 d 2 o d 3 to be compared with eq 40a from the linearised telegraph equation 51 κ ω 1 i 1 4 9 f 2 d 2 4 9 f 2 16 27 f 4 d 2 o d 3 both show that at zeroeth order the solution κ ω 1 such that κ r ω 1 and κ i 0 corresponding to a uniformly progressing wave now using this example we calculate the relative error in the wave speed by using the advection diffusion method with the result shown above that wave speed is proportional to 1 κ r we obtain using δ the symbol for the magnitude of the relative error 52 δ c ad c telegraph 1 κ r telegraph κ r ad 1 and from eqs 50 and 51 and then performing power series operations 53 δ 1 2 4 9 f 2 16 27 f 4 d 2 1 2 d 2 1 4 9 d 2 f 2 1 4 3 f 2 o d 3 this can be solved to give the criterion for d such that the relative error is less than δ such operations were repeated for the errors in wave magnitude and then for both wave speed and magnitude errors using muskingum methods when it was necessary to use higher order series for presentation here however results to leading order only in both d and froude number f were retained and shown here when the extra inertial terms in price s eq 23b are neglected and the result is the same as the other muskingum theories the results are given in table 2 such that for a relative error of less than δ in wave speed or magnitude d should be limited as shown it is surprising that there is such a variety of powers of δ and f these results are plotted as coarsely spaced dotted lines on fig 1 for a standard error value of δ 0 05 or 5 and it can be seen that in most of the four cases these formula seem to predict quite well where the two approximate theories have begun to deviate by about 5 from the long wave equation case in the case of the results for wave magnitude with the advection diffusion method it is not quite so clear as the accuracy boundary is very close to the result for f 0 1 from the last formula in the table and from the figure we see that the boundary for d is quite a strongly varying function of the froude number f in fact a simple and useful result can be obtained recalling from eq 39 that d ω α 2 f 2 and using the last limitation in table 2 factors of f 2 cancel and we find the simple frequency limitation ω 9 α 2 δ 4 π in our dimensionless co ordinates we obtain ω 2 π σ 0 τ from eq 41 and so for advection diffusion methods we obtain the simple accuracy limitation 54 1 σ 0 τ 9 α 2 δ 8 π 2 δ 3 after so much mathematics it is interesting that we have returned to the very long wave type of condition specified at the very beginning of this work as shown in the approximate momentum eq 3 that neglected terms are o 1 σ 0 τ our detailed calculations here have led to an equivalent surprisingly simple statement to express it in terms of channel and flood quantities we use the definition of σ 0 2 gs u 0 from eq 31 and for completeness we use the gauckler manning formula for flow resistance for uniform flow in a wide rectangular channel of discharge q 0 per unit width giving the criterion of eq 55a below for muskingum methods the slightly more demanding of the two criteria for δ 0 05 is that for the flood magnitude we use eq 45 for d to give the criterion for the use of muskingum methods eq 55b below the limitations on the use of the two approximate flood routing theories to limit the relative error in flood magnitude to less than δ are advection diffusion 55a 1 σ 0 τ u 0 2 gs τ q 0 2 5 2 gs 7 10 n 3 5 τ δ 3 muskingum 55b d 9 π 25 q 0 1 5 n 6 5 s 8 5 τ δ 3 π 1 3 the results have been presented in terms of the main physical characteristics of the channel and flood event with wave period τ in the denominators showing that they are also very long wave limits strangely the manning coefficient n has a different effect in the two cases again we see that in the muskingum case the slope s appears in the denominator with a large exponent of 8 5 leading to problems with muskingum methods for small slopes also and what has not been emphasised in the muskingum literature the wave period plays a role the limitations in eqs 55 are for the period τ of any wave in the input hydrograph if the overall flood wave is fast rising it will be more difficult to satisfy the inequalities accuracy will be diminished if there are fluctuations and hence short period waves present in all the above we obtained results for a single periodic wave of period τ and frequency ω 2 π τ in the case of the overall hydrograph we chose a period τ 2 t p which was twice that of the time to rise to the peak t p as that rising limb often resembles half a cosine wave we then had the effective importance of diffusion for such a smoothly varying flood event if one had an inflow hydrograph which was close to such an ideal one could calculate the importance of diffusion and if it were sufficiently small one could use advection diffusion or muskingum routing as they are both based on a small diffusion approximation however in the case of a general hydrograph input which could be represented by a fourier series in time with a number of frequencies present such that ω j j 2 π σ 0 t where t is the total length of hydrograph and 1 σ 0 t is the fundamental dimensionless frequency and j 1 2 is an integer which can be large then the effective diffusion of the higher frequency components becomes much larger and the application of low diffusion approximations such as advection diffusion and muskingum becomes questionable for general inflow hydrographs thereby throwing doubt on their utility as flood routing tools 4 flood routing methods 4 1 numerical solution of the long wave equations in view of the finite range of validity of advection diffusion and muskingum methods for flood routing especially for fast rising floods and for inflow hydrographs with fluctuations it is necessary to have available a method that has no such limitations the long wave equation formulation for flood routing problems indeed has no essential accuracy limitations other than the modelling limitations as set out in 2 especially for flood routing where detailed knowledge of the stream geometry may not be available the form of the equations in eq 1 is particularly suitable based on use of the discharge q and cross sectional area a as they allow the specification of stream geometry in a quite approximate sense the parameters necessary are possibly the rating curve relationship q r a which can be calculated from rating data fenton 2018a and if that is not known it can be calculated from eq 2 using a resistance coefficient like manning s n plus stream surface width b a and wetted perimeter p a however in many streams neither p nor b vary much and simple approximate values could be used this compares with the approximate flood routing methods which require the computation of c d q r d a non trivial for some river cross sections the long wave equations can be solved by an explicit forward time quadratic space ftqs scheme which is the simplest and most obvious method the use of the term quadratic space pertains to the use of quadratic variation with three point finite difference formulae for derivatives at the left middle or right end of the computational module see appendix a such an explicit scheme has hardly been used because liggett and cunge 1975 p111 mistakenly declared it unconditionally unstable and named it the unstable scheme this may have contributed to both the extensive use of complicated implicit methods for the long wave equations and to the proliferation of muskingum methods fenton 2014 section 6 found that the ftqs scheme was not unconditionally unstable and presented stability criteria and a figure showing that over a wide range of bed slopes and froude numbers the time step had limiting values in the range of 10 s to 300 s while that is very much smaller than the values allowed by muskingum methods or implicit long wave equation solvers in practice it seems not to be a problem as the scheme is simple and explicit as shown below computational costs seem to be roughly the same as for muskingum methods the author s suggestion is not to bother computing the stability limits from the theory but choosing a time step of say 30 s and if a computation does go unstable halve the time step and if necessary repeat the details of the computational scheme using discharge q and area a as dependent variables are set out in appendix a the common downstream condition for simple routing purposes is described where the computational domain is truncated at an arbitrary point in the stream and no computations are performed beyond that point often in simulations using the long wave equations an assumption is made that the stage there is given by normal depth as if uniform flow conditions existed beyond that point this is not quite correct and introduces finite errors diffusing upstream we advocate simply treating the downstream point as part of the stream which of course it is and computing the x derivatives using backwards differences the method has been found to work well as shown in fenton 2014 section 7 and fenton 2018b section 3 6 further evidence for the accuracy of the method is provided in a hidden manner in fig 2 explained in the accompanying description there this open boundary condition is similar to that of muskingum methods where also all information is assumed to come from upstream for more general boundary conditions a number of different cases are given in fenton 2018b section 3 6 in general applications as q is a dependent variable the discharge hydrograph q x i t at any point i is obtained as part of the computations which is sometimes enough for flood routing purposes however if one were given a stage hydrograph as input or needed one at any other point as output it would be necessary to know cross sectional details there to go between values of a and stage 4 2 numerical solution of the slow change routing equation eq 9 is a single equation in a single unknown the upstream volume v which may be more useful for theoretical or conceptual considerations such as in 2 than in routing applications the method uses the same stream information as the long wave equations and similarly simple assumptions can be made for the geometrical quantities of surface width b and wetted perimeter p ftqs approximation can be used including for evaluating the second derivative the details will not be presented here more sophisticated methods have been presented by barlow et al 2006 and by soroush et al 2013 even though this method works well and accurately over a wide range as will be seen there are finite limits to its accuracy for waves that are too short or variation too rapid the equation is of advection diffusion type and there are finite stability limits on the time step which are slightly more demanding than those for the ftqs solution of the long wave equations nevertheless it is a possibly useful alternative in a single variable in general the long wave equations themselves are to be preferred for flood routing purposes 4 3 small diffusion methods above a number of approximate equations have been presented found to have finite accuracy criteria below we will examine the performance of some of them including the quasilinear advection diffusion eq 14 and the four point muskingum formulae considered in 2 6 5 examples results from the various methods were calculated for a sequence of five different problems in the transition range of diffusion frequency number d where it went from sufficiently small for application of muskingum methods to large computational parameters are given in table 3 and the results shown in fig 2 the basis for comparison was provided by numerical solutions of the long wave equations the performances of the slow change routing equation quasilinear advection diffusion equation and various muskingum methods were tested as well as the proposed open downstream boundary condition the effects of channel cross section were ignored by considering an infinitely wide rectangular channel in the first rows of the table are given values of the two parameters measuring the applicability of a theory d p and σ 0 τ given by the peak discharge and τ given by twice the time to rise of the peak plus the limiting values of those parameters for the two approximate theories given in eq 55 two inflow hydrographs were used 1 a function mimicking an idealised hydrograph with a smooth relatively rapid rise but slower fall 56 q x 0 t q min q p q min t t p e 1 t t p 5 where q p and t p are the peak values of discharge

boussinesq coefficient used in the momentum equation was β 1 05 of interest are the computational steps used and the actual computer times shown in the table the muskingum methods were applied with customary large time steps of 900 or 1800 s whereas to ensure stability both explicit ftqs methods used a constant step of only 30 s which is derisorily small compared with those allowed by muskingum methods or implicit computational methods we did not experiment with changing the time step with that small value satisfactory results were obtained and the computational time as shown was roughly the same as for the muskingum methods we concluded that the finite stability criteria of the ftqs methods was not a problem the results in fig 2 show that the dependence of the accuracy of the muskingum methods on diffusion is much as predicted by the theoretical results shown in fig 1 the numerical values of the diffusion frequency number d p being shown in the first rows of table 3 it is interesting that results from three of the muskingum methods agreed very closely those of price 1985 todini 2007 and price 2009 this is somewhat surprising as the two price papers use different muskingum formulae price in the 2009 paper did note theoretical agreement between that and the todini formulae but that the latter contained no inertial unsteady terms which price 1985 went to some trouble to include unnecessarily it seems for these problems as suggested by the discovery reported in section 2 2 that the fundamental approximation is not a kinematic one but a slow variation one the fully nonlinear slow change routing equation is found to be quite accurate over the whole range tested and the quasilinear advection diffusion equation found to be more accurate than the linear analysis suggested only the muskingum methods performed poorly for larger diffusion cases a small diffusion d p 0 11 the diffusion is small enough that we expect muskingum results to be satisfactory and indeed the results from three of the muskingum methods reproduce the behaviour as modelled by the long wave equations very well indeed the extra diffusion by a factor of c 0 u 0 5 3 in the method of perumal and price 2013 noted in 2 7 seems to be borne out by the computations in this example the resistance is small with n 0 015 contributing to the smallness of d p but the counteracting all important bed slope is also quite small at s 0 0002 so that there would be many examples in practice of rather steeper rivers where d p would be smaller and muskingum results would be just as satisfactory results from the slow change routing eq 9 and the quasilinear advection diffusion equation agree closely with those from the long wave equations b slightly larger d p 0 29 errors using muskingum methods are beginning to be apparent and greater than 5 as we expect from the theoretical limit of d 0 22 c compound hydrograph d p 0 72 and secondary fluctuations with d 1 0 this shows the effects of increasing diffusion and those of higher frequency components a cosine wave with two fourier components as given by eq 57 was used giving two inflow maxima of 10 m 2 s 1 and an interim minimum of 8 m 2 s 1 the effective d of the secondary wave computed using the magnitude of the discharge fluctuation and of course with twice the frequency of the main flood was d 1 0 larger than that of the primary and the errors of the muskingum methods are now larger the advection diffusion methods are still quite accurate when such a secondary oscillation with twice the frequency of the fundamental was used as input in the low diffusion cases of a and b above there was no such deterioration in accuracy as even the d of the secondary oscillation was small enough in general however we expect there to be input signals showing rather higher frequencies than the simple ones used here and the effects on the small diffusion approximation methods especially muskingum to be strong d finite diffusion d p 1 4 now diffusion is sufficiently important that even for an input approximating a single wave the muskingum methods are not accurate enough the parameter values n 0 05 s 0 0001 t p 12 h are quite possible in routing problems results from the slow change routing eq 9 are generally quite accurate but now show some disagreement where change is not slow e large diffusion d p 8 6 with the same channel as d but a faster rising flood the strongly diffusive effects of shorter waves are clear no muskingum results have been shown the slow change routing eq 9 is still quite accurate surprisingly the quasilinear advection diffusion equation has not lost as much accuracy as linear theory would suggest for such a value of d this is in accordance with the findings of zoppou and o neill 1982 all figs 2 a e contain hidden extra results that in each two curves have been plotted for the long wave eqs 1 both visually coincident one was plotted from results at the end point of the computations in the stream the other was from the same point but taken from a computation that extended further for a total length of twice the first the coincidence of the results shows the satisfying performance of the method for treating the downstream point as an open boundary described in appendix a conventional use of an assumed uniform flow rating curve here gave finite errors 6 conclusions in the introduction the general structure of the paper was summarised here specific results are itemised the families of approximate flood routing methods muskingum and advection diffusion are based on two approximations one that waves have a very long period slow change the other that variations in the surface slope are relatively small this means that the apparent diffusion should be small the magnitude of that diffusion in any problem has been made explicit by a dimensionless diffusion frequency number from this criteria for practical use of the approximate methods are obtained which reveal when they have difficulties for large diffusion the effect of slope s on diffusion is strong with the effective diffusion varying like s 8 5 showing why streams of small slope have always caused problems for muskingum methods the effect on diffusion of the wave period τ of a component of the inflow hydrograph is like 1 τ such that also for faster rising flood waves diffusion is more important and the accuracy of muskingum and advection diffusion methods is degraded even if an overall inflow hydrograph were sufficiently slowly varying for the approximate theory to apply any fluctuations in it would cause shorter period waves to be present as harmonics whose accuracy of simulation might be quite poor all muskingum methods actually solve a quasi advection diffusion equation with a mixed second derivative term which is obvious from the four point computational module used price 1985 showed that this is a consistent small diffusion approximation to the problem expressing the equations in terms of discharge four muskingum formulations have been tested for consistency with the governing equation one has been found to have an incorrect diffusion coefficient in many practical problems both advection diffusion and muskingum methods are accurate enough with advection diffusion being more accurate however in view of the approximate methods not being accurate for all conditions it is desirable to have a simple flood routing method without any essential important restrictions such a method is available using the long wave equations themselves expressed in terms of discharge and cross sectional area surprisingly the equations can be solved approximately with relatively few geometric details paradoxically even fewer than the common approximate flood routing methods the presentation of the long wave equations has contained a novelty expressing the resistance in the equations in terms of a more hydrologically oriented quantity the discharge as a function of area obtained from a rating curve in rivers this is often what is known at one or more stations rather than values of resistance coefficients a simple explicit numerical scheme can be used using finite differences forward in time and quadratic in space time steps much smaller than those of muskingum methods must be used but the simplicity of the method means that any common flood routing problem can be solved quickly and accurately which is not guaranteed for the approximate routing methods declaration of interests none appendix a computational scheme for solving the long wave equations the following details are enough for typical simple flood routing problems the scheme is set out in greater detail in fenton 2018b section 3 6 which includes a number of different input and boundary conditions and the possible use of irregularly spaced computational points consider the forward difference approximation for the time derivative at a computational point x i t j a 1 f t i j f x i t j δ t f x i t j δ t and the quadratic approximations for the spatial derivatives at three equally spaced points in terms of the function values at those points are a 2a f x 0 3 f 0 4 f 1 f 2 2 δ x a 2b f x i f i 1 f i 1 2 δ x for i 1 2 n 1 a 2c f x n f n 2 4 f n 1 3 f n 2 δ x usually one just considers the centred approximation a 2b but here we are going to present expressions for boundary conditions which make use of the other two as well initial conditions the simplest method of obtaining initial conditions over a variable computational reach is to assume an approximate solution with constant discharge and something like linear free surface variation and compute until all waves generated by that incorrect solution have left the system and then use the results as the real initial conditions at every time level t perform the following operations to calculate the solution at the next time level t δ t upstream point i 0 where information is usually given as a function of time if the inflow hydrograph q x 0 t is known one can easily calculate q x 0 t δ t to calculate a x 0 t δ t one uses the mass conservation eq 1 with a t approximated by eq a 1 and q x obtained from eq a 2a using the values of q x i t at i 0 1 and 2 otherwise if the stage hydrograph is known giving a x 0 t one calculates a x 0 t δ t then for q x 0 t δ t one uses the momentum conservation eq 1b with q x and a x calculated from eq a 2a in terms of q x i t values and a x i t values respectively at points i 0 1 and 2 interior points i 1 n 1 evaluate q x and a x using the centre difference expression a 2b with f q and f a and use them in both eqs 1 where the time derivatives are given by the forward difference expression a 1 downstream point n the procedure depends on what the downstream boundary is a number of different conditions are given in fenton 2018b section 3 6 here we consider only an open boundary condition where the computational domain is truncated mid stream instead of applying an artificial boundary condition there the equations can be solved using backwards differences for the spatial derivatives in this case one uses both derivatives q x and a x computed from the backwards expression a 2c in terms of values at n 2 n 1 and n itself and then using both eqs 1 where the time derivatives are given by the forward difference expression a 1 
6706,among the reference evapotranspiration eto equations temperature based and radiation based equations have been accepted as promising approaches when the available meteorological data are limited the present paper aimed at assessing this general implication in island environments which might be generally volatile than the interior coastal zones using data from five island locations of iran daily eto values were calculated by the benchmark fao penman monteith fao56 pm model then the commonly used temperature radiation and mass transfer based eto equations were evaluated against the benchmark values an additional heuristic modeling of eto was also performed through employing gene expressions programming gep evaluated by k fold testing the obtained outcomes showed that the calibrated mass transfer based equations and their corresponded gep models generally surpassed the other applied models in the studied locations this criticized the commonly accepted implication about applying temperature radiation based models in case of data scarcity for different locations nevertheless analysis of the temporal variations of models performance among test years showed that fixing the minimum test size as 1 year for local k fold testing that is the case in similar studies might be misleading as it could not show the fluctuations in modeling accuracy well a minimum affordable size of at least one growing season was instead selected tested and recommended in the current research keywords evapotranspiration gene expression programming island pca analysis 1 introduction the reference evapotranspiration eto is defined as the evapotranspiration amount from a hypothesized reference crop grass with a height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 eto is a major attribute for calculating crop actual water requirements analyzing water budget in watersheds environmental assessment of catchments studying the hydrological processes and planning for making optimal management decisions on water exploitations especially in arid and semi arid regions nourani and sayyah fard 2012 the dominant climatic variables affecting eto are air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed several attempts have been conducted so far to relate eto to these variables worldwide leading to numerous empirical or physics based equations generally those equations might be categorized into temperature based radiation based mass transfer based and combination groups in relation to the utilized meteorological variables for calculating eto the latter group is based on combining the energy balance and mass transfer components to obtain eto values thus they might give reliable outcomes in a wide range of climatologic conditions the penman monteith model adopted by the united nations food and agriculture organization that will be referred to as fao56 pm model in the present paper as one of the physics based combination models unite both the physiologic and aerodynamic parameters and has been accepted as the standard method of eto calculation when the in situ measurements of this factor are not available allen et al 1998 albeit it needs lots of meteorological records that cannot be easily gathered in some locations consequently employing other empirical equations that utilize limited weather variables for determining eto would be crucial in case of data scarcity however those equations should be calibrated and adjusted against lysimetric data or standard fao56 pm model at various locations with different climatic contexts meanwhile the heuristic data driven models have been considered as a proxy for simulating eto in different climatic and data availability conditions nevertheless only a brief survey in the existing literature showed that the accuracies of those equations models might be site specific xu and singh 2002 compared various temperature radiation mass transfer based equations for estimating eto in switzerland and found the radiation based models as the best estimators of the eto values obtained by the standard fao56 pm model irmak et al 2003 carried out a comprehensive comparison among different eto equations in a humid climate of florida and showed that the combination equations gave the most accurate simulations followed by the radiation based and temperature based equations using data from a semi arid environment of iran dehghanisanij et al 2004 have confirmed the acceptable performance of the temperature based eto equations nandagiri and kovoor 2006 evaluated the performances of seven eto equations under different climatic conditions of india for both daily and monthly time scales the assessment outcomes revealed that the temperature based hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 might be considered as the best alternative to the standard fao56 pm model in different climatic contexts except humid locations where the radiation humidity based equations would be preferable jabloun and sahli 2008 evaluated the temperature based hs equation in tunisia and observed higher deviations between the eto values produced by this equation and those of the standard fao56 pm model in both coastal and interior stations sabziparvar and tabari 2010 performed a comparison between the temperature and radiation based equations under arid and semiarid conditions of iran which showed the superiority of temperature based equations in such regions xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 made an appraisal of 13 temperature and radiation based equations at the island of crete in greece with semi arid climate the results revealed that the performances of the radiation based equations were much better than those of the temperature based ones rahimikhoob et al 2012 evaluated different temperature radiation based equations under a subtropical condition in iran the outcomes of the comparison showed that both the employed categories presented acceptable performance accuracy in the studied regions tabari et al 2013 compared 31 eto models including temperature radiation and mass transfer based equations in a humid region of iran and found that the radiation based equations gave the best results followed by the temperature based models while the mass transfer based equations presented the highest underestimations and error magnitudes liu et al 2017 compared 16 eto equations against lysimetric data and stated that the combination based equations presented the best results followed by the radiation based and temperature based equations paredes et al 2018 applied temperature based hs equation under humid conditions of azores islands north atlantic ocean and disclosed the proper capability of this equation for eto estimation in such regions it is seen that there are only limited studies that tackled eto simulation in island environments on the other hand the heuristic models with various input variables have been employed to simulate eto among different heuristic methods gene expression programming gep technique has found wide applications for modeling diverse hydrologic parameters including eto a complete review of the studies around gep applications in hydrology is beyond the scope of the present paper thus a few relevant studies will be discussed here guven et al 2008 employed gep in simulating daily eto values using data from usa and found that the models that have been relied on all necessary meteorological variables e g temperature radiation humidity and wind speed gave the best performance among others yassin et al 2016 applied gep and artificial neural networks techniques for estimating daily eto values in arid locations and found that the best performance accuracies were corresponded to the input combination that included all necessary meteorological inputs followed by the temperature humidity wind speed based configuration mattar 2018 performed monthly eto simulation in egypt by employing gep among the evaluated input configurations the model with the air temperature humidity and wind speed inputs gave the best accuracy the present research aimed at assessing the general implications of applying commonly used eto models through evaluating the empirical equations in island environments the first implication as can be seen from the literature is the superiority of temperature and radiation based models over the mass transfer based models in interior and coastal regions so the capabilities of mass transfer based models in simulating eto of island environments where the surrounding vast amount of water bodies might remarkably affect the meteorological parameters of such locations was investigated second by applying gep as a robust heuristic model relied on similar input variables of empirical equations the minimum affordable test sizes for temporal data scanning procedures that is assumed to be annual period in most of the studies were investigated and criticized to the best of the author s knowledge the current paper is the first time presentation of such assessments for island regions in literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 data analysis daily meteorological variables of 5 island weather stations of iran operated by the i r of iran meteorological organization irimo covering a period of 11 years 1st january 2007 31st december 2017 were utilized in this research fig 1 the climatic variables included the records of maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity all studied locations are island environments with the maximum elevation of 30 m a s l for kish and the minimum elevation of 4 4 m a s l for siri stations table1 specifies the general information of the analyzed data and locations based on the values obtained for the aridity index ia all the stations are classified as arid locations analysis of the temporal distribution of the rainfall events in these locations showed that the maximum rainfall in the locations is occurred during the december and january while the hot seasons may september receive almost no rain or a little amount of it wind speed u2 and direction also showed obvious variations among the stations and the months analysis of the wind speed values for the study period and the growing season may september in all the stations showed that the variations of u2 in terms of the coefficient of variation cv are obviously different for the growing seasons and the total study period nonetheless cv values of u2 records were fluctuated among the available years further wind direction had obvious variations from 20 minimum degree of lavan to 340 maximum degree of kish among the stations and the studied years months such variations may affect the humidity relative variables of the island stations the variations of the eto magnitudes during the year however did not show similar adverse trend while the summer months showed the highest eto values there was no fixed trend for its minimum values that might guessed to be happened during the winter season fig 2 illustrates the whisker range plot of the monthly eto values during the study period obvious variations among the months for the studied locations could be detected from fig 2 the maximum eto variations was belonged to lavan november 2 2 mm day and abu musa july 2 10 mm day while the minimum variations was observed in gheshm january 0 66 mm day the highest average relative humidity and rainfall amount values were also corresponded to abu musa and lavan respectively while the highest average total incoming solar radiation has been observed in gheshm as can be seen from table1 variations depicted in fig 2 were not similar among the stations and during the year although the higher variations could be observed in summer season for abu musa and gheshm stations the rest of the locations have had generally higher variations even in the cold season further the eto values have been scattered generally with values lower than the mean eto magnitudes for summer while this could be rarely detected for the winter period this might be anticipated because eto has lower values during the cold month so the values would have a smooth distribution around the mean values in the studied locations finally the variations of the mean eto values within the months were similar for all the sites an additional analysis using multiple sites over time s mode principal component analysis pca was performed to evaluate the regionalization of the studied sites and their meteorological variables a correlation matrix was used by employing pca because it excludes the differences in measurement units between the meteorological variables xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 and allows correlating the locations with the same seasonal patterns of meteorological variables together as discussed by comrie and glenn 1998 using the scree test cattell 1966 two pca factors were selected for both analyses explaining 93 2 and 90 8 of variance for stations and variables analysis respectively fig 3 shows the ordination plot of the meteorological data recorded at the studied sites from the figure it is clearly seen that all the studied sites formed a unique group this might be specifically decisive when using exogenous patterns for modeling eto in a location with missing data although variations domain should be considered when selecting the ancillary stations the available meteorological records were thoroughly screened for any inconsistency and the missing values were estimated and filled using the best methods compared by shiri 2017 a statistical analysis not presented here was also performed by comparing the coefficient of variations cv of the data before and after filling the missing values that showed both of the data sets had similar cv values 2 2 eto formulation table 2 summarizes the mathematical expressions of the applied eto equations following the suggestion of allen et al 1998 the physics based fao56 pm model was used to calculate the benchmark eto values in the present study the temperature based hargreaves samani hs hargreaves and samani 1985 radiation based priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 makkink mk makkink 1957 and turc tu turc 1961 and the mass transfer based dalton dn dalton 1802 trabert tr trabert 1896 and penman pn penman 1948 equations were utilized to calculate the eto values allen et al 1998 recommended the use of hs equation if only air temperature values are available as the unique meteorological records in a region the pt equation is the most widely utilized radiation based eto model in literature that omits the advection aerodynamic component effects in eto phenomenon and represents its effect by the advectivity coefficient constant value of 1 26 the turc equation tu is a special simplification of the makkink mk equation that needs air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity values for calculating eto when tu equation is utilized it would be possible to analyze the integrated consequence of solar radiation and air humidity on eto in relation to the temperature based models finally the equations that utilize the fundamentals of the dalton s law and the principles of eddy motion transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere mass transfer based equations require the air temperature and wind speed values for calculating eto the validity of the application of the latter group has been criticized in different regions especially in arid or hyper arid climatic contexts according to literature e g shiri 2018a 2 3 calibration of eto equations generally the performance accuracy of the empirical semi empirical eto equations might be improved through calibrating those equations taking into consideration the values obtained by the standard fao56 pm model as the target eto values shiri et al 2014a argued that the linear calibration procedure produces better results than the non linear calibration methods hence a linear calibration equation was adopted here for calibrating the applied eto equations as follows 1 e t o target a e t o model b where e t o target is the eto values produced by the standard fao56 pm model e t o model is the eto calculated by any of the utilized temperature radiation and mass transfer based equations and a b are the regression coefficients 2 4 gene expression programming gep genetic programming models i e gep have superiority over the other heuristic approaches as they can provide explicit formulations black and white approach of the rules that govern the studied phenomenon additionally there is no predefined function to be contemplated by gep to create formed functions guven et al 2008 the plan of eto modeling through employing gep starts by selecting the fitness function that was chosen as the root mean squared error rmse based on previous literature e g shiri 2017 then the set of terminals and functions that should create the chromosomes are selected in the present study the terminal set involved meteorological variables whereas the terminal set included the arithmetic operators and some other basic mathematical functions 3 ln x e x x 2 x 3 as suggested by shiri 2017 in the third step the chromosomal architecture length of head 8 number of gene per chromosome 3 was defined according to the suggestions of ferreira 2001 the linking function addition function based on the literature was selected at the fourth step the final step was to choose the genetic operators the parameters used per run are those recommended in literature for these kinds of studies e g shiri 2017 the genexpro program was used for modeling eto in the present study the parsimony pressure was used as penalization tool to reduce the program size for avoiding the over fitting 2 5 research protocol gep technique was applied in the present study along with the commonly used eto equations in order to make a through comparison between the empirical equations and gep models a subject matter expertise was combined with heuristic model and the input selection was carried out based on the necessary meteorological parameters of the applied empirical equations this has been proved to make better assessment and simulations of the target parameters as discussed by deschaine 2014 accordingly the following input configurations were used in the present study 1 gep1 tmax tmin tmean ra temperature based 2 gep2 tmax tmin rs radiation based 3 gep3 tmax tmin rh rs radiation mass transfer based 4 gep4 tmax tmin u2 mass transfer based abbreviations have been defined in table 2 another important step with using empirical and regression based models would be the supply of the used data patterns to the models so that they can handle the data properly and give reliable estimates using nv block fold test approach considering leave nv out cross validation would be a suitable data handling mode for making a through scanning of data and analyses of the outcomes shao 1993 racine 2000 accordingly a special type of this test which will be referred to as k fold test here was adopted to introduce the data to the applied models in both temporal local and regional external scales a local modeling the temporal strategy deals with at station local approach that utilizes chronological records of meteorological variables as well as the eto magnitudes for developing and testing the models consequently a minimum test set was defined as one year according to literature at each location and the models were trained each time with data from 10 years and tested with the remaining one year data given that the data records covers a period of 11 years a total of 220 5 stations 4 input configurations 11 years 1 heuristic models training testing processes were carried out in the local implementation of the gep models lgep models a similar procedure was also conducted for local calibration of the applied empirical equations calibrated using eq 1 so total 385 5 stations 11 years 7 equations calibration testing processes were established in the local calibration of the eto equations b external modeling egep two scenarios were adopted in this case as e1 gep the complete patterns data of one island station were reserved for testing the models each time so the models were trained using data from training stations here complete data from 4 island stations then tested using the complete patterns of the test site as there are five stations in the present study a total of 20 5 stations 4 input configurations 1 heuristic model training testing processes were performed at the external assessment of the gep technique e1 gep similarly total of 35 5 stations 7 equations calibration testing procedures were carried out for evaluating the empirical equations using external calibration strategy e2 gep an additional external gep modeling was performed using exogenous data from two coastal sites that are located in comparable latitudes with the studied island stations the coastal stations were chabahar latitude 25 17 n and jask latitude 25 38 n with total data period of 10 years 2005 2014 for each input configuration data from these coastal stations were pooled together and used for training the gep models the established models were then tested at the studied island locations therefore total 20 training testing procedures 5 stations 4 input configurations were carried out in this scenario it is noted that the selection of the island weather stations was carried out based on the availability of data despite relevant studies have used similar numbers of stations and data periods in such kinds of investigations nonetheless as the robust k fold testing was utilized for assessing the capabilities of the applied techniques the risk of overfitting was minimized because the models were evaluated through a complete data set scanning procedure 2 6 models assessment for assessing the applied models two dimensionless statistical measures namely the index of agreement ioa and the nash sutcliffe index ns along with an error index e g root mean square error rmse were used 2 ioa 1 i 1 n e t io mod e l e t io t arg e t i 1 n e t io mod e l e t o mod e l e t io t arg e t e t o t arg e t 3 ns 1 i 1 n e t io mod e l e t io t arg e t 2 i 1 n e t io t arg e t e t o t arg e t 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n e t io mod e l e t io t arg e t 2 in these equations e t o model and e t o target stand for the estimated and target obtained by fao56 pm model values at the ith time step respectively e t o model and e t o target denote the corresponding mean et values respectively n is number of patterns willmott 1981 introduced the ioa as a dimensionless index for assessing the degree of model simulation error ioa varies between 0 worse simulation and 1 perfect match between the observed and simulated values it might represent the additive and proportional differences in the target and estimated mean and variance magnitudes moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns compares the residual variance with the observed patterns variance the optimal value of ns is 1 representing the perfect fit legates and mccabe 1999 the root mean square error rmse represents the errors in the same units of the studied phenomenon here eto mm day rmse shows the average error values through assigning higher weights to the larger errors noises by using the local k fold assignment these indicators were computed for each test stage here one year or growing season as well as for the total study period in case of the external k fold mode as the complete patterns of test stations were used for assessing the models each time the values were obtained using all available data at each location for the total study period 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of the eto equations table3 gives the summary of the overall performance of the eto equations for the study period mean performance indicators of the five studied locations the mass transfer based dalton dn and the radiation based turc tu models presented the highest rmse values and the lowest ns and ioa values while the radiation based priestley taylor pt equation gave the best eto estimations with the mean values of rmse ns and ioa as 1 373 mm day 0 364 and 0 802 respectively the rest of the applied models presented negative ns values that showed their produced outcomes could not be acceptable the temperature based hs model could not surpass the radiation based models and produced similar results to the mass transfer based penman pn equation among the mass transfer based equations pn showed the lowest mean rmse 2 024 mm day although its ns values were generally negative for all the studied locations the detailed breakdown of the rmse magnitudes in the studied sites as well as the spans of the models over underestimations has been delineated in fig 4 3 1 1 temperature based hs equation rmse per station values presented in fig 4 confirmed the aforementioned statements about the order of the equations performance accuracy in the studied region although the mean eto values in siri are slightly higher than the rest of the locations the highest rmse values that is assumed to be influenced by the range of the variations of the target eto values were not belonged to this station except hs that showed the highest rmse value 2 564 mm day in siri the highest wind speed u2 values both the mean and maximum wind speed values have been recorded in this site this is in agreement with the conclusions obtained by martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 that found the highest error values of hs equation for the stations with the higher wind speed values although this fact cannot be corresponded to the findings of xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 in this regard the reason for the higher rmse values of hs equation in this site might be explained through analyzing the correlation values between the meteorological parameters and equations errors table 4 the correlation analysis confirmed that the hs errors had the highest positive correlation values with u2 0 696 in the studied region such higher positive correlations might explain the underestimations of eto magnitudes by hs equation as can be seen from fig 4 in spite of that the higher eto values and arid climatic condition usually provide underestimated eto values by hs equation droogers and allen 2002 the maximum underestimation of hs equation was observed in siri with the highest u2 records overall hs equation could not provide accurate simulations of fao56 pm eto values in the studied locations as can be seen from the higher rmse and negative ns values as there was no similar study for simulating eto values in similar island regions it might not be possible to compare whether similar reports have been presented in literature in a comprehensive study about hs equation shiri et al 2015 used various calibration scenarios of hs adjustment throughout iran they reported generally lower rmse values for hs than those obtained here for bandar e lengeh coastal site that is located in comparable geographic position latitude 26 32 n they found rmse of hs equation as 0 540 mm day for a period of nine years with the mean eto value of 4 189 mm day that is significantly lower than those observed for the present locations hence it is seen that the performance of this equation is weak for the island regions alike to the arid semi arid regions that have been already analyzed by shiri et al 2015 this can be attributed to omitting the influence of high advection events of arid and island environments by hs equation berengena and gávilan 2005 xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 nevertheless successful applications of this equation in arid semi arid regions have been also reported in literature e g temesgen et al 2005 so the statements of alexandris et al 2006 about dependency of the hs equation performance accuracy on the local climatic conditions is confirmed here which dictates the necessity of calibrating this model against benchmark eto values e g values calculated by the fao56 pm model 3 1 2 radiation based equations in comparison to the other applied radiation based equations pt equation showed the lowest rmse values in all locations while tu had the highest values of this indicator however the overall performance accuracy of pt was low that might be due to excluding the effect of advection component from eto calculation procedure priestley and taylor 1972 the best estimations of pt have been provided in gheshm rmse 1 159 mm day ns 0 554 while its worst estimations were corresponded to abu musa rmse 1 273 mm day ns 0 197 among the studied locations the maximum solar radiation and minimum wind speed values have been recorded in gheshm further the lowest solar radiation and the highest relative humidity values have been observed in abu musa on the other hand the errors of pt equation showed the highest positive and negative correlations with the wind speed and relative humidity records respectively table 4 this might explain the best and worst performances of the pt equation in these locations among others gunston and batchelor 1983 also concluded that the pt equation produces better eto simulations for low wind speed conditions analyzing the pt over underestimations in fig 4 b showed that this equation underestimated the eto values in all locations so the advectivity coefficient should be higher than its original value higher than 1 26 for the studied sites similar trends have been also reported by utset et al 2004 for mediterranean conditions and by jury and tanner 1975 for arid and semi arid conditions the maximum underestimations of pt were corresponded to lavan that has the highest average annual precipitation this cannot generally confirm the results offered by xiaoying and erda 2005 that found better results of pt equation for rainy seasons however inter annual analysis of the values obtained for this coefficient not presented here showed that the eto values calculated by pt equation were closer to the target eto magnitudes by comparing the ratios of the eto values produced by benchmark fao56 pm with those obtained by pt for the study period 2007 2017 it was found that the advectivity coefficient α takes values of 1 282 1 281 1 349 1 377 and 1 370 for abu musa gheshm kish lavan and siri respectively the variations of this value did not showed a direct clear relation with the meteorological inputs of the stations although it might be supposed that the range of the vapor pressure as well as solar net radiation have direct influence on this coefficient castellvi et al 2001 the obtained values of this coefficient partially fallen within the suggested range of viswanadham et al 1991 1 2 α 1 3 although they are not in agreement with eaton et al 2001 that have obtained values between 1 51 and 2 32 for this coefficient in deep lake environments which are partially comparable locations to island sites this could be due to the differences between the water bodies used for calculating the eto where the first was open water lake while the latter was calculated for a reference grass land cover finally it should be noted that the analysis made here was based on the total study period that has been based on daily scale data more downscaled analysis focusing on hourly variations of pt coefficient values might provide more insight about its real values in the field scale regarding the makkink mk equation the maximum rmse values were obtained for abu musa 3 529 mm day the highest relative humidity values have been also recorded in this station the errors corresponded to mk equation showed the highest negative and positive correlations with relative humidity and wind speed respectively table 4 this can explain the higher rmse values of this equation in abu musa and the highest underestimation of mk at lavan with the lowest average relative humidity as can be seen from fig 4 b this specific observation cannot corresponded to the results presented by landeras et al 2008 that reported positive and negative correlations of mk errors with humidity and wind speed and overestimation trend of mk for humid locations from fig 4 b it is clearly seen that the highest underestimations have been produced by mk equation in all five locations among the all applied equations therefore the values of mk equation coefficient would be higher than their original value higher than 0 61 although its general value 0 6 0 7 have been proved to produced satisfactory results in humid locations xu and chen 2005 cristea et al 2013 only limited studies have tackled the application of mk equation for arid locations in literature which confirms the weak performance of the mk model in such regions e g shiri et al 2014a but there was no published studies where the mk equation has been evaluated under arid island conditions finally the radiation mass transfer based turc tu equation showed the highest rmse values than the pt and mk equations in all five stations alike to the former equations tu underestimated the eto values with the minimum and maximum underestimations in gheshm with the highest recorded solar radiation values and siri with the lowest recorded precipitation values as the maximum correlations of tu error was obtained with solar radiation in gheshm this might explain the lowest underestimations produced by tu in this location it is relevant to note here that the tu model has been developed for humid regions trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 so as could be expected its performance was weak for the studied arid island locations this outcome confirms the previous reports on application of tu equation in arid and hyper arid sites shiri 2017 3 1 3 mass transfer based equations penman pn gave the lowest rmse in all locations followed by trabert tr and dalton dn weakest performance these equations did not show an obvious trend of accuracy in the studied locations more specifically pn showed the lowest rmse in kish while abu musa with the highest relative humidity was corresponded to the lowest rmse for dn and tr equations it is seen that the overall performance of the mass transfer based equations are weak in all five stations with relatively higher rmse values the errors of dn and tr showed the highest negative correlations with relative humidity that could explain the lowest rmse values of these equations in abu musa these results are in good agreement with the results presented by kiafar et al 2017 that found mass transfer based equations unsuitable for both arid and humid locations of iran however the performance accuracy of pn was comparable to the temperature based hs and radiation based mk equations here while it surpassed them in abu musa from fig 4 b the overestimation trend of dn and tr equations as well as the underestimation behavior of pn in all sites can be easily detected these observations cannot support the conclusions given by shiri 2018a that reported the overestimation trend for these equations in arid locations such differences between the performances of the mass transfer based equations in arid regions might be due to the effect of the location of the studied weather stations island environments that may be subjected to the higher variations in advection phenomenon as well as other humidity based parameters which are effected by wind direction see section 2 1 as discussed by xiaoying and erda 2005 summarizing it is clear that despite some similarities between the present results and those already reported in literature regarding the application of different eto equations categories in arid regions these specific observations criticized the applicability of the utilized equations in arid environments of island locations additional adjustment of these equations would be therefore necessary through calibration of these equations against the standard fao56 pm model to improve the validity of them in those regions therefore as mentioned before different calibration strategies were adopted here based on local and ancillary data supplementation 3 2 calibration of eto equations a brief summary of the performance indicators of the locally calibrated equations calibrated using eq 1 at 95 confidence interval has been presented in table 3 for the total study period the values given in this table are corresponded to a simple data management strategy where the total available data patterns were used for calibrating the equations and then the calibrated versions were tested using the same patterns 2007 2017 from the table it is clearly seen that the maximum standard deviation of iao values is corresponded to temperature based hs followed by the mass transfer based equations while the highest deviation values of rmse are observed for mass transfer based dn and radiation based mk equations regarding the ns indicator the highest deviation values are belonged to dn tr and tu equations this shows clear variations in the magnitudes of the statistical indicators in the studied stations the locally calibrated pt equation lcpt gave the lowest mean rmse 1 043 mm d and the highest mean ns 0 635 values among others while the locally calibrated tu equation lctu presented the highest mean rmse 1 210 mm day and the lowest mean ns 0 509 values comparing with non calibrated versions of these equations it is seen that calibrating the equations has improved the performance of them in all locations per station ns values of the calibrated equations have been illustrated in fig 5 the calibrated hs pt and mk equations presented the highest ns values in gheshm and kish whereas the best performance of the tu dn tr and pn equations were observed in kish and lavan this can be confirmed by analyzing the calibration regression equation parameters table 5 overall it might be stated that although the calibration of eto equations against the standard fao56 pm model can improve their performance the improvement magnitudes would be affected by the local climatic conditions at the studied locations as well as the calibrated equation and its dominant variables nevertheless as stated before these results depict the potential of calibration process for enhancing the eto equations using the same calibration and test data hence as could be foreshadowed performance improvement would be remarkable using this procedure consequently the robust k fold testing was adopted for calibrating the models to make a better deep analysis in this regard see section 2 4 assessing the performance of the equations calibrated using the local k fold testing data management strategy it was found that the performance accuracies of the models were fluctuated during the study period given that the test set was defined as one year here these variations were pictured among the studied years 11 years that showed obvious temporal variations for the statistical indicators magnitudes as an example of such variations the differences between the highest and lowest observed rmse and ns values among the test years were displayed in fig 6 for the studied locations oscillations in rmse values of hs were generally lower than the rest of the applied equations in all sites except kish while the minimum fluctuations of ns magnitudes were corresponded to pt in the studied sites except abu musa the highest variations in rmse and ns values were observed for mass transfer based equations with the exception of such variations in siri where all models showed similar rmse and ns differences this reveals that the performance accuracy of these equations at each location was different among the test years which confirms the necessity of adopting a complete data scanning procedure for monitoring the mentioned variations nonetheless the present statement stresses using the traditional data supply strategy where the same patterns would be used for calibrating and assessing the equations as discussed by marti et al 2011 the overall ns values of the equations calibrated using ancillary data have been presented in fig 5 these values were corresponded to the total study period at each location as stated before the performances of the externally calibrated ec equations are generally comparable to the locally calibrated lc versions of the equations that shows both the procedures could be adopted for simulating the eto values this might be expected because the differences between the calibration and test stations patterns were relevant as can be seen from table 1 further the ns values of the externally calibrated tu dn and tr equations are higher than those of the locally calibrated versions in gheshm on the other hand the ec procedure benefits from using ancillary data where the local patterns would not be necessary for calibrating the equations this is of special importance in the locations with limited scarce necessary meteorological observations for calculating the eto summarizing it might be concluded that calibration of the empirical eto equations against standard fao56 pm model in island locations could generally improve their performance although such improvement would be case sensitive and dependent on the local climatologic characteristics of the studied sites nevertheless improvements of some commonly used equations e g hs in some locations was not significant that cannot confirm the statements presented in previous studies regarding the capability of calibration procedure for enhancing the equations accuracy finally the locally calibrated models suffers from using local data for both calibration and testing phases that would limit the applicability of them in case of the lack of sufficient necessary meteorological data 3 3 evaluation of gep models fig 7 presents the global performance indicators of the applied gep models in both local and external scales at the local scale gep3 and gep4 models presented the best simulations followed by gep2 and gep1 in the external scale the mass transfer based gep4 surpassed the other applied gep models followed by gep2 for gep3 and gep4 models the locally trained models lgep gave better simulations of eto than those of the externally trained models e1 gep e2 gep while such differences were not observed for temperature based gep1 and radiation based gep2 models analysis of the values obtained for the indicators revealed that temperature based models gave weak simulations when compared to the other applied input configurations models relied on temperature and radiation records gave slightly better results than temperature based models including the relative humidity that is a mass transfer parameter shiri 2018b as an additional input variable gep3 improved the modeling accuracy to some extent ns 0 799 720 and 0 682 for lgep3 lgep2 and lgep1 respectively finally the mass transfer based models presented better results than temperature based and radiation based models in both local and external applications fig 8 displays the ns values of the gep models per station for all four input configurations expectedly the lgep models outperformed the e1 gep and e2 gep since they used the patterns of the same locations for training and testing however the performances of egep models were comparable to local models in some cases among the lgeps the models relied on humidity radiation and mass transfer based configurations lgep3 4 presented the highest performance accuracy in all studied locations although the better performance of the lgep3 might be anticipated as benefits from both radiation and mass transfer in term of relative humidity components the performance of the mass transfer based models that utilize limited inputs were better than the radiation based and temperature based models which contradicts the results presented by previous studies conducted in other regions most of the previous inferences have confirmed the weak performances of mass transfer based heuristic models in interior and coastal regions e g kiafar et al 2017 shiri 2018a this partial conclusion might be due to the specific locations of the studied stations in the present study island regions where the humidity relative parameters might be severely affected by wind speed and direction as stated in the previous sections analysis of the models performances among the stations revealed that lgep models gave the best simulations in gheshm while the poorest estimations were corresponded to lavan except for lgep1 where lavan and siri showed similar performances and lgep4 that produced the best outputs in lavan these observations might be explained by taking into consideration the correlations between the models errors and meteorological variables the maximum humidity has been recorded at lavan where it showed a negative correlation with the errors of lgep4 model next according to fig 8 it is seen that the performance accuracy of the egep models are better than the local ones in some cases for instance the temperature based lgep1 gave a ns value of around 0 66 in abu musa while the corresponded values of e1 gep3 and e2 gep3models for the same location were 0 745 and 0 767 respectively similarly e1 gep4 and e2 gep4 produced ns values of 0 716 and 0 690 respectively again this criticizes the use of temperature based models in island locations and confirms the necessity of adopting humidity relative parameters for using as models input variables nonetheless this shows the suitable relevance of the studied stations patters that provide a straightforward mapping between the input target parameters when the models were trained using data from other island locations comparing two external training scenarios of gep models e1 gep and e2 gep in fig 8 it was found that except for the radiation mass transfer based models the first scenario that uses the ancillary data from other island locations for training the gep models seems to be better than the second scenario that uses data from two coastal stations with comparable latitudes as e1 gep2 showed its superiority over the e2 gep2 both utilize temperature and radiation data the weak performance of the e1 gep3 that uses temperature radiation and humidity data in relation to e2 gep3 could be associated to introducing the relative humidity as an additional input variable although all the studied locations presented similar mean rh values differences between the maximum and minimum rh values in the stations are remarkable 73 72 71 5 67 0 and 65 for abu musa gheshm kish lavan and siri respectively this difference might explain the abnormal performance of e1 gep3 when compared to e2 gep3 in these stations again similar to the locally calibrated eto equations the performances of the lgep models were assessed per test year of each station and the differences between the maximum and minimum rmse and ns values within test years were illustrated in fig 5 unlike to the empirical equations lgep models did not show obvious oscillations among the test years maximum rmse and ns differences were corresponded to lgep3 in lavan 0 217 mm day and 0 288 respectively whereas minimum differences were observed for lgep2 in kish 0 015 mm day and 0 006 for rmse and ns differences respectively other models generally showed such low differences in all locations around 0 2 marti et al 2010 2011 argued that assessment of heuristic eto models should be carried out based on k fold testing so that all the available patterns can incorporate in both training and testing phases they showed remarkable variations of performance accuracy between the test years similar statements have been presented by e g shiri et al 2014a and shiri 2018a so this partial conclusion cannot confirm the previously published conclusions that have reported obvious variations of performance indicators among test years in similar studies hence a downscaling breakdown was made and the variations of these indicators were calculated for growing seasons of the study period fig 9 shows the variations of rmse values of lgep models for the growing seasons conspicuous disparities can be discerned among the growing seasons for rmse although the order of the models performance accuracy was same for all the stations lgep3 and lgep4 surpassed lgep2 and lgep1 weakest model some remarkable quantitative differences can be detected among the test years for all locations and input configurations considering such differences two cases are elucidated among others first the maximum oscillations can be observed for lgep1 in all locations while the minimum variations are belonged to lgep3 except for lavan where lgep4 showed the minimum rmse variations second if the performances of the all lgep models are considered for the growing season of test years 2007 and 2014 in abu musa it might be stated that all the models have presented similar comparable results even so if the growing season of test year 2015 was contemplated it would be seen that lgep3 produced the best outcomes followed by lgep4 likewise evaluating the performance of the lgep models in the growing season of test year 2015 in siri it was realized that lgep3 and lgep4 were markedly better than lgep1 and lgep2 such variations might be linked to the relations between the meteorological parameters utilized for training and testing the lgep models fig 10 shows the scatterplots of the observed and simulated eto values produced by gep models in abu musa station as an example despite confirming the mentioned statements about the order of the accuracies of the models the scatterplots clearly show that the higher eto values have been underestimated by all the local and external gep models where the highest underestimations are corresponded temperature based models concluding although the variations of the models performance accuracies could not be distinguished when they were calculated for the test years clear fluctuations of rmse values were detected when they were obtained for growing seasons this cannot confirm the findings of the previous literature e g shiri et al 2015 that have found one year as a suitable test size for assessing gep at local scale although it shows the necessity of adopting k fold testing while it suggests using the downscaled test size less than one year for picturing such variations at least for island regions finally the mathematical expressions of the gep models have been given in table 6 for all applied input configurations these models have been obtained through running the gep models by using complete patterns of the all studied locations for each input configuration 3 4 comparison of gep with empirical equations as discussed in section 3 2 calibrated eto equations presented more accurate results than the original versions of the equations hence the calibrated equations were compared with the corresponding gep models in this part considering the temperature based models all the models exhibited similar accuracy except lgep1 that slightly outperformed the other temperature based models similar statements might be given for radiation based models where lgep2 showed a slight superiority over the other locally externally calibrated models these good performances might be anticipated because these models were feed with the training and testing patterns of a same location the key point would be the acceptable performance of the externally calibrated models empirical equations and gep models that exempts using the local data for calculating eto in case of the paucity of data comparing these two cases it is seen that the inclusion of solar radiation as an additional input variable has improved the models performances so that the external gep2 models surpasses the locally trained gep models and empirical equations the models relied on temperature radiation and humidity data gave remarkably better results than the first two cases alike to the previous cases the gep models gave more accurate results than the empirical equations in both local and external training scales further the e2 gep3 model surpasses the locally calibrated empirical equation turc equation that shows the higher ability of gep in mapping the nonlinear relations between the inputs and targets when exogenous data were supplied for establishing the heuristic models finally the gep models generally presented the best results among the mass transfer based category again the performance of the e1 gep4 and e2 gep4 models were much better than the corresponded empirical equations in all the studied stations it might be finally stated that the externally organized models egep have given better or at least comparable results to the locally calibrated empirical equations assuming that all the necessary weather parameters of eto are not recorded in most of the locations this capability will provide reliable simulations to be used by experts in different practical contexts outlining it was found based on the analyses that temperature based and radiation based empirical and gep models could not give promising outcomes when used to simulate eto in the studied island stations while the models that gained from mass transfer components presented more accurate results this is a specific observation achieved in the present study that contradicts the previous reports e g shiri et al 2014b regarding the optimistic performance of the temperature and radiation based models as well as unsuccessful application of mass transfer based models for even coastal zones that have been partially surrounded by vast amount of water nonetheless overall performance of the evaluated models were lower than those reported in previous studies although they were promising for the optimum models as discussed in the text for interior coastal sites this might be because of sudden changes in weather conditions of island locations when compared to interior costal sites for which similar outcomes have been reported by boland et al 2016 for solar radiation forecast issue however further studies would be necessary to investigate the validity of these conclusions in humid island environments as well as other arid islands with different latitudes 4 conclusions the present study aimed at assessing the general practical implications of employing commonly used eto models in arid island regions the acquired results revealed the following closures about the applied models 1 wind speed can explain most of the variations of eto in island regions 2 temperature based and radiation based empirical and gene expressions programming gep models failed to give reliable eto estimations in arid island environments with large error magnitudes and highest underestimations 3 the gep models based on solar radiation and relative humidity that benefited from both energy and mass transfer components gave the most accurate results 4 unlike to the most of the previously published literature models based on mass transfer inputs temperature wind speed gave promising results as they would need less data than the radiation mass transfer models they might be considered as preferable approaches for simulating eto in island regions 5 externally trained gep models that used data from other island stations for simulating the eto values of the target island locations e1 gep models gave comparable results to the locally trained gep as well as locally calibrated empirical equations this would exempt needing local patterns for obtaining eto at test sites 6 externally trained gep models with data from exogenous coastal sites e2 gep models gave suitable results especially when they were fed with radiation humidity or with air temperature wind speed data 7 fixing the minimum test set of one year in k fold testing could not show the variations of the performance accuracy of gep models among the test years properly breaking the analysis to at least one growing season could show the variations more clearly acknowledgments author would like to thank prof dr ahmad fakheri fard university of tabriz

6706,among the reference evapotranspiration eto equations temperature based and radiation based equations have been accepted as promising approaches when the available meteorological data are limited the present paper aimed at assessing this general implication in island environments which might be generally volatile than the interior coastal zones using data from five island locations of iran daily eto values were calculated by the benchmark fao penman monteith fao56 pm model then the commonly used temperature radiation and mass transfer based eto equations were evaluated against the benchmark values an additional heuristic modeling of eto was also performed through employing gene expressions programming gep evaluated by k fold testing the obtained outcomes showed that the calibrated mass transfer based equations and their corresponded gep models generally surpassed the other applied models in the studied locations this criticized the commonly accepted implication about applying temperature radiation based models in case of data scarcity for different locations nevertheless analysis of the temporal variations of models performance among test years showed that fixing the minimum test size as 1 year for local k fold testing that is the case in similar studies might be misleading as it could not show the fluctuations in modeling accuracy well a minimum affordable size of at least one growing season was instead selected tested and recommended in the current research keywords evapotranspiration gene expression programming island pca analysis 1 introduction the reference evapotranspiration eto is defined as the evapotranspiration amount from a hypothesized reference crop grass with a height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 eto is a major attribute for calculating crop actual water requirements analyzing water budget in watersheds environmental assessment of catchments studying the hydrological processes and planning for making optimal management decisions on water exploitations especially in arid and semi arid regions nourani and sayyah fard 2012 the dominant climatic variables affecting eto are air temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed several attempts have been conducted so far to relate eto to these variables worldwide leading to numerous empirical or physics based equations generally those equations might be categorized into temperature based radiation based mass transfer based and combination groups in relation to the utilized meteorological variables for calculating eto the latter group is based on combining the energy balance and mass transfer components to obtain eto values thus they might give reliable outcomes in a wide range of climatologic conditions the penman monteith model adopted by the united nations food and agriculture organization that will be referred to as fao56 pm model in the present paper as one of the physics based combination models unite both the physiologic and aerodynamic parameters and has been accepted as the standard method of eto calculation when the in situ measurements of this factor are not available allen et al 1998 albeit it needs lots of meteorological records that cannot be easily gathered in some locations consequently employing other empirical equations that utilize limited weather variables for determining eto would be crucial in case of data scarcity however those equations should be calibrated and adjusted against lysimetric data or standard fao56 pm model at various locations with different climatic contexts meanwhile the heuristic data driven models have been considered as a proxy for simulating eto in different climatic and data availability conditions nevertheless only a brief survey in the existing literature showed that the accuracies of those equations models might be site specific xu and singh 2002 compared various temperature radiation mass transfer based equations for estimating eto in switzerland and found the radiation based models as the best estimators of the eto values obtained by the standard fao56 pm model irmak et al 2003 carried out a comprehensive comparison among different eto equations in a humid climate of florida and showed that the combination equations gave the most accurate simulations followed by the radiation based and temperature based equations using data from a semi arid environment of iran dehghanisanij et al 2004 have confirmed the acceptable performance of the temperature based eto equations nandagiri and kovoor 2006 evaluated the performances of seven eto equations under different climatic conditions of india for both daily and monthly time scales the assessment outcomes revealed that the temperature based hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 might be considered as the best alternative to the standard fao56 pm model in different climatic contexts except humid locations where the radiation humidity based equations would be preferable jabloun and sahli 2008 evaluated the temperature based hs equation in tunisia and observed higher deviations between the eto values produced by this equation and those of the standard fao56 pm model in both coastal and interior stations sabziparvar and tabari 2010 performed a comparison between the temperature and radiation based equations under arid and semiarid conditions of iran which showed the superiority of temperature based equations in such regions xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 made an appraisal of 13 temperature and radiation based equations at the island of crete in greece with semi arid climate the results revealed that the performances of the radiation based equations were much better than those of the temperature based ones rahimikhoob et al 2012 evaluated different temperature radiation based equations under a subtropical condition in iran the outcomes of the comparison showed that both the employed categories presented acceptable performance accuracy in the studied regions tabari et al 2013 compared 31 eto models including temperature radiation and mass transfer based equations in a humid region of iran and found that the radiation based equations gave the best results followed by the temperature based models while the mass transfer based equations presented the highest underestimations and error magnitudes liu et al 2017 compared 16 eto equations against lysimetric data and stated that the combination based equations presented the best results followed by the radiation based and temperature based equations paredes et al 2018 applied temperature based hs equation under humid conditions of azores islands north atlantic ocean and disclosed the proper capability of this equation for eto estimation in such regions it is seen that there are only limited studies that tackled eto simulation in island environments on the other hand the heuristic models with various input variables have been employed to simulate eto among different heuristic methods gene expression programming gep technique has found wide applications for modeling diverse hydrologic parameters including eto a complete review of the studies around gep applications in hydrology is beyond the scope of the present paper thus a few relevant studies will be discussed here guven et al 2008 employed gep in simulating daily eto values using data from usa and found that the models that have been relied on all necessary meteorological variables e g temperature radiation humidity and wind speed gave the best performance among others yassin et al 2016 applied gep and artificial neural networks techniques for estimating daily eto values in arid locations and found that the best performance accuracies were corresponded to the input combination that included all necessary meteorological inputs followed by the temperature humidity wind speed based configuration mattar 2018 performed monthly eto simulation in egypt by employing gep among the evaluated input configurations the model with the air temperature humidity and wind speed inputs gave the best accuracy the present research aimed at assessing the general implications of applying commonly used eto models through evaluating the empirical equations in island environments the first implication as can be seen from the literature is the superiority of temperature and radiation based models over the mass transfer based models in interior and coastal regions so the capabilities of mass transfer based models in simulating eto of island environments where the surrounding vast amount of water bodies might remarkably affect the meteorological parameters of such locations was investigated second by applying gep as a robust heuristic model relied on similar input variables of empirical equations the minimum affordable test sizes for temporal data scanning procedures that is assumed to be annual period in most of the studies were investigated and criticized to the best of the author s knowledge the current paper is the first time presentation of such assessments for island regions in literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 data analysis daily meteorological variables of 5 island weather stations of iran operated by the i r of iran meteorological organization irimo covering a period of 11 years 1st january 2007 31st december 2017 were utilized in this research fig 1 the climatic variables included the records of maximum and minimum air temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity all studied locations are island environments with the maximum elevation of 30 m a s l for kish and the minimum elevation of 4 4 m a s l for siri stations table1 specifies the general information of the analyzed data and locations based on the values obtained for the aridity index ia all the stations are classified as arid locations analysis of the temporal distribution of the rainfall events in these locations showed that the maximum rainfall in the locations is occurred during the december and january while the hot seasons may september receive almost no rain or a little amount of it wind speed u2 and direction also showed obvious variations among the stations and the months analysis of the wind speed values for the study period and the growing season may september in all the stations showed that the variations of u2 in terms of the coefficient of variation cv are obviously different for the growing seasons and the total study period nonetheless cv values of u2 records were fluctuated among the available years further wind direction had obvious variations from 20 minimum degree of lavan to 340 maximum degree of kish among the stations and the studied years months such variations may affect the humidity relative variables of the island stations the variations of the eto magnitudes during the year however did not show similar adverse trend while the summer months showed the highest eto values there was no fixed trend for its minimum values that might guessed to be happened during the winter season fig 2 illustrates the whisker range plot of the monthly eto values during the study period obvious variations among the months for the studied locations could be detected from fig 2 the maximum eto variations was belonged to lavan november 2 2 mm day and abu musa july 2 10 mm day while the minimum variations was observed in gheshm january 0 66 mm day the highest average relative humidity and rainfall amount values were also corresponded to abu musa and lavan respectively while the highest average total incoming solar radiation has been observed in gheshm as can be seen from table1 variations depicted in fig 2 were not similar among the stations and during the year although the higher variations could be observed in summer season for abu musa and gheshm stations the rest of the locations have had generally higher variations even in the cold season further the eto values have been scattered generally with values lower than the mean eto magnitudes for summer while this could be rarely detected for the winter period this might be anticipated because eto has lower values during the cold month so the values would have a smooth distribution around the mean values in the studied locations finally the variations of the mean eto values within the months were similar for all the sites an additional analysis using multiple sites over time s mode principal component analysis pca was performed to evaluate the regionalization of the studied sites and their meteorological variables a correlation matrix was used by employing pca because it excludes the differences in measurement units between the meteorological variables xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 and allows correlating the locations with the same seasonal patterns of meteorological variables together as discussed by comrie and glenn 1998 using the scree test cattell 1966 two pca factors were selected for both analyses explaining 93 2 and 90 8 of variance for stations and variables analysis respectively fig 3 shows the ordination plot of the meteorological data recorded at the studied sites from the figure it is clearly seen that all the studied sites formed a unique group this might be specifically decisive when using exogenous patterns for modeling eto in a location with missing data although variations domain should be considered when selecting the ancillary stations the available meteorological records were thoroughly screened for any inconsistency and the missing values were estimated and filled using the best methods compared by shiri 2017 a statistical analysis not presented here was also performed by comparing the coefficient of variations cv of the data before and after filling the missing values that showed both of the data sets had similar cv values 2 2 eto formulation table 2 summarizes the mathematical expressions of the applied eto equations following the suggestion of allen et al 1998 the physics based fao56 pm model was used to calculate the benchmark eto values in the present study the temperature based hargreaves samani hs hargreaves and samani 1985 radiation based priestley taylor pt priestley and taylor 1972 makkink mk makkink 1957 and turc tu turc 1961 and the mass transfer based dalton dn dalton 1802 trabert tr trabert 1896 and penman pn penman 1948 equations were utilized to calculate the eto values allen et al 1998 recommended the use of hs equation if only air temperature values are available as the unique meteorological records in a region the pt equation is the most widely utilized radiation based eto model in literature that omits the advection aerodynamic component effects in eto phenomenon and represents its effect by the advectivity coefficient constant value of 1 26 the turc equation tu is a special simplification of the makkink mk equation that needs air temperature solar radiation and relative humidity values for calculating eto when tu equation is utilized it would be possible to analyze the integrated consequence of solar radiation and air humidity on eto in relation to the temperature based models finally the equations that utilize the fundamentals of the dalton s law and the principles of eddy motion transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere mass transfer based equations require the air temperature and wind speed values for calculating eto the validity of the application of the latter group has been criticized in different regions especially in arid or hyper arid climatic contexts according to literature e g shiri 2018a 2 3 calibration of eto equations generally the performance accuracy of the empirical semi empirical eto equations might be improved through calibrating those equations taking into consideration the values obtained by the standard fao56 pm model as the target eto values shiri et al 2014a argued that the linear calibration procedure produces better results than the non linear calibration methods hence a linear calibration equation was adopted here for calibrating the applied eto equations as follows 1 e t o target a e t o model b where e t o target is the eto values produced by the standard fao56 pm model e t o model is the eto calculated by any of the utilized temperature radiation and mass transfer based equations and a b are the regression coefficients 2 4 gene expression programming gep genetic programming models i e gep have superiority over the other heuristic approaches as they can provide explicit formulations black and white approach of the rules that govern the studied phenomenon additionally there is no predefined function to be contemplated by gep to create formed functions guven et al 2008 the plan of eto modeling through employing gep starts by selecting the fitness function that was chosen as the root mean squared error rmse based on previous literature e g shiri 2017 then the set of terminals and functions that should create the chromosomes are selected in the present study the terminal set involved meteorological variables whereas the terminal set included the arithmetic operators and some other basic mathematical functions 3 ln x e x x 2 x 3 as suggested by shiri 2017 in the third step the chromosomal architecture length of head 8 number of gene per chromosome 3 was defined according to the suggestions of ferreira 2001 the linking function addition function based on the literature was selected at the fourth step the final step was to choose the genetic operators the parameters used per run are those recommended in literature for these kinds of studies e g shiri 2017 the genexpro program was used for modeling eto in the present study the parsimony pressure was used as penalization tool to reduce the program size for avoiding the over fitting 2 5 research protocol gep technique was applied in the present study along with the commonly used eto equations in order to make a through comparison between the empirical equations and gep models a subject matter expertise was combined with heuristic model and the input selection was carried out based on the necessary meteorological parameters of the applied empirical equations this has been proved to make better assessment and simulations of the target parameters as discussed by deschaine 2014 accordingly the following input configurations were used in the present study 1 gep1 tmax tmin tmean ra temperature based 2 gep2 tmax tmin rs radiation based 3 gep3 tmax tmin rh rs radiation mass transfer based 4 gep4 tmax tmin u2 mass transfer based abbreviations have been defined in table 2 another important step with using empirical and regression based models would be the supply of the used data patterns to the models so that they can handle the data properly and give reliable estimates using nv block fold test approach considering leave nv out cross validation would be a suitable data handling mode for making a through scanning of data and analyses of the outcomes shao 1993 racine 2000 accordingly a special type of this test which will be referred to as k fold test here was adopted to introduce the data to the applied models in both temporal local and regional external scales a local modeling the temporal strategy deals with at station local approach that utilizes chronological records of meteorological variables as well as the eto magnitudes for developing and testing the models consequently a minimum test set was defined as one year according to literature at each location and the models were trained each time with data from 10 years and tested with the remaining one year data given that the data records covers a period of 11 years a total of 220 5 stations 4 input configurations 11 years 1 heuristic models training testing processes were carried out in the local implementation of the gep models lgep models a similar procedure was also conducted for local calibration of the applied empirical equations calibrated using eq 1 so total 385 5 stations 11 years 7 equations calibration testing processes were established in the local calibration of the eto equations b external modeling egep two scenarios were adopted in this case as e1 gep the complete patterns data of one island station were reserved for testing the models each time so the models were trained using data from training stations here complete data from 4 island stations then tested using the complete patterns of the test site as there are five stations in the present study a total of 20 5 stations 4 input configurations 1 heuristic model training testing processes were performed at the external assessment of the gep technique e1 gep similarly total of 35 5 stations 7 equations calibration testing procedures were carried out for evaluating the empirical equations using external calibration strategy e2 gep an additional external gep modeling was performed using exogenous data from two coastal sites that are located in comparable latitudes with the studied island stations the coastal stations were chabahar latitude 25 17 n and jask latitude 25 38 n with total data period of 10 years 2005 2014 for each input configuration data from these coastal stations were pooled together and used for training the gep models the established models were then tested at the studied island locations therefore total 20 training testing procedures 5 stations 4 input configurations were carried out in this scenario it is noted that the selection of the island weather stations was carried out based on the availability of data despite relevant studies have used similar numbers of stations and data periods in such kinds of investigations nonetheless as the robust k fold testing was utilized for assessing the capabilities of the applied techniques the risk of overfitting was minimized because the models were evaluated through a complete data set scanning procedure 2 6 models assessment for assessing the applied models two dimensionless statistical measures namely the index of agreement ioa and the nash sutcliffe index ns along with an error index e g root mean square error rmse were used 2 ioa 1 i 1 n e t io mod e l e t io t arg e t i 1 n e t io mod e l e t o mod e l e t io t arg e t e t o t arg e t 3 ns 1 i 1 n e t io mod e l e t io t arg e t 2 i

values at the ith time step respectively e t o model and e t o target denote the corresponding mean et values respectively n is number of patterns willmott 1981 introduced the ioa as a dimensionless index for assessing the degree of model simulation error ioa varies between 0 worse simulation and 1 perfect match between the observed and simulated values it might represent the additive and proportional differences in the target and estimated mean and variance magnitudes moriasi et al 2007 the nash sutcliffe coefficient ns compares the residual variance with the observed patterns variance the optimal value of ns is 1 representing the perfect fit legates and mccabe 1999 the root mean square error rmse represents the errors in the same units of the studied phenomenon here eto mm day rmse shows the average error values through assigning higher weights to the larger errors noises by using the local k fold assignment these indicators were computed for each test stage here one year or growing season as well as for the total study period in case of the external k fold mode as the complete patterns of test stations were used for assessing the models each time the values were obtained using all available data at each location for the total study period 3 results and discussions 3 1 comparison of the eto equations table3 gives the summary of the overall performance of the eto equations for the study period mean performance indicators of the five studied locations the mass transfer based dalton dn and the radiation based turc tu models presented the highest rmse values and the lowest ns and ioa values while the radiation based priestley taylor pt equation gave the best eto estimations with the mean values of rmse ns and ioa as 1 373 mm day 0 364 and 0 802 respectively the rest of the applied models presented negative ns values that showed their produced outcomes could not be acceptable the temperature based hs model could not surpass the radiation based models and produced similar results to the mass transfer based penman pn equation among the mass transfer based equations pn showed the lowest mean rmse 2 024 mm day although its ns values were generally negative for all the studied locations the detailed breakdown of the rmse magnitudes in the studied sites as well as the spans of the models over underestimations has been delineated in fig 4 3 1 1 temperature based hs equation rmse per station values presented in fig 4 confirmed the aforementioned statements about the order of the equations performance accuracy in the studied region although the mean eto values in siri are slightly higher than the rest of the locations the highest rmse values that is assumed to be influenced by the range of the variations of the target eto values were not belonged to this station except hs that showed the highest rmse value 2 564 mm day in siri the highest wind speed u2 values both the mean and maximum wind speed values have been recorded in this site this is in agreement with the conclusions obtained by martínez cob and tejero juste 2004 that found the highest error values of hs equation for the stations with the higher wind speed values although this fact cannot be corresponded to the findings of xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 in this regard the reason for the higher rmse values of hs equation in this site might be explained through analyzing the correlation values between the meteorological parameters and equations errors table 4 the correlation analysis confirmed that the hs errors had the highest positive correlation values with u2 0 696 in the studied region such higher positive correlations might explain the underestimations of eto magnitudes by hs equation as can be seen from fig 4 in spite of that the higher eto values and arid climatic condition usually provide underestimated eto values by hs equation droogers and allen 2002 the maximum underestimation of hs equation was observed in siri with the highest u2 records overall hs equation could not provide accurate simulations of fao56 pm eto values in the studied locations as can be seen from the higher rmse and negative ns values as there was no similar study for simulating eto values in similar island regions it might not be possible to compare whether similar reports have been presented in literature in a comprehensive study about hs equation shiri et al 2015 used various calibration scenarios of hs adjustment throughout iran they reported generally lower rmse values for hs than those obtained here for bandar e lengeh coastal site that is located in comparable geographic position latitude 26 32 n they found rmse of hs equation as 0 540 mm day for a period of nine years with the mean eto value of 4 189 mm day that is significantly lower than those observed for the present locations hence it is seen that the performance of this equation is weak for the island regions alike to the arid semi arid regions that have been already analyzed by shiri et al 2015 this can be attributed to omitting the influence of high advection events of arid and island environments by hs equation berengena and gávilan 2005 xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 nevertheless successful applications of this equation in arid semi arid regions have been also reported in literature e g temesgen et al 2005 so the statements of alexandris et al 2006 about dependency of the hs equation performance accuracy on the local climatic conditions is confirmed here which dictates the necessity of calibrating this model against benchmark eto values e g values calculated by the fao56 pm model 3 1 2 radiation based equations in comparison to the other applied radiation based equations pt equation showed the lowest rmse values in all locations while tu had the highest values of this indicator however the overall performance accuracy of pt was low that might be due to excluding the effect of advection component from eto calculation procedure priestley and taylor 1972 the best estimations of pt have been provided in gheshm rmse 1 159 mm day ns 0 554 while its worst estimations were corresponded to abu musa rmse 1 273 mm day ns 0 197 among the studied locations the maximum solar radiation and minimum wind speed values have been recorded in gheshm further the lowest solar radiation and the highest relative humidity values have been observed in abu musa on the other hand the errors of pt equation showed the highest positive and negative correlations with the wind speed and relative humidity records respectively table 4 this might explain the best and worst performances of the pt equation in these locations among others gunston and batchelor 1983 also concluded that the pt equation produces better eto simulations for low wind speed conditions analyzing the pt over underestimations in fig 4 b showed that this equation underestimated the eto values in all locations so the advectivity coefficient should be higher than its original value higher than 1 26 for the studied sites similar trends have been also reported by utset et al 2004 for mediterranean conditions and by jury and tanner 1975 for arid and semi arid conditions the maximum underestimations of pt were corresponded to lavan that has the highest average annual precipitation this cannot generally confirm the results offered by xiaoying and erda 2005 that found better results of pt equation for rainy seasons however inter annual analysis of the values obtained for this coefficient not presented here showed that the eto values calculated by pt equation were closer to the target eto magnitudes by comparing the ratios of the eto values produced by benchmark fao56 pm with those obtained by pt for the study period 2007 2017 it was found that the advectivity coefficient α takes values of 1 282 1 281 1 349 1 377 and 1 370 for abu musa gheshm kish lavan and siri respectively the variations of this value did not showed a direct clear relation with the meteorological inputs of the stations although it might be supposed that the range of the vapor pressure as well as solar net radiation have direct influence on this coefficient castellvi et al 2001 the obtained values of this coefficient partially fallen within the suggested range of viswanadham et al 1991 1 2 α 1 3 although they are not in agreement with eaton et al 2001 that have obtained values between 1 51 and 2 32 for this coefficient in deep lake environments which are partially comparable locations to island sites this could be due to the differences between the water bodies used for calculating the eto where the first was open water lake while the latter was calculated for a reference grass land cover finally it should be noted that the analysis made here was based on the total study period that has been based on daily scale data more downscaled analysis focusing on hourly variations of pt coefficient values might provide more insight about its real values in the field scale regarding the makkink mk equation the maximum rmse values were obtained for abu musa 3 529 mm day the highest relative humidity values have been also recorded in this station the errors corresponded to mk equation showed the highest negative and positive correlations with relative humidity and wind speed respectively table 4 this can explain the higher rmse values of this equation in abu musa and the highest underestimation of mk at lavan with the lowest average relative humidity as can be seen from fig 4 b this specific observation cannot corresponded to the results presented by landeras et al 2008 that reported positive and negative correlations of mk errors with humidity and wind speed and overestimation trend of mk for humid locations from fig 4 b it is clearly seen that the highest underestimations have been produced by mk equation in all five locations among the all applied equations therefore the values of mk equation coefficient would be higher than their original value higher than 0 61 although its general value 0 6 0 7 have been proved to produced satisfactory results in humid locations xu and chen 2005 cristea et al 2013 only limited studies have tackled the application of mk equation for arid locations in literature which confirms the weak performance of the mk model in such regions e g shiri et al 2014a but there was no published studies where the mk equation has been evaluated under arid island conditions finally the radiation mass transfer based turc tu equation showed the highest rmse values than the pt and mk equations in all five stations alike to the former equations tu underestimated the eto values with the minimum and maximum underestimations in gheshm with the highest recorded solar radiation values and siri with the lowest recorded precipitation values as the maximum correlations of tu error was obtained with solar radiation in gheshm this might explain the lowest underestimations produced by tu in this location it is relevant to note here that the tu model has been developed for humid regions trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 so as could be expected its performance was weak for the studied arid island locations this outcome confirms the previous reports on application of tu equation in arid and hyper arid sites shiri 2017 3 1 3 mass transfer based equations penman pn gave the lowest rmse in all locations followed by trabert tr and dalton dn weakest performance these equations did not show an obvious trend of accuracy in the studied locations more specifically pn showed the lowest rmse in kish while abu musa with the highest relative humidity was corresponded to the lowest rmse for dn and tr equations it is seen that the overall performance of the mass transfer based equations are weak in all five stations with relatively higher rmse values the errors of dn and tr showed the highest negative correlations with relative humidity that could explain the lowest rmse values of these equations in abu musa these results are in good agreement with the results presented by kiafar et al 2017 that found mass transfer based equations unsuitable for both arid and humid locations of iran however the performance accuracy of pn was comparable to the temperature based hs and radiation based mk equations here while it surpassed them in abu musa from fig 4 b the overestimation trend of dn and tr equations as well as the underestimation behavior of pn in all sites can be easily detected these observations cannot support the conclusions given by shiri 2018a that reported the overestimation trend for these equations in arid locations such differences between the performances of the mass transfer based equations in arid regions might be due to the effect of the location of the studied weather stations island environments that may be subjected to the higher variations in advection phenomenon as well as other humidity based parameters which are effected by wind direction see section 2 1 as discussed by xiaoying and erda 2005 summarizing it is clear that despite some similarities between the present results and those already reported in literature regarding the application of different eto equations categories in arid regions these specific observations criticized the applicability of the utilized equations in arid environments of island locations additional adjustment of these equations would be therefore necessary through calibration of these equations against the standard fao56 pm model to improve the validity of them in those regions therefore as mentioned before different calibration strategies were adopted here based on local and ancillary data supplementation 3 2 calibration of eto equations a brief summary of the performance indicators of the locally calibrated equations calibrated using eq 1 at 95 confidence interval has been presented in table 3 for the total study period the values given in this table are corresponded to a simple data management strategy where the total available data patterns were used for calibrating the equations and then the calibrated versions were tested using the same patterns 2007 2017 from the table it is clearly seen that the maximum standard deviation of iao values is corresponded to temperature based hs followed by the mass transfer based equations while the highest deviation values of rmse are observed for mass transfer based dn and radiation based mk equations regarding the ns indicator the highest deviation values are belonged to dn tr and tu equations this shows clear variations in the magnitudes of the statistical indicators in the studied stations the locally calibrated pt equation lcpt gave the lowest mean rmse 1 043 mm d and the highest mean ns 0 635 values among others while the locally calibrated tu equation lctu presented the highest mean rmse 1 210 mm day and the lowest mean ns 0 509 values comparing with non calibrated versions of these equations it is seen that calibrating the equations has improved the performance of them in all locations per station ns values of the calibrated equations have been illustrated in fig 5 the calibrated hs pt and mk equations presented the highest ns values in gheshm and kish whereas the best performance of the tu dn tr and pn equations were observed in kish and lavan this can be confirmed by analyzing the calibration regression equation parameters table 5 overall it might be stated that although the calibration of eto equations against the standard fao56 pm model can improve their performance the improvement magnitudes would be affected by the local climatic conditions at the studied locations as well as the calibrated equation and its dominant variables nevertheless as stated before these results depict the potential of calibration process for enhancing the eto equations using the same calibration and test data hence as could be foreshadowed performance improvement would be remarkable using this procedure consequently the robust k fold testing was adopted for calibrating the models to make a better deep analysis in this regard see section 2 4 assessing the performance of the equations calibrated using the local k fold testing data management strategy it was found that the performance accuracies of the models were fluctuated during the study period given that the test set was defined as one year here these variations were pictured among the studied years 11 years that showed obvious temporal variations for the statistical indicators magnitudes as an example of such variations the differences between the highest and lowest observed rmse and ns values among the test years were displayed in fig 6 for the studied locations oscillations in rmse values of hs were generally lower than the rest of the applied equations in all sites except kish while the minimum fluctuations of ns magnitudes were corresponded to pt in the studied sites except abu musa the highest variations in rmse and ns values were observed for mass transfer based equations with the exception of such variations in siri where all models showed similar rmse and ns differences this reveals that the performance accuracy of these equations at each location was different among the test years which confirms the necessity of adopting a complete data scanning procedure for monitoring the mentioned variations nonetheless the present statement stresses using the traditional data supply strategy where the same patterns would be used for calibrating and assessing the equations as discussed by marti et al 2011 the overall ns values of the equations calibrated using ancillary data have been presented in fig 5 these values were corresponded to the total study period at each location as stated before the performances of the externally calibrated ec equations are generally comparable to the locally calibrated lc versions of the equations that shows both the procedures could be adopted for simulating the eto values this might be expected because the differences between the calibration and test stations patterns were relevant as can be seen from table 1 further the ns values of the externally calibrated tu dn and tr equations are higher than those of the locally calibrated versions in gheshm on the other hand the ec procedure benefits from using ancillary data where the local patterns would not be necessary for calibrating the equations this is of special importance in the locations with limited scarce necessary meteorological observations for calculating the eto summarizing it might be concluded that calibration of the empirical eto equations against standard fao56 pm model in island locations could generally improve their performance although such improvement would be case sensitive and dependent on the local climatologic characteristics of the studied sites nevertheless improvements of some commonly used equations e g hs in some locations was not significant that cannot confirm the statements presented in previous studies regarding the capability of calibration procedure for enhancing the equations accuracy finally the locally calibrated models suffers from using local data for both calibration and testing phases that would limit the applicability of them in case of the lack of sufficient necessary meteorological data 3 3 evaluation of gep models fig 7 presents the global performance indicators of the applied gep models in both local and external scales at the local scale gep3 and gep4 models presented the best simulations followed by gep2 and gep1 in the external scale the mass transfer based gep4 surpassed the other applied gep models followed by gep2 for gep3 and gep4 models the locally trained models lgep gave better simulations of eto than those of the externally trained models e1 gep e2 gep while such differences were not observed for temperature based gep1 and radiation based gep2 models analysis of the values obtained for the indicators revealed that temperature based models gave weak simulations when compared to the other applied input configurations models relied on temperature and radiation records gave slightly better results than temperature based models including the relative humidity that is a mass transfer parameter shiri 2018b as an additional input variable gep3 improved the modeling accuracy to some extent ns 0 799 720 and 0 682 for lgep3 lgep2 and lgep1 respectively finally the mass transfer based models presented better results than temperature based and radiation based models in both local and external applications fig 8 displays the ns values of the gep models per station for all four input configurations expectedly the lgep models outperformed the e1 gep and e2 gep since they used the patterns of the same locations for training and testing however the performances of egep models were comparable to local models in some cases among the lgeps the models relied on humidity radiation and mass transfer based configurations lgep3 4 presented the highest performance accuracy in all studied locations although the better performance of the lgep3 might be anticipated as benefits from both radiation and mass transfer in term of relative humidity components the performance of the mass transfer based models that utilize limited inputs were better than the radiation based and temperature based models which contradicts the results presented by previous studies conducted in other regions most of the previous inferences have confirmed the weak performances of mass transfer based heuristic models in interior and coastal regions e g kiafar et al 2017 shiri 2018a this partial conclusion might be due to the specific locations of the studied stations in the present study island regions where the humidity relative parameters might be severely affected by wind speed and direction as stated in the previous sections analysis of the models performances among the stations revealed that lgep models gave the best simulations in gheshm while the poorest estimations were corresponded to lavan except for lgep1 where lavan and siri showed similar performances and lgep4 that produced the best outputs in lavan these observations might be explained by taking into consideration the correlations between the models errors and meteorological variables the maximum humidity has been recorded at lavan where it showed a negative correlation with the errors of lgep4 model next according to fig 8 it is seen that the performance accuracy of the egep models are better than the local ones in some cases for instance the temperature based lgep1 gave a ns value of around 0 66 in abu musa while the corresponded values of e1 gep3 and e2 gep3models for the same location were 0 745 and 0 767 respectively similarly e1 gep4 and e2 gep4 produced ns values of 0 716 and 0 690 respectively again this criticizes the use of temperature based models in island locations and confirms the necessity of adopting humidity relative parameters for using as models input variables nonetheless this shows the suitable relevance of the studied stations patters that provide a straightforward mapping between the input target parameters when the models were trained using data from other island locations comparing two external training scenarios of gep models e1 gep and e2 gep in fig 8 it was found that except for the radiation mass transfer based models the first scenario that uses the ancillary data from other island locations for training the gep models seems to be better than the second scenario that uses data from two coastal stations with comparable latitudes as e1 gep2 showed its superiority over the e2 gep2 both utilize temperature and radiation data the weak performance of the e1 gep3 that uses temperature radiation and humidity data in relation to e2 gep3 could be associated to introducing the relative humidity as an additional input variable although all the studied locations presented similar mean rh values differences between the maximum and minimum rh values in the stations are remarkable 73 72 71 5 67 0 and 65 for abu musa gheshm kish lavan and siri respectively this difference might explain the abnormal performance of e1 gep3 when compared to e2 gep3 in these stations again similar to the locally calibrated eto equations the performances of the lgep models were assessed per test year of each station and the differences between the maximum and minimum rmse and ns values within test years were illustrated in fig 5 unlike to the empirical equations lgep models did not show obvious oscillations among the test years maximum rmse and ns differences were corresponded to lgep3 in lavan 0 217 mm day and 0 288 respectively whereas minimum differences were observed for lgep2 in kish 0 015 mm day and 0 006 for rmse and ns differences respectively other models generally showed such low differences in all locations around 0 2 marti et al 2010 2011 argued that assessment of heuristic eto models should be carried out based on k fold testing so that all the available patterns can incorporate in both training and testing phases they showed remarkable variations of performance accuracy between the test years similar statements have been presented by e g shiri et al 2014a and shiri 2018a so this partial conclusion cannot confirm the previously published conclusions that have reported obvious variations of performance indicators among test years in similar studies hence a downscaling breakdown was made and the variations of these indicators were calculated for growing seasons of the study period fig 9 shows the variations of rmse values of lgep models for the growing seasons conspicuous disparities can be discerned among the growing seasons for rmse although the order of the models performance accuracy was same for all the stations lgep3 and lgep4 surpassed lgep2 and lgep1 weakest model some remarkable quantitative differences can be detected among the test years for all locations and input configurations considering such differences two cases are elucidated among others first the maximum oscillations can be observed for lgep1 in all locations while the minimum variations are belonged to lgep3 except for lavan where lgep4 showed the minimum rmse variations second if the performances of the all lgep models are considered for the growing season of test years 2007 and 2014 in abu musa it might be stated that all the models have presented similar comparable results even so if the growing season of test year 2015 was contemplated it would be seen that lgep3 produced the best outcomes followed by lgep4 likewise evaluating the performance of the lgep models in the growing season of test year 2015 in siri it was realized that lgep3 and lgep4 were markedly better than lgep1 and lgep2 such variations might be linked to the relations between the meteorological parameters utilized for training and testing the lgep models fig 10 shows the scatterplots of the observed and simulated eto values produced by gep models in abu musa station as an example despite confirming the mentioned statements about the order of the accuracies of the models the scatterplots clearly show that the higher eto values have been underestimated by all the local and external gep models where the highest underestimations are corresponded temperature based models concluding although the variations of the models performance accuracies could not be distinguished when they were calculated for the test years clear fluctuations of rmse values were detected when they were obtained for growing seasons this cannot confirm the findings of the previous literature e g shiri et al 2015 that have found one year as a suitable test size for assessing gep at local scale although it shows the necessity of adopting k fold testing while it suggests using the downscaled test size less than one year for picturing such variations at least for island regions finally the mathematical expressions of the gep models have been given in table 6 for all applied input configurations these models have been obtained through running the gep models by using complete patterns of the all studied locations for each input configuration 3 4 comparison of gep with empirical equations as discussed in section 3 2 calibrated eto equations presented more accurate results than the original versions of the equations hence the calibrated equations were compared with the corresponding gep models in this part considering the temperature based models all the models exhibited similar accuracy except lgep1 that slightly outperformed the other temperature based models similar statements might be given for radiation based models where lgep2 showed a slight superiority over the other locally externally calibrated models these good performances might be anticipated because these models were feed with the training and testing patterns of a same location the key point would be the acceptable performance of the externally calibrated models empirical equations and gep models that exempts using the local data for calculating eto in case of the paucity of data comparing these two cases it is seen that the inclusion of solar radiation as an additional input variable has improved the models performances so that the external gep2 models surpasses the locally trained gep models and empirical equations the models relied on temperature radiation and humidity data gave remarkably better results than the first two cases alike to the previous cases the gep models gave more accurate results than the empirical equations in both local and external training scales further the e2 gep3 model surpasses the locally calibrated empirical equation turc equation that shows the higher ability of gep in mapping the nonlinear relations between the inputs and targets when exogenous data were supplied for establishing the heuristic models finally the gep models generally presented the best results among the mass transfer based category again the performance of the e1 gep4 and e2 gep4 models were much better than the corresponded empirical equations in all the studied stations it might be finally stated that the externally organized models egep have given better or at least comparable results to the locally calibrated empirical equations assuming that all the necessary weather parameters of eto are not recorded in most of the locations this capability will provide reliable simulations to be used by experts in different practical contexts outlining it was found based on the analyses that temperature based and radiation based empirical and gep models could not give promising outcomes when used to simulate eto in the studied island stations while the models that gained from mass transfer components presented more accurate results this is a specific observation achieved in the present study that contradicts the previous reports e g shiri et al 2014b regarding the optimistic performance of the temperature and radiation based models as well as unsuccessful application of mass transfer based models for even coastal zones that have been partially surrounded by vast amount of water nonetheless overall performance of the evaluated models were lower than those reported in previous studies although they were promising for the optimum models as discussed in the text for interior coastal sites this might be because of sudden changes in weather conditions of island locations when compared to interior costal sites for which similar outcomes have been reported by boland et al 2016 for solar radiation forecast issue however further studies would be necessary to investigate the validity of these conclusions in humid island environments as well as other arid islands with different latitudes 4 conclusions the present study aimed at assessing the general practical implications of employing commonly used eto models in arid island regions the acquired results revealed the following closures about the applied models 1 wind speed can explain most of the variations of eto in island regions 2 temperature based and radiation based empirical and gene expressions programming gep models failed to give reliable eto estimations in arid island environments with large error magnitudes and highest underestimations 3 the gep models based on solar radiation and relative humidity that benefited from both energy and mass transfer components gave the most accurate results 4 unlike to the most of the previously published literature models based on mass transfer inputs temperature wind speed gave promising results as they would need less data than the radiation mass transfer models they might be considered as preferable approaches for simulating eto in island regions 5 externally trained gep models that used data from other island stations for simulating the eto values of the target island locations e1 gep models gave comparable results to the locally trained gep as well as locally calibrated empirical equations this would exempt needing local patterns for obtaining eto at test sites 6 externally trained gep models with data from exogenous coastal sites e2 gep models gave suitable results especially when they were fed with radiation humidity or with air temperature wind speed data 7 fixing the minimum test set of one year in k fold testing could not show the variations of the performance accuracy of gep models among the test years properly breaking the analysis to at least one growing season could show the variations more clearly acknowledgments author would like to thank prof dr ahmad fakheri fard university of tabriz

the biogeochemical response of dom in lakes provides insight into how different ecosystems may respond to future changes in climate and land use however only a small proportion of lakes can be

the relative influence of different catchment characteristics on doc a250 a365 suva254 and fi fig 3 land cover variables and hydrogeological characteristics had a similar importance in predicting doc values explaining 10 8 and 10 4 of the variability respectively for dom parameters land cover variables were more important explaining 36 9 21 7 and 47 4 of the variance in the values of a250 a365 suva254 and fi respectively for doc and fi the most important land cover variable was the percentage of bogs explaining even 37 1 of the variance in the fi values for a250 a365 and suva254 the most

and fi hydrogeological characteristics explained much smaller proportions of the variability for doc the most important soil variables were the percentage of haplic albeluvisols and soc stock explaining 12 8 and 12 7 of the variability respectively for a250 a365 and suva254 the most important soil variable was the percentage of gleyic rendzinas and for fi the percentage of fibric histosols 4 discussion 4 1 doc concentrations and properties of dom the range of doc concentrations measured by us in 34 estonian lakes table 5 was comparable with that reported for lakes in finland kortelainen 1993 sweden von einem and granéli 2010 and latvia klavins et al 2012 but slightly higher than those found in irish aherne et al 2002 burton and aherne 2012 and norwegian lakes hagman et al 2015 finstad et al 2016 according to dom properties the studied lakes could be divided into two groups by their limnological types the first group comprising clear and dark water lakes with low nutrients oligotrophic semidystrophic acidotrophic and dystrophic lakes had greater contributions of humic substances with higher molecular weight indicated by the low values of a250 a365 a254 a436 and a365 a465 tables 4 and 5 low values of fi 1 4 and β α 0 7 in these lakes except oligotrophic ones and two mixotrophic lakes showed predominantly terrestrial sources of dom and a low autochthonous component humic substances with higher aromaticity had the highest relative contribution in dark water lakes nohipalo mustjärv and ohepalu reflected by suva254 values 4 l mg 1 m 1 a250 a365 values close to 4 in these lakes were characteristic of strongly coloured waters and higher scoa436 values compared to other studied lakes showed greater contribution of quinonic and ketonic structures the second group including most of the light coloured eutrophic lakes hard water eutrophic macrophytic and halotrophic lakes had a relatively high share of low molecular weight organic compounds from primary production indicated by high values of a250 a365 a254 a436 and a365 a465 low suva254 values 3 l mg 1 m 1 in these lakes reflected also a rather low aromaticity of dom and high values of fi 1 5 a greater contribution of internally produced dom humic acids had a greater contribution than fulvic acids in dystrophic semidystrophic mixotrophic and oligotrophic lakes as evidenced by a465 a665 values 5 or near to it fulvic acids had a relatively high share only in 7 hard water eutrophic macrophytic or acidotrophic lakes as indicated by a465 a665 values of 6 8 5 and suva285 values 2 4 2 the effect of catchment characteristics on doc concentrations the qualitative and quantitative properties of dom in our study depended substantially on land cover and soil types in the catchments and catchment hydrology and geology showing that dom originated predominantly from the catchment in many of the studied lakes in general soil variables were much more important than land cover variables and hydrogeological characteristics we ca la and alkalinity in determining doc concentrations figs 3 and 5 we have not found studies examining variables of catchment soil cover in relation to dom in lakes which makes us believe that our study is the first to find connections between organic carbon in catchment soils and lake water soil organic carbon soc stock in the catchment showed the strongest positive correlation with doc concentrations in lakes figs 2 and 4 and explained the greatest proportion of doc variation among land cover and soil variables billett et al 2006 also found a strong positive correlation between downstream changes of doc in a scottish stream and catchment soc pool that was related to the percentage of peat soils histosols in the catchment however the relationship between soc and stream doc weakened downstream as other processes e g lower soc inputs from minerals soils and in stream processing of doc became more important soc stocks are soil type specific and depend mainly on soil carbonate and clay content moisture regime and method of soil management kõlli et al 2009 our results showed that agricultural soils with highest soc stock among mineral soils in estonia gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols had a strong positive effect on doc concentrations in lakes and forest soils with low soc content mainly haplic albeluvisols a negative effect however soc storage does not directly equate to doc leaching as soc retaining capacity of soil types is different e g podzols unlike histosols have a significant capacity to retain doc within the soil profile by physicochemical adsorption lundström et al 2000 doc concentrations in lakes increased in addition with the percentages of bogs and peat soils dominating in bogs fibric histosols the effect of bogs peatlands on doc in lakes has been observed for example in finnish lakes kortelainen 1993 rantakari et al 2004 mattsson et al 2005 arvola et al 2016 and the role of peatlands as a major source of doc has been confirmed for boreal catchments in general e g dillon and molot 1997 hydrogeological characteristics showed different effect on doc concentrations in lakes doc increased with the water exchange we and catchment area drainage ratio ca la and doc values were lower in lakes with calcareous catchment light coloured eutrophic lakes similar relationships with ca la have been observed in finnish lakes kortelainen 1993 and with we in finnish lakes vuorenmaa 2006 and swedish lakes köhler et al 2013 higher we restricts in lake doc removal processes e g sedimentation microbial decomposition and photo oxidation and causes an increase in doc concentrations schindler et al 1992 1997 4 3 the effect of catchment characteristics on the properties of dom catchment characteristics had a stronger effect on dom properties than on its concentration as seen from linear models that explained more variance in a250 a365 suva254 and fi values than in doc concentrations figs 3 and 5 catchment characteristics explained more than half of the variability in a250 a365 66 7 and fi 59 3 while somewhat less in suva254 43 0 soil variables were more important than land cover variables in determining the properties of dom in lakes soil variables together with hydrogeological characteristics explained a much greater proportion of the variability in average molecular weight aromaticity and origin of dom than land cover variables with hydrogeological characteristics the aromaticity and molecular weight relative contribution of fulvic acids quinonic and ketonic structures and terrestrial origin of dom increased with ca la and the percentages of bogs and dystric histosols and fibric histosols peat soils dominating in transitional mires and bogs respectively in the catchments figs 2 and 4 tables 6 and 7 this showed that the export of allochthonous dom to the studied lakes was greater from larger catchments and confirmed the role of peatlands as a major source of dom dependence of dom aromaticity and molecular weight on catchment peatland cover has been found also in finnish arvola et al 2016 and swedish catchments olefeldt et al 2013 as described by vogt et al 2004 histosols produce and release dom with high quinone content and that explained the positive effect of dystric and fibric histosols on the contribution of quinonic and ketonic structures according to the correlation analysis podzols and gleyic podzols soils formed underneath coniferous forests had a similar relationship with the molecular weight and origin of dom as dystric and fibric histosols however linear models did not confirm it billett et al 2006 found a relationship between the percentage of podzols in the catchment and stream doc in scotland suggesting that the dom in stream water originated at least partially from podzols forests especially coniferous forests have been found to be an important sources of humic substances to lakes hongve 1999 our results did not confirm the effect of forests as a land cover type maybe since it did not differentiate between deciduous mixed and coniferous forests and forests grow on many different soils types in estonia kõlli et al 2009 moreover dom export from forested catchments is tightly linked to the catchment hydrology and local precipitation diodato et al 2016 and forests in different catchments can have a different effect aromaticity of dom increased also with higher we and with the percentages of agricultural areas and albeluvisols fertile agricultural soils similar relationship between we and dom aromaticity was found in lake mälaren one of the largest lakes in sweden köhler et al 2013 and in other swedish lakes kellerman et al 2014 where the share of terrestrially derived dom decreased with lower we agricultural land was found to be an important source of dom export in finnish catchments mattsson et al 2005 other fertile agricultural soils gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols and brown soils showed different effect on dom properties molecular weight of dom decreased with the percentage of gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols and brown soils also the contribution of autochthonous dom increased with the percentage of brown soils but our results did not confirm the same for gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols relationships between dom in water bodies and organic carbon in soils are more complex and not so strong in the catchments where mineral soils are spatially more important than peat soils billett et al 2006 contribution of low molecular weight and autochthonous dom increased also with the percentage of sapric histosols peat soils dominating typically in mires research conducted in norwegian lakes showed similarly very poor relationships between percentage of mires in the catchments and humic substances in lakes hongve 1999 one explanation for the opposite effect of sapric histosols on dom properties compared to other peat soils could be different land use fibric and dystric histosols are not used for agriculture in estonia yet sapric histosols are kõlli et al 2009 our results showed that sapric histosols had a similar effect on dom properties than some agricultural soils e g brown soils in addition sapric histosols are part of heterogeneous catchments in our study sites even if being the dominating soil type and runoff from these soils can interact with mineral soils this most likely causes the decrease in dom aromaticity and molecular weight because of the substantial and selective absorption of hydrophobic dom while passing through mineral soils kaiser and zech 1998 if bogs and fibric histosols dominate in the catchment in our study sites the catchment soil cover is quite homogeneous with low percentage of mineral soils and runoff probably does not interact with mineral soils before reaching the lake dominance of non humic over humic substances and autochthonous over allochthonous dom in lakes corresponded most strongly to calcareous catchments higher percentages of gleyic rendzinas thin soils on calcareous rock and higher percentages of land cover types open space areas with little or no vegetation and other other land cover types together in estonia gleyic rendzinas are common on land cover other than forest arable land or grassland kõlli et al 2009 i e land cover types open space and other used in our study both belong to this category all the studied lakes with calcareous catchment are light coloured eutrophic lakes and our results indicated a greater contribution of internally produced dom in these types of lakes the role of catchment characteristics in determining dom properties was not so clear in eutrophic lakes because the contribution of autochthonous dom is determined by the trophic status of a lake williamson et al 1999 increased nutrient loads from the catchment may increase the in lake production of dom and the relative importance of autochthonous over allochthonous dom tranvik et al 2009 in these lakes catchment characteristics have an indirect effect on dom properties 5 conclusions the results of our study showed that catchment characteristics had a stronger effect on dom properties than on doc concentrations explaining up to 66 7 of the variability in spectral parameters in nutrient poor clear and dark water lakes dom was represented predominantly by humic substances originated from the catchment whereas in light coloured eutrophic lakes internally produced non humic substances had a greater contribution catchment characteristics land cover soil and catchment hydrology and geology had substantial effects on dom especially in acidotrophic dystrophic semidystrophic and mixotrophic lakes we can conclude that larger catchments and intensive water exchange resulted in higher levels of dom in lakes and soil variables had in general a greater effect than land cover soil types provide more detailed information about organic carbon in the catchment and therefore are better predictors of dom loading than general land cover types our study confirmed the role of peatlands as a major source of dom to lakes however agricultural lands with albeluvisols and coniferous forests with podzols and gleyic podzols were also important dom sources in eutrophic lakes with relatively high share of autochthonous dom catchment characteristics had an indirect and less clear impact on dom patterns in dom quantity and quality found in our study were similar to patterns found in temperate lakes in general our study sites do not represent all temperate catchments especially regarding hydrological conditions e g estonian mean annual precipitation is lower than in several western european countries and soil variables e g the mean soc content of estonian soils is higher than in most european countries however our results could still be expanded with some caution to other catchments and have important implications for understanding catchment lake interactions across the temperate

calcareous catchments and higher percentages of gleyic rendzinas thin soils on calcareous rock sapric histosols peat soils in mires and open spaces areas with little vegetation our results showed that soil variables had in general a greater effect than land cover and were more informative for describing the role of catchment characteristics on dom in lakes patterns in dom quantity and quality found

the biogeochemical response of dom in lakes provides insight into how different ecosystems may respond to future changes in climate and land use however only a small proportion of lakes can be

the relative influence of different catchment characteristics on doc a250 a365 suva254 and fi fig 3 land cover variables and hydrogeological characteristics had a similar importance in predicting doc values explaining 10 8 and 10 4 of the variability respectively for dom parameters land cover variables were more important explaining 36 9 21 7 and 47 4 of the variance in the values of a250 a365 suva254 and fi respectively for doc and fi the most important land cover variable was the percentage of bogs explaining even 37 1 of the variance in the fi values for a250 a365 and suva254 the most important land cover variable was the percentage of open spaces 3 3 dom relationships with soil types soc stocks and the percentages of gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols and fibric histosols had the

59 3 of fi variance table 7 whereas alkalinity brown soils and sapric histosols did not contribute significantly to the predictions of doc and dom parameters soil variables were more important than the hydrogeological characteristics explaining 32 9 of doc 57 6 of a250 a365 30 2 of suva254 and 54 2 of fi variability fig 5 for suva254 we explained 12 9 of the variability for doc a250 a365 suva254 and fi hydrogeological characteristics explained much smaller proportions of the variability for doc the most important soil variables were the percentage of haplic albeluvisols and soc stock explaining 12 8 and 12 7 of the variability respectively for a250 a365 and suva254 the most important soil variable was the percentage of gleyic rendzinas and for fi the percentage of fibric histosols 4 discussion 4 1 doc concentrations and properties of dom the range of doc concentrations measured by us in 34 estonian lakes table 5 was comparable with that reported for lakes in finland kortelainen 1993 sweden von einem and granéli 2010 and latvia klavins et al 2012 but slightly higher than those found in irish aherne et al 2002 burton and aherne 2012 and norwegian lakes hagman et al 2015 finstad et al 2016 according to dom properties the studied lakes could be divided into two groups by their limnological types the first group comprising clear and dark water lakes with low nutrients oligotrophic semidystrophic acidotrophic and dystrophic lakes had greater contributions of humic substances with higher molecular weight indicated by the low values of a250 a365 a254 a436 and a365 a465 tables 4 and 5 low values of fi 1 4 and β α 0 7 in these lakes except oligotrophic ones and two mixotrophic lakes showed predominantly terrestrial sources of dom and a low autochthonous component humic substances with higher aromaticity had the highest relative contribution in dark water lakes nohipalo mustjärv and ohepalu reflected by suva254 values 4 l mg 1 m 1 a250 a365 values close to 4 in these lakes were characteristic of strongly coloured waters and higher scoa436 values compared to other studied lakes showed greater contribution of quinonic and ketonic structures the second group including most of the light coloured eutrophic lakes hard water eutrophic macrophytic and halotrophic lakes had a relatively high share of low molecular weight organic compounds from primary production indicated by high values of a250 a365 a254 a436 and a365 a465 low suva254 values 3 l mg 1 m 1 in these lakes reflected also a rather low aromaticity of dom and high values of fi 1 5 a greater contribution of internally produced dom humic acids had a greater contribution than fulvic acids in dystrophic semidystrophic mixotrophic and oligotrophic lakes as evidenced by a465 a665 values 5 or near to it fulvic acids had a relatively high share only in 7 hard water eutrophic macrophytic or acidotrophic lakes as indicated by a465 a665 values of 6 8 5 and suva285 values 2 4 2 the effect of catchment characteristics on doc concentrations the qualitative and quantitative properties of dom in our study depended substantially on land cover and soil types in the catchments and catchment hydrology and geology showing that dom originated predominantly from the catchment in many of the studied lakes in general soil variables were much more important than land cover variables and hydrogeological characteristics we ca la and alkalinity in determining doc concentrations figs 3 and 5 we have not found studies examining variables of catchment soil cover in relation to dom in lakes which makes us believe that our study is the first to find connections between organic carbon in catchment soils and lake water soil organic carbon soc stock in the catchment showed the strongest positive correlation with doc concentrations in lakes figs 2 and 4 and explained the greatest proportion of doc variation among land cover and soil variables billett et al 2006 also found a strong positive correlation between downstream changes of doc in a scottish stream and catchment soc pool that was related to the percentage of peat soils histosols in the catchment however the relationship between soc and stream doc weakened downstream as other processes e g lower soc inputs from minerals soils and in stream processing of doc became more important soc stocks are soil type specific and depend mainly on soil carbonate and clay content moisture regime and method of soil management kõlli et al 2009 our results showed that agricultural soils with highest soc stock among mineral soils in estonia gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols had a strong positive effect on doc concentrations in lakes and forest soils with low soc content mainly haplic albeluvisols a negative effect however soc storage does not directly equate to doc leaching as soc retaining capacity of soil types is different e g podzols unlike histosols have a significant capacity to retain doc within the soil profile by physicochemical adsorption lundström et al 2000 doc concentrations in lakes increased in addition with the percentages of bogs and peat soils dominating in bogs fibric histosols the effect of bogs peatlands on doc in lakes has been observed for example in finnish lakes kortelainen 1993 rantakari et al 2004 mattsson et al 2005 arvola et al 2016 and the role of peatlands as a major source of doc has been confirmed for boreal catchments in general e g dillon and molot 1997 hydrogeological characteristics showed different effect on doc concentrations in lakes doc increased with the water exchange we and catchment area drainage ratio ca la and doc values were lower in lakes with calcareous catchment light coloured eutrophic lakes similar relationships with ca la have been observed in finnish lakes kortelainen 1993 and with we in finnish lakes vuorenmaa 2006 and swedish lakes köhler et al 2013 higher we restricts in lake doc removal processes e g sedimentation microbial decomposition and photo oxidation and causes an increase in doc concentrations schindler et al 1992 1997 4 3 the effect of catchment characteristics on the properties of dom catchment characteristics had a stronger effect on dom properties than on its concentration as seen from linear models that explained more variance in a250 a365 suva254 and fi values than in doc concentrations figs 3 and 5 catchment characteristics explained more than half of the variability in a250 a365 66 7 and fi 59 3 while somewhat less in suva254 43 0 soil variables were more important than land cover variables in determining the properties of dom in lakes soil variables together with hydrogeological characteristics explained a much greater proportion of the variability in average molecular weight aromaticity and origin of dom than land cover variables with hydrogeological characteristics the aromaticity and molecular weight relative contribution of fulvic acids quinonic and ketonic structures and terrestrial origin of dom increased with ca la and the percentages of bogs and dystric histosols and fibric histosols peat soils dominating in transitional mires and bogs respectively in the catchments figs 2 and 4 tables 6 and 7 this showed that the export of allochthonous dom to the studied lakes was greater from larger catchments and confirmed the role of peatlands as a major source of dom dependence of dom aromaticity and molecular weight on catchment peatland cover has been found also in finnish arvola et al 2016 and swedish catchments olefeldt et al 2013 as described by vogt et al 2004 histosols produce and release dom with high quinone content and that explained the positive effect of dystric and fibric histosols on the contribution of quinonic and ketonic structures according to the correlation analysis podzols and gleyic podzols soils formed underneath coniferous forests had a similar relationship with the molecular weight and origin of dom as dystric and fibric histosols however linear models did not confirm it billett et al 2006 found a relationship between the percentage of podzols in the catchment and stream doc in scotland suggesting that the dom in stream water originated at least partially from podzols forests especially coniferous forests have been found to be an important sources of humic substances to lakes hongve 1999 our results did not confirm the effect of forests as a land cover type maybe since it did not differentiate between deciduous mixed and coniferous forests and forests grow on many different soils types in estonia kõlli et al 2009 moreover dom export from forested catchments is tightly linked to the catchment hydrology and local precipitation diodato et al 2016 and forests in different catchments can have a different effect aromaticity of dom increased also with higher we and with the percentages of agricultural areas and albeluvisols fertile agricultural soils similar relationship between we and dom aromaticity was found in lake mälaren one of the largest lakes in sweden köhler et al 2013 and in other swedish lakes kellerman et al 2014 where the share of terrestrially derived dom decreased with lower we agricultural land was found to be an important source of dom export in finnish catchments mattsson et al 2005 other fertile agricultural soils gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols and brown soils showed different effect on dom properties molecular weight of dom decreased with the percentage of gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols and brown soils also the contribution of autochthonous dom increased with the percentage of brown soils but our results did not confirm the same for gleyic cambisols gleyic luvisols relationships between dom in water bodies and organic carbon in soils are more complex and not so strong in the catchments where mineral soils are spatially more important than peat soils billett et al 2006 contribution of low molecular weight and autochthonous dom increased also with the percentage of sapric histosols peat soils dominating typically in mires research conducted in norwegian lakes showed similarly very poor relationships between percentage of mires in the catchments and humic substances in lakes hongve 1999 one explanation for the opposite effect of sapric histosols on dom properties compared to other peat soils could be different land use fibric and dystric histosols are not used for agriculture in estonia yet sapric histosols are kõlli et al 2009 our results showed that sapric histosols had a similar effect on dom properties than some agricultural soils e g brown soils in addition sapric histosols are part of heterogeneous catchments in our study sites even if being the dominating soil type and runoff from these soils can interact with mineral soils this most likely causes the decrease in dom aromaticity and molecular weight because of the substantial and selective absorption of hydrophobic dom while passing through mineral soils kaiser and zech 1998 if bogs and fibric histosols dominate in the catchment in our study sites the catchment soil cover is quite homogeneous with low percentage of mineral soils and runoff probably does not interact with mineral soils before reaching the lake dominance of non humic over humic substances and autochthonous over allochthonous dom in lakes corresponded most strongly to calcareous catchments higher percentages of gleyic rendzinas thin soils on calcareous rock and higher percentages of land cover types open space areas with little or no vegetation and other other land cover types together in estonia gleyic rendzinas are common on land cover other than forest arable land or grassland kõlli et al 2009 i e land cover types open space and other used in our study both belong to this category all the studied lakes with calcareous catchment are light coloured eutrophic lakes and our results indicated a greater contribution of internally produced dom in these types of lakes the role of catchment characteristics in determining dom properties was not so clear in eutrophic lakes because the contribution of autochthonous dom is determined by the trophic status of a lake williamson et al 1999 increased nutrient loads from the catchment may increase the in lake production of dom and the relative importance of autochthonous over allochthonous dom tranvik et al 2009 in these lakes catchment characteristics have an indirect effect on dom properties 5 conclusions the results of our study showed that catchment characteristics had a stronger effect on dom properties than on doc concentrations explaining up to 66 7 of the variability in spectral parameters in nutrient poor clear and dark water lakes dom was represented predominantly by humic substances originated from the catchment whereas in light coloured eutrophic lakes internally produced non humic substances had a greater contribution catchment characteristics land cover soil and catchment hydrology and geology had substantial effects on dom especially in acidotrophic dystrophic semidystrophic and mixotrophic lakes we can conclude that larger catchments and intensive water exchange resulted in higher levels of dom in lakes and soil variables had in general a greater effect than land cover soil types provide more detailed information about organic carbon in the catchment and therefore are better predictors of dom loading than general land cover types our study confirmed the role of peatlands as a major source of dom to lakes however agricultural lands with albeluvisols and coniferous forests with podzols and gleyic podzols were also important dom sources in eutrophic lakes with relatively high share of autochthonous dom catchment characteristics had an indirect and less clear impact on dom patterns in dom quantity and quality found in our study were similar to patterns found in temperate lakes in general our study sites do not represent all temperate catchments especially regarding hydrological conditions e g estonian mean annual precipitation is lower than in several western european countries and soil variables e g the mean soc content of estonian soils is higher than in most european countries however our results could still be expanded with some caution to other catchments and have important implications for understanding catchment lake interactions across the temperate

6708,as a boundary condition the lower bound is a prerequisite for constructing the budyko framework however the traditional lower bound i e the horizontal axis is an analytical boundary without considering realistic conditions in fact under real word condition the lower bound of budyko curves representing the maximum value of water yield should be located above the horizontal axis due to complicated constraints from basin characteristics especially the precipitation seasonality a key driver of runoff yield and a dominant factor in constructing budyko framework thus this study focused on exploring the reasonable location of the lower bound by adequately analyzing potential influence of precipitation seasonality to do that multiple hydrological simulations in basins under different climate and topography conditions were developed based on various precipitation scenarios constructed by using markov chain with full range of precipitation seasonality to fully understand the influence from precipitation seasonality on the lower bound the water energy supply and the basin characteristics were fixed by aridity index and hydrological model parameters respectively the results reveal a positive correlation between runoff coefficient and precipitation seasonality with an obvious higher location above the horizontal axis indicating the horizontal axis is imprecise to describe the upper bound of runoff yield under real word condition furthermore a potential location of the lower bound above the horizontal axis in budyko space was found based on runoff yield mechanism under real basin condition representing a more appropriate boundary condition of budyko framework 1 introduction in the long term mean annual water balance at the water basin scale the hydrological cycle and energy balance together control the partitioning of mean annual precipitation p into evaporation e and runoff r budyko 1958 1974 proposed a relation between mean annual evaporation ratio e p and mean annual climate aridity index pet climatologic potential evaporation p to describe the coupled water energy balance over the long term on the basis of observations from around the world budyko 1958 1974 postulated that the e p is dominantly controlled by the pet p further many subsequently derived formulations of the budyko hypothesis have been developed for quantifying the relation between e p and pet p e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 milly and dunne 2002 yang et al 2008 gerrits et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 among these functional forms besides the pet p the effects of other catchment and climate characteristics have been discussed to explain the observed deviation from the budyko curve on the mean annual water balance e g precipitation seasonality hickel and zhang 2006

variables information the budyko framework can gain more effective assessment of the interplay between climate basins characteristics and the hydrologic cycle donohue et al 2007 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 generally the budyko framework serves as a powerful tool to assess changes in catchment water balance as a function of climate and watershed characteristics e g donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 shao et al 2012 wang et al 2013 greve et al 2014 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 singh and kumar 2015 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 as a series of the simple first order theoretical equations to describe the water and energy balance the budyko framework has two physical limiting conditions called the water supply limiting condition and the energy demand limiting condition in a basin under arid condition p pet e is limited by water supply while under humid conditions p pet energy is the limiting factor zhang et al 2004 roderick and farquhar 2011 liu and mcvicar 2012 liang et al 2015 fang et al 2016 traditionally confined to the physical limiting conditions and the horizontal axis the budyko space is the solution space of mean annual water energy balance represented by a set of budyko curves based on the budyko space budyko curves provide an useful tool to estimate the influence of climate change on water balance chen et al 2013 or quantify the impact of climate variability and human activities on streamflow wang et al 2016 however unlike the two physical limiting conditions the traditional infimum of the budyko curve represented by the horizontal axis is an analytical boundary condition without considering the real basin conditions from the hydrological perspective as the meaning of the lower bound in budyko space is the upper bound of runoff coefficient r p minimum value of e p the horizontal axis represents a complete transformation from precipitation to runoff without any evapotranspiration that case is however obviously impractical if considering the runoff yield situation under real basin condition since the lower bound is a prerequisite for constructing the budyko space it is necessary to find an appropriate lower bound in budyko framework located above the horizontal axis with considering the real basin and climate conditions recently some researches did indeed find that under real world conditions the range of most budyko curves is smaller than theoretical one choudhury 1999 roderick and farquhar 2011 indicating the infimum of the budyko curve is not necessarily zero but could be larger e g greve et al 2015 moreover some budyko type equations have been derived with another lower bound called the empirical lower bound based on the observation and hydrological hypothesis i e proportionality hypothesis in soil conservation service scs curve number model to describe the real runoff yield situations at mean annual scale zhang et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 given that the previous researches reflected the lower bound of budyko curves should be located above the horizontal axis under the real basin and climate conditions to better measure the changes in water availability caused by climate and landscape altering through the budyko framework the investigation of the lower bound with considering realistic basin condition in budyko space is urgent however systematic investigation on the lower bound in budyko framework is scare and the combination of previous finding was not conclusive since the interactions between local condition and the hydrologic cycle are complicated many environmental factors can affect the mean water balance and thus influence the lower bound in budyko space among these factors the effects of precipitation on the water balance have been studied and numerous researches in the literature indicated precipitation is the key driver of water yield e g thornthwaite 1948 turc 1954 sankarasubramaniam et al 2001 fu et al 2007 chiew et al 2009 bao et al 2012 liu et al 2013 she et al 2015 precipitation in itself is a complex climate factor in assessing continental water availability due that the influence from precipitation on water balance can be associated with the overall magnitude seasonal distribution and interannual variability of precipitation among the precipitation characteristics the precipitation seasonality is an excellent indicator for investigating the impacts of precipitation on water cycle due that the influences from magnitude duration or other characteristics of precipitation on water cycle systems can be directly or indirectly reflected by seasonal pattern of precipitation feng et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 furthermore precipitation seasonality is a dominant factor in budyko framework for assessing the long mean term water balance milly 1994 feng et al 2012 for example precipitation seasonality has been found to play a significant role in determining the budyko functional forms potter and zhang 2009 and affect the inter annual variability of hydrologic responses donohue et al 2012 meanwhile the monthly distribution of precipitation has been found to have significant effects on watershed classifications coopersmith et al 2012 gitau 2016 and potter et al 2005 investigated the effect of the seasonal distribution of water and energy and found that evaporation ratio was significantly related to precipitation seasonality and soil moisture since the precipitation seasonality can serve as an important factor of environmental impacts on water and energy balance understanding of the potential influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound can help to investigate the reasonability of boundary condition in budyko space and thus improve the accuracy of simulation of water cycle process at mean annual water balance therefore in this study we attempted to investigate the lower bound directly in budyko framework from the hydrological perspective based on observations and simulated scenarios the scenarios were constructed to extend the observed precipitation seasonality for fully understanding the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality to isolate patterns stemming from precipitation seasonality from other factors for given basins with different climate and topography characteristics the energy water supply and the basin characteristics were fixed by aridity index and model parameters respectively as a starting point for analyzing the potential influence from precipitation seasonality on lower bound in budyko space in each selected basins at the same mean annual aridity index more than 10 000 multiple hydrological simulations were conducted based on various precipitation scenarios to simulate runoff through the xinanjiang model with a series of basin characteristic parameters wherein the precipitation scenarios were constructed with full range of precipitation seasonality developed by using markov chain on the basis of the 55 year historical daily precipitation from mopex data availability we explored the response of precipitation seasonality to the lower bound and tested whether the different lower bounds derived from previous studies is appropriate for the realistic basins characteristics in budyko framework meanwhile a potential lower bound locating above the horizontal axis was identified from hydrological perspective 2 methodology 2 1 data sources the study basins were obtained from the international model parameter estimation experiment mopex data set duan et al 2006 the data set provides high quality controlled daily precipitation runoff and climatologic potential evaporation data during 1948 2003 due to its reliability and completeness of the data set the mopex data set has been utilized for assessing the impact of climate variability on catchment water balance berghuijs et al 2014 greve et al 2015 koppa and gebremichael 2017 in this paper basins for which there are no missing data for any single day during the period of 1948 2003 were selected for analysis meanwhile the influence from snow water equivalent swe has been taken into consideration we used the swe data set obtained from the european space agency esa data user element due globsnow swe product set version 2 0 luojus et al 2010 this data provides information concerning the areal extent of swe for the northern hemisphere based on the combination of satellite based microwave radiometer and ground based weather station data swe is a component of the streamflow within catchments with high snowfall and it is an interference factor in assessment of rain runoff system thus to highlight the influences from precipitation seasonality in this study the basins from mopex data set with relative lower swe were selected fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the selected mopex watersheds in addition the köppen geiger climate classification were also used as the reference in this study wherein the köppen geiger climate classification was developed based on the empirical relationship between temperature and precipitation observations for 1951 2000 on a regular 0 5 degree latitude longitude grid rubel and kottek 2010 based on köppen geiger climate classification basins were separated into three main precipitation types the climate zone i summer dry ii steppe and iii fully humid see fig 1 because of the thermal properties differences between atlantic and the rocky mountains basins in classification i have a relatively high si the mediterranean climate compared with those in classification iiand iii berghuijs et al 2014 therefore in this study for the sake of further discussion basins in classification ⅱ iii and basins in classification i were analyzed respectively 4 basins in climate zone i and 22 basins in climate zone ⅱ iii moreover besides a general analysis of observations from selected basins in the mopex data set the detailed investigation based on multiple hydrological simulations of 26 mopex basins with low human interferences was carried out with considering various climate and topography conditions to further analyze the potential influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in budyko framework 2 2 the lower bound of budyko curves the budyko framework is an effective equation to investigate the interactions of climate variables in long term water balance fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 chen et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the variability of budyko curves are used to incorporate the effect of other catchment characteristics on long term water balance potter and zhang 2009 donohue et al 2012 li et al 2013 greve et al 2015 wang and fu 2018 while the upper limit of budyko curves is determined by the water and energy supply the lower limit represented by the horizontal axis is a mathematical boundary condition i e e p 0 according to fu 1981 and choudhury 1999 without considering the real basin characteristics resulting in an imprecise analysis when assessing the upper bound of runoff yield based on budyko framework under real word condition recently observations from other research showed that the lower limit should locate above the horizontal axis zhang et al 2004 furthermore a budyko equation derived from the proportionality hypothesis of the scs model e g wang and tang 2014 did indeed find an empirical lower limit located above the horizontal axis see fig 2 indicating a pressing need for the analysis of the appropriate lower bound in budyko space technically the lower limit of budyko curve is an idealized special curve to describe the upper bound of r p for a given pet p for given catchment characteristics e g land cover soil and topography annual e p is dependent on the temporal variability of precipitation including seasonal distribution intensity and duration of precipitation and inter storm period l vovich 1979 zhao 1992 wood et al 1992 liang et al 1994 in budyko framework fig 2 shows the shape of original nonparametric curves indicating that e p is steadily increasing with aridity index which means the shape of the lower bound in budyko framework should increase with aridity index under real world condition 2 3 precipitation seasonality index the study of precipitation seasonality was carried out to identify the pattern of seasonal distribution of precipitation to quantify precipitation seasonality fully the seasonality index si walsh and lawler 1981 is of special interest for measuring the precipitation seasonality due that it provides a measure of the spread of the monthly precipitation with respect to an ideal uniform monthly distribution in all 12 months celleri et al 2007 meanwhile the si can help to assess the intra annual variability of precipitation distribution hu et al 2003 rivington et al 2007 beck et al 2013 thus it was selected to quantify the precipitation seasonality the si is expressed as 1 si i 1 p i j 1 12 p ij p i 12 where pi is annual precipitation for year i and pij is monthly precipitation for month j in year i si is zero when annual precipitation was uniformly distributed within a year the higher the departure from uniform conditions the higher the index value will be fig 3 2 4 daily precipitation simulation to sufficiently reveal the influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in this study the runoff yield situation was assessed under different precipitation seasonal scenarios in a full range of si for precisely simulating the runoff from different precipitation seasonality scenarios the daily precipitation process needs to be constructed firstly the occurrences of daily precipitation are seldom considered as an independent random event results of daily precipitation time series at a station always reveal a tendency for wet days and dry days to cluster and to form respective sequences chin 1977 this daily tendency can be perfectly described by a markov chain model gabriel and neumann 1962 roldan and woolhiser 1982 kaptué et al 2015 a first order markov chain model has been successfully used to model daily precipitation state gregory et al 1993 vrugt et al 2008 kaptué et al 2015 sansom et al 2017 a second order two state model may also be used however in many case it performs no better than the simpler first order model and requires estimation of more parameter apipattanavis et al 2007 thus a two step process was used here to simulate daily precipitation where i the occurrence of wet day follow a first order markov chain a wet day is a day with a total precipitation depth 0 1 mm d and ii the daily precipitation depth follow a gamma distribution thom 1958 wilks 2011 kaptué et al 2015 in the process the occurrence of precipitation in simulation depends on precipitation in the previous period and the likelihood that wet dry condition will persist or transition gabriel and neumann 1962 a first order markov model is fully determined by two precipitation transition probabilities the transition probability of a wet day to a wet day pww and the transition probability of a dry day to a wet day pdw we separately estimate precipitation transition probabilities by computing the conditional relative frequencies for each 12 calendar month based on mopex daily precipitation data set according to the transition probabilities the occurrence of precipitation xn n 0 1 2 can be synthetically generated by a sequence of random number un sampled from the uniform distribution in the interval 0 1 for example if xn 1 was wet day and un pww or if xn 1 was dry day and un pdw then set xn wet day set xn day day otherwise based on the first order markov chain and the gamma distribution the daily precipitation now can be simulated the scenarios were used to extend the possible precipitation seasonality under different topography conditions for fully understanding the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality in this study we simulated more than 10 000 times of daily precipitation processes for each basin in the full range of the si scenarios from 0 to 1 83 for each si scenarios we strictly kept the simulated annual precipitation depth equal to the mean annual precipitation depth in order to highlight the influence from precipitation seasonality the tendency in markov chain and the parameters in gamma distribution were calculated from the 55 year historical daily precipitation data 2 5 xinanjiang model the xinanjiang xaj hydrological model is a conceptual hydrological model developed by zhao 1992 it has been applied extensively for runoff simulation and water resources planning in humid and semi humid regions of china and many countries li and lu 2014 si et al 2015 applications of the model have included design flood estimation water project programming and water availability estimation zhao 1992 a main feature of the xaj model is the concept of runoff formation on repletion of storage which means that runoff is not produced until the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches the field capacity and thereafter runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss zhao 1992 based on this characteristic feature the xaj model implements the concept of a storage capacity curve in the computation of total runoff to accommodate nonuniformity of the runoff distributions resulted from the heterogeneous structure of the soil moisture deficit further the total determined runoff is separated into three components surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater the details of xaj model are refereed to si et al 2015 the model parameters were calibrated using historical daily data and the genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm is a search procedure based on the mechanism of natural selection and natural genetics which construct an artificial survival of the fittest with genetic operators abstracted from nature holland 1975 it has been broadly applied to calibrate conceptual rainfall runoff models e g smalley et al 2000 karpouzos et al 2001 kishtawal et al 2003 yan and minsker 2006 for every generation in the genetic algorithm the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns yapo et al 1996 was used as a performance metrics to select the best fit parameters the equation of the nash sutcliffe efficiency is expressed as 2 n s 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where n is the number of days in runoff simulation the time step in this study is day qs and qo is the simulated and observed discharge respectively and q o is the mean value of observed discharge the parameters in xaj model represent rough catchment characteristics for each basin the function and corresponding meaning of parameters in every part of the model are shown in table 1 in this study for different basins with climate and topography characteristics we applied xaj model to simulate runoff from precipitation seasonality scenarios with a group of constant parameters calibrated based on precipitation and runoff data representing catchment characteristic 3 results and discussion 3 1 the responses of runoff coefficient to precipitation seasonality before analyzing the influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in budyko framework the relationship between si and r p need to be investigated first the mean values of si i where i 1 2 n n is the total number of years were calculated by using mopex daily precipitation data set for mopex basins fig 4 the mean annual si was used to assess the relationship between si and r p on long term scale as pointed out by sumner et al 2001 the use of the long term average monthly precipitation data to calculate the si value will cause a lower magnitude therefore in this study we calculated the mean annual si by averaging the values of annual si to eliminate this error fig 4 shows a rich spatial structure of the annual mean si that the si in climate zone iii with a relative low value in the eastern part of continent and high value in western part compared with other climate zones climate zone i has a relative high value of the si due to the mountain barriers of the coastal ranges the rocky mountains the spatial distribution of si indicate a importance for separately investigating the response of the lower bound to si in climate zone i and climate zone ⅱ iii to fully understand the influences from si on the lower bound under different climate and topography condition moreover the relationships between the mean annual si and r p under different aridity index pet p condition of mopex basins were shown in fig 5 the larger value of runoff coefficient mainly distributed in the regions with relative high si value under the same pet p condition and vice versa pet p is the first order control on r p i e r p increases with the decrease of pet p although the runoff ratio become lower along with the increasing si given pet p a relatively positive correlation can be found in runoff ratio from low to high si value this point is support by the result from potter et al 2005 further for given catchment characteristics annual runoff coefficient generally increases with the temporal concentration of precipitation annual runoff coefficient approaches to 1 i e budyko curve approaches the horizontal axis only when annual precipitation occurs in a very short time period e g an instantaneous precipitation event therefore to in depth study the response from r p to si change we simulated the r p from every precipitation seasonality scenarios si varies from 0 to 1 83 by using xaj model for each selected 26 basin the basins were selected by considering different aridity condition pet p varies from 0 39 to 2 30 and topographic condition plain mountain basin etc in xaj model for each basin the parameters in the xaj model with the ns above 0 5 were selected as the final choice the resulted correlations between si and r p in climate zone i ⅱ iii were visualized in figs 6 and 7 well fitted by positive side of the quadratic polynomial indicating that as expected the relationship between the runoff ratio and the si is monotonic increasing given the relationship between si and r p are positive with a strong correlation of simulated r p and si the range of si can be revealed in budyko space with the help of corresponding range of simulated r p and thus the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality can be visually indicated more specifically for a given basin the multiple hydrological simulations under different climate and topography conditions were constructed by using more than 10 000 daily precipitation simulations with full range of precipitation seasonality as an input of the xaj model to reveal directly the relationship of si and the lower bound in budyko space 3 2 the response of lower bound to precipitation seasonality in budyko space the series of simulated r p were indicated by the variability of e p to further explore the possible range of r p in the budyko space the corresponding simulated e p were separated into two kinds see figs 8 and 9 1 the e pf gray lines were simulated by the xaj model based on the precipitation seasonality scenarios in full range of si indicating a maximum range of e p under real basin conditions however this maximum range may not be feasible especially for the e p in extreme scenarios si 1 83 or 0 2 the e ph orange lines were simulated from the precipitation seasonality scenarios in historical range of si the historical range of si was simulated from interannual variation of si based on si value for each year reflecting the possible real ranges of e p under specific local condition the two lower limit including the horizontal axis and the empirical lower bound green line derived from early studies were also located in budyko space for every basins zhang et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 according to figs 8 and 9 under different continental climate and topography condition most values of the e pf were above the horizontal axis for every basins indicating that the precipitation will not completely transfer to the runoff even in the extreme seasonality scenarios the upper limit of si in other word this means the horizontal axis is not appropriate for the runoff yield situation under real world condition moreover the ranges of the e ph can represent the possible ranges of e p in budyko space under the specific basin steady state condition while in some basins the minimum values of the e ph were close or slight over to the empirical lower bound most values of e ph were above this boundary condition the point is supported by the results based on other watersheds data in previous studies e g roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 the parts of e ph under the empirical lower bound can be explained by the non linear relationship between si and r p in addition the ranges of the e ph values indicate that for a given basin the e p can only fluctuate in a certain range along with the historical changes in the si above the empirical lower bound in the budyko framework in terms of the results the responses of the lower bound to the precipitation seasonality indicate that the range of variability of budyko curves is less than the theoretical range with considering the real basin characteristics the budyko space with the horizontal axis as the lower bound is imprecise to describe the maximum runoff yield under real world condition meanwhile ranges of the e ph show that compared with the horizontal axis budyko space limited by the empirical lower bound may be more accurate to capture possible ranges of e p r p under real basin condition 3 3 potential location of the lower bound in the context of the previous studies given the horizontal axis is imprecise to capture the upper bound of the r p in real runoff yield situation it is important to find a more appropriate location of the lower bound in budyko space from hydrological perspective according to the runoff yield process while precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and runoff a portion of precipitation does not be the runoff immediately and transform into soil wetting due to the interception surface ponding and soil wetting sivapalan et al 2011 at the annual scale a part of the precipitation is only available for direct evaporation and not contributed to competition between runoff and evaporation wang and tang 2014 the point is supported by the results based on other watersheds data in previous studies e g roderick and farquhar 2011 in this study figs 8 and 9 show that most of the e pf values were lager than zero indicating that even in the extreme precipitation seasonality condition si 1 83 not all of the precipitation transform into runoff due to the water lost when direct runoff is generated such as precipitation interception by vegetation water storage in top soils and infiltration therefore the part of precipitation which is only available for direct evaporation may be the potential reason for the distance from the horizontal axis to the minimum value of e pf figs 8 and 9 have shown an interesting phenomenon about the distance from the horizontal axis to the minimum value of the e pf take one basin as an example fig 10 the δ 1 is the difference between the e pf value and the horizontal axis according to early discussion in the humid region with abundant water supply aridity index 1 the δ 1 is not contributed to competition between runoff and evaporation in basin under specific condition determined by catch characteristics e g land cover soil and topography due that the historical range of si values is computed from a long serial of historic precipitation data the e ph is reasonable to be the possible range of r p under real basin condition thus the range from the upper value of e ph to the difference value between the minimum values of the e ph and the δ 1 may be the maximum possible range of the budyko curves for given basin under real world condition with all precipitation contribute to the competition between runoff and evaporation in other words the low value of this maximum possible range should close to the lower bound of budyko curves for a given a specific basin therefore a potential location of the lower bound in budyko framework can subsequently be determined it is important to note that compared with the energy demand limited basins aridity index 1 the difference values in the water supply limited basins aridity index 1 will involve a part of energy demand and located lower than the infimum of budyko curves due to the lack of water supply compared with the energy demand thus the difference values between the minimum values of the e ph and the δ 1 in humid basins were used to identify the potential location of the lower bound in budyko space we calculated these differences in 26 basins in climate zone i ⅱ iii and plotted them in fig 11 result shows that both the potential lower bounds fitted by fu s equation and wang tang s equation were overlapped to the empirical lower boundary derived from runoff yield mechanism confirming the reasonability of the potential lower bound and the empirical lower bound as the boundary condition in budyko space from both multiple hydrological simulations and hydrological runoff yield theory under real basin condition 3 4 the variability of precipitation seasonality as mentioned in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the potential lower bound under the specific basin condition in budyko space is related to the range of e ph controlled by historical range of si to further evaluate the reasonability of the potential lower bound it is important to analyze the variability of si in this study we calculated the historical variability of si represented by coefficient of variation cv under different basins characteristics see fig 12 according to fig 10 although the cv of historical si were large in humid basin aridity index 1 the values of si were small in humid regions see fig 5 in dry basin aridity index 1 the values of cv were less than 0 23 and decrease to 0 12 with the increasing of aridity index therefore the variability of si spans a narrow range in both humid and dry basins further given the potential lower bound is overlapped with the empirical lower bound to better understand the reasonability of the potential lower bound in this study we evaluated the ranges of the critical si compared with the historical si at mean annual scale based on the empirical lower bound see fig 13 the critical si represents the group of si corresponds to the precipitation seasonality scenarios when the simulated e p were on the empirical lower bound in budyko space at the mean annual scale while the values of si increase along with the increasing aridity index the mean values of the critical si were farther above the mean annual si for each basins in climate zone i ii and iii the results confirm that for a given basin under the real world condition the e p can entirely be constrained by the empirical lower bound in budyko space indicating that the potential lower bound and the empirical lower bound are reasonable to be a boundary condition in budyko space from observation data 4 summary and conclusions in this paper an investigation of the influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in budyko space was constructed to reveal the reasonability of previous boundary condition the horizontal axis and the empirical lower bound and analyze the appropriate location of the lower bound the si was chosen as an indicator to represent the precipitation seasonality for a given basin multiple hydrological simulations were conducted based on various precipitation scenarios developed by using the first order markov chain and gamma distribution with full range of precipitation seasonality index to investigate the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality the xaj model was selected to simulate the runoff from different precipitation seasonality scenarios with a series of basin characteristic parameters results indicated that r p e p has a positive correlation with the si under both dry and humid climatic conditions moreover further analysis of e pf in budyko space revealed under real local condition the lower bound of budyko curves should be above the horizontal axis even in the extreme precipitation seasonality scenarios the precipitation does not totally transform into runoff indicating that as boundary condition in budyko space the horizontal axis is imprecise to describe the lower bound of e p under real world condition in the historical range of si the empirical lower bound in budyko space can precisely constrain the ranges of e p under real local condition this means that compared with the horizontal axis the empirical lower bound serves as the boundary condition of budyko curves can provide a more accurate solution space in addition by analyzing the runoff yield situation under different precipitation seasonality scenarios potential location of the infimum in budyko space were found to be overlapped with the empirical lower bound indicating under real word condition the lower bound of budyko curves is located above the horizontal axis around the empirical lower bound furthermore a narrow change of si revealed in the study confirms the range of budyko curve under local condition is smaller than that in the theoretical condition the potential lower bound around the empirical lower bound in budyko space is thus reasonable to describe the upper bound of runoff yield under real world condition declaration of interests none declared acknowledgments this work was

6708,as a boundary condition the lower bound is a prerequisite for constructing the budyko framework however the traditional lower bound i e the horizontal axis is an analytical boundary without considering realistic conditions in fact under real word condition the lower bound of budyko curves representing the maximum value of water yield should be located above the horizontal axis due to complicated constraints from basin characteristics especially the precipitation seasonality a key driver of runoff yield and a dominant factor in constructing budyko framework thus this study focused on exploring the reasonable location of the lower bound by adequately analyzing potential influence of precipitation seasonality to do that multiple hydrological simulations in basins under different climate and topography conditions were developed based on various precipitation scenarios constructed by using markov chain with full range of precipitation seasonality to fully understand the influence from precipitation seasonality on the lower bound the water energy supply and the basin characteristics were fixed by aridity index and hydrological model parameters respectively the results reveal a positive correlation between runoff coefficient and precipitation seasonality with an obvious higher location above the horizontal axis indicating the horizontal axis is imprecise to describe the upper bound of runoff yield under real word condition furthermore a potential location of the lower bound above the horizontal axis in budyko space was found based on runoff yield mechanism under real basin condition representing a more appropriate boundary condition of budyko framework 1 introduction in the long term mean annual water balance at the water basin scale the hydrological cycle and energy balance together control the partitioning of mean annual precipitation p into evaporation e and runoff r budyko 1958 1974 proposed a relation between mean annual evaporation ratio e p and mean annual climate aridity index pet climatologic potential evaporation p to describe the coupled water energy balance over the long term on the basis of observations from around the world budyko 1958 1974 postulated that the e p is dominantly controlled by the pet p further many subsequently derived formulations of the budyko hypothesis have been developed for quantifying the relation between e p and pet p e g fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 milly and dunne 2002 yang et al 2008 gerrits et al 2009 wang and tang 2014 among these functional forms besides the pet p the effects of other catchment and climate characteristics have been discussed to explain the observed deviation from the budyko curve on the mean annual water balance e g precipitation seasonality hickel and zhang 2006 potter and zhang 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 soil type and geologic substrate yang et al 2006 donohue et al 2012 topography mcvicar et al 2007 shao et al 2012 xu et al 2013 vegetation functioning zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2007 2010 brümmer et al 2012 li et al 2013 and soil water storage capacity wang and alimohammadi 2012 chen et al 2013 involved these controlling variables information the budyko framework can gain more effective assessment of the interplay between climate basins characteristics and the hydrologic cycle donohue et al 2007 wang and hejazi 2011 xing et al 2018 generally the budyko framework serves as a powerful tool to assess changes in catchment water balance as a function of climate and watershed characteristics e g donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 shao et al 2012 wang et al 2013 greve et al 2014 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 singh and kumar 2015 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 as a series of the simple first order theoretical equations to describe the water and energy balance the budyko framework has two physical limiting conditions called the water supply limiting condition and the energy demand limiting condition in a basin under arid condition p pet e is limited by water supply while under humid conditions p pet energy is the limiting factor zhang et al 2004 roderick and farquhar 2011 liu and mcvicar 2012 liang et al 2015 fang et al 2016 traditionally confined to the physical limiting conditions and the horizontal axis the budyko space is the solution space of mean annual water energy balance represented by a set of budyko curves based on the budyko space budyko curves provide an useful tool to estimate the influence of climate change on water balance chen et al 2013 or quantify the impact of climate variability and human activities on streamflow wang et al 2016 however unlike the two physical limiting conditions the traditional infimum of the budyko curve represented by the horizontal axis is an analytical boundary condition without considering the real basin conditions from the hydrological perspective as the meaning of the lower bound in budyko space is the upper bound of runoff coefficient r p minimum value of e p the horizontal axis represents a complete transformation from precipitation to runoff without any evapotranspiration that case is however obviously impractical if considering the runoff yield situation under real basin condition since the lower bound is a prerequisite for constructing the budyko space it is necessary to find an appropriate lower bound in budyko framework located above the horizontal axis with considering the real basin and climate conditions recently some researches did indeed find that under real world conditions the range of most budyko curves is smaller than theoretical one choudhury 1999 roderick and farquhar 2011 indicating the infimum of the budyko curve is not necessarily zero but could be larger e g greve et al 2015 moreover some budyko type equations have been derived with another lower bound called the empirical lower bound based on the observation and hydrological hypothesis i e proportionality hypothesis in soil conservation service scs curve number model to describe the real runoff yield situations at mean annual scale zhang et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 given that the previous researches reflected the lower bound of budyko curves should be located above the horizontal axis under the real basin and climate conditions to better measure the changes in water availability caused by climate and landscape altering through the budyko framework the investigation of the lower bound with considering realistic basin condition in budyko space is urgent however systematic investigation on the lower bound in budyko framework is scare and the combination of previous finding was not conclusive since the interactions between local condition and the hydrologic cycle are complicated many environmental factors can affect the mean water balance and thus influence the lower bound in budyko space among these factors the effects of precipitation on the water balance have been studied and numerous researches in the literature indicated precipitation is the key driver of water yield e g thornthwaite 1948 turc 1954 sankarasubramaniam et al 2001 fu et al 2007 chiew et al 2009 bao et al 2012 liu et al 2013 she et al 2015 precipitation in itself is a complex climate factor in assessing continental water availability due that the influence from precipitation on water balance can be associated with the overall magnitude seasonal distribution and interannual variability of precipitation among the precipitation characteristics the precipitation seasonality is an excellent indicator for investigating the impacts of precipitation on water cycle due that the influences from magnitude duration or other characteristics of precipitation on water cycle systems can be directly or indirectly reflected by seasonal pattern of precipitation feng et al 2013 berghuijs et al 2014 furthermore precipitation seasonality is a dominant factor in budyko framework for assessing the long mean term water balance milly 1994 feng et al 2012 for example precipitation seasonality has been found to play a significant role in determining the budyko functional forms potter and zhang 2009 and affect the inter annual variability of hydrologic responses donohue et al 2012 meanwhile the monthly distribution of precipitation has been found to have significant effects on watershed classifications coopersmith et al 2012 gitau 2016 and potter et al 2005 investigated the effect of the seasonal distribution of water and energy and found that evaporation ratio was significantly related to precipitation seasonality and soil moisture since the precipitation seasonality can serve as an important factor of environmental impacts on water and energy balance understanding of the potential influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound can help to investigate the reasonability of boundary condition in budyko space and thus improve the accuracy of simulation of water cycle process at mean annual water balance therefore in this study we attempted to investigate the lower bound directly in budyko framework from the hydrological perspective based on observations and simulated scenarios the scenarios were constructed to extend the observed precipitation seasonality for fully understanding the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality to isolate patterns stemming from precipitation seasonality from other factors for given basins with different climate and topography characteristics the energy water supply and the basin characteristics were fixed by aridity index and model parameters respectively as a starting point for analyzing the potential influence from precipitation seasonality on lower bound in budyko space in each selected basins at the same mean annual aridity index more than 10 000 multiple hydrological simulations were conducted based on various precipitation scenarios to simulate runoff through the xinanjiang model with a series of basin characteristic parameters wherein the precipitation scenarios were constructed with full range of precipitation seasonality developed by using markov chain on the basis of the 55 year historical daily precipitation from mopex data availability we explored the response of precipitation seasonality to the lower bound and tested whether the different lower bounds derived from previous studies is appropriate for the realistic basins characteristics in budyko framework meanwhile a potential lower bound locating above the horizontal axis was identified from hydrological perspective 2 methodology 2 1 data sources the study basins were obtained from the international model parameter estimation experiment mopex data set duan et al 2006 the data set provides high quality controlled daily precipitation runoff and climatologic potential evaporation data during 1948 2003 due to its reliability and completeness of the data set the mopex data set has been utilized for assessing the impact of climate variability on catchment water balance berghuijs et al 2014 greve et al 2015 koppa and gebremichael 2017 in this paper basins for which there are no missing data for any single day during the period of 1948 2003 were selected for analysis meanwhile the influence from snow water equivalent swe has been taken into consideration we used the swe data set obtained from the european space agency esa data user element due globsnow swe product set version 2 0 luojus et al 2010 this data provides information concerning the areal extent of swe for the northern hemisphere based on the combination of satellite based microwave radiometer and ground based weather station data swe is a component of the streamflow within catchments with high snowfall and it is an interference factor in assessment of rain runoff system thus to highlight the influences from precipitation seasonality in this study the basins from mopex data set with relative lower swe were selected fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the selected mopex watersheds in addition the köppen geiger climate classification were also used as the reference in this study wherein the köppen geiger climate classification was developed based on the empirical relationship between temperature and precipitation observations for 1951 2000 on a regular 0 5 degree latitude longitude grid rubel and kottek 2010 based on köppen geiger climate classification basins were separated into three main precipitation types the climate zone i summer dry ii steppe and iii fully humid see fig 1 because of the thermal properties differences between atlantic and the rocky mountains basins in classification i have a relatively high si the mediterranean climate compared with those in classification iiand iii berghuijs et al 2014 therefore in this study for the sake of further discussion basins in classification ⅱ iii and basins in classification i were analyzed respectively 4 basins in climate zone i and 22 basins in climate zone ⅱ iii moreover besides a general analysis of observations from selected basins in the mopex data set the detailed investigation based on multiple hydrological simulations of 26 mopex basins with low human interferences was carried out with considering various climate and topography conditions to further analyze the potential influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in budyko framework 2 2 the lower bound of budyko curves the budyko framework is an effective equation to investigate the interactions of climate variables in long term water balance fu 1981 choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 donohue et al 2010 roderick and farquhar 2011 chen et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the variability of budyko curves are used to incorporate the effect of other catchment characteristics on long term water balance potter and zhang 2009 donohue et al 2012 li et al 2013 greve et al 2015 wang and fu 2018 while the upper limit of budyko curves is determined by the water and energy supply the lower limit represented by the horizontal axis is a mathematical boundary condition i e e p 0 according to fu 1981 and choudhury 1999 without considering the real basin characteristics resulting in an imprecise analysis when assessing the upper bound of runoff yield based on budyko framework under real word condition recently observations from other research showed that the lower limit should locate above the horizontal axis zhang et al 2004 furthermore a budyko equation derived from the proportionality hypothesis of the scs model e g wang and tang 2014 did indeed find an empirical lower limit located above the horizontal axis see fig 2 indicating a pressing need for the analysis of the appropriate lower bound in budyko space technically the lower limit of budyko curve is an idealized special curve to describe the upper bound of r p for a given pet p for given catchment characteristics e g land cover soil and topography annual e p is dependent on the temporal variability of precipitation including seasonal distribution intensity and duration of precipitation and inter storm period l vovich 1979 zhao 1992 wood et al 1992 liang et al 1994 in budyko framework fig 2 shows the shape of original nonparametric curves indicating that e p is steadily increasing with aridity index which means the shape of the lower bound in budyko framework should increase with aridity index under real world condition 2 3 precipitation seasonality index the study of precipitation seasonality was carried out to identify the pattern of seasonal distribution of precipitation to quantify precipitation seasonality fully the seasonality index si walsh and lawler 1981 is of special interest for measuring the precipitation seasonality due that it provides a measure of the spread of the monthly precipitation with respect to an ideal uniform monthly distribution in all 12 months celleri et al 2007 meanwhile the si can help to assess the intra annual variability of precipitation distribution hu et al 2003 rivington et al 2007 beck et al 2013 thus it was selected to quantify the precipitation seasonality the si is expressed as 1 si i 1 p i j 1 12 p ij p i 12 where pi is annual precipitation for year i and pij is monthly precipitation for month j in year i si is zero when annual precipitation was uniformly distributed within a year the higher the departure from uniform conditions the higher the index value will be fig 3 2 4 daily precipitation simulation to sufficiently reveal the influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in this study the runoff yield situation was assessed under different precipitation seasonal scenarios in a full range of si for precisely simulating the runoff from different precipitation seasonality scenarios the daily precipitation process needs to be constructed firstly the occurrences of daily precipitation are seldom considered as an independent random event results of daily precipitation time series at a station always reveal a tendency for wet days and dry days to cluster and to form respective sequences chin 1977 this daily tendency can be perfectly described by a markov chain model gabriel and neumann 1962 roldan and woolhiser 1982 kaptué et al 2015 a first order markov chain model has been successfully used to model daily precipitation state gregory et al 1993 vrugt et al 2008 kaptué et al 2015 sansom et al 2017 a second order two state model may also be used however in many case it performs no better than the simpler first order model and requires estimation of more parameter apipattanavis et al 2007 thus a two step process was used here to simulate daily precipitation where i the occurrence of wet day follow a first order markov chain a wet day is a day with a total precipitation depth 0 1 mm d and ii the daily precipitation depth follow a gamma distribution thom 1958 wilks 2011 kaptué et al 2015 in the process the occurrence of precipitation in simulation depends on precipitation in the previous period and the likelihood that wet dry condition will persist or transition gabriel and neumann 1962 a first order markov model is fully determined by two precipitation transition probabilities the transition probability of a wet day to a wet day pww and the transition probability of a dry day to a wet day pdw we separately estimate precipitation transition probabilities by computing the conditional relative frequencies for each 12 calendar month based on mopex daily precipitation data set according to the transition probabilities the occurrence of precipitation xn n 0 1 2 can be synthetically generated by a sequence of random number un sampled from the uniform distribution in the interval 0 1 for example if xn 1 was wet day and un pww or if xn 1 was dry day and un pdw then set xn wet day set xn day day otherwise based on the first order markov chain and the gamma distribution the daily precipitation now can be simulated the scenarios were used to extend the possible precipitation seasonality under different topography conditions for fully understanding the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality in this study we simulated more than 10 000 times of daily precipitation processes for each basin in the full range of the si scenarios from 0 to 1 83 for each si scenarios we strictly kept the simulated annual precipitation depth equal to the mean annual precipitation depth in order to highlight the influence from precipitation seasonality the tendency in markov chain and the parameters in gamma distribution were calculated from the 55 year historical daily precipitation data 2 5 xinanjiang model the xinanjiang xaj hydrological model is a conceptual hydrological model developed by zhao 1992 it has been applied extensively for runoff simulation and water resources planning in humid and semi humid regions of china and many countries li and lu 2014 si et al 2015 applications of the model have included design flood estimation water project programming and water availability estimation zhao 1992 a main feature of the xaj model is the concept of runoff formation on repletion of storage which means that runoff is not produced until the soil moisture content of the aeration zone reaches the field capacity and thereafter runoff equals the rainfall excess without further loss zhao 1992 based on this characteristic feature the xaj model implements the concept of a storage capacity curve in the computation of total runoff to accommodate nonuniformity of the runoff distributions resulted from the heterogeneous structure of the soil moisture deficit further the total determined runoff is separated into three components surface flow subsurface flow and groundwater the details of xaj model are refereed to si et al 2015 the model parameters were calibrated using historical daily data and the genetic algorithm the genetic algorithm is a search procedure based on the mechanism of natural selection and natural genetics which construct an artificial survival of the fittest with genetic operators abstracted from nature holland 1975 it has been broadly applied to calibrate conceptual rainfall runoff models e g smalley et al 2000 karpouzos et al 2001 kishtawal et al 2003 yan and minsker 2006 for every generation in the genetic algorithm the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns yapo et al 1996 was used as a performance metrics to select the best fit parameters the equation of the nash sutcliffe efficiency is expressed as 2 n s 1 i 1 n q s i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where n is the number of days in runoff simulation the time step in this study is day qs and qo is the simulated and observed discharge respectively and q o is the mean value of observed discharge the parameters in xaj model represent rough catchment characteristics for each basin the function and corresponding meaning of parameters in every part of the model are shown in table 1 in this study for different basins with climate and topography characteristics we applied xaj model to simulate runoff from precipitation seasonality scenarios with a group of constant parameters calibrated based on precipitation and runoff data representing catchment characteristic 3 results and discussion 3 1 the responses of runoff coefficient to precipitation seasonality before analyzing the influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in budyko framework the relationship between si and r p need to be investigated first the mean values of si i where i 1 2 n n is the total number of years were calculated by using mopex daily precipitation data set for mopex basins fig 4 the mean annual si was used to assess the relationship between si and r p on long term scale as pointed out by sumner et al 2001 the use of the long term average monthly precipitation data to calculate the si value will cause a lower magnitude therefore in this study we calculated the mean annual si by averaging the values of annual si to eliminate this error fig 4 shows a rich spatial structure of the annual mean si that the si in climate zone iii with a relative low value in the eastern part of continent and high value in western part compared with other climate zones climate zone i has a relative high value of the si due to the mountain barriers of the coastal ranges the rocky mountains the spatial distribution of si indicate a importance for separately investigating the response of the lower bound to si in climate zone i and climate zone ⅱ iii to fully understand the influences from si on the lower bound under different climate and topography condition moreover the relationships between the mean annual si and r p under different aridity index pet p condition of mopex basins were shown in fig 5 the larger value of runoff coefficient mainly distributed in the regions with relative high si value under the same pet p condition and vice versa pet p is the first order control on r p i e r p increases with the decrease of pet p although the runoff ratio become lower along with the increasing si given pet p a relatively positive correlation can be found in runoff ratio from low to high si value this point is support by the result from potter et al 2005 further for given catchment characteristics annual runoff coefficient generally increases with the temporal concentration of precipitation annual runoff coefficient approaches to 1 i e budyko curve approaches the horizontal axis only when annual precipitation occurs in a very short time period e g an instantaneous precipitation event therefore to in depth study the response from r p to si change we simulated the r p from every precipitation seasonality scenarios si varies from 0 to 1 83 by using xaj model for each selected 26 basin the basins were selected by considering different aridity condition pet p varies from 0 39 to 2 30 and topographic condition plain mountain basin etc in xaj model for each basin the parameters in the xaj model with the ns above 0 5 were selected as the final choice the resulted correlations between si and r p in climate zone i ⅱ iii were visualized in figs 6 and 7 well fitted by positive side of the quadratic polynomial indicating that as expected the relationship between the runoff ratio and the si is monotonic increasing given the relationship between si and r p are positive with a strong correlation of simulated r p and si the range of si can be revealed in budyko space with the help of corresponding range of simulated r p and thus the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality can be visually indicated more specifically for a given basin the multiple hydrological simulations under different climate and topography conditions were constructed by using more than 10 000 daily precipitation simulations with full range of precipitation seasonality as an input of the xaj model to reveal directly the relationship of si and the lower bound in budyko space 3 2 the response of lower bound to precipitation seasonality in budyko space the series of simulated r p were indicated by the variability of e p to further explore the possible range of r p in the budyko space the corresponding simulated e p were separated into two kinds see figs 8 and 9 1 the e pf gray lines were simulated by the xaj model based on the precipitation seasonality scenarios in full range of si indicating a maximum range of e p under real basin conditions however this maximum range may not be feasible especially for the e p in extreme scenarios si 1 83 or 0 2 the e ph orange lines were simulated from the precipitation seasonality scenarios in historical range of si the historical range of si was simulated from interannual variation of si based on si value for each year reflecting the possible real ranges of e p under specific local condition the two lower limit including the horizontal axis and the empirical lower bound green line derived from early studies were also located in budyko space for every basins zhang et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 according to figs 8 and 9 under different continental climate and topography condition most values of the e pf were above the horizontal axis for every basins indicating that the precipitation will not completely transfer to the runoff even in the extreme seasonality scenarios the upper limit of si in other word this means the horizontal axis is not appropriate for the runoff yield situation under real world condition moreover the ranges of the e ph can represent the possible ranges of e p in budyko space under the specific basin steady state condition while in some basins the minimum values of the e ph were close or slight over to the empirical lower bound most values of e ph were above this boundary condition the point is supported by the results based on other watersheds data in previous studies e g roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 the parts of e ph under the empirical lower bound can be explained by the non linear relationship between si and r p in addition the ranges of the e ph values indicate that for a given basin the e p can only fluctuate in a certain range along with the historical changes in the si above the empirical lower bound in the budyko framework in terms of the results the responses of the lower bound to the precipitation seasonality indicate that the range of variability of budyko curves is less than the theoretical range with considering the real basin characteristics the budyko space with the horizontal axis as the lower bound is imprecise to describe the maximum runoff yield under real world condition meanwhile ranges of the e ph show that compared with the horizontal axis budyko space limited by the empirical lower bound may be more accurate to capture possible ranges of e p r p under real basin condition 3 3 potential location of the lower bound in the context of the previous studies given the horizontal axis is imprecise to capture the upper bound of the r p in real runoff yield situation it is important to find a more appropriate location of the lower bound in budyko space from hydrological perspective according to the runoff yield process while precipitation is partitioned into evapotranspiration and runoff a portion of precipitation does not be the runoff immediately and transform into soil wetting due to the interception surface ponding and soil wetting sivapalan et al 2011 at the annual scale a part of the precipitation is only available for direct evaporation and not contributed to competition between runoff and evaporation wang and tang 2014 the point is supported by the results based on other watersheds data in previous studies e g roderick and farquhar 2011 in this study figs 8 and 9 show that most of the e pf values were lager than zero indicating that even in the extreme precipitation seasonality condition si 1 83 not all of the precipitation transform into runoff due to the water lost when direct runoff is generated such as precipitation interception by vegetation water storage in top soils and infiltration therefore the part of precipitation which is only available for direct evaporation may be the potential reason for the distance from the horizontal axis to the minimum value of e pf figs 8 and 9 have shown an interesting phenomenon about the distance from the horizontal axis to the minimum value of the e pf take one basin as an example fig 10 the δ 1 is the difference between the e pf value and the horizontal axis according to early discussion in the humid region with abundant water supply aridity index 1 the δ 1 is not contributed to competition between runoff and evaporation in basin under specific condition determined by catch characteristics e g land cover soil and topography due that the historical range of si values is computed from a long serial of historic precipitation data the e ph is reasonable to be the possible range of r p under real basin condition thus the range from the upper value of e ph to the difference value between the minimum values of the e ph and the δ 1 may be the maximum possible range of the budyko curves for given basin under real world condition with all precipitation contribute to the competition between runoff and evaporation in other words the low value of this maximum possible range should close to the lower bound of budyko curves for a given a specific basin therefore a potential location of the lower bound in budyko framework can subsequently be determined it is important to note that compared with the energy demand limited basins aridity index 1 the difference values in the water supply limited basins aridity index 1 will involve a part of energy demand and located lower than the infimum of budyko curves due to the lack of water supply compared with the energy demand thus the difference values between the minimum values of the e ph and the δ 1 in humid basins were used to identify the potential location of the lower bound in budyko space we calculated these differences in 26 basins in climate zone i ⅱ iii and plotted them in fig 11 result shows that both the potential lower bounds fitted by fu s equation and wang tang s equation were overlapped to the empirical lower boundary derived from runoff yield mechanism confirming the reasonability of the potential lower bound and the empirical lower bound as the boundary condition in budyko space from both multiple hydrological simulations and hydrological runoff yield theory under real basin condition 3 4 the variability of precipitation seasonality as mentioned in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the potential lower bound under the specific basin condition in budyko space is related to the range of e ph controlled by historical range of si to further evaluate the reasonability of the potential lower bound it is important to analyze the variability of si in this study we calculated the historical variability of si represented by coefficient of variation cv under different basins characteristics see fig 12 according to fig 10 although the cv of historical si were large in humid basin aridity index 1 the values of si were small in humid regions see fig 5 in dry basin aridity index 1 the values of cv were less than 0 23 and decrease to 0 12 with the increasing of aridity index therefore the variability of si spans a narrow range in both humid and dry basins further given the potential lower bound is overlapped with the empirical lower bound to better understand the reasonability of the potential lower bound in this study we evaluated the ranges of the critical si compared with the historical si at mean annual scale based on the empirical lower bound see fig 13 the critical si represents the group of si corresponds to the precipitation seasonality scenarios when the simulated e p were on the empirical lower bound in budyko space at the mean annual scale while the values of si increase along with the increasing aridity index the mean values of the critical si were farther above the mean annual si for each basins in climate zone i ii and iii the results confirm that for a given basin under the real world condition the e p can entirely be constrained by the empirical lower bound in budyko space indicating that the potential lower bound and the empirical lower bound are reasonable to be a boundary condition in budyko space from observation data 4 summary and conclusions in this paper an investigation of the influence of precipitation seasonality on the lower bound in budyko space was constructed to reveal the reasonability of previous boundary condition the horizontal axis and the empirical lower bound and analyze the appropriate location of the lower bound the si was chosen as an indicator to represent the precipitation seasonality for a given basin multiple hydrological simulations were conducted based on various precipitation scenarios developed by using the first order markov chain and gamma distribution with full range of precipitation seasonality index to investigate the response of the lower bound to precipitation seasonality the xaj model was selected to simulate the runoff from different precipitation seasonality scenarios with a series of basin characteristic parameters results indicated that r p e p has a positive correlation with the si under both dry and humid climatic conditions moreover further analysis of e pf in budyko space revealed under real local condition the lower bound of budyko curves should be above the horizontal axis even in the extreme precipitation seasonality scenarios the precipitation does not totally transform into runoff indicating that as boundary condition in budyko space the horizontal axis is imprecise to describe the lower bound of e p under real world condition in the historical range of si the empirical lower bound in budyko space can precisely constrain the ranges of e p under real local condition this means that compared with the horizontal axis the empirical lower bound serves as the boundary condition of budyko curves can provide a more accurate solution space in addition by analyzing the runoff yield situation under different precipitation seasonality scenarios potential location of the infimum in budyko space were found to be overlapped with the empirical lower bound indicating under real word condition the lower bound of budyko curves is located above the horizontal axis around the empirical lower bound furthermore a narrow change of si revealed in the study confirms the range of budyko curve under local condition is smaller than that in the theoretical condition the potential lower bound around the empirical lower bound in budyko space is thus reasonable to describe the upper bound of runoff yield under real world condition declaration of interests none declared acknowledgments this work was

6709,streamflow recession analysis provides valuable insights into catchment functioning that can be related to runoff generation storage retention and baseflow dynamics as an integrated characteristic recession analysis is particularly useful in catchment comparison studies to help explain drivers of spatial and temporal variability in hydrological behavior here five years of hourly streamflow data from 14 partly nested catchments within a 68 km2 boreal forest landscape in northern sweden were used to explore spatiotemporal variation in hydrological processes through recession analysis the aim of this study was to better understand spatial variation in runoff generation and storage discharge dynamics across the landscape as well as the relation to landscape properties due to high collinearity between variables partial least square regression was used to quantify the associations between recession characteristics and catchment properties as well as to identify key variables controlling recession behavior we analyzed recession characteristics using both an aggregated approach including all recession data and individual recession events the analyses based on individual recession events indicated that catchment topography quantified by indices such as mean slope or elevation above the stream network is a primary control on the recession behavior during relatively high flows whereas catchment area gains importance when flows are relatively low the proportion of sediment and deep soils also controlled recession behavior furthermore we found that recession characteristics are influenced by both evapotranspiration et and proxies of antecedent catchment storage but that the patterns were different depending on catchment properties et was less influential in catchments with deeper soils and larger catchment area shifts in recession rates were primarily related to variation in storage with faster streamflow recessions occurring during periods with low storage the results demonstrate the influence of catchment properties on recession behavior and we found great value in analyzing individual recession events for an increased understanding of spatial and temporal recession characteristics when recession properties were lumped together the relationships to catchment characteristics were obscured this indicates the value of more detailed analyses at least under the strongly seasonal hydroclimatic conditions of this site keywords recession curves spatio temporal variability landscape analysis runoff krycklan 1 introduction the gradual decrease in stream discharge following runoff events or streamflow recession has long been analyzed by the hydrological community to improve the understanding of catchment processes the ability of catchments to store and release water is a key property that needs to be taken into account for reliable model predictions and to effectively manage water resources spence 2010 wagener et al 2007 studies of streamflow recession have for example been used to infer catchment scale aquifer properties pauwels and troch 2010 troch et al 1993 to model streamflow and storage birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 permafrost thawing rates lyon et al 2009 catchment scale evapotranspiration palmroth et al 2010 szilagyi et al 2007 and to detect human interferences thomas et al 2013 wang and cai 2010 yet the question of what controls the spatial and temporal variability of recession characteristics remains partly open troch et al 2013 the spatial variability in recession characteristics and their relation to catchment properties have been examined across scales ranging from regional krakauer and temimi 2011 vogel and kroll 1992 wittenberg 1999 to continental or global beck et al 2013 peña arancibia et al 2010 commonly variability in recession characteristics is related to climatic geological and topographical attributes tallaksen 1995 from a theoretical standpoint the flow recession rate of streams fed by a single unconfined aquifer depends on the aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity thus recession analysis can be used in such cases to derive catchment scale estimates of aquifer properties or as a basis for physical interpretation of recession characteristics brutsaert and nieber 1977 for example bogaart et al 2015 found strong links between spatially variable recession characteristics and landscape types which they related to mechanistic hydraulic and hydrological processes several studies have shown that recession characteristics can be variable not only spatially among catchments but also temporally between events within the same catchment variability in evapotranspiration et has often been suggested as one of the main drivers of this temporal variability where a higher rate of et leads to faster declines in discharge through concurrent depletion of the storage feeding the stream the classic study by federer 1973 showed that streamflow recession was much faster during the growing season compared to the dormant season for a forested watershed while an adjacent clear cut catchment did not show the same increased recession rate during the growing season the direct effect of et was quantified by weisman 1977 who observed faster recession rates during periods with a higher rate of et these studies did however not consider other factors that might influence the recession rates such as catchment storage conditions which tend to be highly correlated with et see discussion in shaw et al 2013 while et influences changes in catchment storage shaw et al 2013 did not find a direct relation between recession rates and concurrent et instead they found that proxies of antecedent catchment storage namely soil moisture and stream discharge at the start of the recession controlled the recession rates antecedent catchment storage has been linked to variation in streamflow recession behavior in several recent studies e g bart and hope 2014 patnaik et al 2015 shaw 2015 for example bart and hope 2014 found that recession rates decreased by up to two orders of magnitude as antecedent storage increased and related both storage magnitude and distribution as controls on the observed dynamics of recession behavior others have theoretically related the temporal variation in streamflow recession to expansion and contraction of the active drainage network rather than et and aquifer drainage biswal and kumar 2014a biswal and marani 2010 however the assumptions in their model have generally not been found to be realistic when tested in field studies linking stream network dynamics and stream flow for example seepage inflow per unit length of the stream is assumed to be constant in time and the contraction of the stream network is assumed to be orderly and top down so that a change in discharge i e recession rate is proportional to changes in the active network these assumptions have been contradicted in field studies e g godsey and kirchner 2014 shaw et al 2017 whiting and godsey 2016 and control by the extent of the active drainage network on recession rates has not been confirmed shaw 2015 instead the study by shaw 2015 demonstrated that the temporal variation in recessions could be explained by variable contributions from different reservoirs with variable recharge and storage this wide array of possible controls on dynamic streamflow recession suggests that different processes could be relevant for different catchments and regions a central question in this context is if information on recessions can be used to go from identifying major regional factors to understanding variation within a smaller landscape subject to the same climate to date most studies examine either spatial variation between catchments or temporal variability in recession characteristics but overlook the possibility that spatial patterns might vary over time two exceptions are the work of krakauer and temimi 2011 and mcmillan et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2014 quantified the degree of variability in recession characteristics for 28 locations within a 50 km2 catchment in new zealand and found high temporal variability between different events the degree of variability was somewhat related to catchment soil and topographic characteristics krakauer and temimi 2011 investigated the spatial variation in recession timescales between catchments and across flow conditions they found variable spatial patterns for low and high flows over the contiguous united states so far however there is a dearth of studies covering both spatial and temporal patterns in recession characteristics which can contribute to resolving the underlying physical controls therefore we analyzed spatial and temporal streamflow recession behavior within the same landscape using data from 14 catchments with hourly data over 5 years which is unique in a boreal context since all catchments are located within an area of 68 km2 climate influences on spatial recession behavior are negligible this provides a rare opportunity to further the understanding of the mechanisms regulating the variability across space and time the main purpose of this study was therefore to investigate how recession characteristics relate to physical catchment properties and if these relationships vary over time this study addressed the following questions how much do storage discharge relationships vary between nearby catchments in a boreal landscape are there relationships between catchment properties and streamflow recession behavior how much do recession characteristics vary over time and do spatial patterns among catchments vary between recession events to what extent is the streamflow recession in the different catchments influenced by evapotranspiration and antecedent storage conditions 2 methods and data 2 1 site description the study was carried out in

groundwater storage reservoir can be approximated by a power function 2 q a s b where q is the discharge at the catchment outflow s is the storage volume and a and b are parameters if s and q are both measured the parameters a and b can be estimated directly however measurements of catchment scale s are notoriously difficult and seldom available so instead the parameters are commonly estimated using the water balance equation conservation of mass eq 3 and selecting time periods when precipitation snowmelt and evapotranspiration can be neglected 3 ds dt p m e q where a change in s is equal to the difference in input precipitation p and snowmelt m and output evapotranspiration e and discharge q assuming that storage is only influenced by q during periods without p m and e this can be simplified to 4 ds dt q p q m q e q brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed to analyze the streamflow recession by relating the change in discharge dq dt to observed discharge q following this approach eq 2 can be substituted into eq 4 taking the derivate with respect to time so that 5 dq dt α q β where α a 1 b b and β 2 1 b clark et al 2009 we use eq 5 to estimate the recession parameters α and β by taking the logarithm 6 log dq dt log α β log q where log α is the intercept and β is the slope in log log space the units of α are t 1 l t 1 β for units of q in l t 1 while β is dimensionless we estimated dq dt as 7 dq dt q i q i j δ t where qi is discharge at time i and qi j is discharge at an earlier time i j q in eqs 5 and 6 is calculated as the average discharge over the time interval i j to i eq 8 8 q k i j i q k j 1 for β equal to unity the groundwater reservoir is linear and α takes the units of t 1 and its reciprocal is often referred to as the characteristic recession timescale

streamflow between lowest and highest observed discharges was estimated by integrating eq 9 kirchner 2009 krakauer and temimi 2011 10 s max s min q min q max ds q min q max τ q d q we used two approaches to estimate the recession characteristics for each of the 14 subcatchments for the first approach we calculated a single storage discharge relationship for each of the catchments following the approach of kirchner 2009 and based on brutsaert and nieber 1977 this approach uses all selected periods of dq dt when precipitation snowmelt and evapotranspiration are assumed to have a negligible effect on the recession and calculate a single temporally aggregated storage discharge relationship for this we used hourly data and evaluated the change of discharge over time increments δt of 1 h for the second approach we calculated recession characteristics for individual recession events and also included periods when evapotranspiration is occurring using daily data and calculating change in discharge over increments of 1 day 2 5 obtaining a storage discharge relationship for the first aggregated approach we selected periods without precipitation or snowmelt and when also et could be assumed to have negligible influence on ds dt using the criteria outlines below which are based on the criteria of kirchner 2009 and teuling et al 2010 the selection was split into two data sets set 1 being warm and dry and set 2 being cold and dry for set 1 we selected hours of dq dt when the moving sum of precipitation for the previous 36 h and the following two hours of the calculated dq dt is negligible p 0 2 mm centered 3 hour moving average shortwave radiation required to be below 10 w m 2 to select night time values additionally we excluded days when discharge was low compared to the daily potential evaporation rates in order to exclude occasions when daytime evaporation may have a large impact on night time recession rates moving average temperature from the previous 30 days had to be above 5 c to exclude the presence of any snow cover this criterion was stricter than used by teuling et al 2010 who used 7 day moving average temperature above 3 c but necessary due to a thick snow cover in the study area set 2 was cold dry and dark the same criteria as in set 1 for precipitation shortwave radiation and daily potential evaporation was applied for set 2 in addition both the 4 hour and 24 hour moving average temperature had to be below 1 c to exclude any influence of snowmelt these sets were combined and the dq dt data was binned and averaged into ranges of q based on the method by kirchner 2009 binning started with the highest q and bins were defined so that they spanned at least 1 of the log q range if variation within the bin was too high standard error in dq dt larger than the mean dq dt divided by two or if the bin contained less than 9 data points the bin size was increased another 1 of the log q range until both criteria were met this way the bins represent the average dq dt rate at the mean flow rate q of the bin the binning also served in averaging out scatter in dq dt at low flows when instrument measurement errors can be relatively large kirchner 2009 rupp and selker 2006 we then applied least squares linear regression using equation 6 to estimate α and β 2 6 analyzing individual recession events the above analysis only considered the aggregated dq dt q relationship derived from the point cloud of recessions without accounting for any influence of evapotranspiration to test the potential effects of evapotranspiration and storage on streamflow recession characteristics we analyzed individual recession segments at a daily timescale we chose daily timescales due to diurnal fluctuation in streamflow occurring during summer low flow for some catchments as well as the better accuracy in quantifying individual recession event characteristics especially for low flows using coarser time scales chen and krajewski 2016 for the extraction of the daily recession events we used the following criteria to avoid any significant influence of recharge by precipitation or snowmelt we first selected a set of days with decreasing discharge dq dt 0 and measured precipitation being below 0 5 mm for the preceding two days when the moving average temperature of the preceding 30 days was above 5 c additionally we selected a second set of days when the two day moving average temperature was below 1 c to avoid snowmelt with decreasing discharge and negligible precipitation as above we used these selected days and extracted segments of continuous dq dt 0 of a length 7 days or longer and finally we removed the first two days and the last day of the segment so that the minimum effective recession segment length was 4 days these criteria were similar to shaw and riha 2012 with the added restriction of excluding days with precipitation or snow influence the variation among recession events has been found to take the form of translations in the dq dt q space as shifts without necessarily affecting the shape parameter β shaw and riha 2012 in the case of fixed β values this dynamic dq dt q behavior can be quantified using the recession intercept α due to the larger variability in β values that we observed we used a simple metric to quantify the shift in the dq dt q plot as the ratio between total discharge from the observed recession segment and total discharge from the established aggregated storage discharge relationship qr seg qr agg given the same initial discharge and time period discharge q from the individual recessions was calculated by solving equation 5 for q t with qt 0 as initial value yielding szilagyi and parlange 1998 11 q t q t 0 1 β 1 β α t 1 1 β for β 1 and q t q t 0 exp α t for β 1 qr seg was then calculated as the sum of q over the time periods of the recession event using equation 11 with α and β estimated from the recession segment and the observed initial discharge at t 0 qr agg is the corresponding sum of q for the same time period using α and β from the single aggregated analysis this metric thus accounts for effects of both changes in recession parameter β and shifts of the recession segment giving a dynamic dq dt q behavior 2 7 spatial and temporal variability on recession characteristics to relate the spatial and temporal variability in recession characteristics we used multivariate partial least squares analysis pls also referred to as projection to latent structures pls is a regression extension of the principal component analysis for modelling the association between two sets of data predictors and responses using a linear multivariate model eriksson et al 2006 pls is different from multiple linear regressions in that it models the structure of both predictors and responses in order to develop a relationship between them and is therefore a more suitable method for datasets with a number of noisy and collinear variables wold et al 2001 pls analysis has previously been applied in hydrological and geochemical studies to explore controls and patterns of observations e g fang et al 2015 ledesma et al 2013 sponseller et al 2014 we used simca 14 1 umetrics to perform the analysis to evaluate the pls models we used r2y which specifies the fraction of the variation in the response that is explained by the model and c2 which describes the predictive ability of the model from cross validation analysis cross validation was performed by leaving out 1 7th of the observations in turns and predicting the data left out using the remaining 6 7th this is summarized as c2 which specifies the fraction of variation in the response that is predicted by the model what constitutes an acceptable pls model in terms of r2y and c2 depends on the noise in the dataset a c2 0 indicates no predictive ability and 1 is perfect predictive ability in general a threshold of c2 0 4 indicates good predictive ability while a difference 0 3 between r2y and c2 indicates irrelevant model terms due to outliers in the dataset eriksson et al 2006 to avoid overfitting the models we used a balance between the r2y and the c2 measures to determine the appropriate number of components aiming to minimize the predictive error maximize c2 onderka et al 2012 to identify the most influential predictors in the pls models we used component loadings and the variable influence in projection metric vip vip indicates the relative importance of the predictors across all model components wold et al 2001 we used a threshold of vip 1 for identifying important variables it is worth noting that the vip and pls loadings describe the importance of a predictor variable in explaining the variation in the response which is different from the correlation coefficient between the variable and the response the loadings should thus be interpreted in terms of predictor variable importance in the pls model and not strength of correlation we explored the spatial relation between catchment properties and recession characteristics for three different approaches based on the pls analysis first we used recession characteristics based on the aggregated storage discharge relationships for each catchment second we used seasonal median values of recession characteristics derived from all individual recession events for each catchment finally we used individual concurrent recession events during which recessions occurred simultaneously in at least 10 catchments seasons were divided into spring am summer jja autumn so and winter ndjfm following the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute criteria vedin 1995 winter was excluded from the spatial analysis due to the shortage of simultaneous winter streamflow observations across all catchments for the temporal patterns of recession characteristics we used individual recession events and analyzed the relation of recession characteristics to storage metrics and evapotranspiration individually for each catchment using pls we then related the importance of storage and et in the pls model to spatial properties of the catchments using univariate spearman rank correlation spearman 1904 2 8 proxies for storage and evapotranspiration direct measurements of catchment scale water storage are difficult at the scale of this study and we used instead three proxies based on discharge and water balance for the water balance we used daily modelled storage from the hbv model bergström 1976 seibert and vis 2012 for each catchment and used the storage at the onset of the recession event shbv hbv gives an indirect measure of dynamic water storage at the catchment scale and while this measure is an approximation it allows for comparison and estimation of storage changes among recession events staudinger et al 2017 for details on the hbv modelling see karlsen et al 2016b in addition we used the specific discharge at the onset of the recession qp0 and past cumulative discharge between 2 and 10 days before the recession qp8 for each catchment stream discharge has previously been found to be strongly related to groundwater levels near the stream in parts of krycklan ledesma et al 2016 seibert et al 2003 and discharge is commonly used as a metric of antecedent storage at the catchment scale bart and hope 2014 to represent evapotranspiration et we used potential et and calculated the mean rate occurring during the recession event segment pets the depletion of storage and the recession rates are the result of interactions between et and discharge eq 3 therefore the influence of et on concurrent recession rates may be masked in situations where discharge is the dominant flux depleting the storage if et on the other hand is the dominant flux the influence on recession rates might be more apparent therefore following shaw et al 2013 we also included the ratio pets qs where qs is the mean specific discharge rate during the recession event 2 9 catchment properties different catchment properties related to terrain vegetation and soils were calculated for each of the 14 subcatchments we used the same selection as karlsen et al 2016a and further details can be found there and in laudon et al 2013 for describing terrain we used mean slope elevation elevation above stream eas tangential curvature topographic wetness index twi median subcatchment area msca and the ratio between flow path length and gradient to stream lfs gfs soils were classified following the swedish geological survey sgu and a proportional cover of sediment peat till and thin soils were used land use is divided into lakes wetlands strongly correlated to peat soils agriculture excluded from the analysis due to only covering 2 of the total area and the remaining area was classified as forested soil depths were extracted from the sgu soil depth model daniels and thunholm 2014 tree volume derived from lidar and from a forest inventory represented vegetation density spatially variable potential evapotranspiration based on the turc method petturc and insolation lyon et al 2012 represented spatial variations in temperature and energy note that these metrics are temporally invariable a selection of the catchment properties is provided in table 1 3 results 3 1 spatial variability in aggregated storage discharge characteristics a median of 1181 data points corresponding to about 3 of the total measured time series were extracted for each catchment for the aggregated hourly dq dt analysis this number varied between 617 and 5068 for the individual catchments nearly all data points were selected during autumn or winter when the effect of evapotranspiration was small fig 2 fig 3 shows dq dt q plots with binned data and regression lines for c2 c7 and c16 for all catchments see fig a 1 in the supplementary material the aggregated storage discharge relationships established for each catchment showed some but generally weak relationships to catchment properties most pls models showed poor predictive ability in the cross validation analysis except for dynamic storage table 2 the recession parameter β which is the exponent representing the non linearity in recession behavior varied between 1 62 and 2 85 and was generally lower for catchments with lower slopes and elevation above stream eas typical for wetland and lake influenced catchments the pls model explained 41 of the spatial variability in β values between catchments r2y 0 43 but with poor predictive ability c2 0 11 recession timescales τ showed variable spatial patterns depending on the flow conditions but were not well related to catchment properties with low c2 for lower flow rates q75 smaller catchments with higher elevation above stream eas had the longest recession times the recession timescales varied between 16 and 38 days for q75 for higher flow rates q25 recession timescales varied between 2 5 and 9 days catchments with lower tree volume and till soils more lake influence and long low gradient flow paths to the stream had longer recession timescales the dynamic storage as estimated between the daily minimum and maximum specific discharge observed for each catchment was higher for catchments with lake influence and long low gradient flow paths to the stream and lower for catchments with high tree volume and till soils r2y 0 44 c2 0 27 the lowest dynamic storage was observed for c2 with 20 mm and the highest for c6 with 75 mm 3 2 temporal variation in recession characteristics and relationships to catchment properties the number of extracted recession events varied from 12 to 26 per catchment with a median of 19 events for all 14 catchments the variation in recession parameters for individual events varied between catchments as well as the clustering of events on the dq dt q plots fig 4 fig a 2 c5 which is draining a lake showed little variation in β between events and the recession events tend to plot closely together figs 4 and 5 for the till dominated catchments c1 and c2 a large scattering of the events and a moderate variation in β could be observed larger catchments and catchments with more sediment soils e g c16 c20 showed less variation in dq dt rates but a higher variability in β during spring the variation was generally lower both within and among catchments compared to summer and autumn median seasonal β values were the lowest in summer or spring and highest for all catchments in autumn fig 5 the relationships to catchment characteristics were stronger when β was calculated as seasonal median or as median of all recession events than β values derived from single aggregated relations table 3 the predictive power of catchment characteristics was greatest for explaining spatial variability in median summer β r2y 0 80 c2 0 68 and lowest for median spring β r2y 0 65 c2 0 48 average catchment terrain slope was the most influential variable in all models and steeper slopes were related to higher β which was also the case for the aggregated β model table 2 other variables related to higher β values across seasons were the proportion of sediment soil cover soil depth and catchment area the overall variation in β between recession events quantified as the interquartile range iqr showed that catchments with steeper slopes deep sediment soils and higher average elevation above stream had a larger variation between events 3 3 spatial variation during concurrent recession events there were 14 concurrent recession events during which events could be extracted for 10 or more of the catchments five of these events occurred during spring five during summer and four during autumn the relation between catchment properties and both β and recession event timescales τ using mean recession event discharge was generally strong table 4 recession timescales and β were often positively correlated for the recession events median rank correlation 0 7 and had similar explanatory variables with vip 1 a larger catchment area steeper slopes a higher sediment proportion deeper soils and a lower elevation were associated with longer τ and higher β shortest τ values were found in wetland and forest dominated small headwater catchments underlain by till while largest τ values were observed in larger catchments underlain by sediments generally the variability of τ in headwaters underlain by till c1 c2 c4 c5 was less than the variability τ in catchments that were larger and had more sediment soils e g c20 c15 c16 when comparing wet and dry conditions quantified as recession mean discharge some patterns can be seen between wetness state and vip rankings for explaining β and τ for τ eas was only considered important during the six recessions with relatively high discharge i e wetter where higher eas was related to longer recession timescales catchment area which often had vip 1 was higher ranked among the three most important variables during recession events with low discharge terrain slope which had vip 1 for all models for both β and τ was ranked more important than catchment area during wetter recessions and vice versa during drier recessions fig 6 this indicates some shifts in the spatial patterns of base flow formation depending on catchment wetness we also note that catchment area had lower importance in pls models where the two largest catchments c15 c16 were not included due to recessions not meeting set criteria or due to missing data suggesting that scale might not be of primary importance between smaller catchments but rather in describing differences between small and large catchments 3 4 relating temporal variation to evapotranspiration and antecedent storage temporal variation in β was moderately well explained and predicted with only three catchments with c2 values around 0 5 the remaining 11 catchments had c2 0 4 and three of which with c2 0 2 indicating poor predictive ability table a 1 the mean potential evaporation occurring over the recession segment was considered important vip 1 for all catchments metrics of antecedent catchment storage using discharge qp0 qp8 had vip 1 for four catchments the temporal variation in qr seg qr agg was better explained with all catchments having c2 0 5 metrics of catchment storage were considered important variables for all catchments fig 7 3 4 1 spatial patterns of et and antecedent storage influence to quantify the relationship between catchment properties and the influence of antecedent storage and et on recessions we compared the pls variable loadings from the plstβ temporal variation in β and plstqr temporal variation in qr seg qr agg models to catchment properties to simplify the analysis we present one metric for storage qp0 and potential evaporation rate pets since all pls models were fitted with one component the pls loading magnitudes were proportional to vip and describe the correlation between the explanatory variables here qp0 and pets and the responses here β and qr seg qr agg in the plstβ models qp0 loading magnitudes showed the strongest relation to catchment area fig 8 a spearman rank correlation r 0 82 p 0 05 meaning that antecedent storage was more strongly associated to temporal variation in β for larger catchments than for smaller catchments catchment slope and deeper sediment soils were also related to the loadings in a similar manner and considering other storage metrics shbv qp8 gave similar patterns the pets loadings showed an opposite pattern where smaller catchments had higher loading fig 8b r 0 72 p 0 05 the relation between catchment properties and loadings in the plstqr models were weaker compared to the plstβ models and the strongest relation was with eas catchments with higher eas showed higher loadings for qp0 fig 8c r 0 56 p 0 05 meaning antecedent storage was more important in explaining the variability of qr seg qr agg in these catchments than those with lower eas for the pets loadings the pattern was weaker fig 8d r 0 51 p 0 06 and pets loadings were low for all catchments vip 1 the highest loading was found for c6 and c9 both with low eas one explanation of the lack of association with pets could be that the effects are masked by events with higher flow et is expected to influence the recession most when it is relatively large compared to q only considering events when the ratio of pets and q is high 5 and 10 did however not result in stronger influence of pets but confirmed that pets has some influence on the catchments with low eas c5 c6 and c9 all being the catchments located closest downstream of the lake draining directly to the c5 gauging station 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation in recession β and τ among catchments using the individual recession events to explore spatial variation among catchments we found strong relationships between landscape properties and recession non linearity β and timescales τ the most important catchment properties related to spatial variation in β and τ were catchment terrain slope catchment area deeper soils and sediment deposits more non linear recessions for catchments with deeper soils sediment deposits and larger catchment areas are consistent with the results of tague and grant 2004 and mcmillan et al 2014 at smaller spatial scales non linearity in recessions has been found to increase with catchment size and that this increase in β can be explained by increasing heterogeneity at larger scales due to different landscape classes and stores contributing to streamflow clark et al 2009 in our study low β median 1 0 was observed for c5 located directly downstream from a small lake consistent with open water hydraulics and thus very low degree of heterogeneity in the main contributing store bogaart et al 2015 in addition to topography and soils underlying catchment geology has often been found to explain spatial variability in recession characteristics among catchments see review in tallaksen 1995 in krycklan the bedrock geology is very uniform and thus cannot be linked to any observed variations in this study nevertheless in other regions underlying geology has been found to exert a strong control on storage and release of water e g jencso and mcglynn 2011 penna et al 2017 pfister et al 2017 this may be an important factor controlling recession behavior across larger boreal regions devito et al 2005 interestingly our results showed that catchments with steeper mean terrain slopes had higher β and longer τ which might seem contradictory to classic hydraulic theory suggesting that steeper sloping aquifers drain faster vogel and kroll 1992 in other studies both similar beck et al 2013 krakauer and temimi 2011 peña arancibia et al 2010 and contrasting brandes et al 2005 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 results have been reported in krycklan the steepest mean slopes are found for catchments with a proportion of sediment soils the lowest slopes are in wet area catchments and intermediate slopes are in till dominated catchments thus spatial patterns of mean catchment terrain slope are correlated with other catchment properties which can have a large influence on the recessions and terrain slope does not necessarily correspond to dominant aquifer properties for example in the deeper sediment soils we expect deeper groundwater systems with hydraulic gradients that are less related to terrain slope in these cases steeper slope corresponds to permeable soils with higher elevation above streams which could lead to a deeper groundwater flow system and slower recession similar to what was found by several other studies gao et al 2018 krakauer and temimi 2011 tague and grant 2004 the fraction of deeper groundwater in krycklan streams during winter base flow has previously been related to catchment area peralta tapia et al 2015 with the highest relative deep groundwater contributions in large catchments here we found both catchment area and sediment cover to be important factors for longer recession timescales for example the relatively small catchment c20 with relatively steep slopes and sediment soils near the stream channel often had the slowest recessions comparable to those of the main outlet c16 which has a catchment area that is 45 times larger additionally the slopes in krycklan are gentle compared to many other catchments and the variation in slope between catchments with similar soils is small it is thus possible that slope influences streamflow recession rates in for example till dominated catchments but there is not enough variation in this dataset to detect it in contrast to the analysis of individual events the aggregated analysis did not reveal any strong spatial patterns between recession behavior and landscape properties the weaker relationships with catchment properties for the aggregated analysis could be explained by not capturing the temporal variation in recession events or by the limited dataset which might not have been sufficient to fully describe the relationships temporally varying factors such as antecedent moisture conditions or variable contributing stores have been linked to shifts in recession curves between events mcmillan et al 2014 shaw et al 2013 fitting recession parameters through aggregated data clouds composed of such shifting individual events might not result in representative recession parameter values shaw and riha 2012 4 2 temporal variation and changing spatial patterns in krycklan the degree of temporal variation in β from individual recession events was highly variable among catchments mcmillan et al 2014 found similarly high temporal variability in recession β for individual recessions but did not investigate potential spatial or temporal controls on the temporal variability the variability in β among catchments was also changing between seasons with less spatial variation and low β during spring spring recessions follow the snowmelt when the landscape is generally at its wettest a possible explanation for the decrease in spatial variability during this wet period could be that spatial heterogeneity in the storage reservoirs contributing to streamflow is small across landscape e g a shallow fast reservoir dominates whereas later in summer and autumn there is larger heterogeneity in contributing stores following smaller recharge events shaw 2015 observed that non linearity in recession decreased β 1 otherwise 2 following a large rainfall and speculated whether this could mean a single linear reservoir dominated the recession with the otherwise non linear recessions being caused by variable contributions from several reservoirs the spatial patterns were relatively consistent among different recession events although the relative importance of different catchment properties varied with flow conditions for example catchment area gained importance as flow decreased whereas elevation above stream eas was only important when flows were relatively high changing spatial patterns for specific discharge between high and low flow periods have previously been observed in krycklan karlsen et al 2016a others have also seen changing controls on spatial base flow patterns for example payn et al 2012 observed a decreasing importance of topography and increasing geological controls as base flow declined changing spatial patterns of recession timescale between low and high flow were also seen by krakauer and temimi 2011 with soil infiltration capacity only associated with τ at low flows and forest cover only at high flows as the landscape became drier and flow decreased the positive association between catchment area and recession timescales became stronger we attribute this mainly to storage characteristics and a larger contribution of deeper slower flow paths in larger catchments and thicker sediment soils this is in line with other studies at krycklan where catchments with more sediment soils and larger area maintain a higher baseflow during dry periods karlsen et al 2016a and chemical tracers showing increasing contributions of older groundwater with catchment area during winter baseflow peralta tapia et al 2015 a more gradual release of water in areas with thicker soils and unsaturated zones as well as larger subsurface storage capacities has been observed across different environments gao et al 2018 penna et al 2017 this is possibly a more general trait of storage as a primary descriptor of catchment hydrological behavior mcnamara et al 2011 pfister et al 2017 a factor not considered explicitly in this study is the random spatial variation in precipitation on the event scale which is a source of noise in the analysis of individual recessions longer time series with more individual events to analyze could help reduce the effects of such variability and improve the degree of explanation 4 3 effects of evapotranspiration and antecedent storage on recession characteristics our results show that both et and storage can be linked to temporal variation in recession characteristics with varying influence for different catchments the rate of potential evapotranspiration occurring during a recession segment was overall the most important factor explaining temporal variation in β this implies that a higher et was related to lower β and hence shorter recession timescales and faster decline in discharge similar results have been shown in other catchments e g szilagyi et al 2007 weisman 1977 in larger catchments with deeper soils and deeper flow systems the effect of et on the variability in β was weaker and the association with storage was stronger whereas the effect of et on the variability in β was stronger for small catchments where dominant flow paths are likely to be more superficial peralta tapia et al 2015 tiwari et al 2014 deeper flow systems can be expected to be less influenced by transpiration and soil evaporation than more superficial systems where et results in a depletion of the reservoir that is contributing to streamflow both biswal and kumar 2014b and shaw et al 2013 examined the effect of et on the recession but concluded that there was little relation between recession rates and concurrent et one explanation might be that both studies used a fixed β and only examined variation in α i e shifts in recession curves in dq dt q space it is nevertheless possible that relatively small variations in β could be related to et a more likely explanation is that nearly all catchments in their studies are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the entire krycklan study catchment we observed a decreasing importance of et with increasing scale and it is possible that et has less direct influence on recessions in large catchment systems the general pattern in krycklan with recession shifts qr seg qr agg related to catchment antecedent storage has also been found in other studies bart and hope 2014 patnaik et al 2015 shaw 2015 shaw et al 2013 we hypothesize that these recession shifts as well as the degree of temporal variability in recession behavior is related to the degree of catchment storage heterogeneity catchments with more homogeneous storage control on discharge such as lake influenced catchments with low elevation above stream e g c5 c6 have a lower degree of non linearity and variability between recession events here a single reservoir dominated and the recession behavior did not change much over time catchments with larger heterogeneity in soils caused for example by a combination of till wetlands and sediment e g c20 c16 showed greater non linearity and variability between events this could be linked to variable contributions from different reservoirs with different drainage characteristics and variable storage over time as catchments are wetted up during sustained precipitation or snowmelt spatial variability in non linearity and recession timescales were reduced suggesting a convergence across the landscape to a dominance of shallow subsurface reservoirs with relatively short timescales compared to the reservoirs dominating during lower flow conditions previous studies which have characterized a single unique catchment scale storage discharge relationship have similarly noted that humid catchments and periods are better described brauer et al 2013 teuling et al 2010 and that dry conditions are better described with a more complex and temporally variable storage discharge relationship accounting for antecedent moisture conditions bart and hope 2014 li and nieber 2017 furthermore as storage accumulates in slower responding parts of the catchment recession rates decrease causing a shift in dq dt q once storage has increased in the slower responding storages a return to low flow conditions will be associated with drainage from these stores creating non linearity in the recession response bart and hope 2014 clark et al 2009 harman et al 2009 shaw 2015 this suggests that the shape of recessions is dependent on both the volume and distribution of storage within the landscape and that no single storage discharge relationship can be expected moore 1997 however in the smaller till dominated catchments c1 c2 where one would expect storage heterogeneity to be small considerable variability in the recession characteristics was found during wet periods with larger saturated storage more of the upslope area a slow responding reservoir gets connected and sustains the riparian storage controlling streamflow in such cases streamflow recession rates become slower compared to dry periods for runoff events occurring during dry periods the water table in these upslope areas remain relatively low and a thicker unsaturated zone is available to receive infiltration amvrosiadi et al 2017 recession rates then increase as the near stream zone are not sustained by upslope storage to the same extent precisely how these upslope areas connect and influence recession rates and what controls this process remains an open question that warrants further investigation it is however possible that the degree of non linearity depends on the drainage characteristics of different reservoirs together with the spatial configuration of the storage reservoirs and their respective contribution to base flow other have theorized that temporal variations in recession characteristics are controlled by changes in the drainage network extent as the network contracts with decreasing discharge biswal and kumar 2014b biswal and marani 2010 in krycklan the stream network extent has been shown to vary for different wetness conditions i e discharge especially during low flow conditions ågren et al 2015 thus the association we have made in this study to antecedent storage may very well be related at least in part to dynamic drainage networks as the two are likely to be closely related however the assumptions of uniform flow contributions along channels and top down orderly channel contraction in the biswal and marani 2010 model are often not met in real systems godsey and kirchner 2014 shaw et al 2017 including in krycklan karlsen et al 2016a we suggest that dynamic networks are not a controlling factor on dynamic recession behavior but that these are both affected by storage distribution and dynamics 5 conclusions the analysis using individual recession curves provided a more detailed insight into the spatial and temporal variation in recession behavior in the krycklan catchment than the aggregated analysis despite considerable variation in the recession behavior among catchments as derived from the aggregated analysis no strong relationships to catchment properties were found however the analysis of individual recession events identified strong relationships between recession behavior and catchment properties as well as temporal variability between seasons the questions remains though about the degree to which streamflow recessions are controlled by aquifer hydraulic properties alone and the role of spatial heterogeneity organization in catchment properties including antecedent water storage clark et al 2009 shaw 2015 troch et al 2013 in this study we found variable spatial patterns in recession behavior among catchments between wet and dry periods we hypothesize that these patterns are the result of different runoff generation processes and different degrees of heterogeneity in catchment storages contributing to streamflow future work should aim at finding meaningful model descriptions for these variable recession patterns and explore the role of how different stores of water contribute and connect across the landscape catchment size topography and the presence of deep soils were strongly related to recession behavior among catchments in krycklan these spatial patterns remained fairly stable over time despite large temporal variability in recession characteristics between events the relative influence of catchment properties varied with flow conditions the temporal variation in streamflow recession across the different catchments was also influenced by both et and antecedent storage conditions et was more influential in smaller catchments with shallow groundwater systems but less influential for systems with deeper groundwater systems lower antecedent storage generally resulted in faster recession rates compared to high antecedent storage together these analyses show that recession behavior among nearby catchments is highly variable but that this variability is related in a predictable way to catchment properties the ability to discern the underlying patterns in complex recession phenomena provides insights into the fundamental physical controls on the storage and release of water across this boreal region declaration of interests none acknowledgements we

6709,streamflow recession analysis provides valuable insights into catchment functioning that can be related to runoff generation storage retention and baseflow dynamics as an integrated characteristic recession analysis is particularly useful in catchment comparison studies to help explain drivers of spatial and temporal variability in hydrological behavior here five years of hourly streamflow data from 14 partly nested catchments within a 68 km2 boreal forest landscape in northern sweden were used to explore spatiotemporal variation in hydrological processes through recession analysis the aim of this study was to better understand spatial variation in runoff generation and storage discharge dynamics across the landscape as well as the relation to landscape properties due to high collinearity between variables partial least square regression was used to quantify the associations between recession characteristics and catchment properties as well as to identify key variables controlling recession behavior we analyzed recession characteristics using both an aggregated approach including all recession data and individual recession events the analyses based on individual recession events indicated that catchment topography quantified by indices such as mean slope or elevation above the stream network is a primary control on the recession behavior during relatively high flows whereas catchment area gains importance when flows are relatively low the proportion of sediment and deep soils also controlled recession behavior furthermore we found that recession characteristics are influenced by both evapotranspiration et and proxies of antecedent catchment storage but that the patterns were different depending on catchment properties et was less influential in catchments with deeper soils and larger catchment area shifts in recession rates were primarily related to variation in storage with faster streamflow recessions occurring during periods with low storage the results demonstrate the influence of catchment properties on recession behavior and we found great value in analyzing individual recession events for an increased understanding of spatial and temporal recession characteristics when recession properties were lumped together the relationships to catchment characteristics were obscured this indicates the value of more detailed analyses at least under the strongly seasonal hydroclimatic conditions of this site keywords recession curves spatio temporal variability landscape analysis runoff krycklan 1 introduction the gradual decrease in stream discharge following runoff events or streamflow recession has long been analyzed by the hydrological community to improve the understanding of catchment processes the ability of catchments to store and release water is a key property that needs to be taken into account for reliable model predictions and to effectively manage water resources spence 2010 wagener et al 2007 studies of streamflow recession have for example been used to infer catchment scale aquifer properties pauwels and troch 2010 troch et al 1993 to model streamflow and storage birkel et al 2011 kirchner 2009 permafrost thawing rates lyon et al 2009 catchment scale evapotranspiration palmroth et al 2010 szilagyi et al 2007 and to detect human interferences thomas et al 2013 wang and cai 2010 yet the question of what controls the spatial and temporal variability of recession characteristics remains partly open troch et al 2013 the spatial variability in recession characteristics and their relation to catchment properties have been examined across scales ranging from regional krakauer and temimi 2011 vogel and kroll 1992 wittenberg 1999 to continental or global beck et al 2013 peña arancibia et al 2010 commonly variability in recession characteristics is related to climatic geological and topographical attributes tallaksen 1995 from a theoretical standpoint the flow recession rate of streams fed by a single unconfined aquifer depends on the aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity thus recession analysis can be used in such cases to derive catchment scale estimates of aquifer properties or as a basis for physical interpretation of recession characteristics brutsaert and nieber 1977 for example bogaart et al 2015 found strong links between spatially variable recession characteristics and landscape types which they related to mechanistic hydraulic and hydrological processes several studies have shown that recession characteristics can be variable not only spatially among catchments but also temporally between events within the same catchment variability in evapotranspiration et has often been suggested as one of the main drivers of this temporal variability where a higher rate of et leads to faster declines in discharge through concurrent depletion of the storage feeding the stream the classic study by federer 1973 showed that streamflow recession was much faster during the growing season compared to the dormant season for a forested watershed while an adjacent clear cut catchment did not show the same increased recession rate during the growing season the direct effect of et was quantified by weisman 1977 who observed faster recession rates during periods with a higher rate of et these studies did however not consider other factors that might influence the recession rates such as catchment storage conditions which tend to be highly correlated with et see discussion in shaw et al 2013 while et influences changes in catchment storage shaw et al 2013 did not find a direct relation between recession rates and concurrent et instead they found that proxies of antecedent catchment storage namely soil moisture and stream discharge at the start of the recession controlled the recession rates antecedent catchment storage has been linked to variation in streamflow recession behavior in several recent studies e g bart and hope 2014 patnaik et al 2015 shaw 2015 for example bart and hope 2014 found that recession rates decreased by up to two orders of magnitude as antecedent storage increased and related both storage magnitude and distribution as controls on the observed dynamics of recession behavior others have theoretically related the temporal variation in streamflow recession to expansion and contraction of the active drainage network rather than et and aquifer drainage biswal and kumar 2014a biswal and marani 2010 however the assumptions in their model have generally not been found to be realistic when tested in field studies linking stream network dynamics and stream flow for example seepage inflow per unit length of the stream is assumed to be constant in time and the contraction of the stream network is assumed to be orderly and top down so that a change in discharge i e recession rate is proportional to changes in the active network these assumptions have been contradicted in field studies e g godsey and kirchner 2014 shaw et al 2017 whiting and godsey 2016 and control by the extent of the active drainage network on recession rates has not been confirmed shaw 2015 instead the study by shaw 2015 demonstrated that the temporal variation in recessions could be explained by variable contributions from different reservoirs with variable recharge and storage this wide array of possible controls on dynamic streamflow recession suggests that different processes could be relevant for different catchments and regions a central question in this context is if information on recessions can be used to go from identifying major regional factors to understanding variation within a smaller landscape subject to the same climate to date most studies examine either spatial variation between catchments or temporal variability in recession characteristics but overlook the possibility that spatial patterns might vary over time two exceptions are the work of krakauer and temimi 2011 and mcmillan et al 2014 mcmillan et al 2014 quantified the degree of variability in recession characteristics for 28 locations within a 50 km2 catchment in new zealand and found high temporal variability between different events the degree of variability was somewhat related to catchment soil and topographic characteristics krakauer and temimi 2011 investigated the spatial variation in recession timescales between catchments and across flow conditions they found variable spatial patterns for low and high flows over the contiguous united states so far however there is a dearth of studies covering both spatial and temporal patterns in recession characteristics which can contribute to resolving the underlying physical controls therefore we analyzed spatial and temporal streamflow recession behavior within the same landscape using data from 14 catchments with hourly data over 5 years which is unique in a boreal context since all catchments are located within an area of 68 km2 climate influences on spatial recession behavior are negligible this provides a rare opportunity to further the understanding of the mechanisms regulating the variability across space and time the main purpose of this study was therefore to investigate how recession characteristics relate to physical catchment properties and if these relationships vary over time this study addressed the following questions how much do storage discharge relationships vary between nearby catchments in a boreal landscape are there relationships between catchment properties and streamflow recession behavior how much do recession characteristics vary over time and do spatial patterns among catchments vary between recession events to what extent is the streamflow recession in the different catchments influenced by evapotranspiration and antecedent storage conditions 2 methods and data 2 1 site description the study was carried out in the 68 km2 krycklan catchment in northern sweden 64 25 n 19 46 e about 50 km west of the baltic sea coast the climate is characterized by relatively cold winters with persistent snow cover and warm

scots pine pinus sylvestris and norway spruce picea abies streamflow was monitored at 14 locations named c1 c20 within krycklan including the main outlet c16 fig 1 table 1 the subcatchment areas range between 12 and 6790 ha and have a differing composition of quaternary deposits mire cover and forest density 2 2 streamflow data stream discharge used in this study for each of the 14 subcatchments was monitored between 2008 and 2013 at an hourly resolution using automatic water level loggers karlsen et al 2016b automatic observations were possible year round for four gauging stations while the remaining stations were monitored only during the ice free period frequent manual water level measurements monthly during winter minimum bi weekly rest of the year were made to adjust automatic water level data and stage discharge relationships were defined using manual flow gauging specific discharge discharge per unit catchment area was calculated using catchment areas derived from a 5 m resolution lidar dem using the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 with questionable sections being assisted by 0 5 m resolution dem and field surveys laudon et al 2013 2011 2 3 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from a reference climate station at svartberget located within the krycklan catchment 64 14 n 19 46 e 225 m a s l the climate station is part of the reference climate

groundwater storage reservoir can be approximated by a power function 2 q a s b where q is the discharge at the catchment outflow s is the storage volume and a and b are parameters if s and q are both measured the parameters a and b can be estimated directly however measurements of catchment scale s are notoriously difficult and seldom available so instead the parameters are commonly estimated using the water balance equation conservation of mass eq 3 and selecting time periods when precipitation snowmelt and evapotranspiration can be neglected 3 ds dt p m e q where a change in s is equal to the difference in input precipitation p and snowmelt m and output evapotranspiration e and discharge q assuming that storage is only influenced by q during periods without p m and e this can be simplified to 4 ds dt q p q m q e q brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed to analyze the streamflow recession by relating the change in discharge dq dt to observed discharge q following this approach eq 2 can be substituted into eq 4 taking the derivate with respect to time so that 5 dq dt α q β where α a 1 b b and β 2 1 b clark et al 2009 we use eq 5 to estimate the recession parameters α and β by taking the logarithm 6 log dq dt log α β log q where log α is the intercept and β is the slope in log log space the units of α are t 1 l t 1 β for units of q in l t 1 while β is dimensionless we estimated dq dt as 7 dq dt q i q i j δ t where qi is discharge at time i and qi j is discharge at an earlier time i j q in eqs 5 and 6 is calculated as the average discharge over the time interval i j to i eq 8 8 q k i j i q k j 1 for β equal to unity the groundwater reservoir is linear and α takes the units of t 1 and its reciprocal is often referred to as the characteristic recession timescale and is invariable with respect to q if β 1 the recession timescale τ will vary depending on q as shown by kirchner 2009 9 τ q 1 α q β 1 the dynamic storage i e the change of storage contributing to streamflow between lowest and highest observed discharges was estimated by integrating eq 9 kirchner 2009 krakauer and temimi 2011 10 s max s min q min q max ds q min q max τ q d q we used two approaches to estimate the recession characteristics for each of the 14 subcatchments for the first approach we calculated a single storage discharge relationship for each of the catchments following the approach of kirchner 2009 and based on brutsaert and nieber 1977 this approach uses all selected periods of dq dt when precipitation snowmelt and evapotranspiration are assumed to have a negligible effect on the recession and calculate a single temporally aggregated storage discharge relationship for this we used hourly data and evaluated the change of discharge over time increments δt of 1 h for the second approach we calculated recession characteristics for individual recession events and also included periods when evapotranspiration is occurring using daily data and calculating change in discharge over increments of 1 day 2 5 obtaining a storage discharge relationship for the first aggregated approach we selected periods without precipitation or snowmelt and when also et could be assumed to have negligible influence on ds dt using the criteria outlines below which are based on the criteria of kirchner 2009 and teuling et al 2010 the selection was split into two data sets set 1 being warm and dry and set 2 being cold and dry for set 1 we selected hours of dq dt when the moving sum of precipitation for the previous 36 h and the following two hours of the calculated dq dt is negligible p 0 2 mm centered 3 hour moving average shortwave radiation required to be below 10 w m 2 to select night time values additionally we excluded days when discharge was low compared to the daily potential evaporation rates in order to exclude occasions when daytime evaporation may have a large impact on night time recession rates moving average temperature from the previous 30 days had to be above 5 c to exclude the presence of any snow cover this criterion was stricter than used by teuling et al 2010 who used 7 day moving average temperature above 3 c but necessary due to a thick snow cover in the study area set 2 was cold dry and dark the same criteria as in set 1 for precipitation shortwave radiation and daily potential evaporation was applied for set 2 in addition both the 4 hour and 24 hour moving average temperature had to be below 1 c to exclude any influence of snowmelt these sets were combined and the dq dt data was binned and averaged into ranges of q based on the method by kirchner 2009 binning started with the highest q and bins were defined so that they spanned at least 1 of the log q range if variation within the bin was too high standard error in dq dt larger than the mean dq dt divided by two or if the bin contained less than 9 data points the bin size was increased another 1 of the log q range until both criteria were met this way the bins represent the average dq dt rate at the mean flow rate q of the bin the binning also served in averaging out scatter in dq dt at low flows when instrument measurement errors can be relatively large kirchner 2009 rupp and selker 2006 we then applied least squares linear regression using equation 6 to estimate α and β 2 6 analyzing individual recession events the above analysis only considered the aggregated dq dt q relationship derived from the point cloud of recessions without accounting for any influence of evapotranspiration to test the potential effects of evapotranspiration and storage on streamflow recession characteristics we analyzed individual recession segments at a daily timescale we chose daily timescales due to diurnal fluctuation in streamflow occurring during summer low flow for some catchments as well as the better accuracy in quantifying individual recession event characteristics especially for low flows using coarser time scales chen and krajewski 2016 for the extraction of the daily recession events we used the following criteria to avoid any significant influence of recharge by precipitation or snowmelt we first selected a set of days with decreasing discharge dq dt 0 and measured precipitation being below 0 5 mm for the preceding two days when the moving average temperature of the preceding 30 days was above 5 c additionally we selected a second set of days when the two day moving average temperature was below 1 c to avoid snowmelt with decreasing discharge and negligible precipitation as above we used these selected days and extracted segments of continuous dq dt 0 of a length 7 days or longer and finally we removed the first two days and the last day of the segment so that the minimum effective recession segment length was 4 days these criteria were similar to shaw and riha 2012 with the added restriction of excluding days with precipitation or snow influence the variation among recession events has been found to take the form of translations in the dq dt q space as shifts without necessarily affecting the shape parameter β shaw and riha 2012 in the case of fixed β values this dynamic dq dt q behavior can be quantified using the recession intercept α due to the larger variability in β values that we observed we used a simple metric to quantify the shift in the dq dt q plot as the ratio between total discharge from the observed recession segment and total discharge from the established aggregated storage discharge relationship qr seg qr agg given the same initial discharge and time period discharge q from the individual recessions was calculated by solving equation 5 for q t with qt 0 as initial value yielding szilagyi and parlange 1998 11 q t q t 0 1 β 1 β α t 1 1 β for β 1 and q t q t 0 exp α t for β 1 qr seg was then calculated as the sum of q over the time periods of the recession event using equation 11 with α and β estimated from the recession segment and the observed initial discharge at t 0 qr agg is the corresponding sum of q for the same time period using α and β from the single aggregated analysis this metric thus accounts for effects of both changes in recession parameter β and shifts of the recession segment giving a dynamic dq dt q behavior 2 7 spatial and temporal variability on recession characteristics to relate the spatial and temporal variability in recession characteristics we used multivariate partial least squares analysis pls also referred to as projection to latent structures pls is a regression extension of the principal component analysis for modelling the association between two sets of data predictors and responses using a linear multivariate model eriksson et al 2006 pls is different from multiple linear regressions in that it models the structure of both predictors and responses in order to develop a relationship between them and is therefore a more suitable method for datasets with a number of noisy and collinear variables wold et al 2001 pls analysis has previously been applied in hydrological and geochemical studies to explore controls and patterns of observations e g fang et al 2015 ledesma et al 2013 sponseller et al 2014 we used simca 14 1 umetrics to perform the analysis to evaluate the pls models we used r2y which specifies the fraction of the variation in the response that is explained by the model and c2 which describes the predictive ability of the model from cross validation analysis cross validation was performed by leaving out 1 7th of the observations in turns and predicting the data left out using the remaining 6 7th this is summarized as c2 which specifies the fraction of variation in the response that is predicted by the model what constitutes an acceptable pls model in terms of r2y and c2 depends on the noise in the dataset a c2 0 indicates no predictive ability and 1 is perfect predictive ability in general a threshold of c2 0 4 indicates good predictive ability while a difference 0 3 between r2y and c2 indicates irrelevant model terms due to outliers in the dataset eriksson et al 2006 to avoid overfitting the models we used a balance between the r2y and the c2 measures to determine the appropriate number of components aiming to minimize the predictive error maximize c2 onderka et al 2012 to identify the most influential predictors in the pls models we used component loadings and the variable influence in projection metric vip vip indicates the relative importance of the predictors across all model components wold et al 2001 we used a threshold of vip 1 for identifying important variables it is worth noting that the vip and pls loadings describe the importance of a predictor variable in explaining the variation in the response which is different from the correlation coefficient between the variable and the response the loadings should thus be interpreted in terms of predictor variable importance in the pls model and not strength of correlation we explored the spatial relation between catchment properties and recession characteristics for three different approaches based on the pls analysis first we used recession characteristics based on the aggregated storage discharge relationships for each catchment second we used seasonal median values of recession characteristics derived from all individual recession events for each catchment finally we used individual concurrent recession events during which recessions occurred simultaneously in at least 10 catchments seasons were divided into spring am summer jja autumn so and winter ndjfm following the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute criteria vedin 1995 winter was excluded from the spatial analysis due to the shortage of simultaneous winter streamflow observations across all catchments for the temporal patterns of recession characteristics we used individual recession events and analyzed the relation of recession characteristics to storage metrics and evapotranspiration individually for each catchment using pls we then related the importance of storage and et in the pls model to spatial properties of the catchments using univariate spearman rank correlation spearman 1904 2 8 proxies for storage and evapotranspiration direct measurements of catchment scale water storage are difficult at the scale of this study and we used instead three proxies based on discharge and water balance for the water balance we used daily modelled storage from the hbv model bergström 1976 seibert and vis 2012 for each catchment and used the storage at the onset of the recession event shbv hbv gives an indirect measure of dynamic water storage at the catchment scale and while this measure is an approximation it allows for comparison and estimation of storage changes among recession events staudinger et al 2017 for details on the hbv modelling see karlsen et al 2016b in addition we used the specific discharge at the onset of the recession qp0 and past cumulative discharge between 2 and 10 days before the recession qp8 for each catchment stream discharge has previously been found to be strongly related to groundwater levels near the stream in parts of krycklan ledesma et al 2016 seibert et al 2003 and discharge is commonly used as a metric of antecedent storage at the catchment scale bart and hope 2014 to represent evapotranspiration et we used potential et and calculated the mean rate occurring during the recession event segment pets the depletion of storage and the recession rates are the result of interactions between et and discharge eq 3 therefore the influence of et on concurrent recession rates may be masked in situations where discharge is the dominant flux depleting the storage if et on the other hand is the dominant flux the influence on recession rates might be more apparent therefore following shaw et al 2013 we also included the ratio pets qs where qs is the mean specific discharge rate during the recession event 2 9 catchment properties different catchment properties related to terrain vegetation and soils were calculated for each of the 14 subcatchments we used the same selection as karlsen et al 2016a and further details can be found there and in laudon et al 2013 for describing terrain we used mean slope elevation elevation above stream eas tangential curvature topographic wetness index twi median subcatchment area msca and the ratio between flow path length and gradient to stream lfs gfs soils were classified following the swedish geological survey sgu and a proportional cover of sediment peat till and thin soils were used land use is divided into lakes wetlands strongly correlated to peat soils agriculture excluded from the analysis due to only covering 2 of the total area and the remaining area was classified as forested soil depths were extracted from the sgu soil depth model daniels and thunholm 2014 tree volume derived from lidar and from a forest inventory represented vegetation density spatially variable potential evapotranspiration based on the turc method petturc and insolation lyon et al 2012 represented spatial variations in temperature and energy note that these metrics are temporally invariable a selection of the catchment properties is provided in table 1 3 results 3 1 spatial variability in aggregated storage discharge characteristics a median of 1181 data points corresponding to about 3 of the total measured time series were extracted for each catchment for the aggregated hourly dq dt analysis this number varied between 617 and 5068 for the individual catchments nearly all data points were selected during autumn or winter when the effect of evapotranspiration was small fig 2 fig 3 shows dq dt q plots with binned data and regression lines for c2 c7 and c16 for all catchments see fig a 1 in the supplementary material the aggregated storage discharge relationships established for each catchment showed some but generally weak relationships to catchment properties most pls models showed poor predictive ability in the cross validation analysis except for dynamic storage table 2 the recession parameter β which is the exponent representing the non linearity in recession behavior varied between 1 62 and 2 85 and was generally lower for catchments with lower slopes and elevation above stream eas typical for wetland and lake influenced catchments the pls model explained 41 of the spatial variability in β values between catchments r2y 0 43 but with poor predictive ability c2 0 11 recession timescales τ showed variable spatial patterns depending on the flow conditions but were not well related to catchment properties with low c2 for lower flow rates q75 smaller catchments with higher elevation above stream eas had the longest recession times the recession timescales varied between 16 and 38 days for q75 for higher flow rates q25 recession timescales varied between 2 5 and 9 days catchments with lower tree volume and till soils more lake influence and long low gradient flow paths to the stream had longer recession timescales the dynamic storage as estimated between the daily minimum and maximum specific discharge observed for each catchment was higher for catchments with lake influence and long low gradient flow paths to the stream and lower for catchments with high tree volume and till soils r2y 0 44 c2 0 27 the lowest dynamic storage was observed for c2 with 20 mm and the highest for c6 with 75 mm 3 2 temporal variation in recession characteristics and relationships to catchment properties the number of extracted recession events varied from 12 to 26 per catchment with a median of 19 events for all 14 catchments the variation in recession parameters for individual events varied between catchments as well as the clustering of events on the dq dt q plots fig 4 fig a 2 c5 which is draining a lake showed little variation in β between events and the recession events tend to plot closely together figs 4 and 5 for the till dominated catchments c1 and c2 a large scattering of the events and a moderate variation in β could be observed larger catchments and catchments with more sediment soils e g c16 c20 showed less variation in dq dt rates but a higher variability in β during spring the variation was generally lower both within and among catchments compared to summer and autumn median seasonal β values were the lowest in summer or spring and highest for all catchments in autumn fig 5 the relationships to catchment characteristics were stronger when β was calculated as seasonal median or as median of all recession events than β values derived from single aggregated relations table 3 the predictive power of catchment characteristics was greatest for explaining spatial variability in median summer β r2y 0 80 c2 0 68 and lowest for median spring β r2y 0 65 c2 0 48 average catchment terrain slope was the most influential variable in all models and steeper slopes were related to higher β which was also the case for the aggregated β model table 2 other variables related to higher β values across seasons were the proportion of sediment soil cover soil depth and catchment area the overall variation in β between recession events quantified as the interquartile range iqr showed that catchments with steeper slopes deep sediment soils and higher average elevation above stream had a larger variation between events 3 3 spatial variation during concurrent recession events there were 14 concurrent recession events during which events could be extracted for 10 or more of the catchments five of these events occurred during spring five during summer and four during autumn the relation between catchment properties and both β and recession event timescales τ using mean recession event discharge was generally strong table 4 recession timescales and β were often positively correlated for the recession events median rank correlation 0 7 and had similar explanatory variables with vip 1 a larger catchment area steeper slopes a higher sediment proportion deeper soils and a lower elevation were associated with longer τ and higher β shortest τ values were found in wetland and forest dominated small headwater catchments underlain by till while largest τ values were observed in larger catchments underlain by sediments generally the variability of τ in headwaters underlain by till c1 c2 c4 c5 was less than the variability τ in catchments that were larger and had more sediment soils e g c20 c15 c16 when comparing wet and dry conditions quantified as recession mean discharge some patterns can be seen between wetness state and vip rankings for explaining β and τ for τ eas was only considered important during the six recessions with relatively high discharge i e wetter where higher eas was related to longer recession timescales catchment area which often had vip 1 was higher ranked among the three most important variables during recession events with low discharge terrain slope which had vip 1 for all models for both β and τ was ranked more important than catchment area during wetter recessions and vice versa during drier recessions fig 6 this indicates some shifts in the spatial patterns of base flow formation depending on catchment wetness we also note that catchment area had lower importance in pls models where the two largest catchments c15 c16 were not included due to recessions not meeting set criteria or due to missing data suggesting that scale might not be of primary importance between smaller catchments but rather in describing differences between small and large catchments 3 4 relating temporal variation to evapotranspiration and antecedent storage temporal variation in β was moderately well explained and predicted with only three catchments with c2 values around 0 5 the remaining 11 catchments had c2 0 4 and three of which with c2 0 2 indicating poor predictive ability table a 1 the mean potential evaporation occurring over the recession segment was considered important vip 1 for all catchments metrics of antecedent catchment storage using discharge qp0 qp8 had vip 1 for four catchments the temporal variation in qr seg qr agg was better explained with all catchments having c2 0 5 metrics of catchment storage were considered important variables for all catchments fig 7 3 4 1 spatial patterns of et and antecedent storage influence to quantify the relationship between catchment properties and the influence of antecedent storage and et on recessions we compared the pls variable loadings from the plstβ temporal variation in β and plstqr temporal variation in qr seg qr agg models to catchment properties to simplify the analysis we present one metric for storage qp0 and potential evaporation rate pets since all pls models were fitted with one component the pls loading magnitudes were proportional to vip and describe the correlation between the explanatory variables here qp0 and pets and the responses here β and qr seg qr agg in the plstβ models qp0 loading magnitudes showed the strongest relation to catchment area fig 8 a spearman rank correlation r 0 82 p 0 05 meaning that antecedent storage was more strongly associated to temporal variation in β for larger catchments than for smaller catchments catchment slope and deeper sediment soils were also related to the loadings in a similar manner and considering other storage metrics shbv qp8 gave similar patterns the pets loadings showed an opposite pattern where smaller catchments had higher loading fig 8b r 0 72 p 0 05 the relation between catchment properties and loadings in the plstqr models were weaker compared to the plstβ models and the strongest relation was with eas catchments with higher eas showed higher loadings for qp0 fig 8c r 0 56 p 0 05 meaning antecedent storage was more important in explaining the variability of qr seg qr agg in these catchments than those with lower eas for the pets loadings the pattern was weaker fig 8d r 0 51 p 0 06 and pets loadings were low for all catchments vip 1 the highest loading was found for c6 and c9 both with low eas one explanation of the lack of association with pets could be that the effects are masked by events with higher flow et is expected to influence the recession most when it is relatively large compared to q only considering events when the ratio of pets and q is high 5 and 10 did however not result in stronger influence of pets but confirmed that pets has some influence on the catchments with low eas c5 c6 and c9 all being the catchments located closest downstream of the lake draining directly to the c5 gauging station 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variation in recession β and τ among catchments using the individual recession events to explore spatial variation among catchments we found strong relationships between landscape properties and recession non linearity β and timescales τ the most important catchment properties related to spatial variation in β and τ were catchment terrain slope catchment area deeper soils and sediment deposits more non linear recessions for catchments with deeper soils sediment deposits and larger catchment areas are consistent with the results of tague and grant 2004 and mcmillan et al 2014 at smaller spatial scales non linearity in recessions has been found to increase with catchment size and that this increase in β can be explained by increasing heterogeneity at larger scales due to different landscape classes and stores contributing to streamflow clark et al 2009 in our study low β median 1 0 was observed for c5 located directly downstream from a small lake consistent with open water hydraulics and thus very low degree of heterogeneity in the main contributing store bogaart et al 2015 in addition to topography and soils underlying catchment geology has often been found to explain spatial variability in recession characteristics among catchments see review in tallaksen 1995 in krycklan the bedrock geology is very uniform and thus cannot be linked to any observed variations in this study nevertheless in other regions underlying geology has been found to exert a strong control on storage and release of water e g jencso and mcglynn 2011 penna et al 2017 pfister et al 2017 this may be an important factor controlling recession behavior across larger boreal regions devito et al 2005 interestingly our results showed that catchments with steeper mean terrain slopes had higher β and longer τ which might seem contradictory to classic hydraulic theory suggesting that steeper sloping aquifers drain faster vogel and kroll 1992 in other studies both similar beck et al 2013 krakauer and temimi 2011 peña arancibia et al 2010 and contrasting brandes et al 2005 zecharias and brutsaert 1988 results have been reported in krycklan the steepest mean slopes are found for catchments with a proportion of sediment soils the lowest slopes are in wet area catchments and intermediate slopes are in till dominated catchments thus spatial patterns of mean catchment terrain slope are correlated with other catchment properties which can have a large influence on the recessions and terrain slope does not necessarily correspond to dominant aquifer properties for example in the deeper sediment soils we expect deeper groundwater systems with hydraulic gradients that are less related to terrain slope in these cases steeper slope corresponds to permeable soils with higher elevation above streams which could lead to a deeper groundwater flow system and slower recession similar to what was found by several other studies gao et al 2018 krakauer and temimi 2011 tague and grant 2004 the fraction of deeper groundwater in krycklan streams during winter base flow has previously been related to catchment area peralta tapia et al 2015 with the highest relative deep groundwater contributions in large catchments here we found both catchment area and sediment cover to be important factors for longer recession timescales for example the relatively small catchment c20 with relatively steep slopes and sediment soils near the stream channel often had the slowest recessions comparable to those of the main outlet c16 which has a catchment area that is 45 times larger additionally the slopes in krycklan are gentle compared to many other catchments and the variation in slope between catchments with similar soils is small it is thus possible that slope influences streamflow recession rates in for example till dominated catchments but there is not enough variation in this dataset to detect it in contrast to the analysis of individual events the aggregated analysis did not reveal any strong spatial patterns between recession behavior and landscape properties the weaker relationships with catchment properties for the aggregated analysis could be explained by not capturing the temporal variation in recession events or by the limited dataset which might not have been sufficient to fully describe the relationships temporally varying factors such as antecedent moisture conditions or variable contributing stores have been linked to shifts in recession curves between events mcmillan et al 2014 shaw et al 2013 fitting recession parameters through aggregated data clouds composed of such shifting individual events might not result in representative recession parameter values shaw and riha 2012 4 2 temporal variation and changing spatial patterns in krycklan the degree of temporal variation in β from individual recession events was highly variable among catchments mcmillan et al 2014 found similarly high temporal variability in recession β for individual recessions but did not investigate potential spatial or temporal controls on the temporal variability the variability in β among catchments was also changing between seasons with less spatial variation and low β during spring spring recessions follow the snowmelt when the landscape is generally at its wettest a possible explanation for the decrease in spatial variability during this wet period could be that spatial heterogeneity in the storage reservoirs contributing to streamflow is small across landscape e g a shallow fast reservoir dominates whereas later in summer and autumn there is larger heterogeneity in contributing stores following smaller recharge events shaw 2015 observed that non linearity in recession decreased β 1 otherwise 2 following a large rainfall and speculated whether this could mean a single linear reservoir dominated the recession with the otherwise non linear recessions being caused by variable contributions from several reservoirs the spatial patterns were relatively consistent among different recession events although the relative importance of different catchment properties varied with flow conditions for example catchment area gained importance as flow decreased whereas elevation above stream eas was only important when flows were relatively high changing spatial patterns for specific discharge between high and low flow periods have previously been observed in krycklan karlsen et al 2016a others have also seen changing controls on spatial base flow patterns for example payn et al 2012 observed a decreasing importance of topography and increasing geological controls as base flow declined changing spatial patterns of recession timescale between low and high flow were also seen by krakauer and temimi 2011 with soil infiltration capacity only associated with τ at low flows and forest cover only at high flows as the landscape became drier and flow decreased the positive association between catchment area and recession timescales became stronger we attribute this mainly to storage characteristics and a larger contribution of deeper slower flow paths in larger catchments and thicker sediment soils this is in line with other studies at krycklan where catchments with more sediment soils and larger area maintain a higher baseflow during dry periods karlsen et al 2016a and chemical tracers showing increasing contributions of older groundwater with catchment area during winter baseflow peralta tapia et al 2015 a more gradual release of water in areas with thicker soils and unsaturated zones as well as larger subsurface storage capacities has been observed across different environments gao et al 2018 penna et al 2017 this is possibly a more general trait of storage as a primary descriptor of catchment hydrological behavior mcnamara et al 2011 pfister et al 2017 a factor not considered explicitly in this study is the random spatial variation in precipitation on the event scale which is a source of noise in the analysis of individual recessions longer time series with more individual events to analyze could help reduce the effects of such variability and improve the degree of explanation 4 3 effects of evapotranspiration and antecedent storage on recession characteristics our results show that both et and storage can be linked to temporal variation in recession characteristics with varying influence for different catchments the rate of potential evapotranspiration occurring during a recession segment was overall the most important factor explaining temporal variation in β this implies that a higher et was related to lower β and hence shorter recession timescales and faster decline in discharge similar results have been shown in other catchments e g szilagyi et al 2007 weisman 1977 in larger catchments with deeper soils and deeper flow systems the effect of et on the variability in β was weaker and the association with storage was stronger whereas the effect of et on the variability in β was stronger for small catchments where dominant flow paths are likely to be more superficial peralta tapia et al 2015 tiwari et al 2014 deeper flow systems can be expected to be less influenced by transpiration and soil evaporation than more superficial systems where et results in a depletion of the reservoir that is contributing to streamflow both biswal and kumar 2014b and shaw et al 2013 examined the effect of et on the recession but concluded that there was little relation between recession rates and concurrent et one explanation might be that both studies used a fixed β and only examined variation in α i e shifts in recession curves in dq dt q space it is nevertheless possible that relatively small variations in β could be related to et a more likely explanation is that nearly all catchments in their studies are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the entire krycklan study catchment we observed a decreasing importance of et with increasing scale and it is possible that et has less direct influence on recessions in large catchment systems the general pattern in krycklan with recession shifts qr seg qr agg related to catchment antecedent storage has also been found in other studies bart and hope 2014 patnaik et al 2015 shaw 2015 shaw et al 2013 we hypothesize that these recession shifts as well as the degree of temporal variability in recession behavior is related to the degree of catchment storage heterogeneity catchments with more homogeneous storage control on discharge such as lake influenced catchments with low elevation above stream e g c5 c6 have a lower degree of non linearity and variability between recession events here a single reservoir dominated and the recession behavior did not change much over time catchments with larger heterogeneity in soils caused for example by a combination of till wetlands and sediment e g c20 c16 showed greater non linearity and variability between events this could be linked to variable contributions from different reservoirs with different drainage characteristics and variable storage over time as catchments are wetted up during sustained precipitation or snowmelt spatial variability in non linearity and recession timescales were reduced suggesting a convergence across the landscape to a dominance of shallow subsurface reservoirs with relatively short timescales compared to the reservoirs dominating during lower flow conditions previous studies which have characterized a single unique catchment scale storage discharge relationship have similarly noted that humid catchments and periods are better described brauer et al 2013 teuling et al 2010 and that dry conditions are better described with a more complex and temporally variable storage discharge relationship accounting for antecedent moisture conditions bart and hope 2014 li and nieber 2017 furthermore as storage accumulates in slower responding parts of the catchment recession rates decrease causing a shift in dq dt q once storage has increased in the slower responding storages a return to low flow conditions will be associated with drainage from these stores creating non linearity in the recession response bart and hope 2014 clark et al 2009 harman et al 2009 shaw 2015 this suggests that the shape of recessions is dependent on both the volume and distribution of storage within the landscape and that no single storage discharge relationship can be expected moore 1997 however in the smaller till dominated catchments c1 c2 where one would expect storage heterogeneity to be small considerable variability in the recession characteristics was found during wet periods with larger saturated storage more of the upslope area a slow responding reservoir gets connected and sustains the riparian storage controlling streamflow in such cases streamflow recession rates become slower compared to dry periods for runoff events occurring during dry periods the water table in these upslope areas remain relatively low and a thicker unsaturated zone is available to receive infiltration amvrosiadi et al 2017 recession rates then increase as the near stream zone are not sustained by upslope storage to the same extent precisely how these upslope areas connect and influence recession rates and what controls this process remains an open question that warrants further investigation it is however possible that the degree of non linearity depends on the drainage characteristics of different reservoirs together with the spatial configuration of the storage reservoirs and their respective contribution to base flow other have theorized that temporal variations in recession characteristics are controlled by changes in the drainage network extent as the network contracts with decreasing discharge biswal and kumar 2014b biswal and marani 2010 in krycklan the stream network extent has been shown to vary for different wetness conditions i e discharge especially during low flow conditions ågren et al 2015 thus the association we have made in this study to antecedent storage may very well be related at least in part to dynamic drainage networks as the two are likely to be closely related however the assumptions of uniform flow contributions along channels and top down orderly channel contraction in the biswal and marani 2010 model are often not met in real systems godsey and kirchner 2014 shaw et al 2017 including in krycklan karlsen et al 2016a we suggest that dynamic networks are not a controlling factor on dynamic recession behavior but that these are both affected by storage distribution and dynamics 5 conclusions the analysis using individual recession curves provided a more detailed insight into the spatial and temporal variation in recession behavior in the krycklan catchment than the aggregated analysis despite considerable variation in the recession behavior among catchments as derived from the aggregated analysis no strong relationships to catchment properties were found however the analysis of individual recession events identified strong relationships between recession behavior and catchment properties as well as temporal variability between seasons the questions remains though about the degree to which streamflow recessions are controlled by aquifer hydraulic properties alone and the role of spatial heterogeneity organization in catchment properties including antecedent water storage clark et al 2009 shaw 2015 troch et al 2013 in this study we found variable spatial patterns in recession behavior among catchments between wet and dry periods we hypothesize that these patterns are the result of different runoff generation processes and different degrees of heterogeneity in catchment storages contributing to streamflow future work should aim at finding meaningful model descriptions for these variable recession patterns and explore the role of how different stores of water contribute and connect across the landscape catchment size topography and the presence of deep soils were strongly related to recession behavior among catchments in krycklan these spatial patterns remained fairly stable over time despite large temporal variability in recession characteristics between events the relative influence of catchment properties varied with flow conditions the temporal variation in streamflow recession across the different catchments was also influenced by both et and antecedent storage conditions et was more influential in smaller catchments with shallow groundwater systems but less influential for systems with deeper groundwater systems lower antecedent storage generally resulted in faster recession rates compared to high antecedent storage together these analyses show that recession behavior among nearby catchments is highly variable but that this variability is related in a predictable way to catchment properties the ability to discern the underlying patterns in complex recession phenomena provides insights into the fundamental physical controls on the storage and release of water across this boreal region declaration of interests none acknowledgements we
