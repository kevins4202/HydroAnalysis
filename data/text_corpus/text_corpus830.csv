4150,the frequency of extreme precipitation is increasing globally and poses a significant threat to human and natural systems at the regional scale these changes are becoming increasingly uncertain therefore it is critical to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of extreme precipitation on a regional scale in this study we applied the connected component labelling algorithm to define regional extreme precipitation events repes this approach considers spatial coverage and its correlation with precipitation we further investigated the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation in the yangtze river basin using the empirical orthogonal function and examined their potential relationships with large scale climate indices including the el niño southern oscillation enso and pacific decadal oscillation pdo the results show that repes in the study area exhibited an increasing trend in both frequency and spatial coverage since 1970 in addition the integrated effects of pdo and enso have a significant impact on repes at various scales in summer and at large scales in winter we also analysed the differences in these events between the current year and the following year for pdo and enso combinations and found that the position of repes change with different pdo and enso combinations in both summer and winter season the spatiotemporal characteristics of repes in the study area reveal the corresponding connections with the east asian continent ocean 500 hpa pressure field based on our analysis and current predictions of these ocean atmospheric oscillations we suggest creating more repe scenarios for upcoming decades which may benefit forecasting and water resource management keywords yangtze river regional extreme precipitation spatiotemporal variability enso pdo 1 introduction the impact of extreme weather and climate change on the economy environment and human activities has become a major concern worldwide santos et al 2017 the ipcc pointed out that the incidence of extreme weather events has changed owing to human influence in many regions including the increase in extreme temperature and precipitation events barker et al 2009 murray and ebi 2012 furthermore increasingly intense precipitation extremes tend to cause more natural disasters such as landslides tichavsky et al 2019 crop failure beillouin et al 2020 and floods ashfaq et al 2010 therefore understanding the evolution of spatiotemporal variations in extreme precipitation events is critical for flood and water resource planning studies the spatial consistency or patterns of extreme events has previously been assessed for the evaluation of disasters however estimates of the spatial patterns of extreme precipitation may be uncertain because of the high spatial variation of precipitation and sparse observation networks in many regions min et al 2011 to solve this issue grid data have been generated by spatial interpolation and expansion based on data from measuring stations goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 wu et al 2018 and have been applied in many regional impact studies however most previous studies focused on analysing data at a single grid point han et al 2019 roxy et al 2017 ignoring the spatial consistency of extreme events nikumbh et al 2019 attempted to identify spatially adjacent grids that simultaneously experienced a certain amount of rainfall to study the spatial scale of extreme precipitation in central india however they did not conduct a comprehensive analysis on extreme precipitation over time the temporal variability of extreme precipitation in the yangtze river basin yrb is closely related to the north atlantic oscillation el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon wu 2017 wu and xu 2020 zhou et al 2020 enso affects precipitation anomalies by changing the circulation system wu et al 2003 and its relationship with the east asian summer monsoon is significant huijun 2001 the major impact of enso on precipitation mainly occurs in summer and autumn ouyang et al 2014 and the warm phase of enso events tends to increase the intensity of spring precipitation in the eastern part of the yrb mingzhong et al 2014 the effect of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo anomalies on precipitation changes with the alternation of the enso phase du et al 2019 while summer precipitation anomalies in the yangtze river delta are positive during the pdo phase dong 2016 in terms of the physical mechanism different pdo enso events affect the interannual variability of the main precipitation patterns in china through atmospheric teleconnections wu and mao 2018 when explaining these phenomena most studies focus on the atmospheric circulation characteristics of eurasia and the asian monsoon he et al 2020 xu et al 2015 in the mature enso phase the western pacific subtropical high is strengthened while ascending movements and abundant water vapour flux originating from the equatorial western pacific and the bay of bengal result in wet conditions in the mid lower reaches of the yrb wei et al 2020 the transformation of the pdo phase affects precipitation anomalies in southern china by changing the characteristics of atmospheric circulation over eurasia xu et al 2015 water vapour and atmospheric circulation characteristics are the main factors that influence precipitation the western pacific and the indian ocean provide large amounts of water vapour for east asia acting as the primary precipitation source for china the east asian continent ocean atmospheric circulation system is particularly important as a result the integrated effects of pdo enso on extreme precipitation as well as the connection between pdo enso and the east asian continent ocean circulation system should be further investigated most studies have investigated the connections between single oceanic atmospheric oscillations and the spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme precipitation han et al 2020 cayan et al 1999 sun et al 2015 while recent studies have indicated that integrated effects between different oceanic atmospheric oscillations should be considered to explain extreme precipitation variations jiang et al 2013a jiang et al 2013b additionally it is also necessary to identify the spatial coverage of regional events that to our knowledge have been conducted by only a few studies nikumbh et al 2019 especially using the connected component labelling algorithm falcao et al 2004 which is commonly applied in graph theory this study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of extreme regional precipitation in the yrb we seek to 1 identify the spatial coverage of the regional extreme precipitation events repes using the connected component labelling algorithm and 2 evaluate the integrated impacts of pdo enso and the corresponding east asian continental ocean circulation system on the evolution of extreme precipitation events 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb is located from 24 30 n to 35 45 n and 90 33 e to 122 25 e and covers an area of approximately 1 8 million km2 it straddles the three major economic zones of eastern central and western china and is the third largest river basin in the world the yrb presents a multi level terraced terrain including mountains plateaus basins hills and plains with most of this region dominated by a typical subtropical monsoon climate except for some areas over the tibetan plateau precipitation during the year is mainly concentrated in the summer and most of the water vapour in the basin comes from the pacific and indian oceans yihui and chan 2005 in particular the annual precipitation in the upper reaches of the basin is 400 mm year whereas that in the lower reaches is 1 600 mm year gu et al 2018 in the present study the yrb was divided into three parts upper middle and lower areas with yichang and hukou as the dividing points fig 1 the qinghai tibet plateau was not considered in the upper region as the grid precipitation data in this region are not reliable because of the sparse precipitation network 2 2 data sources in the present study the daily precipitation dataset was a 0 5 0 5 gridded daily precipitation dataset v2 0 of 1970 2020 obtained from the chinese meteorological administration http data cma cn this dataset was constructed based on 2 472 observed rain gauge stations across china data are temporarily missing in taiwan and the south china sea islands and resampled using thin plate splines and gtopo30 global 30 arc second elevation data the quality of the dataset was strictly controlled and cross validation tests showed that this gauge based analysis has high quantitativeness with an annual interpolation error typically 0 49 mm and a correlation coefficient of 0 93 according to the methods described by national meteorological information center nmic and zhao et al nmic 2012 zhao et al 2014a b the station distribution within the cells is shown in supplementary fig 5 more details on the calculation process and station distribution information are described by nmic nmic 2012 showing that the station coverage in our study area is 77 this dataset has been extensively used to explore the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation in china han et al 2019 wang et al 2013 wu 2018 the large scale ocean atmospheric circulation indices selected in this study included enso https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 and pdo https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data pdo long data to explore the influence of different pdo enso modes on the eurasian pressure field the geopotential height data 500 hpa during 1970 2020 were derived from the ncep ncar reanalysis data https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html because of the sparse rainfall stations in the qinghai tibet plateau the accuracy of precipitation data in this region was very low in contrast the rainfall stations in southern china were denser and the data accuracy was thus better therefore we chose the yrb in southern china as our research area and omitted data from the qinghai tibet plateau 3 methods 3 1 definition and classification of repes it is difficult to analyse precipitation on a single grid which causes the spatiality of precipitation to be lost for example one repe can occur at multiple grid points simultaneously but it is recorded as many extreme precipitation events if a single grid point analysis is conducted therefore for processing precipitation gridded data spatial correlation needs to be considered if precipitation analysis is only conducted at a single grid point without considering its relationship with adjacent grid points then the spatial consistency of precipitation is ignored which is particularly important for studying extreme precipitation therefore it is necessary to identify the spatial coverage of regional events and the connected component labelling algorithm falcao et al 2004 is suitable for this purpose the connected component labelling algorithm is commonly used in graph theory and it has very few applications in hydrology nikumbh et al 2019 although the precipitation gridded dataset and graph pixels are very similar in the present study we use the 8 connected component labelling algorithm to identify repes as it considers the spatial coverage and correlation of precipitation a threshold was selected to define extreme precipitation the most commonly used percentile thresholds are 95 and 99 which depend on the extreme precipitation evaluation requirements howarth et al 2019 gao and xie 2016 in the current study we assembled the daily data daily precipitation 1 mm of each grid from 1970 to 2020 in ascending order and then took the 99th percentile as the extreme precipitation threshold of the grid points thereafter we extracted the gridded data on a daily scale and scanned it to identify repes if the edges or corners of the grid points where extreme precipitation occurs are in contact these grid points have connectivity in other words two adjoining grid points where extreme precipitation occurs are part of the same object if they are connected along horizontal vertical or diagonal directions fig 2 a connected grid points where extreme precipitation occurred simultaneously were defined as one repe nikumbh et al 2019 we introduced two time dependent parameters the total number of extreme precipitation grid points was recorded as nt and the total number of repes was recorded as ne fig 2 b to reflect the scale of one repe we introduced a new physical quantity s the average size of one repe which is given by s n t n e for a year in the current study the time step of the repes was one day 3 2 empirical orthogonal function to analyse the main distribution characteristics of repes at different scales an empirical orthogonal function eof was used to identify the dominant pattern of repes lorenz 1956 this method aims to identify and extract the spatiotemporal modes which are ordered with respect to their representations of data variance and their measured importance or contribution and has been used for investigating the spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation variations in many studies jiang et al 2013a merino et al 2019 eof analysis can produce a set of modes consisting of spatial structures eof and corresponding time series pc eof analysis is actually a mathematical feature vector analysis and the results of eof analysis are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix formed from the input data the signs of the results are arbitrary in the present work we calculated the annual accumulated repes for all grids in different seasons and obtained the first leading modes eof1 and the corresponding pc which reflects the most important largest proportion spatial distribution characteristics of repes the significance test of the feature vector was applied according to the rule of thumb north et al 1982 and we found that the first three modes of all types in different seasons were independent however for the summer we found that the variances of other modes except for the first mode of small extreme precipitation events sepes and middle extreme precipitation events mepes were 8 which is too low to be representative because winter repes account for 10 of those in the entire year and the sample size was small therefore we only considered the first mode for analysis in the present study 3 3 mann kendall test to analyse the annual trend of repes the repe indices were calculated and examined using the linear fit method and the mann kendall test kendall m 1975 mann h d 1945 sneyers 1990 this is a rank based non parametric method that has been widely applied to detect trends in hydro climatic time series zhao et al 2014a b zhao et al 2010 the mann kendall test requires data to be serially independent the standardised statistic of the mann kendall test is z and positive and negative z values indicate upward and downward trends respectively the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z 1 96 at the 5 significance level the time series are independent according to the calculated autocorrelation coefficients at lag 1 for each annual time series nt ne s 3 4 permutation test to explore the significance and spatial distribution of the 500 hpa pressure field in different pdo enso phases the 500 hpa pressure field data in east asia and north pacific were tested using permutation tests in the present study the permutation test was used to test the statistical significance of abnormal patterns here we extracted a certain set of abnormal precipitation values in specific years from the original data calculated their average value a1 and then calculated the average of the remaining data set b1 the difference between the two averages was the first difference variable v1 v1 a1 b1 then the original dataset was randomly sampled to calculate the new average a2 the number of sampling years is equal to the number of specific years for example the total number of years of the pdo el niño is 10 meaning the number of sampling years is 10 and the number of specific years is constant and the other average value was calculated b2 the difference between the two new averages was the second difference variable v2 v2 a2 b2 this process was repeated 2000 times to obtain multiple variables v3 v4 v2000 if the size of the first difference variable exceeded the 95th or 5th percentile of other difference variables then anomalies from the original data set were considered significant at the 10 level 4 results 4 1 general trends of repes in the yrb according to the mann kendall test the nt ne and s time series showed a significant increasing trend at the 99 confidence level mann kendall test values were 10 35 2 55 and 2 79 respectively as shown in fig 3 the nt and ne indices increase 31 86 and 3 36 fold every 10 years respectively the average size of repes showed a significant slowly increasing trend the purpose of trend analysis was to illustrate the changes in the overall number and spatial coverage of repes although this analysis could not provide additional information on regional extreme events this result indicated that extreme precipitation events increased in both frequency and spatial coverage over the past 51 years regardless of the classification 4 2 leading modes of seasonal repes the eof modes of repes were evaluated for both summer may september and winter october april of the following year because of the obvious seasonal variation in this region furthermore we classified repes according to their spatial scales in the study of global precipitation systems precipitation systems smaller than 1 104 km2 approximately equal to four grid points of 0 5 0 5 are defined as small precipitation systems zhang and wang 2021 we defined precipitation systems smaller than 1 104 km2 as sepe for precipitation systems 1 104 km2 we referred to the classification method of nikumbh et al 2019 and used 6 104 km2 approximately equal to 24 grid points of 0 5 0 5 as the dividing line between mepe and large extreme precipitation events lepe thus the spatial scales of different types of extreme precipitation events were as follows sepe 2 number of grid points 4 mepe 5 number of grid points 23 and lepe 24 number of grid points the results indicated that 91 of repes occur in the summer eof analysis was carried out on the repes at different spatial scales in summer and winter in the study area to better analyse the characteristics of different repe scales in different seasons the present study only retained the most important mode the first mode as the analysis object figs 4 and 5 the difference in spatial distribution between summer and winter was particularly obvious regardless of the spatial scale the area that failed to pass the significance test in winter exceeded 2 3 of the research area whereas it was very small in summer this is directly related to seasonal variations in precipitation in this region to better expand and interpret differences in repes with time we conducted mutation tests pettitt 1979 sneyers 1990 on each time series and found that most of the modal times had mutation points between 1990 and 1999 supplementary fig 1 supplementary table 1 precisely corresponding to the shift in pdo from the warm phase pdo to the cold phase pdo campozano et al 2020 mantua et al 1997 many scholars wang et al 2000 zeng et al 2020 found that the change in enso is closely related to extreme precipitation events in southern china so we used different phase combinations of pdo enso to investigate the relationship between global sea temperature pressure field changes and the repes in the research area the enso and pdo data were divided into positive and negative phases the pdo was divided into three stages 1970 1975 pdo 1976 1996 pdo and 1997 2020 pdo the enso warm phase el niño is years wherein the enso monthly data is greater than or equal to 0 5 c and lasts for at least 5 months whereas the enso cold phase la niña is years wherein enso monthly data is less than or equal to 0 5 c and lasts for at least 5 months fig 6 lists the number of years for the pdo enso combination several studies have shown that the global weather system changes caused by enso in the current year cy and the following year fy are vastly different jourdain et al 2015 ren et al 2017 the current study subdivided the years affected by enso into the current year and the year following the enso event we used the permutation test to calculate the relationship between repes and pdo enso with different phases and found that it corresponds well with the spatial relationship found during the eof analysis the distribution of the first eof mode of sepe during summer fig 4 a was not significant during 1970 1990 and sepes were mainly distributed in the upper southeast middle south and lower north areas during 1990 2000 and 2010 2020 pc 0 this phenomenon corresponds well to the significant area of the permutation test in both pdo el niño fy fig 7 j and pdo la niña cy fig 7 a the two modes pdo el niño fy and pdo la niña cy have the most significant impact on the distribution of repes fig 7 b c k l corresponding to the main significant regions of the first mode of the summer mepe fig 4 c and summer lepe fig 4 e to explore the influence of pdo enso we used field data of the 500 hpa geopotential height for analysis when pdo el niño fy and pdo la niña cy occur there is a significant difference in the pressure field between the east asia and the ocean the ocean pressure drops significantly during el niño fy fig 8 h and the continental pressure increases significantly during la niña cy fig 8 c both these phenomena tend to prevent the moisture carried by the summer monsoon from being transported north of the yrb the first eof mode of summer mepes fig 4 c is significant in the south lower area pc 0 corresponding with the area where the influence of pdo el niño is significant fig 7 h at this time owing to the western pacific subtropical high the pressure over the indian ocean and northern china increased significantly fig 8 d the western pacific subtropical high and the pressure over the indian ocean enable more water vapour from the indian and pacific oceans to be transported inland however the increase in pressure in northern china hinders the transportation of water vapour north of the yrb causing precipitation to increase significantly in the southern part in the lower area of the yrb the first eof mode of summer lepes fig 4 e is significant in the middle of the upper areas and north of the middle area pc 0 corresponding to all four combinations of pdo enso pdo la niña cy fy supplementary fig 2 c f wherein the south asian high increases significantly fig 8 a e causes a significant increase in summer lepes in the middle of the upper area pdo el niño cy fy supplementary fig 2 i l wherein the pressure over south china sea increases significantly and the pressure field in northern china decreases significantly causes a significant increase in summer lepes in the northern part of the middle area fig 8 b f there were no obvious features in the first sepe eof mode in winter fig 5 a while there were significant areas for the first eof mode of winter mepe fig 5 c in the northern upper and southern lower areas pc 0 however a corresponding area is missing in the pdo enso correlation analysis the first eof mode of lepe during winter fig 5 e has significant areas north of the middle area and north of the lower area pc 0 corresponding to the main significant areas of pdo la niña cy supplementary fig 3 c and pdo el niño cy fy supplementary fig 3 i l at this time the air pressure over the northwest pacific decreased significantly fig 7 i n 4 3 long range forecast for repes the prediction of future ocean atmosphere oscillations may help predict repe changes in the next few decades many studies have shown that summer precipitation in the yrb is related to pdo phases song and wang 2020 zhang et al 2018 although some studies have also shown that the pdo might persist lapp et al 2012 mochizuki et al 2010 and enso may occur more frequently in the future jin et al 2003 timmermann et al 1999 the present study can considerably help predict future repe scenarios in the present study summer repes were mainly related to pdo so we predict that summer repes will increase in the next few decades based on the summer pdo enso analysis fig 7 we then forecast increased summer sepes at the centre of the lower and middle areas increased summer mepes south of the middle area and north of the lower area and increased summer lepes at the centre and north of the lower area winter repes occur far less than summer repes but they are still possible in the present study winter repes primarily occurred in the pdo phase so we predict that winter repes might decrease in the next few decades based on the winter pdo enso analysis supplementary fig 4 l we then forecast winter lepes south of the lower area during el niño fy if repes occur during pdo stages 5 summary and discussion the accuracy of the repes depends on the grid resolution therefore the higher the accuracy of the grid data used the more accurate the repes obtained however for grid data with extremely high accuracy such as several kilometres additional conditions may be required when defining repes for example because the area covered by a single grid is very small an extreme precipitation event with an extensive spatial coverage may be divided into several repes that are very close to each other in general the advantage of this method is that it considers spatial consistency but further evaluations of the spatial resolution of grid size and temporal resolution of extreme precipitation time series are necessary we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of repes in the yrb and their connection with ocean atmospheric oscillations such as pdo enso and 500 hpa pressure field anomalies our analysis shows that in the past 51 years regardless of the spatial scale repes in the yrb have increased significantly and their scale has become more extensive furthermore we found that 91 of repes occurred in summer the leading modes of repe variability and the connections between the pdo and enso are dependent on each other during pdo stages summer lepes occur in the upper area during the la niña cy fy which might be related to the increase in the south asia high winter repes primarily occur north of the middle area and north of the lower area in the form of lepes during pdo la niña cy and pdo el niño cy fy which might be related to the significant drop in pressure in the northwest pacific during pdo stages regardless of the spatial scale summer repes are related to la niña cy and el niño fy and their influence covers the entire yrb however we did not find any influence of pdo stages on winter repes in addition our results have implications for predicting seasonal repes over the next few decades over the yrb if the current pdo phase persists lapp et al 2012 mochizuki et al 2010 and ensos occur more frequently in the future jin et al 2003 timmermann et al 1999 summer repes might increase in the middle and lower areas and winter repes might decrease in the entire yrb it is worth noting that besides the oceanic atmospheric oscillation that affects the seasonal variations in extreme precipitation other factors including land surface processes and anthropogenic effects also appear to be important tabari et al 2020 although this study explains the first mode of repes anthropogenic processes can directly affect the spatiotemporal distribution of hydrological conditions in the yrb jiao et al 2020 nanding et al 2020 furthermore the increase in urbanisation has also changed the local atmospheric circulation pattern ma and zhang 2015 in addition pdo has become more difficult to predict because of the intensification of the greenhouse effect li et al 2019 although multi model ensemble projections can be used to analyse the impact of human activities and ocean atmospheric oscillations on extreme precipitation wang et al 2011 yang et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to further study the combined effects of ocean atmospheric oscillations and human activities on extreme precipitation finally it should be noted that we discuss extreme precipitation mainly from the aspect of spatial distribution an extension of the current research would be to investigate the connections between extreme precipitation and the combined physical oceanic and atmospheric

strictly controlled and cross validation tests showed that this gauge based analysis has high quantitativeness with an annual interpolation error typically 0 49 mm and a correlation coefficient of 0 93 according to the methods described by national meteorological information center nmic and zhao et al nmic 2012 zhao et al 2014a b the station distribution within the cells is shown in supplementary fig 5 more details on the calculation process and station distribution information are described by nmic nmic 2012 showing that the station coverage in our study area is 77 this dataset has been extensively used to explore the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation in china han et al 2019 wang et al 2013 wu 2018 the large scale ocean atmospheric circulation indices selected in this study included enso https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries nino34 and pdo https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries data pdo long data to explore the influence of different pdo enso modes on the eurasian pressure field the geopotential height data 500 hpa during 1970 2020 were derived from the ncep ncar reanalysis data https psl noaa gov data gridded data ncep reanalysis html because of the sparse rainfall stations in the qinghai tibet plateau the accuracy of precipitation data in this region was very low in contrast the rainfall stations in southern china were denser and the data accuracy was thus better therefore we chose the yrb in southern china as our research area and omitted data from the qinghai tibet plateau 3 methods 3 1 definition and classification of repes it is difficult to analyse precipitation on a single grid which causes the spatiality of precipitation to be lost for example one repe can occur at multiple grid points simultaneously but it is recorded as many extreme precipitation events if a single grid point analysis is conducted therefore for processing precipitation gridded data spatial correlation needs to be considered if precipitation analysis is only conducted at a single grid point without considering its relationship with adjacent grid points then the spatial consistency of precipitation is ignored which is particularly important for studying extreme precipitation therefore it is necessary to identify the spatial coverage of regional events and the connected component labelling algorithm falcao et al 2004 is suitable for this purpose the connected component labelling algorithm is commonly used in graph theory and it has very few applications in hydrology nikumbh et al 2019 although the precipitation gridded dataset and graph pixels are very similar in the present study we use the 8 connected component labelling algorithm to identify repes as it considers the spatial coverage and correlation of precipitation a threshold was selected to define extreme precipitation the most commonly used percentile thresholds are 95 and 99 which depend on the extreme precipitation evaluation requirements howarth et al 2019 gao and xie 2016 in the current study we assembled the daily data daily precipitation 1 mm of each grid from 1970 to 2020 in ascending order and then took the 99th percentile as the extreme precipitation threshold of the grid points thereafter we extracted the gridded data on a daily scale and scanned it to identify repes if the edges or corners of the grid points where extreme precipitation occurs are in contact these grid points have connectivity in other words two adjoining grid points where extreme precipitation occurs are part of the same object if they are connected along horizontal vertical or diagonal directions fig 2 a connected grid points where extreme precipitation occurred simultaneously were defined as one repe nikumbh et al 2019 we introduced two time dependent parameters the total number of extreme precipitation grid points was recorded as nt and the total number of repes was recorded as ne fig 2 b to reflect the scale of one repe we introduced a new physical quantity s the average size of one repe which is given by s n t n e for a year in the current study the time step of the repes was one day 3 2 empirical orthogonal function to analyse the main distribution characteristics of repes at different scales an empirical orthogonal function eof was used to identify the dominant pattern of repes lorenz 1956 this method aims to identify and extract the spatiotemporal modes which are ordered with respect to their representations of data variance and their measured importance or contribution and has been used for investigating the spatiotemporal pattern of precipitation variations in many studies jiang et al 2013a merino et al 2019 eof analysis can produce a set of modes consisting of spatial structures eof and corresponding time series pc eof analysis is actually a mathematical feature vector analysis and the results of eof analysis are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix formed from the input data the signs of the results are arbitrary in the present work we calculated the annual accumulated repes for all grids in different seasons and obtained the first leading modes eof1 and the corresponding pc which reflects the most important largest proportion spatial distribution characteristics of repes the significance test of the feature vector was applied according to the rule of thumb north et al 1982 and we found that the first three modes of all types in different seasons were independent however for the summer we found that the variances of other modes except for the first mode of small extreme precipitation events sepes and middle extreme precipitation events mepes were 8 which is too low to be representative because winter repes account for 10 of those in the entire year and the sample size was small therefore we only considered the first mode for analysis in the present study 3 3 mann kendall test to analyse the annual trend of repes the repe indices were calculated and examined using the linear fit method and the mann kendall test kendall m 1975 mann h d 1945 sneyers 1990 this is a rank based non parametric method that has been widely applied to detect trends in hydro climatic time series zhao et al 2014a b zhao et al 2010 the mann kendall test requires data to be serially independent the standardised statistic of the mann kendall test is z and positive and negative z values indicate upward and downward trends respectively the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z 1 96 at the 5 significance level the time series are independent according to the calculated autocorrelation coefficients at lag 1 for each annual time series nt ne s 3 4 permutation test to explore the significance and spatial distribution of the 500 hpa pressure field in different pdo enso phases the 500 hpa pressure field data in east asia and north pacific were tested using permutation tests in the present study the permutation test was used to test the statistical significance of abnormal patterns here we extracted a certain set of abnormal precipitation values in specific years from the original data calculated their average value a1 and then calculated the average of the remaining data set b1 the difference between the two averages was the first difference variable v1 v1 a1 b1 then the original dataset was randomly sampled to calculate the new average a2 the number of sampling years is equal to the number of specific years for example the total number of years of the pdo el niño is 10 meaning the number of sampling years is 10 and the number of specific years is constant and the other average value was calculated b2 the difference between the two new averages was the second difference variable v2 v2 a2 b2 this process was repeated 2000 times to obtain multiple variables v3 v4 v2000 if the size of the first difference variable exceeded the 95th or 5th percentile of other difference variables then anomalies from the original data set were considered significant at the 10 level 4 results 4 1 general trends of repes in the yrb according to the mann kendall test the nt ne and s time series showed a significant increasing trend at the 99 confidence level mann kendall test values were 10 35 2 55 and 2 79 respectively as shown in fig 3 the nt and ne indices increase 31 86 and 3 36 fold every 10 years respectively the average size of repes showed a significant slowly increasing trend the purpose of trend analysis was to illustrate the changes in the overall number and spatial coverage of repes although this analysis could not provide additional information on regional extreme events this result indicated that extreme precipitation events increased in both frequency and spatial coverage over the past 51 years regardless of the classification 4 2 leading modes of seasonal repes the eof modes of repes were evaluated for both summer may september and winter october april of the following year because of the obvious seasonal variation in this region furthermore we classified repes according to their spatial scales in the study of global precipitation systems precipitation systems smaller than 1 104 km2 approximately equal to four grid points of 0 5 0 5 are defined as small precipitation systems zhang and wang 2021 we defined precipitation systems smaller than 1 104 km2 as sepe for precipitation systems 1 104 km2 we referred to the classification method of nikumbh et al 2019 and used 6 104 km2 approximately equal to 24 grid points of 0 5 0 5 as the dividing line between mepe and large extreme precipitation events lepe thus the spatial scales of different types of extreme precipitation events were as follows sepe 2 number of grid points 4 mepe 5 number of grid points 23 and lepe 24 number of grid points the results indicated that 91 of repes occur in the summer eof analysis was carried out on the repes at different spatial scales in summer and winter in the study area to better analyse the characteristics of different repe scales in different seasons the present study only retained the most important mode the first mode as the analysis object figs 4 and 5 the difference in spatial distribution between summer and winter was particularly obvious regardless of the spatial scale the area that failed to pass the significance test in winter exceeded 2 3 of the research area whereas it was very small in summer this is directly related to seasonal variations in precipitation in this region to better expand and interpret differences in repes with time we conducted mutation tests pettitt 1979 sneyers 1990 on each time series and found that most of the modal times had mutation points between 1990 and 1999 supplementary fig 1 supplementary table 1 precisely corresponding to the shift in pdo from the warm phase pdo to the cold phase pdo campozano et al 2020 mantua et al 1997 many scholars wang et al 2000 zeng et al 2020 found that the change in enso is closely related to extreme precipitation events in southern china so we used different phase combinations of pdo enso to investigate the relationship between global sea temperature pressure field changes and the repes in the research area the enso and pdo data were divided into positive and negative phases the pdo was divided into three stages 1970 1975 pdo 1976 1996 pdo and 1997 2020 pdo the enso warm phase el niño is years wherein the enso monthly data is greater than or equal to 0 5 c and lasts for at least 5 months whereas the enso cold phase la niña is years wherein enso monthly data is less than or equal to 0 5 c and lasts for at least 5 months fig 6 lists the number of years for the pdo enso combination several studies have shown that the global weather system changes caused by enso in the current year cy and the following year fy are vastly different jourdain et al 2015 ren et al 2017 the current study subdivided the years affected by enso into the current year and the year following the enso event we used the permutation test to calculate the relationship between repes and pdo enso with different phases and found that it corresponds well with the spatial relationship found during the eof analysis the distribution of the first eof mode of sepe during summer fig 4 a was not significant during 1970 1990 and sepes were mainly distributed in the upper southeast middle south and lower north areas during 1990 2000 and 2010 2020 pc 0 this phenomenon corresponds well to the significant area of the permutation test in both pdo el niño fy fig 7 j and pdo la niña cy fig 7 a the two modes pdo el niño fy and pdo la niña cy have the most significant impact on the distribution of repes fig 7 b c k l corresponding to the main significant regions of the first mode of the summer mepe fig 4 c and summer lepe fig 4 e to explore the influence of pdo enso we used field data of the 500 hpa geopotential height for analysis when pdo el niño fy and pdo la niña cy occur there is a significant difference in the pressure field between the east asia and the ocean the ocean pressure drops significantly during el niño fy fig 8 h and the continental pressure increases significantly during la niña cy fig 8 c both these phenomena tend to prevent the moisture carried by the summer monsoon from being transported north of the yrb the first eof mode of summer mepes fig 4 c is significant in the south lower area pc 0 corresponding with the area where the influence of pdo el niño is significant fig 7 h at this time owing to the western pacific subtropical high the pressure over the indian ocean and northern china increased significantly fig 8 d the western pacific subtropical high and the pressure over the indian ocean enable more water vapour from the indian and pacific oceans to be transported inland however the increase in pressure in northern china hinders the transportation of water vapour north of the yrb causing precipitation to increase significantly in the southern part in the lower area of the yrb the first eof mode of summer lepes fig 4 e is significant in the middle of the upper areas and north of the middle area pc 0 corresponding to all four combinations of pdo enso pdo la niña cy fy supplementary fig 2 c f wherein the south asian high increases significantly fig 8 a e causes a significant increase in summer lepes in the middle of the upper area pdo el niño cy fy supplementary fig 2 i l wherein the pressure over south china sea increases significantly and the pressure field in northern china decreases significantly causes a significant increase in summer lepes in the northern part of the middle area fig 8 b f there were no obvious features in the first sepe eof mode in winter fig 5 a while there were significant areas for the first eof mode of winter mepe fig 5 c in the northern upper and southern lower areas pc 0 however a corresponding area is missing in the pdo enso correlation analysis the first eof mode of lepe during winter fig 5 e has significant areas north of the middle area and north of the lower area pc 0 corresponding to the main significant areas of pdo la niña cy supplementary fig 3 c and pdo el niño cy fy supplementary fig 3 i l at this time the air pressure over the northwest pacific decreased significantly fig 7 i n 4 3 long range forecast for repes the prediction of future ocean atmosphere oscillations may help predict repe changes in the next few decades many studies have shown that summer precipitation in the yrb is related to pdo phases song and wang 2020 zhang et al 2018 although some studies have also shown that the pdo might persist lapp et al 2012 mochizuki et al 2010 and enso may occur more frequently in the future jin et al 2003 timmermann et al 1999 the present study can considerably help predict future repe scenarios in the present study summer repes were mainly related to pdo so we predict that summer repes will increase in the next few decades based on the summer pdo enso analysis fig 7 we then forecast increased summer sepes at the centre of the lower and middle areas increased summer mepes south of the middle area and north of the lower area and increased summer lepes at the centre and north of the lower area winter repes occur far less than summer repes but they are still possible in the present study winter repes primarily occurred in the pdo phase so we predict that winter repes might decrease in the next few decades based on the winter pdo enso analysis supplementary fig 4 l we then forecast winter lepes south of the lower area during el niño fy if repes occur during pdo stages 5 summary and discussion the accuracy of the repes depends on the grid resolution therefore the higher the accuracy of the grid data used the more accurate the repes obtained however for grid data with extremely high accuracy such as several kilometres additional conditions may be required when defining repes for example because the area covered by a single grid is very small an extreme precipitation event with an extensive spatial coverage may be divided into several repes that are very close to each other in general the advantage of this method is that it considers spatial consistency but further evaluations of the spatial resolution of grid size and temporal resolution of extreme precipitation time series are necessary we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of repes in the yrb and their connection with ocean atmospheric oscillations such as pdo enso and 500 hpa pressure field anomalies our analysis shows that in the past 51 years regardless of the spatial scale repes in the yrb have increased significantly and their scale has become more extensive furthermore we found that 91 of repes occurred in summer the leading modes of repe variability and the connections between the pdo and enso are dependent on each other during pdo stages summer lepes occur in the upper area during the la niña cy fy which might be related to the increase in the south asia high winter repes primarily occur north of the middle area and north of the lower area in the form of lepes during pdo la niña cy and pdo el niño cy fy which might be related to the significant drop in pressure in the northwest pacific during pdo stages regardless of the spatial scale summer repes are related to la niña cy and el niño fy and their influence covers the entire yrb however we did not find any influence of pdo stages on winter repes in addition our results have implications for predicting seasonal repes over the next few decades over the yrb if the current pdo phase persists lapp et al 2012 mochizuki et al 2010 and ensos occur more frequently in the future jin et al 2003 timmermann et al 1999 summer repes might increase in the middle and lower areas and winter repes might decrease in the entire yrb it is worth noting that besides the oceanic atmospheric oscillation that affects the seasonal variations in extreme precipitation other factors including land surface processes and anthropogenic effects also appear to be important tabari et al 2020 although this study explains the first mode of repes anthropogenic processes can directly affect the spatiotemporal distribution of hydrological conditions in the yrb jiao et al 2020 nanding et al 2020 furthermore the increase in urbanisation has also changed the local atmospheric circulation pattern ma and zhang 2015 in addition pdo has become more difficult to predict because of the intensification of the greenhouse effect li et al 2019 although multi model ensemble projections can be used to analyse the impact of human activities and ocean atmospheric oscillations on extreme precipitation wang et al 2011 yang et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to further study the combined effects of ocean atmospheric oscillations and human activities on extreme precipitation finally it should be noted that we discuss extreme precipitation mainly from the aspect of spatial distribution an extension of the current research would be to investigate the connections between extreme precipitation and the combined physical oceanic and atmospheric

4151,errors in hydrological simulations have impacted their applications in flood prediction and water resources management properly characterizing the properties of errors such as heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation can provide improved hydrological predictions here we present a probabilistic long short term memory lstm network for modeling hydrological residual errors three steps are undertaken to characterize uncertainty using the lstm i the network is trained with gradient optimization to obtain optimal predictions ii the distribution of the errors for optimal predictions are estimated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm iii probabilistic predictions are made using the inferred error distribution and optimal predictions we examine the model in the source of yellow river china over the period 1992 2015 a distributed hydrological model mike she is applied to simulate streamflows in the catchment as benchmarks we compare the results with a bayesian linear regression model and a traditional probabilistic residual error model results show the probabilistic lstm network reduces the heteroscedasticity and removes almost all autocorrelations in residual errors besides compared with the other two methods the proposed method produces more than 50 narrower uncertainty intervals with the best probability coverage our results highlight the potential ability of a deep learning approach integrated with a hydrological model to better characterize predictive uncertainty in hydrologic modeling keywords residual error modeling distributed hydrological model lstm predictive uncertainty bayesian mcmc 1 introduction quantifying and reducing predictive uncertainty remains a challenging issue in the field of hydrology blöschl et al 2019 in recent years many approaches have been developed for improved uncertainty quantification for hydrologic models however difficulties still remain in explicitly accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty han and coulibaly 2017 effective frameworks such as bayesian total error analysis batea kavetski et al 2002 kavetski et al 2006 and the integrated bayesian uncertainty estimator ibune ajami et al 2007 can quantify individual sources of uncertainty in rainfall runoff modeling explicitly to estimate total predictive uncertainty however critics may suggest these approaches are overly complex and not pragmatic for operational hydrologic modeling and identifying each source of uncertainty is not necessary evin et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 residual error models smith et al 2015 are a more simple approach that aggregates all sources of errors such as observation error model parameter error and model structure error as a single lumped predictive uncertainty jiang et al 2019 they provide a statistical description of the differences between observation and simulation evin et al 2014 it has been known that residual errors exist heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation evin et al 2014 kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 inappropriate assumptions made for the property of residual errors can lead to unreliable and inaccurate predictions smith et al 2015 how to properly characterize residual errors is gaining more attention montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 papacharalampous et al 2020a residual error models can be roughly classified into two types one class of method focuses on building the form of likelihood function based on a bayesian framework by making assumptions about the statistical properties of the model errors this class may be termed the formal residual error model a simple formal residual error model assumes the residual errors are independent homoscedastic and gaussian smith et al 2015 however other approaches have been developed to characterize correlated heteroscedastic and non gaussian errors bates and campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 2014 jiang et al 2019 marshall et al 2006 mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 schoups and vrugt 2010 smith et al 2010 2015 tang et al 2019a wang et al 2012a wang et al 2020 the other class of error model may be defined as informal whereby pre defined deterministic models lead to residuals that are then characterized for their inbuilt dependence or heteroscedasticity frequently adopting linear and non linear regression techniques to enable modeling the distribution of residual errors based on a maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian methods dogulu et al 2015 this type of error model is a kind of one way coupling razavi 2021 in which the output of hydrologic models is used as the input for machine learning and is frequently applied in modeling scenarios where the computational expense of the pre specified model implies that it is not possible to undertake statistical residual error models that rely on high frequency parameter sampling most studies of data driven models focus on linear regression or linear variants of quantile regression dogulu et al 2015 papacharalampous et al 2020a papacharalampous et al 2020b tyralis et al 2019 wani et al 2017 and non linear regression techniques are less common some studies have indicated traditional non linear regression techniques such as artificial neural networks ann m5 model trees and k nearest neighbors knn provided superior characterization than linear based techniques shrestha and solomatine 2006 wani et al 2017 the use of a superior alternative for characterizing such residual errors is important as apart from the better understanding of the pre specified model this enables it allows more accurate characterization of resulting errors in new applications thereby allowing specification of more precise prediction intervals although some non linear techniques have demonstrated their abilities in residual error models they have inherent limitations ann cannot provide a representation of long term dependencies in the time series of inputs recurrent neural networks rnn belong to a special class of neural networks that can possess a long term memory in theory rumelhart et al 1986 these have been a long history of application to hydrologic problems kumar et al 2004 razavi 2021 hsu et al 1997 however the long term memory of rnn is easily masked by the short term memory additionally rnn suffers from vanishing or exploding gradient problems in training bengio et al 1994 razavi 2021 reichstein et al 2019 shen 2018 a state of the art network named the long short term memory lstm greff et al 2017 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 network which is a variation of rnn can avoid these problems to some extent recently lstm has emerged in the hydrologic literature and been used to successfully make deterministic predictions fang et al 2017 first applied the lstm network in hydrology to predict soil moisture of continental united states and showed lstm was robust for temporal and spatial predictions zhang et al 2018 compared performances of the lstm network and an artificial neural network in predicting water levels kratzert et al 2019 used the lstm network as a rainfall runoff model to predict the streamflows of 531 catchments in the united states and achieved better performance than 5 existing hydrological models feng et al 2020 combined the lstm network with a data integration tool to improve streamflow forecast however deep learning networks still have as yet unexplored potential in hydrologic applications due to several caveats and challenges razavi 2021 reichstein et al 2019 shen et al 2018 i interpretability is a potential weakness for deep learning networks and ii the performance of deep learning networks in true out of sample predictions is questionable due to hydrologic characteristics varying over time and space one solution may be to combine the strengths of existing deterministic hydrologic models with deep learning networks to improve probabilistic streamflow predictions well constructed rainfall runoff models such as the distributed hydrologic model mike she originating from the système hydrologique européen program are more easily interpretable for analysis by decision makers in addition they are expected to be less prone to generate spurious behaviors in true out of sample predictions as their behaviors are constrained by physical laws razavi 2021 also the outputs of hydrological models can be used as the inputs of networks to improve predictions when data is scarce shen et al 2018 based on these benefits it can be argued that the lstm network has the potential to improve the characterization of residual errors enabling robust probabilistic predictions as well as predictive inferences for difficult to observe variables we argue here that the flexible persistence modeling framework built within the lstm architecture offers a purer characterization of persistence and heteroscedasticity in distributed model simulations that the rigid markov order 1 characterization often adopted cannot achieve in this study a probabilistic lstm network is proposed as a residual error model to characterize distributed hydrologic model errors and subsequently improve uncertainty estimations four predictors the 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture the simulated streamflow and the previous residuals from the mike she simulation and observation are selected as the inputs in the proposed model the performance of the proposed model is compared with a bayesian linear regression model and a formal residual error model the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the catchment and data the description of mike she and the residual error models with heteroscedasticity section 3 describes the analysis of mike she predictive uncertainty of residual error models and other related analyses section 4 presents the conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 catchment and data the source of the yellow river syr is located in the northwest of china fig 1 the outlet

other parameters are identified from the previous literature christiaens and feyen 2002 doummar et al 2012 refsgaard et al 2012 the observed streamflow in the tangnaihai station is used to calibrate the model by trial and error method due to the high computing time for each run making automatic calibration prohibitive first three years 1992 1994 as a warm up period to reduce the effects of initial conditions 1995 2010 and 2011 2015 are calibration periods and validation periods respectively 2 3 residual error models 2 3 1 description of residual error models following the notation of smith et al 2015 a hydrological model that is used to make predictions with parameters θ and input data z can be written as 1 y o y m z θ y ε where y o and y m z θ are the respective observed and modeled streamflow y ε is the residual which is the difference between observed and simulated streamflow y ε is often estimated with the assumptions of homoscedasticity heteroscedasticity independence autocorrelation and gaussianity non gaussianity in a formal residual error model smith et al 2015 in this study we use the term one stage residuals to describe the difference between the streamflow observation and the hydrological model s simulation some studies assume that the residuals depend on certain variables of the hydrological system abramowitz et al 2007 dogulu et al 2015 shrestha and solomatine 2006 this means that these variables could be used to predict residual errors and better characterize the hydrologic model predictive uncertainty for example dogulu et al 2015 selected several hydroclimatological variables including previous precipitation modeled water level soil moisture deficit and groundwater level to predict the residual distribution of streamflow with quantile regression an advantage of the physically based distributed hydrological model mike she used in this study is that the model simulation can provide a richer variety of potential residual error predictors than conceptual models to predict the residual error distribution with linear or non linear regression models f x θ can be defined to infer a regression model with predictors x selected from the variables of mike she and parameters θ note that while such a model can be formulated to ascertain the response streamflow at multiple nodes of the system for simplicity our application focuses on single system response characterization of the error model for this response however allows proportional characterization of errors for the other nodes as well as response such as soil moisture of interest consider a predictor set x that consists of measured and modeled variables and captures the uncertainties in the response due to both the model structure as well as the inputs used here x consists of four predictors the 3 day antecedent precipitation x 1 the simulated soil moisture x 2 the grid averaged mike she rootzone soil moisture the simulated streamflow x 3 and the previous residuals x4 to reduce the scaling difference of the predictors x predictors are standardized leading to 2 y ε f x θ ε where y ε and x denote the standardized variables and ε is the error to describe the difference between the standardized one stage residuals and the linear or non linear model s prediction referred to as the two stage residuals when a linear regression model is used to predict the one stage residuals it can be expressed as 3 y ε f l x θ ε w l x b l ε where w l and b l are the respective weight and bias of the linear function f l x θ an lstm network consists of a series of lstm layers and a fully connected layer each lstm layer has many hidden units or neurons and a fully connected layer that often follows the lstm layers is used for outputting the predictions to predict the residual distribution with the lstm network f lstm an error term ε is added to represent the difference between the one stage residuals and the output of the lstm network thus the model is given by 4 y ε f lstm x θ ε w fc h x b fc ε where the index fc denotes the fully connected layer h x is the last hidden unit output at the last lstm layer w fc and b fc are the respective weight matrix and the bias of the fully connected layer each state of the hidden unit consists of the hidden state and the cell state four components input gate forget gate cell candidate output gate control the states of the layer four components are given by 5 i t σ sig w i x t r i h t 1 b i 6 f t σ sig w f x t r f h t 1 b f 7 g t σ tanh w g x t r g h t 1 b g 8 o t σ sig w o x t r o h t 1 b o where x t is the standardized input matrix x at the time t h t 1 is the hidden state at the time t 1 s i f g o respectively denote the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate σ sig denotes the gate activation function which typically uses the sigmoid function σ tanh denotes state activation function which typically uses the tanh function and the matrices w r b denote the input weights the recurrent weights and the biases of each gate respectively the hidden state h t is updated as follow 9 h t o t σ tanh c t with 10 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where c denotes the cell state and denotes the element wise multiplication h in eq 4 is achieved as a sequence h 1 h 2 h t h n from the last lstm layer the index n denotes the length of the input data x according to previous literature feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and trial and error the hyperparameters of the lstm network in this study are set as follows the number of lstm layer is 1 the size of hidden units is 50 the epoch is 500 with a full batch learning and the learning rate is 0 001 l2 regularization bishop 2006 adding the sum of the square of the lstm s weights into the cost function root mean square error rmse is adopted to avoid overfitting in the lstm network the lstm network is developed with a machine learning framework pytorch in python for further details about lstm methods see kratzert et al 2019 2 3 2 heteroscedasticity of the residuals a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 is adopted to transform the observed streamflow and the modeled streamflow before the application of the residual error models as honti et al 2013 recommended the box cox transformation is given by 11 y t y λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 for λ 1 0 y λ 2 log y λ 2 for λ 1 0 y λ 2 where λ 1 and λ 2 are the parameters of box cox transformation y t and y are the transformed data and untransformed data respectively the index t denotes box cox transformation the scheme bc0 2 with λ 1 0 2 is effectively used in hydrology jiang et al 2019 mcinerney et al 2017 wu et al 2019 2 3 3 bayesian estimation of residual error models a posterior distribution to estimate the parameters of the residual error model eq 2 by the bayes theorem can be written as 12 p θ y o p y o θ x p θ p y o l θ p θ c l θ p θ with 13 l θ t 1 t n p y o t θ x t 14 c p y o t 1 t n l θ p θ where the marginal distributions p θ and p y o are probabilities of the parameters θ and the observed streamflow y o known respectively as the prior distribution and the evidence in the bayes s theorem the evidence expressed as c is a normalizing constant the conditional distribution p y o θ x can be expressed as the likelihood function l θ in the data transformation space ϕ a likelihood function assuming a gaussian distribution of errors with zero mean and constant variance σ 2 can be expressed as 15 l θ 1 2 π σ 2 n t 1 t n exp ϕ y o t ϕ y m t 2 2 σ 2 d ϕ y o t d y o t when data is transformed with the box cox transformation and standardization the jacobian of the likelihood function eq 15 is specified as 16 t 1 t n d ϕ y o t d y o t σ y 1 t 1 t n y o t λ 2 λ 1 1 where σ y is the standardized deviation of y o t t y m t t the index t denotes the box cox transformation σ y does not depend on the parameters and can be ignored the log likelihood function when the errors are gaussian independent and heteroscedastic is thus derived as 17 l n 2 log

lstm network eq 4 expresses the standardization detailed information about the formal residual error model the linear regression model and the lstm network applied in this study are summarized in table 2 the parameters of the residual error models shown in table 2 are sampled with the bayesian adaptive metropolis am algorithm haario et al 2001 which is a variation of the traditional metropolis algorithm the am algorithm adapts continuously to the proposal distribution with no extra computational cost the proposal distribution can be a multivariate normal distribution with mean and covariance matrix here uniform distributions are taken as the prior distribution with specified boundaries tang et al 2019b convergence of the algorithm is confirmed after 50 000 iterations and burn in of the first 10 000 iterations convergence is checked by visualizing the stability of the posterior distribution marshall et al 2004 note that the complexity and dimensionality of the lstm with more than 10 000 parameters in this study leads to a computational cost that makes a fully bayesian approach largely prohibitive wang and yeung 2016 to solve this a probabilistic lstm network is proposed with three steps i the weights and biases of the lstm network are optimized with the gradient descent method adam kingma and ba 2014 which achieves optimal predictions ii the variance σ 2 of the error describing the difference between the one stage residuals and the optimal predictions is estimated with the am algorithm iii probabilistic predictions are estimated with the estimated variance σ 2 and optimal predictions fig 2 shows the flowchart of the probabilistic lstm network note that we avoid calibrating parameters of the lstm using the am algorithm as only two parameters have to be estimated with the am algorithm our proposed method has a similar magnitude of computational demand as a standard lstm 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the mike she results the calibrated parameters of mike she are shown in table 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 are calculated to evaluate the performance of mike she in calibration and in an independent validation period both metrics vary from to 1 with better fitting values closer to 1 mike she gives an acceptable simulated streamflow with the nse values of 0 77 and 0 75 in the calibration period 1995 2010 and the validation period 2011 2015 respectively similarly the kge has a value close to the nse in the calibration period or validation period fig 3 a the relationship between the predictors and predictand produced by mike she and the catchment observations are analyzed in fig 3b e as highlighted in dogulu et al 2015 the four selected predictors 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture simulated streamflow and one day lagged residuals have linear relationships with the residuals in this study fig 3b e suggesting their usefulness in a linear regression model to predict residual errors the scatter of the residuals also suggests high heteroscedasticity which should be stabilized using measures like box cox transformation before residuals are predicted 3 2 predictive uncertainty of the residual error models three cases based on the formal residual error model the linear regression model and the lstm network are compared table 2 four predictors including 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture simulated streamflow and previous residuals are used in the linear regression model and the lstm network to predict the one stage residuals with the one time step ahead prediction the predictive uncertainty of each case is assessed with reliability sharpness smith et al 2015 wu et al 2019 and average interval score statistics papacharalampous et al 2020b gneiting and raftery 2007 the reliability metric measures the proportion of observations that are captured by the prediction intervals the sharpness metric measures the mean width of the prediction intervals based on sharpness the average interval score adds a penalty for the simulation falling out of prediction intervals a smaller sharpness or average interval score implies less uncertainty in this study 90 prediction intervals are computed for each case in the calibration period and validation period table 3 a case with the reliability closest to 90 and the narrowest sharpness and average interval score has the best representation of the predictive uncertainty as shown in table 3 the probabilistic lstm network c gives improved sharpness 102 m3 s and 117 m3 s in the calibration and validation period respectively compared to the bayesian linear regression model b 230 m3 s and 254 m3 s in the calibration and validation period respectively and the formal residual error model a 663 m3 s and 726 m3 s in the calibration and validation period respectively in terms of average interval score the probabilistic lstm network also exhibits the best performance in the entire simulation period the probabilistic lstm network significantly reduces the sharpness and average interval score by more than 50 compared with the other two cases the probabilistic lstm network also has the most reliable predictions as its reliability values are closest to 90 in both periods fig 4 gives 90 prediction intervals for streamflow in the validation period fig 4 shows the probabilistic lstm has the narrowest uncertainty bands this means the probabilistic lstm has the least uncertainty which is consistent with the above analysis of sharpness and average interval score 3 3 evaluating the model predictors four predictors are used in the bayesian linear regression model and the probabilistic lstm network in this study to investigate the roles of the predictors in the model the posterior distributions of the predictors weights are analyzed for the bayesian linear regression model fig 5 a due to large numbers of parameters the weights and biases of the lstm network are calibrated with a gradient optimization instead of the bayesian method the interpretability of lstm networks is not straightforward compared with physically based models visualizing the weights in the hidden units is a simple and direct way to give some insights into the predictors hiebert et al 2018 strobelt et al 2018 the input weights in the hidden units eq 5 8 for the lstm network have direct effects on the predictions therefore the density distribution of the input weights is used to visualize the role of the predictors fig 5b e fig 5a displays the posterior density of the four predictors weights in the bayesian linear regression model the weights of the previous residuals x4 are highly positive this means the residuals have high lag 1 autocorrelations section 3 4 gives a detailed autocorrelation analysis the weights of the soil moisture x2 are moderately positive while the weights of the 3 day antecedent precipitation x1 are slightly negative note that the posterior of the simulated streamflow x3 in fig 5a has a high probability of being zero this means this predictor can likely be removed without affecting the simulation fig 5b e shows the probability distribution of input weights in hidden units neurons including the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate the weights distributions of the previous residuals have fatter tails than the other three predictors in fig 5b e this represents more neurons having high positive or high negative weights for the previous residuals and may infer previous residuals have high impact on the lstm other predictors have similar weights distributions this may imply these predictors have similar effects on the lstm visualizing the weights in hidden units provides limited implicit information this is mainly because the lstm s complex structure leads to high parameter interdependency thus we cannot give an accurate description of a predictor s independent role in lstm networks like a linear model however visualizing the hidden units is still a direct and simple way to interpret the lstm 3 4 testing residual error assumptions an important element in verifying probabilistic model simulations is checking the assumptions associated with the model errors in this study we assume the residuals are independent heteroscedastic and normally distributed a box cox transformation is used to reduce heteroscedasticity autocorrelation is visualized with plots of the sample partial autocorrelation function spaf for the model residuals fig 6 displays the spaf of the residuals with 25 lags for each case in the calibration and validation periods the residuals have a very high correlation close to 1 with lag 1 and a medium correlation 0 05 to 0 40 with lags 2 5 fig 6a and d after employing the linear regression model the residuals autocorrelations with lags 1 and 2 are slightly reduced but still are very high approximately 0 80 the probabilistic lstm network significantly reduces residual s autocorrelation with lag 1 from approximately 1 to 0 20 and removes autocorrelation with subsequent lags the ljung box test ljung and box 1978 is applied to further check the autocorrelation a critical value with a threshold of 5 for 25 lags is 37 65 the residuals will be independently distributed if the test statistic of the ljung box test is smaller than the critical value the test statistics shown in fig 6 are computed to quantify autocorrelations for all cases compared with the other cases the probabilistic lstm network reduces the test statistics by two orders of magnitude this means the probabilistic lstm network significantly reduces the residual s autocorrelation though it still has autocorrelation as the test statistic is larger than the critical value the ar model is widely used to reduce autocorrelation of the residuals bates and campbell 2001 mcinerney et al 2017 and the results suggest a five order autoregressive model ar 5 may be necessary to properly address the degree of autcorrelation in the model residuals however the lstm s architecture makes it easier than the ar model to identify the dependence in the time series heteroscedasticity is detected with scatterplots of the predictors and predictant fig 7 shows scatterplots of the standardized residuals and simulated streamflow in the calibration period and validation period the residuals will be homoscedastic if the scatter of the residuals doesn t change as the simulated streamflow increases the test statistic of the breusch pagan test breusch and pagan 1979 is also applied to quantify the heteroscedasticity the critical value with a 5 threshold is 3 84 from a comparison of scatterplots fig 7 we cannot easily distinguish which residuals are more homoscedastic as a box cox transformation is used to remove some heteroscedasticity the test statistics which have smaller values than the other two cases indicate the probabilistic lstm network further reduces heteroscedasticity a quantile quantile plot qq plot is used to determine if the residuals are gaussian for all cases in the calibration period and validation period fig 8 a qq plot producing an approximately straight line indicates the residuals follow a gaussian distribution in addition the r coefficient in the filliben test filliben 1975 is employed to quantify the linearity of the qq plots the qq plots of all cases produce almost straight lines fig 8 a f similarly their filliben r coefficients close to 1 indicate the linearity of the qq plots the r coefficients of the probabilistic lstm network have slightly higher values than the other cases in both periods thus we can confirm the probabilistic lstm network improves the gaussianity of the model residuals 4 conclusions in this study a probabilistic lstm network is proposed as a residual error model to make predictive uncertainty estimations compared with a formal residual error model and a bayesian linear regression model four predictors the 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture simulated streamflow and previous residuals are selected as the inputs in the bayesian linear regression model and the probabilistic lstm network bc0 2 scheme box cox transformation with a parameter λ 1 fixed to 0 2 are considered to reduce the heteroscedasticity of residuals in the residual error models the main conclusions are as follows 1 the probabilistic lstm network produces the narrowest uncertainty intervals with the best probability coverage compared with a formal residual error model and bayesian linear regression model the probabilistic lstm network reduces the uncertainty intervals by more than 50 for all simulation periods 2 the probabilistic lstm network makes residuals more independent homoscedastic and normally distributed specifically the probabilistic lstm network removes almost all residuals autocorrelations with lags 1 5 3 using previous day residuals as a predictor is highly effective for the bayesian linear regression model and the probabilistic lstm network in this study we combine the physically based hydrological model mike she with the probabilistic lstm network to produce probabilistic streamflow predictions thus we make full use of mike she to characterize the properties of catchment such as land use lai soil moisture these data are open source and are easily obtained besides the probabilistic lstm network as a post processing method is only input by previous precipitation and outputs of hydrological models note that our study catchment the source of the yellow river has few human activities without large dams or large irrigation projects hu et al 2011 however previous literature has shown physically based hydrological models are demonstrated usefully in the catchments that are heavily affected by human activities mishra et al 2005 singh et al 1999 we can expect our proposed method is effective in distinct catchments and intensely managed water resources systems the proposed probabilistic lstm network is a complete separation of the neural network and bayesian approaches to make uncertainty estimations the advantage in using the lstm is that a probabilistic forecasting framework can be easily constructed even for complex deep learning networks but loses the uncertainty estimation of large numbers of parameters in neural networks from the aspect of bayesian deep learning recently some interesting techniques for bayesian deep learning are proposed such as monte carlo dropout gal and ghahramani 2015 and stochastic variational inference blei et al 2017 to overcome the high computational costs of bayesian markov chain monte carlo fang et al 2020 initially evaluated monte carlo dropout with an aleatoric term in the lstm networks and produced reasonable uncertainty estimates of soil moisture in future work we will focus on applying these state of the art

4151,errors in hydrological simulations have impacted their applications in flood prediction and water resources management properly characterizing the properties of errors such as heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation can provide improved hydrological predictions here we present a probabilistic long short term memory lstm network for modeling hydrological residual errors three steps are undertaken to characterize uncertainty using the lstm i the network is trained with gradient optimization to obtain optimal predictions ii the distribution of the errors for optimal predictions are estimated using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm iii probabilistic predictions are made using the inferred error distribution and optimal predictions we examine the model in the source of yellow river china over the period 1992 2015 a distributed hydrological model mike she is applied to simulate streamflows in the catchment as benchmarks we compare the results with a bayesian linear regression model and a traditional probabilistic residual error model results show the probabilistic lstm network reduces the heteroscedasticity and removes almost all autocorrelations in residual errors besides compared with the other two methods the proposed method produces more than 50 narrower uncertainty intervals with the best probability coverage our results highlight the potential ability of a deep learning approach integrated with a hydrological model to better characterize predictive uncertainty in hydrologic modeling keywords residual error modeling distributed hydrological model lstm predictive uncertainty bayesian mcmc 1 introduction quantifying and reducing predictive uncertainty remains a challenging issue in the field of hydrology blöschl et al 2019 in recent years many approaches have been developed for improved uncertainty quantification for hydrologic models however difficulties still remain in explicitly accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty han and coulibaly 2017 effective frameworks such as bayesian total error analysis batea kavetski et al 2002 kavetski et al 2006 and the integrated bayesian uncertainty estimator ibune ajami et al 2007 can quantify individual sources of uncertainty in rainfall runoff modeling explicitly to estimate total predictive uncertainty however critics may suggest these approaches are overly complex and not pragmatic for operational hydrologic modeling and identifying each source of uncertainty is not necessary evin et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 residual error models smith et al 2015 are a more simple approach that aggregates all sources of errors such as observation error model parameter error and model structure error as a single lumped predictive uncertainty jiang et al 2019 they provide a statistical description of the differences between observation and simulation evin et al 2014 it has been known that residual errors exist heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation evin et al 2014 kuczera 1983 sorooshian and dracup 1980 inappropriate assumptions made for the property of residual errors can lead to unreliable and inaccurate predictions smith et al 2015 how to properly characterize residual errors is gaining more attention montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 papacharalampous et al 2020a residual error models can be roughly classified into two types one class of method focuses on building the form of likelihood function based on a bayesian framework by making assumptions about the statistical properties of the model errors this class may be termed the formal residual error model a simple formal residual error model assumes the residual errors are independent homoscedastic and gaussian smith et al 2015 however other approaches have been developed to characterize correlated heteroscedastic and non gaussian errors bates and campbell 2001 evin et al 2013 2014 jiang et al 2019 marshall et al 2006 mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 schoups and vrugt 2010 smith et al 2010 2015 tang et al 2019a wang et al 2012a wang et al 2020 the other class of error model may be defined as informal whereby pre defined deterministic models lead to residuals that are then characterized for their inbuilt dependence or heteroscedasticity frequently adopting linear and non linear regression techniques to enable modeling the distribution of residual errors based on a maximum likelihood estimation or bayesian methods dogulu et al 2015 this type of error model is a kind of one way coupling razavi 2021 in which the output of hydrologic models is used as the input for machine learning and is frequently applied in modeling scenarios where the computational expense of the pre specified model implies that it is not possible to undertake statistical residual error models that rely on high frequency parameter sampling most studies of data driven models focus on linear regression or linear variants of quantile regression dogulu et al 2015 papacharalampous et al 2020a papacharalampous et al 2020b tyralis et al 2019 wani et al 2017 and non linear regression techniques are less common some studies have indicated traditional non linear regression techniques such as artificial neural networks ann m5 model trees and k nearest neighbors knn provided superior characterization than linear based techniques shrestha and solomatine 2006 wani et al 2017 the use of a superior alternative for characterizing such residual errors is important as apart from the better understanding of the pre specified model this enables it allows more accurate characterization of resulting errors in new applications thereby allowing specification of more precise prediction intervals although some non linear techniques have demonstrated their abilities in residual error models they have inherent limitations ann cannot provide a representation of long term dependencies in the time series of inputs recurrent neural networks rnn belong to a special class of neural networks that can possess a long term memory in theory rumelhart et al 1986 these have been a long history of application to hydrologic problems kumar et al 2004 razavi 2021 hsu et al 1997 however the long term memory of rnn is easily masked by the short term memory additionally rnn suffers from vanishing or exploding gradient problems in training bengio et al 1994 razavi 2021 reichstein et al 2019 shen 2018 a state of the art network named the long short term memory lstm greff et al 2017 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 network which is a variation of rnn can avoid these problems to some extent recently lstm has emerged in the hydrologic literature and been used to successfully make deterministic predictions fang et al 2017 first applied the lstm network in hydrology to predict soil moisture of continental united states and showed lstm was robust for temporal and spatial predictions zhang et al 2018 compared performances of the lstm network and an artificial neural network in predicting water levels kratzert et al 2019 used the lstm network as a rainfall runoff model to predict the streamflows of 531 catchments in the united states and achieved better performance than 5 existing hydrological models feng et al 2020 combined the lstm network with a data integration tool to improve streamflow forecast however deep learning networks still have as yet unexplored potential in hydrologic applications due to several caveats and challenges razavi 2021 reichstein et al 2019 shen et al 2018 i interpretability is a potential weakness for deep learning networks and ii the performance of deep learning networks in true out of sample predictions is questionable due to hydrologic characteristics varying over time and space one solution may be to combine the strengths of existing deterministic hydrologic models with deep learning networks to improve probabilistic streamflow predictions well constructed rainfall runoff models such as the distributed hydrologic model mike she originating from the système hydrologique européen program are more easily interpretable for analysis by decision makers in addition they are expected to be less prone to generate spurious behaviors in true out of sample predictions as their behaviors are constrained by physical laws razavi 2021 also the outputs of hydrological models can be used as the inputs of networks to improve predictions when data is scarce shen et al 2018 based on these benefits it can be argued that the lstm network has the potential to improve the characterization of residual errors enabling robust probabilistic predictions as well as predictive inferences for difficult to observe variables we argue here that the flexible persistence modeling framework built within the lstm architecture offers a purer characterization of persistence and heteroscedasticity in distributed model simulations that the rigid markov order 1 characterization often adopted cannot achieve in this study a probabilistic lstm network is proposed as a residual error model to characterize distributed hydrologic model errors and subsequently improve uncertainty estimations four predictors the 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture the simulated streamflow and the previous residuals from the mike she simulation and observation are selected as the inputs in the proposed model the performance of the proposed model is compared with a bayesian linear regression model and a formal residual error model the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the catchment and data the description of mike she and the residual error models with heteroscedasticity section 3 describes the analysis of mike she predictive uncertainty of residual error models and other related analyses section 4 presents the conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 catchment and data the source of the yellow river syr is located in the northwest of china fig 1 the outlet

other parameters are identified from the previous literature christiaens and feyen 2002 doummar et al 2012 refsgaard et al 2012 the observed streamflow in the tangnaihai station is used to calibrate the model by trial and error method due to the high computing time for each run making automatic calibration prohibitive first three years 1992 1994 as a warm up period to reduce the effects of initial conditions 1995 2010 and 2011 2015 are calibration periods and validation periods respectively 2 3 residual error models 2 3 1 description of residual error models following the notation of smith et al 2015 a hydrological model that is used to make predictions with parameters θ and input data z can be written as 1 y o y m z θ y ε where y o and y m z θ are the respective observed and modeled streamflow y ε is the residual which is the difference between observed and simulated streamflow y ε is often estimated with the assumptions of homoscedasticity heteroscedasticity independence autocorrelation and gaussianity non gaussianity in a formal residual error model smith et al 2015 in this study we use the term one stage residuals to describe the difference between the streamflow observation and the hydrological model s simulation some studies assume that the residuals depend on certain variables of the hydrological system abramowitz et al 2007 dogulu et al 2015 shrestha and solomatine 2006 this means that these variables could be used to predict residual errors and better characterize the hydrologic model predictive uncertainty for example dogulu et al 2015 selected several hydroclimatological variables including previous precipitation modeled water level soil moisture deficit and groundwater level to predict the residual distribution of streamflow with quantile regression an advantage of the physically based distributed hydrological model mike she used in this study is that the model simulation can provide a richer variety of potential residual error predictors than conceptual models to predict the residual error distribution with linear or non linear regression models f x θ can be defined to infer a regression model with predictors x selected from the variables of mike she and parameters θ note that while such a model can be formulated to ascertain the response streamflow at multiple nodes of the system for simplicity our application focuses on single system response characterization of the error model for this response however allows proportional characterization of errors for the other nodes as well as response such as soil moisture of interest consider a predictor set x that consists of measured and modeled variables and captures the uncertainties in the response due to both the model structure as well as the inputs used here x consists of four predictors the 3 day antecedent precipitation x 1 the simulated soil moisture x 2 the grid averaged mike she rootzone soil moisture the simulated streamflow x 3 and the previous residuals x4 to reduce the scaling difference of the predictors x predictors are standardized leading to 2 y ε f x θ ε where y ε and x denote the standardized variables and ε is the error to describe the difference between the standardized one stage residuals and the linear or non linear model s prediction referred to as the two stage residuals when a linear regression model is used to predict the one stage residuals it can be expressed as 3 y ε f l x θ ε w l x b l ε where w l and b l are the respective weight and bias of the linear function f l x θ an lstm network consists of a series of lstm layers and a fully connected layer each lstm layer has many hidden units or neurons and a fully connected layer that often follows the lstm layers is used for outputting the predictions to predict the residual distribution with the lstm network f lstm an error term ε is added to represent the difference between the one stage residuals and the output of the lstm network thus the model is given by 4 y ε f lstm x θ ε w fc h x b fc ε where the index fc denotes the fully connected layer h x is the last hidden unit output at the last lstm layer w fc and b fc are the respective weight matrix and the bias of the fully connected layer each state of the hidden unit consists of the hidden state and the cell state four components input gate forget gate cell candidate output gate control the states of the layer four components are given by 5 i t σ sig w i x t r i h t 1 b i 6 f t σ sig w f x t r f h t 1 b f 7 g t σ tanh w g x t r g h t 1 b g 8 o t σ sig w o x t r o h t 1 b o where x t is the standardized input matrix x at the time t h t 1 is the hidden state at the time t 1 s i f g o respectively denote the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate σ sig denotes the gate activation function which typically uses the sigmoid function σ tanh denotes state activation function which typically uses the tanh function and the matrices w r b denote the input weights the recurrent weights and the biases of each gate respectively the hidden state h t is updated as follow 9 h t o t σ tanh c t with 10 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where c denotes the cell state and denotes the element wise multiplication h in eq 4 is achieved as a sequence h 1 h 2 h t h n from the last lstm layer the index n denotes the length of the input data x according to previous literature feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and trial and error the hyperparameters of the lstm network in this study are set as follows the number of lstm layer is 1 the size of hidden units is 50 the epoch is 500 with a full batch learning and the learning rate is 0 001 l2 regularization bishop 2006 adding the sum of the square of the lstm s weights into the cost function root mean square error rmse is adopted to avoid overfitting in the lstm network the lstm network is developed with a machine learning framework pytorch in python for further details about lstm methods see kratzert et al 2019 2 3 2 heteroscedasticity of the residuals a box cox transformation box and cox 1964 is adopted to transform the observed streamflow and the modeled streamflow before the application of the residual error models as honti et al 2013 recommended the box cox transformation is given by 11 y t y λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 for λ 1 0 y λ 2 log y λ 2 for λ 1 0 y λ 2 where λ 1 and λ 2 are the parameters of box cox transformation y t and y are the transformed data and untransformed data respectively the index t denotes box cox transformation the scheme bc0 2 with λ 1 0 2 is effectively used in hydrology jiang et al 2019 mcinerney et al 2017 wu et al 2019 2 3 3 bayesian estimation of residual error models a posterior distribution to estimate the parameters of the residual error model eq 2 by the bayes theorem can be written as 12 p θ y o p y o θ x p θ p y o l θ p θ c l θ p θ with 13 l θ t 1 t n p y o t θ x t 14 c p y o t 1 t n l θ p θ where the marginal distributions p θ and p y o are probabilities of the parameters θ and the observed streamflow y o known respectively as the prior distribution and the evidence in the bayes s theorem the evidence expressed as c is a normalizing constant the conditional distribution p y o θ x can be expressed as the likelihood function l θ in the data transformation space ϕ a likelihood function assuming a gaussian distribution of errors with zero mean and constant variance σ 2 can be expressed as 15 l θ 1 2 π σ 2 n t 1 t n exp ϕ y o t ϕ y m t 2 2 σ 2 d ϕ y o t d y o t when data is transformed with the box cox transformation and standardization the jacobian of the likelihood function eq 15 is specified as 16 t 1 t n d ϕ y o t d y o t σ y 1 t 1 t n y o t λ 2 λ 1 1 where σ y is the standardized deviation of y o t t y m t t the index t denotes the box cox transformation σ y does not depend on the parameters and can be ignored the log likelihood function when the errors are gaussian independent and heteroscedastic is thus derived as 17 l n 2 log

lstm network eq 4 expresses the standardization detailed information about the formal residual error model the linear regression model and the lstm network applied in this study are summarized in table 2 the parameters of the residual error models shown in table 2 are sampled with the bayesian adaptive metropolis am algorithm haario et al 2001 which is a variation of the traditional metropolis algorithm the am algorithm adapts continuously to the proposal distribution with no extra computational cost the proposal distribution can be a multivariate normal distribution with mean and covariance matrix here uniform distributions are taken as the prior distribution with specified boundaries tang et al 2019b convergence of the algorithm is confirmed after 50 000 iterations and burn in of the first 10 000 iterations convergence is checked by visualizing the stability of the posterior distribution marshall et al 2004 note that the complexity and dimensionality of the lstm with more than 10 000 parameters in this study leads to a computational cost that makes a fully bayesian approach largely prohibitive wang and yeung 2016 to solve this a probabilistic lstm network is proposed with three steps i the weights and biases of the lstm network are optimized with the gradient descent method adam kingma and ba 2014 which achieves optimal predictions ii the variance σ 2 of the error describing the difference between the one stage residuals and the optimal predictions is estimated with the am algorithm iii probabilistic predictions are estimated with the estimated variance σ 2 and optimal predictions fig 2 shows the flowchart of the probabilistic lstm network note that we avoid calibrating parameters of the lstm using the am algorithm as only two parameters have to be estimated with the am algorithm our proposed method has a similar magnitude of computational demand as a standard lstm 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the mike she results the calibrated parameters of mike she are shown in table 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 are calculated to evaluate the performance of mike she in calibration and in an independent validation period both metrics vary from to 1 with better fitting values closer to 1 mike she gives an acceptable simulated streamflow with the nse values of 0 77 and 0 75 in the calibration period 1995 2010 and the validation period 2011 2015 respectively similarly the kge has a value close to the nse in the calibration period or validation period fig 3 a the relationship between the predictors and predictand produced by mike she and the catchment observations are analyzed in fig 3b e as highlighted in dogulu et al 2015 the four selected predictors 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture simulated streamflow and one day lagged residuals have linear relationships with the residuals in this study fig 3b e suggesting their usefulness in a linear regression model to predict residual errors the scatter of the residuals also suggests high heteroscedasticity which should be stabilized using measures like box cox transformation before residuals are predicted 3 2 predictive uncertainty of the residual error models three cases based on the formal residual error model the linear regression model and the lstm network are compared table 2 four predictors including 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture simulated streamflow and previous residuals are used in the linear regression model and the lstm network to predict the one stage residuals with the one time step ahead prediction the predictive uncertainty of each case is assessed with reliability sharpness smith et al 2015 wu et al 2019 and average interval score statistics papacharalampous et al 2020b gneiting and raftery 2007 the reliability metric measures the proportion of observations that are captured by the prediction intervals the sharpness metric measures the mean width of the prediction intervals based on sharpness the average interval score adds a penalty for the simulation falling out of prediction intervals a smaller sharpness or average interval score implies less uncertainty in this study 90 prediction intervals are computed for each case in the calibration period and validation period table 3 a case with the reliability closest to 90 and the narrowest sharpness and average interval score has the best representation of the predictive uncertainty as shown in table 3 the probabilistic lstm network c gives improved sharpness 102 m3 s and 117 m3 s in the calibration and validation period respectively compared to the bayesian linear regression model b 230 m3 s and 254 m3 s in the calibration and validation period respectively and the formal residual error model a 663 m3 s and 726 m3 s in the calibration and validation period respectively in terms of average interval score the probabilistic lstm network also exhibits the best performance in the entire simulation period the probabilistic lstm network significantly reduces the sharpness and average interval score by more than 50 compared with the other two cases the probabilistic lstm network also has the most reliable predictions as its reliability values are closest to 90 in both periods fig 4 gives 90 prediction intervals for streamflow in the validation period fig 4 shows the probabilistic lstm has the narrowest uncertainty bands this means the probabilistic lstm has the least uncertainty which is consistent with the above analysis of sharpness and average interval score 3 3 evaluating the model predictors four predictors are used in the bayesian linear regression model and the probabilistic lstm network in this study to investigate the roles of the predictors in the model the posterior distributions of the predictors weights are analyzed for the bayesian linear regression model fig 5 a due to large numbers of parameters the weights and biases of the lstm network are calibrated with a gradient optimization instead of the bayesian method the interpretability of lstm networks is not straightforward compared with physically based models visualizing the weights in the hidden units is a simple and direct way to give some insights into the predictors hiebert et al 2018 strobelt et al 2018 the input weights in the hidden units eq 5 8 for the lstm network have direct effects on the predictions therefore the density distribution of the input weights is used to visualize the role of the predictors fig 5b e fig 5a displays the posterior density of the four predictors weights in the bayesian linear regression model the weights of the previous residuals x4 are highly positive this means the residuals have high lag 1 autocorrelations section 3 4 gives a detailed autocorrelation analysis the weights of the soil moisture x2 are moderately positive while the weights of the 3 day antecedent precipitation x1 are slightly negative note that the posterior of the simulated streamflow x3 in fig 5a has a high probability of being zero this means this predictor can likely be removed without affecting the simulation fig 5b e shows the probability distribution of input weights in hidden units neurons including the input gate forget gate cell candidate and output gate the weights distributions of the previous residuals have fatter tails than the other three predictors in fig 5b e this represents more neurons having high positive or high negative weights for the previous residuals and may infer previous residuals have high impact on the lstm other predictors have similar weights distributions this may imply these predictors have similar effects on the lstm visualizing the weights in hidden units provides limited implicit information this is mainly because the lstm s complex structure leads to high parameter interdependency thus we cannot give an accurate description of a predictor s independent role in lstm networks like a linear model however visualizing the hidden units is still a direct and simple way to interpret the lstm 3 4 testing residual error assumptions an important element in verifying probabilistic model simulations is checking the assumptions associated with the model errors in this study we assume the residuals are independent heteroscedastic and normally distributed a box cox transformation is used to reduce heteroscedasticity autocorrelation is visualized with plots of the sample partial autocorrelation function spaf for the model residuals fig 6 displays the spaf of the residuals with 25 lags for each case in the calibration and validation periods the residuals have a very high correlation close to 1 with lag 1 and a medium correlation 0 05 to 0 40 with lags 2 5 fig 6a and d after employing the linear regression model the residuals autocorrelations with lags 1 and 2 are slightly reduced but still are very high approximately 0 80 the probabilistic lstm network significantly reduces residual s autocorrelation with lag 1 from approximately 1 to 0 20 and removes autocorrelation with subsequent lags the ljung box test ljung and box 1978 is applied to further check the autocorrelation a critical value with a threshold of 5 for 25 lags is 37 65 the residuals will be independently distributed if the test statistic of the ljung box test is smaller than the critical value the test statistics shown in fig 6 are computed to quantify autocorrelations for all cases compared with the other cases the probabilistic lstm network reduces the test statistics by two orders of magnitude this means the probabilistic lstm network significantly reduces the residual s autocorrelation though it still has autocorrelation as the test statistic is larger than the critical value the ar model is widely used to reduce autocorrelation of the residuals bates and campbell 2001 mcinerney et al 2017 and the results suggest a five order autoregressive model ar 5 may be necessary to properly address the degree of autcorrelation in the model residuals however the lstm s architecture makes it easier than the ar model to identify the dependence in the time series heteroscedasticity is detected with scatterplots of the predictors and predictant fig 7 shows scatterplots of the standardized residuals and simulated streamflow in the calibration period and validation period the residuals will be homoscedastic if the scatter of the residuals doesn t change as the simulated streamflow increases the test statistic of the breusch pagan test breusch and pagan 1979 is also applied to quantify the heteroscedasticity the critical value with a 5 threshold is 3 84 from a comparison of scatterplots fig 7 we cannot easily distinguish which residuals are more homoscedastic as a box cox transformation is used to remove some heteroscedasticity the test statistics which have smaller values than the other two cases indicate the probabilistic lstm network further reduces heteroscedasticity a quantile quantile plot qq plot is used to determine if the residuals are gaussian for all cases in the calibration period and validation period fig 8 a qq plot producing an approximately straight line indicates the residuals follow a gaussian distribution in addition the r coefficient in the filliben test filliben 1975 is employed to quantify the linearity of the qq plots the qq plots of all cases produce almost straight lines fig 8 a f similarly their filliben r coefficients close to 1 indicate the linearity of the qq plots the r coefficients of the probabilistic lstm network have slightly higher values than the other cases in both periods thus we can confirm the probabilistic lstm network improves the gaussianity of the model residuals 4 conclusions in this study a probabilistic lstm network is proposed as a residual error model to make predictive uncertainty estimations compared with a formal residual error model and a bayesian linear regression model four predictors the 3 day antecedent precipitation simulated soil moisture simulated streamflow and previous residuals are selected as the inputs in the bayesian linear regression model and the probabilistic lstm network bc0 2 scheme box cox transformation with a parameter λ 1 fixed to 0 2 are considered to reduce the heteroscedasticity of residuals in the residual error models the main conclusions are as follows 1 the probabilistic lstm network produces the narrowest uncertainty intervals with the best probability coverage compared with a formal residual error model and bayesian linear regression model the probabilistic lstm network reduces the uncertainty intervals by more than 50 for all simulation periods 2 the probabilistic lstm network makes residuals more independent homoscedastic and normally distributed specifically the probabilistic lstm network removes almost all residuals autocorrelations with lags 1 5 3 using previous day residuals as a predictor is highly effective for the bayesian linear regression model and the probabilistic lstm network in this study we combine the physically based hydrological model mike she with the probabilistic lstm network to produce probabilistic streamflow predictions thus we make full use of mike she to characterize the properties of catchment such as land use lai soil moisture these data are open source and are easily obtained besides the probabilistic lstm network as a post processing method is only input by previous precipitation and outputs of hydrological models note that our study catchment the source of the yellow river has few human activities without large dams or large irrigation projects hu et al 2011 however previous literature has shown physically based hydrological models are demonstrated usefully in the catchments that are heavily affected by human activities mishra et al 2005 singh et al 1999 we can expect our proposed method is effective in distinct catchments and intensely managed water resources systems the proposed probabilistic lstm network is a complete separation of the neural network and bayesian approaches to make uncertainty estimations the advantage in using the lstm is that a probabilistic forecasting framework can be easily constructed even for complex deep learning networks but loses the uncertainty estimation of large numbers of parameters in neural networks from the aspect of bayesian deep learning recently some interesting techniques for bayesian deep learning are proposed such as monte carlo dropout gal and ghahramani 2015 and stochastic variational inference blei et al 2017 to overcome the high computational costs of bayesian markov chain monte carlo fang et al 2020 initially evaluated monte carlo dropout with an aleatoric term in the lstm networks and produced reasonable uncertainty estimates of soil moisture in future work we will focus on applying these state of the art

4152,vegetation plays an active role in soil water dynamics and water balance in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum systems therefore we characterized soil water transport at depths of 0 4 0 m induced by root water uptake rwu at a groundwater dependent salix site during the whole growth stage and compared the results with those from a non vegetated soil site in the semiarid ordos basin of china the results showed that during the whole experimental period evapotranspiration at the vegetated site was more than twice evaporation at the bare site indicating that the transpiration exceeded the evaporation and was the main output of soil water for the bare site the increase of soil water storage in the lysimeter was 97 9 mm in total accounting for 27 5 of the precipitation with 16 8 of rainfall as retention in the shallow vadose zone and 10 7 of rainfall as seepage below 150 cm depth conversely in the vegetated site rainfall driven soil water was mainly consumed by vegetation and the decrease of soil water storage was 254 4 mm in total with no seepage being observed although the root system as the preferred channel improved the soil infiltration capacity it did not mean that the deep soil water recharge increased the infiltrated rainfwater could not offset the water consumption of the root system an exponential normal composite rwu model obtained by the reverse method showed that the water deficit soil layers caused by rwu changed the soil water flow field and blocked soil water interchange consequently deep soil water and groundwater could not be replenished by precipitation our results emphasize ascertaining the hydrodynamic processes of vegetation in semiarid regions and help to strike a balance between vegetation restoration and groundwater management keywords water flow dynamics rainfall regimes salix root water uptake semiarid region 1 introduction regarding the hydrological cycle in arid and semiarid ecosystems soil water flow dynamics are the key element and affected by complex interactions among several factors wang et al 2012 baroni et al 2013 luo et al 2016 fang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 specifically vegetation participates in the water and energy cycles especially in changing the hydrologic processes such as accelerating regional evapotranspiration reducing soil water storage and terminating deep soil water recharge li et al 2017 huang et al 2018 li et al 2019 wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b the trade off between soil water storage and vegetation growth in water limited regions has become a hot topic of research in recent years zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b however studies of the relationships among the atmosphere soil water groundwater and vegetation have proven to be a difficult issue for the sustainable use of water resources the soil water flow dynamics under the condition of vegetation need to be investigated the capacity of soil water storage and rainwater infiltration are of great importance in determining deep soil water groundwater recharge and vegetation states wang et al 2013a in terms of amount frequency intensity and seasonal or annual changes rainfall in semiarid regions is stochastic noy meir 1973 the infiltration depth increased with rise in rainfall amount and higher rainfall intensity resulted in deeper infiltration under the same rainfall amount yu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 for light and mild rainfall events rainwater is stored only in shallow vadose zones and evaporates before it infiltrates the deeper soil layers yang et al 2014 only rainfall clusters or a heavy rainfall event can increase the deep soil water amount and recharge groundwater during the rainy season song et al 2011 a precipitation with the amount being higher than 15 mm generates noticeable deep soil water recharge below 150 cm in the mu us sandy land yuan et al 2008 yang et al 2014 shallow soil layers 0 100 cm are the main layers receiving precipitation and providing regular water source for vegetation growth where soil moisture varies consistently with rainfall while the maximum infiltration depth is usually less than 200 cm in some semiarid region in northwest china wang et al 2004 cheng et al 2020 the moisture in deep soil layers functions as a soil reservoir while soil desiccation will reduce the capability of rainwater to supply water to deep soil layers for plant growth fang et al 2016 cao et al 2018 therefore understanding the responses of vegetation to precipitation is a key challenge the impact of vegetation on soil water is mainly because to its influence on infiltration rates and transpiration which can directly and indirectly alter soil water flow via canopy interception root water uptake rwu hydraulic lift and so on chen et al 2007 jiménez martínez et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 the evaporation effects under vegetation are lower than those under bare land due to the lower land surface albedo as a result of the higher leaf area index ye et al 2019 some researchers have showcased that vegetation can boost soil conditions and cause higher infiltration capacity bartley et al 2006 the root system is a vital factor affecting soil water flow yu et al 2018 with an influence zone being more than three times the root depth unfortunately vegetation in semiarid environments is chronically dependent on deep soil water which can lead to a decline in deep soil water reserves that cannot be replenished by rainfall in normal years let alone dry years moreover the loss of water in the deep soil layers lowers the chances of vegetation to survive a drought chen et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to reveal deep soil water recharge under vegetation since vegetation connects precipitation with groundwater the rwu model can clarify the influence of rwu on the soil water flow dynamics and a precise and proper rwu model is significant for studying water deprivation mechanisms water resources and ecological environmental management especially in arid regions beyer et al 2016 fatemeh karandish and simunek 2016 jha et al 2017 an application oriented approach introduces the rwu into richards s equation as a sink term whereby the potential transpiration is spread over the root zone proportionally by root density feddes 1978 different types of root distribution functions hoogland et al 1981 hoffman and van genuchten 1983 prasad 1988 li et al 1999 combined with water stress response function feddes 1978 were used to describe the nonuniformity of rwu all these models depend on the root distribution which is not readily available these empirical models can get consistent results with field observation in specific conditions for example in uniform moist soil rwu occurs mainly on the soil surface because the root density is the largest however it does not mean that these rwu models are appropriate entirely for instance these models cannot depict that plants could adapt to the inhomogenous distribution of soil water by adjusting their absorption patterns moreover experimental and numerical methods have also proved that rwu is different from the vertical distribution of root density hence the distribution of rwu is estimated using the inverse method zuo and zhang 2002 zuo et al 2004 zuo et al 2006 shi et al 2007 liao et al 2016 the measured values of soil water content swc in soil profiles which can be acquired relatively easily and accurately were used as input information then a soil water flow equation incorporating an unknown sink term was solved inversely for the sink term which characterizes the rwu distribution in the root zone the advantage of this method is not considering the priori estimation of root distribution which overcomes several of the limitations of the current models therefore detailed observation is necessary and antecedent to capture the soil water flow dynamics at the point scale to this end an in situ experiment with a pair of lysimeters was implemented to depict the soil water transport occurring in vegetated and non vegetated soil profiles our objectives were 1 to explore the soil water flow dynamics affected by plant physiological functions 2 to evaluate the effects of vegetation on soil water storage and the deep soil water supply and 3 to develop a rwu model by a flexible inverse method with the measured swc this research points out crucial conclusions for groundwater sustainability and vegetation restoration in regions with limited water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and in situ experiment the study area is located in the southern margin of mu us sandy land see fig 1 with arid and semiarid climate since 1981 the average annual rainfall is 315 2 mm the maximum annual rainfall is 556 mm and the minimum annual rainfall is 227 mm the annual average temperature is 7 7 the average annual potential evapotranspiration is 2200 5 mm the average water table depth in most areas is between 0 5 m and 10 m wang et al 2013b the main vegetation types in this area are bushes and shrubs including salix psammophylla salix is used in the following context artemisia sargassum caragana korshinskii alkaline herb etc some of these species use only soil water in vadose zone some rely primarily on groundwater and some use both specifically salix is the preferred species in wind prevention and sand fixation and generally grows in fixed and semi fixeddunes or inter hill fig 1 with proper groundwater depth being from 1 5 m to 5 m cheng et al 2012 yang et al 2016 however salix is a perennial shrubwhose growth mainly depends on groundwater cheng et al 2012 and even causes a drop of the water table zhao et al 2020 therefore it has considerable impact on vegetation ecology and groundwater resources additionally according to the field investigation and particle size composition obtained in the laboratory salix can develop either vertical root systems or horizontal roots and the aeolian sand property in the salix dominated community was silty fine sand the in situ experiment was conducted at the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of the atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum in the henan experimental station 37 51 n 108 43 e elevation 1209 9 m of the ordos basin northwest china zhao et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 nearby a meteorological station could provide data regarding air temperature rainfall humidity wind speed sunshine hours etc recorded at hourly intervals two cylindrical lysimeters with 420 cm in depth and 200 cm in diameter were set the lysimeters were backfilled uniformly with natural wind blown sand from a nearby field and then settled using water one lysimeter was deployed with salix that was planted in 2015 the spatial and temporal evolution of swc and water table depth fluctuation were monitored for both cases after a one year settling process by this time the average bulk density of soils at different depths in both lysimeters measured in the laboratory was 1 45 g cm3 water table depth was monitored by a mini diver diver inc 0 05 and corrected by a baro diver diver inc 0 1 simultaneously swc and soil temperature were monitored by ech2o 5tm decagon inc 1 2 which were installed at 3 5 10 20 30 50 80 150 170 190 250 and 350 cm depths for the bare site and at 3 5 10 20 30 50 80 150 250 and 350 cm depths for the vegetated site in addition before the installation of 5te the sensors were calibrated by configuring the soil with different gradient swc in accordance with the instrument instruction manual in this study 3 cm is approximately considered as the surface layer all the data were collected and stored with em50 data logger automatically at five minute intervals and the data were downloaded by ech2o utility the details regarding the instrument installation and experimental setup are illustrated in fig 2 the experiment was conducted from april 25 to november 6 in 2016 thus avoiding the frozen period but covering the entire growth period of salix the upper soil was typically frozen for the remainder of the year and the precipitation and evaporation were essential zero 2 2 methods 2 2 1 water balance in the lysimeter system within the experimental area in question no other recharge resources were available except precipitation there was no surface runoff for sandy land with rapid infiltration additionally the soil water flow is hypothesized to be vertical and one dimensional therefore the soil water in the lysimeter conformed to the following water balance equation chen et al 2010 1 δ w p e t a where δ w is the change in soil water storage in the lysimeter including soil water in vadose zone and groundwater in saturated zone mm obtained by checking the swc difference at different time node and a more detailed calculation process can be found in zhao et al 2020 p is precipitation mm which can be measured directly at the meteorological station eta is actual evapotranspiration mm including transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from the underlying soil and it should be replace with ea in the non vegetated site based on the soil water balance principle the cumulative water retention or reduction can therefore be described as follows wang et al 2012 2 l s i s e z s where s i is the initial swc cm3 cm3 s e is the swc cm3 cm3 at the end stage z s is the specified depth cm and l is the cumulative water retention or reduction the extinct evaporation depth of wind blown sand in the mu us sandy land is less than 1 5 m below which groundwater can no longer sustain evaporation through capillary rise zhang et al 2008 ma et al 2019 therefore groundwater will not be reduced by evaporation but can only be increased by rainfall replenishment based on this the increment of soil water in the soil layer above a depth of 150 cm divided by the rainfall capacity is defined as the rainfall retention ratio and the increment of soil water below a depth of 150 cm divided by the rainfall capacity is called the effective rainfall recharge ratio 2 2 2 determination of the hydraulic gradient the hydraulic head is the sum of the pressure head and the elevation head and the hydraulic gradient dh dz determines upward or downward flow in the vadose zone yeh et al 2015 wang et al 2017 accordingly if dh dz greater than 0 the flow is upward if dh dz less than 0 the flow is downward conversely there is neither an upward nor a downward flow if dh dz 0 which is called the zero flux plane soil water flows upward above the zero flux plane and determines the intensity of evaporation soil water flows downward below the zero flux plane to recharge the deep soil water and groundwater through gravity drainage 2 2 3 calculation of the sink term based on the forward finite difference method the sink term was embedded in the one dimensional richards equation to account for rwu feddes 1978 and the equation describing the water flow in saturated unsaturated medium is 3 c h h t z k h h z k h z s z t where h is the pressure head cm k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 c h is the specific water capacity cm 1 s z t is the rwu rate d 1 s z t 0 when z is deeper than the max root length and z t is spatial vertical coordinates and time coordinate respectively in addition we assume that the sink item refers to rwu namely transpiration the domain is a column with a 420 cm depth and is discretized into 85 nodes with each cell being 5 cm long the simulation spanned 190 days starting april 25 2016 and the time interval was one day the initial condition is the measured soil profile water content upper boundary condition is treated as the dirichlet boundary measured surface water potential and the lower boundary is zero flux to solve the above equation using the finite difference method the water flux through the nth unit was calculated by the following equation 4 s z i t j k z i 1 h i 1 j h i j δ z 2 k z i h i

simulations using different soil specific parameters we performed a sufficient sensitivity analysis for all parameters within the rwu model during the preliminary step i e θr θs ks and hydraulic parameters α n ultimately ks α and n were chosen for a sensitivity analysis to explore how the lysimeter specific rwu model changes with variable hydraulic parameters for the cases where ks was varied α and n corresponded to the initial fittingvalue and were kept constant analogously for the sensitivity analysis of α and n ks was kept constant and corresponded to the testing value the values of ks α and n were adjusted with amplitudes of 5 10 and 20 respectively for sensitivity analysis 2 3 soil hydraulic parameter characteristics the pressured head h can be calculated by the following function

characteristics of key elements in the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum system such as swc evolution water table fluctuations at the bare and vegetated sites and rainfall are presented in fig 3 the rainfall distribution was extremely uneven as manifested in the large difference in its intensity and frequency the accumulated rainfall was 356 3 mm and 68 rainfall events were recorded accounting for 28 4 of the total days during the study period the period from july to september witnessed a concentration of 70 of these rainfall events during the experimental period approximately 52 of rainfall events evinced an amount of 5 0 mm against 26 between 5 0 mm and 10 0 mm 17 between 10 0 mm and 50 0 mm and only 3 50 0 mm the largest daily precipitation was 58 0 mm occurring on august 12 fig 3 b and c illustrate the measured swc of some nodes of the soil profiles in time series for both sites on a daily scale in general the swc in the shallow soil layer changed sharply in both cases corresponding to rainfall increasing rapidly when rainfall occurred and decreasing gradually over the periods without rainfall notably the swc above 30 cm was maintained at a low level and generally did not exceed 0 15 cm3 cm3 for the bare site the swc below 150 cm was higher and relatively stable without being affected by low intensity rainfall except for the concentrated heavy rainfall event in mid august conversely for the vegetated site the swc in the deep layer showed a declining trend affected by the rwu in particular the swc at 150 cm began to decrease gradually in june increased significantly after the heavy rainfall event on august 12 and then gradually decreased the swc at 250 cm decreased rapidly from a near saturated swc level in early august to only 0 1 cm3 cm3 in early november fig 3 d shows the water table depth fluctuations for both cases for the bare site the water table depth was relatively stable at 205 cm before early august an increase of approximately 33 cm was discernible after the most intense rainfall on august 12 after that the water table depth dropped slowly and gradually stabilized at approximately 182 cm for the vegetated site the water table depth was stable at 225 cm before early june and declined at a speed of 2 19 mm d from mid june to early august it continued to decline until early october albeit slower than that of the previous stage finally the water table depth was stable at approximately 350 cm the water table depth at the two sites developed in the opposite direction and the gap became increasingly larger with time 3 2 shallow soil water transport in response to rainfall with and without vegetation the precipitation events occurring in the mu us sandy land can be divided into three regimes a single rainfall pulse moderate rainfall clusters and drastic rainfall pulses specifically a single rainfall event with an intensity of 16 8 mm d rainfall groups with an intensity of less than 10 mm d and rainfall events with an intensity of 58 mm d were chosen as the three rainfall regimes mentioned above to reveal the response of soil water to rainfall infiltration fig 4 shows the impact of different rainfall regimes on the shallow swc above 80 cm for a single rainfall pulse there was an abrupt increase of swc that then decreased slowly but did not return to its original low level unless drought conditions persisted for a long period the increase range of swc decreased with increasing soil depth and the swc at 50 cm was basically not responsive to the single rainfall pulse moderate rainfall clusters accumulated to produce distinct jagged pulses swc the subsequent rainfall infiltration had a superposition effect on the antecedent swc influenced by previous rainfall but the impacted depth was also limited the effect of drastic rainfall on the swc was significant and the impact depth exceeded 80 cm by comparing the difference between the swc in the corresponding positions of both sites it was found the increasing range of swc at the vegetated site in response to rainfall was greater than that at the bare site this result indicated that the root system may improve the soil infiltration capacity to some extent fig 4 also shows that the response of swc at different soil layers for the bare site to rainfall exhibited hysteresis and the hysteretic time prolonged with increasing depth hysteresis became increasingly pronounced with rainfall increasing intensity specifically the hysteresis in a single rainfall pulse was more distinct than that in a sequence of seasonal drastic rainfall events in contrast relatively shorter rainwater infiltration hysteresis was observed at the vegetated site as a preferential channel the root system seemed to increase the rainwater infiltration capacity of sand allowing rainfall driven soil water to penetrate faster and deeper 3 3 effects of vegetation biophysical processes on water transport 3 3 1 vegetation canopy shading fig 5 a shows that the topsoil swc at the vegetated site was almost larger than that at the non vegetated site regardless of whether the soil was dry or wet which was consistent with the results of zeng et al 2006 and wang et al 2012 it can be confirmed that canopy shading blocks solar radiation and then diminishes topsoil soil water evaporation the topsoil temperature at the bare site was higher than that at the vegetated site as shown in fig 5b and increased exponentially with increasing air temperature at both sites 12 t s 6 3034 exp 0 0642 a t r 2 0 8819 for bare site 13 t s 7 647 exp 0 0513 a t r 2 0 8289 for vegetated site where ts denotes the topsoil temperature and at denotes the air temperature 3 3 2 spatiotemporal feature of the sink term fig 6 a presents the calculated rwu of salix along the soil profile obviously the sink term changed with the growth stages and the water availability over different seasons in may the salix seedling relied on soil water above the 150 cm depth since its root distribution was mostly in the shallow layer in june and july the gradually maturing salix switched to utilize deeper soil layers as the shallow layers became dry in august and september coinciding with the rainy season the root system preferentially utilized precipitation derived soil water retained in shallow soil layers however the easily available infiltrated rainwater was inadequate to support the sink term and the root system extended to absorb the deeper soil water at a depth of approximately 300 cm in october and early november the sink term declined significantly with salix withering the distribution function of the sink term was constructed through dynamic mathematical statistical analysis by fitting the calculated rwu as shown in fig 6 b which was consistent with the exponential logarithmic normal composite distribution 14 s α e β z φ z σ 2 π e 1 2 l n τ z μ σ 2 where z is the normalized depth α is the parameter that controls the size of the exponential function β is the shape parameter of the exponential function φ is the parameter that controls the size of the logarithmic normal function τ is the correction factor and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable which control the location and the shape of the logarithmic normal function respectively table 2 shows that r 2 tends to be one and the mae and rmse tend to be zero indicating that the accuracy of the algorithm is higher and the model is reliable due to the greater variability of soil moisture affected by complex changes in atmospheric factors the error of the fitting results is relatively large in the shallow layers 3 3 3 hydraulic redistribution evolution with and without vegetation fig 7 shows the vertical hydraulic head distribution for both sites for the bare site dh dz 0 occurred within 30 cm of the soil profile and the deep soil water potential was relatively stable which was consistent with the findings of chen et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 for the vegetated site two zero flux planes one shallow and one deep appeared in the soil layer due to the joint action of evaporation and rwu the shallow zero flux plane was generally not deeper than 30 cm in depth and the soil water in this region was mainly transported upward to participate in evaporation driven by the hydraulic gradient the hydraulic head decreased rapidly from early july with increasing transpiration and the deep zero flux plane stretched to 120 cm in depth peaking in early august the zero flux plane disappeared as a consequence of the intense rainfall on august 12 later with the continuous rwu the two zero flux planes developed once again in early september meanwhile there was a rapid downward movement of the deep zero flux plane which ultimately stabilized more or less at 140 cm 3 4 water balance table 3 shows the ea eta rainfall retention ratio and rainfall recharge ratio during the experimental period based on the principle of water balance described by eq 1 and 2 for the bare site the cumulative ea was 29 1 mm during days 1 45 38 3 mm during days 46 74 74 1 mm during days 75 115 60 8 mm during days 116 153 and 56 9 mm during days 154 196 the ea was smaller than the rainfall in each period and the accumulated ea in the whole study period was 258 4 mm accounting for 72 5 of the total rainfall for the vegetated site the cumulative eta was 64 7 mm during days 1 45 66 4 mm during days 46 74 163 4 mm during days 75 115 200 7 mm during days 116 153 and 118 9 mm during days 154 196 the eta in each period was higher than the corresponding rain capacity and the accumulated eta in the whole growing period was 613 4 mm which was roughly 1 7 times the total rainfall the eta for the vegetated site was more than two times the ea for the bare site in the whole growth stage indicating that transpiration exceeded evaporation with the specified water table depth in this region and was the main hydrological process that reduced soil water table 3 shows that the total soil water volume increase in the lysimeter was 97 9 mm per unit area for the bare site accounting for 27 5 of the rainfall amount of that year in addition 59 9 mm of rainfall was retained above a depth of 150 cm with a retention ratio of 16 8 while 38 0 mm of rainfall eventually recharged the deep soil water with a recharge ratio of 10 7 however for the vegetated site w was negative in each period and the total soil water volume decrease was 257 1 mm per unit area the retention ratio was positive only on days 46 115 and 154 196 and it was negative in other periods the recharge ratio was always negative indicating that rainfall has not recharged the deep soil at the vegetated site 4 discussion 4 1 blocking effects of the vegetation canopy the most direct factor affecting topsoil moisture is soil temperature because the specific heat capacity of aeolian sand is large the topsoil temperature increases rapidly with the increase of air temperature when the air temperature is about 35 the topsoil temperature is nearly 1 7 times that of the air temperature high temperature drives soil water from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase promoting evaporation some scholars have found that topsoil moisture is negatively correlated with air temperature and the two variables have an exponential relationship wang et al 2011a wang et al 2011b wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 canopy blocks part of solar radiation from reaching the ground resulting in a lower surface temperature in the canopy s shadow and reduces wind speed near the soil surface both of which limit soil evaporation to a certain extent the proportion of the canopy shading area is small in arid ecosystems but may still be ecologically significant noy meir 1973 and may have effects such as improving the local climate canopy interception slows the delivery of rainwater to the ground and directly affects ground surface hydrology interception varies with individual plant forms leaf orientation and size bark roughness and hydrophobicity branch rigidity canopy density etc dunkerley and booth 1999 the canopy intercepts rainwater and part of the rainfall does not penetrate the canopy into the soil this part is held on the leaves and is later returned to the atmosphere through evaporation in particular sporadic low intensity rainfall is largely intercepted by the vegetation canopy nevertheless fig 5a and fig 4 show that the interception of rainfall by salix was not obvious for shrublands the loss to interception is 4 of annual rainfall with much rainwater being effectively transported to the soil layers in the form of stemflow west and gifford 1976 however when rainfall is high rainwater can be delivered to the soil more efficiently in the case of interception occurring dunkerley 2000 because interception can not only delay the arrival but also reduce the intensity of rainwater to the surface thus preventing the loss of runoff 4 2 root channel or intercept infiltrated rainwater the aeolian sand in the mu us sandy land belongs to the category of fine sand with a substantially high infiltration rate a few metres per day and it absorbs rainwater like a sponge generally shrubs have greater root abundance which provides preferential channels for soil water transport and enhances hydraulic conductivity additional studies have shown that revegetation can enhance soil conditions causing a higher infiltration capacity bartley et al 2006 fig 4 shows that the infiltration rate at the vegetated site was much higher than that at the bare site and fu et al 2013 has demonstrated that the influence of shrub root channels on rainfall infiltration depth was greater than 100 cm however fig 4 also shows that the swc at the bare site was generally higher than at the corresponding depth at the vegetated site which has also been confirmed by other studies qiu et al 2001 fu et al 2003 although rainwater infiltration is reinforced most of the rain driven soil water remains in the root zone and is quickly absorbed by the root system in other words the boosted infiltration capacity may not result in greater groundwater recharge due to excessive rwu the root system intercepts and uptakes infiltrated rainwater leading to a severe water deficit in local soil layers as shown in fig 7 even during the rainy season as confirmed by chen et al 2007 this result indicates that the recharge of soil water is not enough to compensate for the consumption of salix moreover the infiltrated rainwater gave priority to replenishing the shallow water deficit zones and supply to quite deep soil as long as it exceeds the demand of vegetation growth which has also been confirmed by fu et al 2013 specific to this study the soil water storage decrease at the vegetated site was 257 1 mm and was 0 72 times the amount of rainfall consequently a lower precipitation offset and no recharge were exhibited at the vegetated site the water deficit soil layers caused by rwu changed the soil water flow field blocked water interchange and interfered with ecohydrological processes excessive soil water depletion is extremely detrimental to vegetation restoration and groundwater recharge and will restrict the level of ecohydrological systems therefore an urgent issue to be resolved is how to balance revegetation and groundwater resources 4 3 rwu in response to rainfall multiple uptake strategies may evolve due to the stochastic nature of precipitation events and subsequently aggravate the complexity of soil water dynamics in the vadose zone the results indicates that the shrubs could develop optimal water use strategies in line with local meteorology and soil water availability at different growth stages to tolerate water shortage flexible water use patterns are vital for the survival of vegetation in dryland regions vegetation can switch their water extraction from one different soil water layer to another for example the primary location of rwu shifted deeper into the soil profile by extending root system when water stress occurred close to the soil surface ogle and reynolds 2004 chen et al 2014 yin et al 2015 indeed some findings have shown that three year old perennials extract water from a depth of 500 cm li and huang 2008 wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b salix specialized in using deeper soil water for drought survival and did not cease to use rainfall infiltration in the shallow layers once rainfall occurred shallow soil water was supplemented and became the main source of rwu once again manifested with the sink term appearing as a peak value in the shallow and deep layers as shown in fig 6a should rainfall replenishment be insufficient however the utilization of deep soil water might prove necessary for longer term survival yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 4 4 evaluation of the inverse rwu model rwu is a dynamic process affected by biological and physical factors quantifying both the species specific sink term and its distribution in the vertical soil profile is challenging in early research the sink term was considered a constant extraction rate feddes 1978 subsequently a linear relationship was suggested between depth and the maximum sink hoogland et al 1981 prasad 1988 hupet et al 2002 the constant sink models and the linear depth dependent extraction models fail to describe the non uniform distribution of rwu in the soil profile adequately an exponential rwu model whereby the sink term increased in the upper layers but decreased in the lower layers evinced a much more realistic water extraction pattern in this case as water stress developed the location of the rwu peak moved downwards along the profile raats 1974 li et al 1999 li et al 2001 vegetation could extract water at the maximum rate according to the root distribution under favourable soil water conditions in other words rwu would remain similar to the root distribution if water content remained in the optimal range throughout the root depth once water stress developed in the upper soil profile the rwu and root distribution diverged the sink term obtained by inversed method is the comprehensive result of biophysical process of vegetation and hydrological process moreover a full growth cycle is deployed for the construction of the sink to guarantee dynamic integrity and authenticity it is well known that the root system of perennial vegetation is in continuous growth which is difficult to capture therefore it is difficult to establish a reliable model through traditional forward modeling because it involves not only the uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters but also the uncertainty of vegetation root system while the inverse method can obtain a relatively reliable distribution of rwu without a priori knowledge of the root distribution and provide the rwu as a formula of time and depth according to the formula the maximum rwu rate and depth could be estimated the accuracy of numerical water flow models for the vadose zone depends on the estimation of the soil hydraulic properties from the results of the sensitivity analysis shown in fig 8 there is a critical dependency between k s α n and the calculated rwu increasing ks values causes an increase in the calculated rwu still the increase amplitudes are smaller than the variation amplitude of the parameter itself indicating that the calculated rwu is not very sensitive to ks in comparison increasing values of α cause a decrease in the calculated rwu the variation amplitudes of the calculated results tend to be larger than the variation amplitude of the parameter itself when the value of α is reduced which means that the lower values will overestimate the calculated result moreover the change in hydraulic parameter n will cause the increase or decrease in the calculated rwu to different degrees with no uniform trend in summary the importance of variations in α and n is more pronounced than that in k s this application oriented method can be both easily and effectively used to analyse rwu processes without root density for other shrubs with specific root systems nevertheless applying this method has certain limitations that require overcoming such as accurately determining soil water moisture potential and identifying soil hydraulic parameters 4 5 implications for soil water conservation of vegetation to prevent soil and water loss and ecosystem degradation in arid and semiarid areas of northwest china the chinese government has initiated a series of ecological restoration programmes since the 1950 s such as the grain for green project and the nature forest grassland protection project zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 hua et al 2016 to some extent restoration projects overemphasize the planting of vegetation and neglect the regional climate hydrological processes and vegetation species it is insufficient to consider only revegetation in pursuit of reducing soil and water loss wang et al 2004 widespread planting of perennials has aggravated the demand for soil water or groundwater and further led to the occurrence of dry soil layers which results in the deterioration of ecosystems and the exacerbation of water deficits wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b wang et al 2011a wang et al 2011b fu et al 2013 feng et al 2016 therefore it is essential to explore perennials suitability in vegetation restoration projects to prevent conflicts between water yield and vegetation growth wang et al 2020 from the standpoint of formulating reasonable and sustainable ecological restoration policies it may be necessary to identify an optimal level of salix planting density and establish a mosaic vegetation system of shrubs bushes and grasses to sustain groundwater resources if necessary it is better to transform the shrublands to new land use types with lower rwu to mitigate the risks of deep soil water resource depletion this will serve as a basis for defining replanting patterns and facilitating vegetation restoration and the groundwater management sustainability our findings provide a practical reference for the balance between revegetation and effective groundwater recharge some results of our study may vary with vegetation species soil conditions climate conditions and other factors particularly with the decrease of soil moisture under the influence of vegetation and the change of plant physiological function the et of salix will change over the following years furthermore precipitation varies considerably every year in semiarid regions and 2016 may not represent all of the characteristic behaviours in response to rainfall in this region still the precipitation during this year was close to the average annual precipitation in mu us sandy land to some extent it may be more representative of the long term average behaviour therefore in order to overcome the limitations of experiment more researches are urgently needed through continuous multiyear experiments with different water level scenarios and species to provide a more comprehensive understanding on hydrodynamic processes of vegetation in semiarid regions 5 conclusions in this work we contrasted the soil water transport of bare and vegetated sites in the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum in the mu us sandy land of china analyses were performed using field observation over a complete growth stage to provide insight into the impact of typical salix on soil water flow dynamics the study gave rise to the following conclusions for the whole experimental period the evaporation of the bare site was 258 4 mm accounting for 72 5 of the rainfall while the evapotranspiration of the vegetated site was 613 4 mm which was 1 72 times the rainfall and more than 2 38 times the evaporation the total soil water volume increase was 97 9 mm per unit area for the bare site accounting for 27 5 of that year s precipitation with the retention rate of rainfall reaching 16 8 and the recharge rate of deep soil water reaching 10 7 for the vegetated site salix could reduce soil water storage by transpiration and significantly change groundwater recharge conditions an exponential logarithmic normal composite distribution of rwu was obtained by the reverse method revealing that there were one shallow and one deep surface zero flux surface in the soil profile and that the deep zero flux surface could reach 1 4 m underground by rwu the root system could act as the preferred channel that improved soil water permeability but our results showed that the recharge rate of deep soil water did not increase as such infiltrated rainwater could not offset soil water uptake by the root system and a significant water deficient layer in the soil prevented the recharge of groundwater specifically the soil water storage of the vegetated site decreased by 254 4 mm per unit area over a complete growth stage therefore an appropriate planting density is suggested for salix to maintain the sustainability of deep soil water resources undoubtedly our findings provide valuable information related to optimal revegetation strategies and water management in this region credit authorship contribution statement ming zhao writing original draft formal analysis

4152,vegetation plays an active role in soil water dynamics and water balance in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum systems therefore we characterized soil water transport at depths of 0 4 0 m induced by root water uptake rwu at a groundwater dependent salix site during the whole growth stage and compared the results with those from a non vegetated soil site in the semiarid ordos basin of china the results showed that during the whole experimental period evapotranspiration at the vegetated site was more than twice evaporation at the bare site indicating that the transpiration exceeded the evaporation and was the main output of soil water for the bare site the increase of soil water storage in the lysimeter was 97 9 mm in total accounting for 27 5 of the precipitation with 16 8 of rainfall as retention in the shallow vadose zone and 10 7 of rainfall as seepage below 150 cm depth conversely in the vegetated site rainfall driven soil water was mainly consumed by vegetation and the decrease of soil water storage was 254 4 mm in total with no seepage being observed although the root system as the preferred channel improved the soil infiltration capacity it did not mean that the deep soil water recharge increased the infiltrated rainfwater could not offset the water consumption of the root system an exponential normal composite rwu model obtained by the reverse method showed that the water deficit soil layers caused by rwu changed the soil water flow field and blocked soil water interchange consequently deep soil water and groundwater could not be replenished by precipitation our results emphasize ascertaining the hydrodynamic processes of vegetation in semiarid regions and help to strike a balance between vegetation restoration and groundwater management keywords water flow dynamics rainfall regimes salix root water uptake semiarid region 1 introduction regarding the hydrological cycle in arid and semiarid ecosystems soil water flow dynamics are the key element and affected by complex interactions among several factors wang et al 2012 baroni et al 2013 luo et al 2016 fang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 specifically vegetation participates in the water and energy cycles especially in changing the hydrologic processes such as accelerating regional evapotranspiration reducing soil water storage and terminating deep soil water recharge li et al 2017 huang et al 2018 li et al 2019 wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b the trade off between soil water storage and vegetation growth in water limited regions has become a hot topic of research in recent years zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b however studies of the relationships among the atmosphere soil water groundwater and vegetation have proven to be a difficult issue for the sustainable use of water resources the soil water flow dynamics under the condition of vegetation need to be investigated the capacity of soil water storage and rainwater infiltration are of great importance in determining deep soil water groundwater recharge and vegetation states wang et al 2013a in terms of amount frequency intensity and seasonal or annual changes rainfall in semiarid regions is stochastic noy meir 1973 the infiltration depth increased with rise in rainfall amount and higher rainfall intensity resulted in deeper infiltration under the same rainfall amount yu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 for light and mild rainfall events rainwater is stored only in shallow vadose zones and evaporates before it infiltrates the deeper soil layers yang et al 2014 only rainfall clusters or a heavy rainfall event can increase the deep soil water amount and recharge groundwater during the rainy season song et al 2011 a precipitation with the amount being higher than 15 mm generates noticeable deep soil water recharge below 150 cm in the mu us sandy land yuan et al 2008 yang et al 2014 shallow soil layers 0 100 cm are the main layers receiving precipitation and providing regular water source for vegetation growth where soil moisture varies consistently with rainfall while the maximum infiltration depth is usually less than 200 cm in some semiarid region in northwest china wang et al 2004 cheng et al 2020 the moisture in deep soil layers functions as a soil reservoir while soil desiccation will reduce the capability of rainwater to supply water to deep soil layers for plant growth fang et al 2016 cao et al 2018 therefore understanding the responses of vegetation to precipitation is a key challenge the impact of vegetation on soil water is mainly because to its influence on infiltration rates and transpiration which can directly and indirectly alter soil water flow via canopy interception root water uptake rwu hydraulic lift and so on chen et al 2007 jiménez martínez et al 2009 zhu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 the evaporation effects under vegetation are lower than those under bare land due to the lower land surface albedo as a result of the higher leaf area index ye et al 2019 some researchers have showcased that vegetation can boost soil conditions and cause higher infiltration capacity bartley et al 2006 the root system is a vital factor affecting soil water flow yu et al 2018 with an influence zone being more than three times the root depth unfortunately vegetation in semiarid environments is chronically dependent on deep soil water which can lead to a decline in deep soil water reserves that cannot be replenished by rainfall in normal years let alone dry years moreover the loss of water in the deep soil layers lowers the chances of vegetation to survive a drought chen et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to reveal deep soil water recharge under vegetation since vegetation connects precipitation with groundwater the rwu model can clarify the influence of rwu on the soil water flow dynamics and a precise and proper rwu model is significant for studying water deprivation mechanisms water resources and ecological environmental management especially in arid regions beyer et al 2016 fatemeh karandish and simunek 2016 jha et al 2017 an application oriented approach introduces the rwu into richards s equation as a sink term whereby the potential transpiration is spread over the root zone proportionally by root density feddes 1978 different types of root distribution functions hoogland et al 1981 hoffman and van genuchten 1983 prasad 1988 li et al 1999 combined with water stress response function feddes 1978 were used to describe the nonuniformity of rwu all these models depend on the root distribution which is not readily available these empirical models can get consistent results with field observation in specific conditions for example in uniform moist soil rwu occurs mainly on the soil surface because the root density is the largest however it does not mean that these rwu models are appropriate entirely for instance these models cannot depict that plants could adapt to the inhomogenous distribution of soil water by adjusting their absorption patterns moreover experimental and numerical methods have also proved that rwu is different from the vertical distribution of root density hence the distribution of rwu is estimated using the inverse method zuo and zhang 2002 zuo et al 2004 zuo et al 2006 shi et al 2007 liao et al 2016 the measured values of soil water content swc in soil profiles which can be acquired relatively easily and accurately were used as input information then a soil water flow equation incorporating an unknown sink term was solved inversely for the sink term which characterizes the rwu distribution in the root zone the advantage of this method is not considering the priori estimation of root distribution which overcomes several of the limitations of the current models therefore detailed observation is necessary and antecedent to capture the soil water flow dynamics at the point scale to this end an in situ experiment with a pair of lysimeters was implemented to depict the soil water transport occurring in vegetated and non vegetated soil profiles our objectives were 1 to explore the soil water flow dynamics affected by plant physiological functions 2 to evaluate the effects of vegetation on soil water storage and the deep soil water supply and 3 to develop a rwu model by a flexible inverse method with the measured swc this research points out crucial conclusions for groundwater sustainability and vegetation restoration in regions with limited water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and in situ experiment the study area is located in the southern margin of mu us sandy land see fig 1 with arid and semiarid climate since 1981 the average annual rainfall is 315 2 mm the maximum annual rainfall is 556 mm and the minimum annual rainfall is 227 mm the annual average temperature is 7 7 the average annual potential evapotranspiration is 2200 5 mm the average water table depth in most areas is between 0 5 m and 10 m wang et al 2013b the main vegetation types in this area are bushes and shrubs including salix psammophylla salix is used in the following context artemisia sargassum caragana korshinskii alkaline herb etc some of these species use only soil water in vadose zone some rely primarily on groundwater and some use both specifically salix is the preferred species in wind prevention and sand fixation and generally grows in fixed and semi fixeddunes or inter hill fig 1 with proper groundwater depth being from 1 5 m to 5 m cheng et al 2012 yang et al 2016 however salix is a perennial shrubwhose growth mainly depends on groundwater cheng et al 2012 and even causes a drop of the water table zhao et al 2020 therefore it has considerable impact on vegetation ecology and groundwater resources additionally according to the field investigation and particle size composition obtained in the laboratory salix can develop either vertical root systems or horizontal roots and the aeolian sand property in the salix dominated community was silty fine sand the in situ experiment was conducted at the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of the atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum in the henan experimental station 37 51 n 108 43 e elevation 1209 9 m of the ordos basin northwest china zhao et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 nearby a meteorological station could provide data regarding air temperature rainfall humidity wind speed sunshine hours etc recorded at hourly intervals two cylindrical lysimeters with 420 cm in depth and 200 cm in diameter were set the lysimeters were backfilled uniformly with natural wind blown sand from a nearby field and then settled using water one lysimeter was deployed with salix that was planted in 2015 the spatial and temporal evolution of swc and water table depth fluctuation were monitored for both cases after a one year settling process by this time the average bulk density of soils at different depths in both lysimeters measured in the laboratory was 1 45 g cm3 water table depth was monitored by a mini diver diver inc 0 05 and corrected by a baro diver diver inc 0 1 simultaneously swc and soil temperature were monitored by ech2o 5tm decagon inc 1 2 which were installed at 3 5 10 20 30 50 80 150 170 190 250 and 350 cm depths for the bare site and at 3 5 10 20 30 50 80 150 250 and 350 cm depths for the vegetated site in addition before the installation of 5te the sensors were calibrated by configuring the soil with different gradient swc in accordance with the instrument instruction manual in this study 3 cm is approximately considered as the surface layer all the data were collected and stored with em50 data logger automatically at five minute intervals and the data were downloaded by ech2o utility the details regarding the instrument installation and experimental setup are illustrated in fig 2 the experiment was conducted from april 25 to november 6 in 2016 thus avoiding the frozen period but covering the entire growth period of salix the upper soil was typically frozen for the remainder of the year and the precipitation and evaporation were essential zero 2 2 methods 2 2 1 water balance in the lysimeter system within the experimental area in question no other recharge resources were available except precipitation there was no surface runoff for sandy land with rapid infiltration additionally the soil water flow is hypothesized to be vertical and one dimensional therefore the soil water in the lysimeter conformed to the following water balance equation chen et al 2010 1 δ w p e t a where δ w is the change in soil water storage in the lysimeter including soil water in vadose zone and groundwater in saturated zone mm obtained by checking the swc difference at different time node and a more detailed calculation process can be found in zhao et al 2020 p is precipitation mm which can be measured directly at the meteorological station eta is actual evapotranspiration mm including transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from the underlying soil and it should be replace with ea in the non vegetated site based on the soil water balance principle the cumulative water retention or reduction can therefore be described as follows wang et al 2012 2 l s i s e z s where s i is the initial swc cm3 cm3 s e is the swc cm3 cm3 at the end stage z s is the specified depth cm and l is the cumulative water retention or reduction the extinct evaporation depth of wind blown sand in the mu us sandy land is less than 1 5 m below which groundwater can no longer sustain evaporation through capillary rise zhang et al 2008 ma et al 2019 therefore groundwater will not be reduced by evaporation but can only be increased by rainfall replenishment based on this the increment of soil water in the soil layer above a depth of 150 cm divided by the rainfall capacity is defined as the rainfall retention ratio and the increment of soil water below a depth of 150 cm divided by the rainfall capacity is called the effective rainfall recharge ratio 2 2 2 determination of the hydraulic gradient the hydraulic head is the sum of the pressure head and the elevation head and the hydraulic gradient dh dz determines upward or downward flow in the vadose zone yeh et al 2015 wang et al 2017 accordingly if dh dz greater than 0 the flow is upward if dh dz less than 0 the flow is downward conversely there is neither an upward nor a downward flow if dh dz 0 which is called the zero flux plane soil water flows upward above the zero flux plane and determines the intensity of evaporation soil water flows downward below the zero flux plane to recharge the deep soil water and groundwater through gravity drainage 2 2 3 calculation of the sink term based on the forward finite difference method the sink term was embedded in the one dimensional richards equation to account for rwu feddes 1978 and the equation describing the water flow in saturated unsaturated medium is 3 c h h t z k h h z k h z s z t where h is the pressure head cm k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 c h is the specific water capacity cm 1 s z t is the rwu rate d 1 s z t 0 when z is deeper than the max root length and z t is spatial vertical coordinates and time coordinate respectively in addition we assume that the sink item refers to rwu namely transpiration the domain is a column with a 420 cm depth and is discretized into 85 nodes with each cell being 5 cm long the simulation spanned 190 days starting april 25 2016 and the time interval was one day the initial condition is the measured soil profile water content upper boundary condition is treated as the dirichlet boundary measured surface water potential and the lower boundary is zero flux to solve the above equation using the finite difference method the water flux through the nth unit was calculated by the following equation 4 s z i t j k z i 1 h i 1 j h i j δ z 2 k z i h i j h i 1 j δ z 2 k z i 1 k z i δ z d θ i d h i h i j 1 h i j δ t 5 k z i k n k n 1 where k n and k n 1 are the hydraulic conductivity at the centre node of unit n and unit n 1 respectively and are calculated by the van genuchten empirical formula k z i takes the geometric mean of the adjacent two parts spatially eq 4 combines with eq 5 and further transforms to the following formula through the forward finite difference method 6 c i j k 1 θ i j 1 k 1 θ i j δ t k 1 1 2 j 1 k h i 1 j 1 k 1 h i j 1 k 1 δ z 2 k 1 1 2 j 1 k h i j 1 k 1 h i 1 j 1 k 1 δ z 2 k 1 1 2 j 1 k k 1 1 2 j 1 k δ z s i j the equation is based on a fully implicit discretization of the time derivative in which subscript i indicates the position in the finite difference mesh superscripts k and k 1 denote the previous and current iteration levels respectively and superscripts j and j 1 represent the previous and current time levels respectively water flux through the nth unit integral along the thickness of the unit of soil layer may be calculated as follows 7 s z t s z i t j δ z n 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis it is quite straightforward comparing the findings for the varying soil environments by re running the simulations using different soil specific parameters we performed a sufficient sensitivity analysis for all parameters within the rwu model during the preliminary step i e θr θs ks and hydraulic parameters α n ultimately ks α and n were chosen for a sensitivity analysis to explore how the lysimeter specific rwu model changes with variable hydraulic parameters for the cases where ks was varied α and n corresponded to the initial fittingvalue and were kept constant analogously for the sensitivity analysis of α and n ks was kept constant and corresponded to the testing value the values of ks α and n were adjusted with amplitudes of 5 10 and 20 respectively for sensitivity analysis 2 3 soil hydraulic parameter characteristics the pressured head h can be calculated by the following function 8 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n h 0 θ s h 0 where θs is saturated swc θr is residual swc α is air entry parameter n is pore size distribution parameter the van genuchten s 1980 empirical formula is 9 k h k s 1 α h n 1 1 α h n m 2 1 α h n m 2 m 1 1 n where k s is saturated hydraulic conductivity the samples collected at the field site were duly utilized to provide basic soil tests such as soil water characteristic curves the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the sand could be estimated with the aid of a standpipe device θs and θr were measured in the laboratory a detailed description of the test method and similar parameter results can be found in the literatures ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the parameters e g α and n of the soil water retention curve were obtained through the ku pf apparatus test and fitted by matlab details are provided in table 1 2 4 statistical analyses error analysis of the fitted and the calculated rwu is carried out through r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae eq 10 and eq 11 the correlation coefficient r2 is higher indicating that the simulation value is more reliable the accuracy of the model may be reflected in the

characteristics of key elements in the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum system such as swc evolution water table fluctuations at the bare and vegetated sites and rainfall are presented in fig 3 the rainfall distribution was extremely uneven as manifested in the large difference in its intensity and frequency the accumulated rainfall was 356 3 mm and 68 rainfall events were recorded accounting for 28 4 of the total days during the study period the period from july to september witnessed a concentration of 70 of these rainfall events during the experimental period approximately 52 of rainfall events evinced an amount of 5 0 mm against 26 between 5 0 mm and 10 0 mm 17 between 10 0 mm and 50 0 mm and only 3 50 0 mm the largest daily precipitation was 58 0 mm occurring on august 12 fig 3 b and c illustrate the measured swc of some nodes of the soil profiles in time series for both sites on a daily scale in general the swc in the shallow soil layer changed sharply in both cases corresponding to rainfall increasing rapidly when rainfall occurred and decreasing gradually over the periods without rainfall notably the swc above 30 cm was maintained at a low level and generally did not exceed 0 15 cm3 cm3 for the bare site the swc below 150 cm was higher and relatively stable without being affected by low intensity rainfall except for the concentrated heavy rainfall event in mid august conversely for the vegetated site the swc in the deep layer showed a declining trend affected by the rwu in particular the swc at 150 cm began to decrease gradually in june increased significantly after the heavy rainfall event on august 12 and then gradually decreased the swc at 250 cm decreased rapidly from a near saturated swc level in early august to only 0 1 cm3 cm3 in early november fig 3 d shows the water table depth fluctuations for both cases for the bare site the water table depth was relatively stable at 205 cm before early august an increase of approximately 33 cm was discernible after the most intense rainfall on august 12 after that the water table depth dropped slowly and gradually stabilized at approximately 182 cm for the vegetated site the water table depth was stable at 225 cm before early june and declined at a speed of 2 19 mm d from mid june to early august it continued to decline until early october albeit slower than that of the previous stage finally the water table depth was stable at approximately 350 cm the water table depth at the two sites developed in the opposite direction and the gap became increasingly larger with time 3 2 shallow soil water transport in response to rainfall with and without vegetation the precipitation events occurring in the mu us sandy land can be divided into three regimes a single rainfall pulse moderate rainfall clusters and drastic rainfall pulses specifically a single rainfall event with an intensity of 16 8 mm d rainfall groups with an intensity of less than 10 mm d and rainfall events with an intensity of 58 mm d were chosen as the three rainfall regimes mentioned above to reveal the response of soil water to rainfall infiltration fig 4 shows the impact of different rainfall regimes on the shallow swc above 80 cm for a single rainfall pulse there was an abrupt increase of swc that then decreased slowly but did not return to its original low level unless drought conditions persisted for a long period the increase range of swc decreased with increasing soil depth and the swc at 50 cm was basically not responsive to the single rainfall pulse moderate rainfall clusters accumulated to produce distinct jagged pulses swc the subsequent rainfall infiltration had a superposition effect on the antecedent swc influenced by previous rainfall but the impacted depth was also limited the effect of drastic rainfall on the swc was significant and the impact depth exceeded 80 cm by comparing the difference between the swc in the corresponding positions of both sites it was found the increasing range of swc at the vegetated site in response to rainfall was greater than that at the bare site this result indicated that the root system may improve the soil infiltration capacity to some extent fig 4 also shows that the response of swc at different soil layers for the bare site to rainfall exhibited hysteresis and the hysteretic time prolonged with increasing depth hysteresis became increasingly pronounced with rainfall increasing intensity specifically the hysteresis in a single rainfall pulse was more distinct than that in a sequence of seasonal drastic rainfall events in contrast relatively shorter rainwater infiltration hysteresis was observed at the vegetated site as a preferential channel the root system seemed to increase the rainwater infiltration capacity of sand allowing rainfall driven soil water to penetrate faster and deeper 3 3 effects of vegetation biophysical processes on water transport 3 3 1 vegetation canopy shading fig 5 a shows that the topsoil swc at the vegetated site was almost larger than that at the non vegetated site regardless of whether the soil was dry or wet which was consistent with the results of zeng et al 2006 and wang et al 2012 it can be confirmed that canopy shading blocks solar radiation and then diminishes topsoil soil water evaporation the topsoil temperature at the bare site was higher than that at the vegetated site as shown in fig 5b and increased exponentially with increasing air temperature at both sites 12 t s 6 3034 exp 0 0642 a t r 2 0 8819 for bare site 13 t s 7 647 exp 0 0513 a t r 2 0 8289 for vegetated site where ts denotes the topsoil temperature and at denotes the air temperature 3 3 2 spatiotemporal feature of the sink term fig 6 a presents the calculated rwu of salix along the soil profile obviously the sink term changed with the growth stages and the water availability over different seasons in may the salix seedling relied on soil water above the 150 cm depth since its root distribution was mostly in the shallow layer in june and july the gradually maturing salix switched to utilize deeper soil layers as the shallow layers became dry in august and september coinciding with the rainy season the root system preferentially utilized precipitation derived soil water retained in shallow soil layers however the easily available infiltrated rainwater was inadequate to support the sink term and the root system extended to absorb the deeper soil water at a depth of approximately 300 cm in october and early november the sink term declined significantly with salix withering the distribution function of the sink term was constructed through dynamic mathematical statistical analysis by fitting the calculated rwu as shown in fig 6 b which was consistent with the exponential logarithmic normal composite distribution 14 s α e β z φ z σ 2 π e 1 2 l n τ z μ σ 2 where z is the normalized depth α is the parameter that controls the size of the exponential function β is the shape parameter of the exponential function φ is the parameter that controls the size of the logarithmic normal function τ is the correction factor and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the variable which control the location and the shape of the logarithmic normal function respectively table 2 shows that r 2 tends to be one and the mae and rmse tend to be zero indicating that the accuracy of the algorithm is higher and the model is reliable due to the greater variability of soil moisture affected by complex changes in atmospheric factors the error of the fitting results is relatively large in the shallow layers 3 3 3 hydraulic redistribution evolution with and without vegetation fig 7 shows the vertical hydraulic head distribution for both sites for the bare site dh dz 0 occurred within 30 cm of the soil profile and the deep soil water potential was relatively stable which was consistent with the findings of chen et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 for the vegetated site two zero flux planes one shallow and one deep appeared in the soil layer due to the joint action of evaporation and rwu the shallow zero flux plane was generally not deeper than 30 cm in depth and the soil water in this region was mainly transported upward to participate in evaporation driven by the hydraulic gradient the hydraulic head decreased rapidly from early july with increasing transpiration and the deep zero flux plane stretched to 120 cm in depth peaking in early august the zero flux plane disappeared as a consequence of the intense rainfall on august 12 later with the continuous rwu the two zero flux planes developed once again in early september meanwhile there was a rapid downward movement of the deep zero flux plane which ultimately stabilized more or less at 140 cm 3 4 water balance table 3 shows the ea eta rainfall retention ratio and rainfall recharge ratio during the experimental period based on the principle of water balance described by eq 1 and 2 for the bare site the cumulative ea was 29 1 mm during days 1 45 38 3 mm during days 46 74 74 1 mm during days 75 115 60 8 mm during days 116 153 and 56 9 mm during days 154 196 the ea was smaller than the rainfall in each period and the accumulated ea in the whole study period was 258 4 mm accounting for 72 5 of the total rainfall for the vegetated site the cumulative eta was 64 7 mm during days 1 45 66 4 mm during days 46 74 163 4 mm during days 75 115 200 7 mm during days 116 153 and 118 9 mm during days 154 196 the eta in each period was higher than the corresponding rain capacity and the accumulated eta in the whole growing period was 613 4 mm which was roughly 1 7 times the total rainfall the eta for the vegetated site was more than two times the ea for the bare site in the whole growth stage indicating that transpiration exceeded evaporation with the specified water table depth in this region and was the main hydrological process that reduced soil water table 3 shows that the total soil water volume increase in the lysimeter was 97 9 mm per unit area for the bare site accounting for 27 5 of the rainfall amount of that year in addition 59 9 mm of rainfall was retained above a depth of 150 cm with a retention ratio of 16 8 while 38 0 mm of rainfall eventually recharged the deep soil water with a recharge ratio of 10 7 however for the vegetated site w was negative in each period and the total soil water volume decrease was 257 1 mm per unit area the retention ratio was positive only on days 46 115 and 154 196 and it was negative in other periods the recharge ratio was always negative indicating that rainfall has not recharged the deep soil at the vegetated site 4 discussion 4 1 blocking effects of the vegetation canopy the most direct factor affecting topsoil moisture is soil temperature because the specific heat capacity of aeolian sand is large the topsoil temperature increases rapidly with the increase of air temperature when the air temperature is about 35 the topsoil temperature is nearly 1 7 times that of the air temperature high temperature drives soil water from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase promoting evaporation some scholars have found that topsoil moisture is negatively correlated with air temperature and the two variables have an exponential relationship wang et al 2011a wang et al 2011b wang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 canopy blocks part of solar radiation from reaching the ground resulting in a lower surface temperature in the canopy s shadow and reduces wind speed near the soil surface both of which limit soil evaporation to a certain extent the proportion of the canopy shading area is small in arid ecosystems but may still be ecologically significant noy meir 1973 and may have effects such as improving the local climate canopy interception slows the delivery of rainwater to the ground and directly affects ground surface hydrology interception varies with individual plant forms leaf orientation and size bark roughness and hydrophobicity branch rigidity canopy density etc dunkerley and booth 1999 the canopy intercepts rainwater and part of the rainfall does not penetrate the canopy into the soil this part is held on the leaves and is later returned to the atmosphere through evaporation in particular sporadic low intensity rainfall is largely intercepted by the vegetation canopy nevertheless fig 5a and fig 4 show that the interception of rainfall by salix was not obvious for shrublands the loss to interception is 4 of annual rainfall with much rainwater being effectively transported to the soil layers in the form of stemflow west and gifford 1976 however when rainfall is high rainwater can be delivered to the soil more efficiently in the case of interception occurring dunkerley 2000 because interception can not only delay the arrival but also reduce the intensity of rainwater to the surface thus preventing the loss of runoff 4 2 root channel or intercept infiltrated rainwater the aeolian sand in the mu us sandy land belongs to the category of fine sand with a substantially high infiltration rate a few metres per day and it absorbs rainwater like a sponge generally shrubs have greater root abundance which provides preferential channels for soil water transport and enhances hydraulic conductivity additional studies have shown that revegetation can enhance soil conditions causing a higher infiltration capacity bartley et al 2006 fig 4 shows that the infiltration rate at the vegetated site was much higher than that at the bare site and fu et al 2013 has demonstrated that the influence of shrub root channels on rainfall infiltration depth was greater than 100 cm however fig 4 also shows that the swc at the bare site was generally higher than at the corresponding depth at the vegetated site which has also been confirmed by other studies qiu et al 2001 fu et al 2003 although rainwater infiltration is reinforced most of the rain driven soil water remains in the root zone and is quickly absorbed by the root system in other words the boosted infiltration capacity may not result in greater groundwater recharge due to excessive rwu the root system intercepts and uptakes infiltrated rainwater leading to a severe water deficit in local soil layers as shown in fig 7 even during the rainy season as confirmed by chen et al 2007 this result indicates that the recharge of soil water is not enough to compensate for the consumption of salix moreover the infiltrated rainwater gave priority to replenishing the shallow water deficit zones and supply to quite deep soil as long as it exceeds the demand of vegetation growth which has also been confirmed by fu et al 2013 specific to this study the soil water storage decrease at the vegetated site was 257 1 mm and was 0 72 times the amount of rainfall consequently a lower precipitation offset and no recharge were exhibited at the vegetated site the water deficit soil layers caused by rwu changed the soil water flow field blocked water interchange and interfered with ecohydrological processes excessive soil water depletion is extremely detrimental to vegetation restoration and groundwater recharge and will restrict the level of ecohydrological systems therefore an urgent issue to be resolved is how to balance revegetation and groundwater resources 4 3 rwu in response to rainfall multiple uptake strategies may evolve due to the stochastic nature of precipitation events and subsequently aggravate the complexity of soil water dynamics in the vadose zone the results indicates that the shrubs could develop optimal water use strategies in line with local meteorology and soil water availability at different growth stages to tolerate water shortage flexible water use patterns are vital for the survival of vegetation in dryland regions vegetation can switch their water extraction from one different soil water layer to another for example the primary location of rwu shifted deeper into the soil profile by extending root system when water stress occurred close to the soil surface ogle and reynolds 2004 chen et al 2014 yin et al 2015 indeed some findings have shown that three year old perennials extract water from a depth of 500 cm li and huang 2008 wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b salix specialized in using deeper soil water for drought survival and did not cease to use rainfall infiltration in the shallow layers once rainfall occurred shallow soil water was supplemented and became the main source of rwu once again manifested with the sink term appearing as a peak value in the shallow and deep layers as shown in fig 6a should rainfall replenishment be insufficient however the utilization of deep soil water might prove necessary for longer term survival yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 4 4 evaluation of the inverse rwu model rwu is a dynamic process affected by biological and physical factors quantifying both the species specific sink term and its distribution in the vertical soil profile is challenging in early research the sink term was considered a constant extraction rate feddes 1978 subsequently a linear relationship was suggested between depth and the maximum sink hoogland et al 1981 prasad 1988 hupet et al 2002 the constant sink models and the linear depth dependent extraction models fail to describe the non uniform distribution of rwu in the soil profile adequately an exponential rwu model whereby the sink term increased in the upper layers but decreased in the lower layers evinced a much more realistic water extraction pattern in this case as water stress developed the location of the rwu peak moved downwards along the profile raats 1974 li et al 1999 li et al 2001 vegetation could extract water at the maximum rate according to the root distribution under favourable soil water conditions in other words rwu would remain similar to the root distribution if water content remained in the optimal range throughout the root depth once water stress developed in the upper soil profile the rwu and root distribution diverged the sink term obtained by inversed method is the comprehensive result of biophysical process of vegetation and hydrological process moreover a full growth cycle is deployed for the construction of the sink to guarantee dynamic integrity and authenticity it is well known that the root system of perennial vegetation is in continuous growth which is difficult to capture therefore it is difficult to establish a reliable model through traditional forward modeling because it involves not only the uncertainty of soil hydraulic parameters but also the uncertainty of vegetation root system while the inverse method can obtain a relatively reliable distribution of rwu without a priori knowledge of the root distribution and provide the rwu as a formula of time and depth according to the formula the maximum rwu rate and depth could be estimated the accuracy of numerical water flow models for the vadose zone depends on the estimation of the soil hydraulic properties from the results of the sensitivity analysis shown in fig 8 there is a critical dependency between k s α n and the calculated rwu increasing ks values causes an increase in the calculated rwu still the increase amplitudes are smaller than the variation amplitude of the parameter itself indicating that the calculated rwu is not very sensitive to ks in comparison increasing values of α cause a decrease in the calculated rwu the variation amplitudes of the calculated results tend to be larger than the variation amplitude of the parameter itself when the value of α is reduced which means that the lower values will overestimate the calculated result moreover the change in hydraulic parameter n will cause the increase or decrease in the calculated rwu to different degrees with no uniform trend in summary the importance of variations in α and n is more pronounced than that in k s this application oriented method can be both easily and effectively used to analyse rwu processes without root density for other shrubs with specific root systems nevertheless applying this method has certain limitations that require overcoming such as accurately determining soil water moisture potential and identifying soil hydraulic parameters 4 5 implications for soil water conservation of vegetation to prevent soil and water loss and ecosystem degradation in arid and semiarid areas of northwest china the chinese government has initiated a series of ecological restoration programmes since the 1950 s such as the grain for green project and the nature forest grassland protection project zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2015 hua et al 2016 to some extent restoration projects overemphasize the planting of vegetation and neglect the regional climate hydrological processes and vegetation species it is insufficient to consider only revegetation in pursuit of reducing soil and water loss wang et al 2004 widespread planting of perennials has aggravated the demand for soil water or groundwater and further led to the occurrence of dry soil layers which results in the deterioration of ecosystems and the exacerbation of water deficits wang et al 2010a wang et al 2010b wang et al 2011a wang et al 2011b fu et al 2013 feng et al 2016 therefore it is essential to explore perennials suitability in vegetation restoration projects to prevent conflicts between water yield and vegetation growth wang et al 2020 from the standpoint of formulating reasonable and sustainable ecological restoration policies it may be necessary to identify an optimal level of salix planting density and establish a mosaic vegetation system of shrubs bushes and grasses to sustain groundwater resources if necessary it is better to transform the shrublands to new land use types with lower rwu to mitigate the risks of deep soil water resource depletion this will serve as a basis for defining replanting patterns and facilitating vegetation restoration and the groundwater management sustainability our findings provide a practical reference for the balance between revegetation and effective groundwater recharge some results of our study may vary with vegetation species soil conditions climate conditions and other factors particularly with the decrease of soil moisture under the influence of vegetation and the change of plant physiological function the et of salix will change over the following years furthermore precipitation varies considerably every year in semiarid regions and 2016 may not represent all of the characteristic behaviours in response to rainfall in this region still the precipitation during this year was close to the average annual precipitation in mu us sandy land to some extent it may be more representative of the long term average behaviour therefore in order to overcome the limitations of experiment more researches are urgently needed through continuous multiyear experiments with different water level scenarios and species to provide a more comprehensive understanding on hydrodynamic processes of vegetation in semiarid regions 5 conclusions in this work we contrasted the soil water transport of bare and vegetated sites in the in situ monitoring lysimeter system of atmosphere plant unsaturated zone groundwater continuum in the mu us sandy land of china analyses were performed using field observation over a complete growth stage to provide insight into the impact of typical salix on soil water flow dynamics the study gave rise to the following conclusions for the whole experimental period the evaporation of the bare site was 258 4 mm accounting for 72 5 of the rainfall while the evapotranspiration of the vegetated site was 613 4 mm which was 1 72 times the rainfall and more than 2 38 times the evaporation the total soil water volume increase was 97 9 mm per unit area for the bare site accounting for 27 5 of that year s precipitation with the retention rate of rainfall reaching 16 8 and the recharge rate of deep soil water reaching 10 7 for the vegetated site salix could reduce soil water storage by transpiration and significantly change groundwater recharge conditions an exponential logarithmic normal composite distribution of rwu was obtained by the reverse method revealing that there were one shallow and one deep surface zero flux surface in the soil profile and that the deep zero flux surface could reach 1 4 m underground by rwu the root system could act as the preferred channel that improved soil water permeability but our results showed that the recharge rate of deep soil water did not increase as such infiltrated rainwater could not offset soil water uptake by the root system and a significant water deficient layer in the soil prevented the recharge of groundwater specifically the soil water storage of the vegetated site decreased by 254 4 mm per unit area over a complete growth stage therefore an appropriate planting density is suggested for salix to maintain the sustainability of deep soil water resources undoubtedly our findings provide valuable information related to optimal revegetation strategies and water management in this region credit authorship contribution statement ming zhao writing original draft formal analysis

4153,climate change is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events with alterations to the functioning of the water cycle global scale assessments of shifts in the hydrologic response to climatic perturbations i e hydrologic sensitivity are needed to identify regions where mitigation efforts will be necessary to avert detrimental changes on terrestrial water resources in this work we quantified the hydrologic sensitivity of the terrestrial planet by assessing year to year changes in hydrologic response to the interannual variability in climate forcing

produce a hydrologic sensitivity index hsi evaluating the hydrologic behavior of a location under variable climatic conditions by examining the extent of the changes in evaporative index aet p against the interannual variation in the dryness index pet p for consecutive years this approach produces hsi 1 for hydrologic sensitive regions and hsi 1 for hydrologically resilient locations while also allowing the detection of changes in water yields as well as wetting or drying conditions globally the results indicate that hydrologic sensitive areas are clustered at high and low latitudes at high latitudes boreal and arctic zones show heightened hydrologic sensitivity accompanied by increasing water yields while at low latitudes tropical rainforests show the largest hydrologic sensitivity with the majority of their sensitive area leaning towards decreasing water yields we found that hydrologic sensitivity is amplified at high elevations and steep sloped terrain outlining the importance of topography in modulating the impacts of varying climatic forcing on hydrologic response we direct the attention towards climate warming resulting in rapid snowmelt and increasing precipitation in arctic tundra and boreal forests and reduced tree cover in tropical forests as probable mechanisms driving the observed patterns our study highlights the regions with greatest hydrologic sensitivity to interannual climatic variability motivating further regional and basin scale investigations on their cascading effects on ecosystems and water resources and their attribution keywords hydrologic sensitivity budyko climate variability 1 introduction 1 1 background global warming and human interventions are changing the behavior of earth s water cycle stott 2016 easterling et al 2017 sterling et al 2013 rodell et al 2018 tabari 2020 although there is evidence that extreme weather events and increasing climatic variability are intensifying hydrologic processes worldwide held soden 2006 milly et al 2005 huntington 2006 tabari 2020 creed et al 2014 there is still no consensus on the direction or the magnitude in which different components of the water cycle will respond in the world s major terrestrial ecosystems under these imposed changes stott 2016 zhan et al 2012 salmoral et al 2015 martens et al 2018 padrón et al 2017 as the current human population arrives at a critical environmental carrying capacity and the world enters a warmer climate our planet s ecosystems are changing and adapting seddon et al 2016 pecl et al 2017 bringing along changes in the way water is partitioned in the landscape milly et al 2005 held soden 2006 huntington 2006 creed et al 2014 tabari 2020 whether natural or human induced ecosystems alterations to the water cycle at the global scale need to be urgently assessed particularly in the face of increasing climate variability and the rising numbers and intensity of extreme weather events altering hydrologic processes worldwide stott 2016 milly et al 2005 zhan et al 2012 thus looking at variations in hydrologic response as a function of the variability in climatic forcing offers an opportunity to detect regions where hydrologic dynamics are changing gao et al 2016 furthermore identifying locations with changing hydrologic responses to climatic variability is important for detecting regions arriving at critical thresholds that may compromise the availability of water for both ecosystems and human settlements 1 2 concept of elasticity assessing the hydrologic sensitivity to climate variability can be approached from the concept of elasticity elasticity here is defined as the capacity of a system to keep a consistent response in spite of sudden perturbations and or extreme climatic variability i e hydrologic resilience creed et al 2014 thus in that sense hydrologic sensitivity is the inverse of elasticity and can be used to detect regions with unstable hydrologic systems the elasticity concept has been devised using the well known and widely used budyko s curve creed et al 2014 roderick et al 2014 helman et al 2017 sinha et al 2018 padrón et al 2017 which provides a reference condition on the behavior of the long term mean water balance as a function of the average climatic condition of an area trenberth 2011 roderick et al 2014 helman et al 2017 li et al 2019 budyko 1974 greve et al 2016 fig 1 it uses annual values of potential and actual evapotranspiration pet and aet respectively and precipitation p and examines changes in the evaporative index i e hydrologic response ei aet p against changes in the dryness index i e climate condition di pet p over defined periods of time simply put budyko s curve represents the historical average of multiple catchments across varying climate types therefore a region s ei can be obtained along the curve given information on its climate di thus elasticity e is quantified by how far the ei deviates from budyko s curve b relative to the change in di defined as the ratio between the range of the dryness index δdi and that of the evaporative index relative to the curve δeir δ ei b creed et al 2014 equation 1 positive deviation δei more aet indicates less water yield q water left over on earth s surface after evaporation has taken place while negative deviation δei less aet indicates greater water yield q fig 1 a catchment has high elasticity when there is a small deviation in eir relative to change in di e 1 δdi δeir resilient and low elasticity when a large deviation of eir occurs relative to the change in di e 1 s δdi δeir sensitive 1 e δ d i δ e i r δ d i δ e i b 1 3 the need for a global assessment of hydrologic response to climatic variability although previous studies have documented regions undergoing hydrological changes using the concept of elasticity for showing how varying climate and the intensification of human activities can have a strong influence on year to year changes in hydrologic responses wu et al 2017b creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2017a they have only been assessed in a few catchments within geographically limited regions because of this limited geographic extent other important factors known to modulate climatic variability such as elevation slope and aspect have been ignored for example elevation and aspect in complex terrain alter temperature and humidity regimes across different land conditions within similar climatic zones elevation leads to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes which are further amplified by slope and aspect creating distinct microclimates gutiérrez jurado et al 2006 gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 srivastava et al 2020 together these factors influence the partitioning of water in the landscape and hence its hydrologic response over time gutiérrez jurado et al 2007 raising questions about which of them plays a major role in maintaining a consistent hydrologic behavior in spite of large climatic perturbations e g climatic deviations from the normal changes to hydrologic functioning in response to climatic perturbations are expected to vary widely according to land cover conditions topographic complexity of the terrain and geographic location sterling et al 2013 specifically in places where sensitive characteristics to these perturbations are relevant thus it is important to evaluate the hydrologic responses to climatic variability globally and to assess the recurrence frequency of heightened responses while evaluating the role of terrain properties in locations where relatively minor perturbations result in significant changes in hydrologic functioning in this study we evaluate the hydrologic responses to climatic variability globally and assess the frequency of these responses while evaluating the role of major topographic factors in modulating these responses given that different biomes climate types have unique characteristics and the way they respond to extreme climate forcing is inextricably linked to how it will affect water resources padrón et al 2017 motew and kucharik 2013 gudmundsson et al 2016 we explore the resulting hydrologic sensitive areas for each of the different terrestrial biomes in the world finally we document the average direction in which hydrologic changes occur in these sensitive areas noting if these regions are shifting to drier δdi or wetter state δdi and if they are yielding more δei or less δei water 2 methods 2 1 data collection we use annual values of the 3 key variables aet pet and p for the period of january 2001 to december 2016 due to the availability of datasets the main characteristics i e component product temporal resolution spatial resolution of the satellite products used are listed in table 1 aet is derived from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 at 500 m resolution zhang et al 2019 the pml v2 product performs well against observations at 95 flux sites across the globe and is similar to or noticeably better than other major state of the art aet products such as pml v1 mod16 and gleam zhang et al 2019 pet is derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod16a2 version 6 onboard the terra satellite and produced at 500 m resolution running et al 2017 it has been validated over 46 eddy flux towers and the close agreement in the seasonality between data reveals the reasonability magnitude range and directions of variations for valid pixels running et al 2017 p is derived from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation dataset mswepv2 at 0 1 degree resolution beck et al 2019a this dataset mswepv2 combines gauge and satellite products with multiple corrections for regional differences and has shown to be a robust dataset when compared to other p products with high

classification system persiann ccs 0 04 overall the three products used in this study have been tested worldwide and span a variety of climates and land cover types providing the opportunity to apply these datasets for studies of global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes 2 2 conceptualization of a hydrologic sensitivity index this study focuses on identifying regions showing consistent large departures in hydrologic responses to interannual variations in climate forcings non elastic regions and which may change to an alternative or permanent state in hydrologic functioning thus we devised a metric called the hydrologic sensitivity index hsi by taking the inverse of the elasticity formulation and adapting it for interannual analyses as stated before the elasticity concept is based on budyko s framework which assumes steady state conditions greve et al 2016 that are seldomly observed at interannual scales because our intent is to produce interannual analysis the budyko s formulation needs an adjustment at sub annual and interannual timescales changes in water storage terms such as soil moisture groundwater snow storage or human interventions result in aet p additional water other than p violating the steady state assumptions greve et al 2016 consequently we apply the adapted budyko formulation presented by greve et al 2016 to account for changes in storage ba equation 2a and fig 2 using the parameter y0 which represents a measure of the maximum amount of additional water besides p being available to aet equation 2b 2a b a aet p 1 p e t p 1 1 y 0 k 1 pet p k 1 k 2b w h e r e y 0 aet p pet i f a e t p 0 the y0 parameter is calculated as the difference between aet and p only when aet p 0 normalized by pet note that the schematic of fig 2 is similar to the one in fig 1 with additional curves for the cases when y0 0 for example case a represents the scenario when a region is sensitive between a pair of years since the δeir δdi in this scenario each year s value of y0 determines which curve is used for calculating the deviations in eir following case a when y0 0 then eir ei b while at y0 0 2 eir ei ba 0 2 in similar fashion case b represents the scenario when a region is resilient so δeir δdi note that in this case green coordinates y0 0 2 therefore eir is in reference to the ba 0 2 curve also the deviation may occur in opposite direction for different years since ei can deviate towards positive greater q or negative directions lower q the parameter k is a free model constant that can be interpreted as a factor other than the aridity index that influences the water partitioning of ei this parameter can change spatially and it must be estimated in its global analysis of the modified budyko function accounting for non steady state water storage conditions greve et al 2016 found the k value yielding the best fit to the original budyko curve and determined k 2 6 as an appropriate value to use worldwide to verify this we performed a sensitivity analysis on k varying its values in between 0 6 and found our results were unaffected thus we use k 2 6 which corresponds to the best fit to the original budyko function greve et al 2016 once budyko s curve is adjusted to varying changes in y0 the interannual changes in hydrologic response δeir of a location or region relative to the adapted curve ba can be tracked that is its water yield deviation to interannual climatic variability δdi for consecutive years producing a value for its hydrologic sensitivity hsi can be calculated in the following manner 3 h s i δ e i r δ d i δ e i b a δ d i where sensitive regions will display hsi 1 and resilient locations will show hsi 1 equation 3 it is important to note that hsi evaluates the absolute difference between di and eir between successive years regardless of which year was warmest or wettest a conceptual diagram depicting the algorithm used is shown in fig 3 of which a detailed description is provided next hsi evaluates the absolute ratio between ranges in di and eir values between consecutive years e g h s i δ e i r δ d i δ e i r 2001 2002 δ d i 2001 2002 2 3 computing hsi 2 3 1 computing hsi frequency knowing the year to year hydrologic sensitivity is more meaningful when looked over a longer period of time regions consistently showing sensitive behavior can be identified by looking at the frequency with which hsi 1 is detected fig 3 displays the algorithm for computing hsi frequency first we compute annual values of aet pet p and y0 next we compute hsi for every successive pair of years from 2001 to 2016 all computations leading to the hsi are performed in the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 a total of 15 hsi maps were obtained representing the hsi for each consecutive pair of years for each map where hsi 1 regions are classified as sensitive and for hsi 1 resilient to provide a synthesis of the general trend of global hydrologic sensitivity we display the frequency of hsi showing the recurrence of hsi 1 for every terrestrial location with a range of 0 low frequency to 15 high frequency regions where frequency hsi 7 are considered highly recurring and as such are deemed as the most hydrologically sensitive 2 3 2 computing mean sensitive area besides the geographic occurrence of hydrologic sensitive areas identifying the percentage of sensitive area relative to the total area in a biome can help inform the regions of the world where hydrologic response has been consistently changing fig 4 displays the algorithm for estimating the mean hydrologic sensitive area for each terrestrial biome for this analysis the biome boundaries were obtained from terrestrial ecosystems of the world teow shapefiles fig 5 by the world wildlife fund olson et al 2001 the 15 pairs of δeir s and δdi s per biome are used to quantify the hydrologic sensitivity for every consecutive pair of years hydrologic sensitive areas are represented by the colored quadrants blue and red or tan and blue all colored area shows that the interannual absolute change in evaporative index δei is greater than the interannual absolute change in the dryness index δdi which is equivalent to hsi 1 the diagram is split into 4 quadrants indicating the possible climate and water yield directions drier δdi wetter δdi and less water yield δei and more water yield δei sensitive area grid cells where hsi 1 δeir δdi equivalent to i δeir δdi less water yield and drier climate ii δeir δdi less water yield and wetter climate iii δeir δdi more water yield and wetter climate iv δeir δdi more water yield and drier climate sensitive area is defined by the percentage of sensitive grid cells hsi 1 to the total number of grid cells within each biome once we obtain all 15 values one per pair of years of sensitive area per biome we compute the temporal average additionally we display sensitive areas with direction of change by including the portion of sensitive area allocated toward drier vs wetter climate conditions fig 4a and less vs greater water yield fig 4b and direction of change for instance the percentage of sensitive grid values toward warmer drier δdi and colder wetter δdi values defines the climate direction while decreasing δei and increasing δei water yield defines the water yield direction also the fraction of the sensitive area is plotted relative to the global land area to provide a global areal extent of sensitivity for each biome separately we created two maps to spatially display the median climate and water yield trends only for regions with hsi 1 and frequency 7 2 3 3 evaluating the effect of elevation slope and aspect on hsi we evaluate the effect of topography on hydrologic sensitivity by plotting the average hsi frequency for all elevations ranges binned every 100 m aspects binned every 22 5 and slope steepness binned every 5 against latitudinal change for this analysis we used global digital elevation models dems from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 data 90 m resolution version 4 for latitudes 60 n and gtopo30 1 resolution http lta cr usgs gov gtopo30 for latitudes 60 n seen in table 1 slope and aspect maps were derived from the dems using standard gis based methods in arcmap 10 7 burrough et al 2015 elevation range used is 0 7000 meters above sea level m a s l aspect n ne e se s sw w nw specifically above slope values 10 no flat areas used and slope 0 90 degrees 3 results 3 1 average annual excess water used from storage y0 we identified where water storage was supplementing precipitation to satisfy the annual aet y0 0 fig 6 except in locations where no data values in either aet or pet impeded the calculation of y0 gray areas in fig 6 particularly high values y0 0 2 occur along the yucatan peninsula y0 0 3 0 4 mexico california y0 0 30 0 35 and great plains y0 0 25 usa patagonia region y0 0 28 0 41 argentina tamil nadu and rajasthan y 0 0 3 0 4 india caatinga forest y0

high aet rates e g central valley california and central midwestern usa northern india northeastern china aeschbach hertig gleeson 2012 other areas with large y0 values show groundwater dependent ecosystems where vegetation has a continual access to water regardless of precipitation conditions yielding high annual aet e g yucatan peninsula uuh sonda et al 2018 other regions along high artic tundra northernmost boreal zones and equatorial tropical zones display no excess storage y0 0 while the remaining regions have slight excess water storage y0 0 0 20 see fig 6 3 2 global map of hsi frequency the areas exhibiting the most frequent hydrologic sensitivity during the 2001 2016 period were located in the tropical rainforests tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest of central and south america amazon basin central western africa congo basin and southeast asia himalayan region indochinese peninsula and malay archipelago the arctic tundra parts of the boreal forest and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests scattered throughout north america and eurasia fig 7 overall arid and semiarid areas worldwide display low frequency 2 of hsi and the areas displaying the highest frequency 7 are in general surrounded by a zone of increasingly lower hsi frequency orange and yellow areas in fig 7 outwards the areas where no hydrologic sensitivity is detected hsi 1 during the period of study 2001 2016 are regions with large interannual variability in climatic conditions a map showing the coefficient of variation cv of the dryness index di reveals that the regions of the world where this coefficient is large values close to 1 show locations with high variability closely match those with no hydrologic sensitivity 0 frequency of hsi 1 fig 8 a in those places the interannual variability of the di outweighs any moderate or even large variabilities in evaporative index ei fig 8 b by contrast the areas where the highest frequency of hydrologic sensitivity is observed correspond to locations with low or moderate interannual variability in di and ei i e cv of di and ei 0 4 this suggests that hydrologic sensitivity as measured by hsi is largely dependent on the prevailing interannual variability of the fluctuations in climatic conditions expressed by the di this finding gives confidence in the ability of the hsi to detect those locations where in spite of having low year to year variations in climatic conditions relatively large variations in the evaporative index are occurring 3 3 mean sensitive area per biome w climate and water yield direction fig 9 displays mean sensitive area per biome arranged from least to largest hydrologic sensitive the biomes displaying the largest sensitive area in descending order are tropical rainforests the arctic tundra tropical and subtropical coniferous forests and boreal forests tropical subtropical rainforests and coniferous forests display decreasing water yields while tundra and boreal systems display increasing water yields relative to global land boreal forests have the greatest actual areal extent of hydrologic sensitive land followed by tropical rainforests and grasslands tropical subtropical grassland savannas and shrublands the hydrologic sensitive area in the majority of the biomes 12 out of 14 biomes have a clear tendency towards decreasing water yield conditions with the exception of the arctic tundra and temperate broadleaf mixed forests mixed forests which display a neutral behavior although the climate direction is roughly neutral for most biomes the hydrologic sensitive area in 9 out of 14 biomes is slightly inclined toward drier conditions with the exception of the arctic tundra mixed forests temperate coniferous forests tropical subtropical coniferous forests and tropical rainforests which lean toward wetter colder conditions 3 3 1 global map of water yield and climate direction for regions with high hsi frequency focusing on only those regions where hsi frequency 7 mainly equatorial and northern high latitudes the median direction in water yield δei and climate direction δdi is displayed in fig 10 and 11 respectively fig 10 displays dominant decreasing water yield tan for the majority of pixels within tropical forest equatorial zones while increasing water yields blue is evident in the northern high latitude regions particularly along alaskan easternmost canadian and eurasian arctic regions and boreal forests fig 11 displays a general neutral tendency in climate conditions in dry red vs wet blue for these same regions in particular nonetheless the map displays drying warmer conditions along southern part and southern edge of the amazon basin western and central congo basin and northeastern part canadian and eurasian continent colder wetter conditions are seen along northern part of the amazon basin and northmost siberian region 3 4 effect of elevation slope and aspect on hsi the topographic effects on hydrologic sensitive areas are most apparent along high latitude regions particularly at mountainous locations in both hemispheres including the tibetan plateau 33 n as seen in fig 12 a c for example in fig 12a elevation appears to be a defining parameter driving hydrologic sensitivity beyond 45 latitude in both north and south hemispheres conversely midlatitude regions between 20 and 40 in both south and north hemispheres appear to be somewhat hydrologically insensitive to changes in elevation but most markedly and for a larger latitudinal stretch in the southern hemisphere the latitudinal stretch on the northern hemisphere where hsi values are low across all elevation ranges is 5 shorter than in the southern hemisphere 20 to 40 vs 30 to 45 respectively along the equatorial belt in between 15 s and 7 n high hsi values appear at the lowlands 0 500 m a s l and above 1500 m a s l throughout all the elevation range with the highest sensitivity above 2000 m a s l in the same latitudes where high hsi is found across elevation gradients steep slopes slopes 30 display high hsi values in fig 12b mainly attributed to the various effects of mountainous landscapes that are generally associated with having steep sloped topography compared to low elevations riebe et al 2015 along the equatorial zone 7 n and 10 s high hsi values are found at the majority of slope angles but with highest sensitivity at slopes 15 in the northern hemisphere hsi gradually increases beginning at latitude 45 and beyond but has specific thin latitudinal stretches 2 of higher sensitivity at slopes 30 around 50 60 70 and 80 in the southern hemisphere especially at slopes 60 hsi increases abruptly with higher latitudes beginning at 40 and beyond while between latitudes of 20 and 40 location of arid lands appear to be insensitive at all slope angles and elevations in our analysis aspect orientation of the terrain did not show an effect on hsi fig 12c this is possibly due to the inability of the hsi data to capture the fine scale microclimatic variability in areas with complex terrain due to the native spatial resolution of the data 500 m there is evidence that varying aspects in complex terrain modulate the hydrologic response to extreme hydroclimatic events gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 gutiérrez jurado et al 2007 and could potentially amplify or mute the hsi of headwater catchments constituting some of the largest water yielding areas inland further studies addressing this shortcoming in the analysis with higher resolution data should provide a clearer picture on the impact of terrain attributes on the hsi of these regions 4 discussion in this study we showed a global map displaying excess storage water these regions agree with locations of some of the world s groundwater dependent ecosystems and groundwater fed irrigated croplands rodell et al 2018 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 regions displaying no excess water storage such as northern high latitude regions and equatorial tropical zones are mostly explained by being energy limited regions and receiving large amounts of precipitation resulting in larger moisture influxes relative to evapotranspiration outfluxes the relatively simple computation of y0 can provide a first insight into out of water balance areas that can alter the estimates of hydrologic sensitivity by raising aet totals substantially at the annual scale our analyses indicate that the majority of the regions detected as hydrologic sensitive areas are changing towards drier conditions with decreasing water yields this observation coincides with a phenomenon suggested by cook et al 2014 in which vast regions of land in the planet are experiencing at least moderate drying as a warmer climate generally more able to evaporate moisture from the land surface in combination with hotter temperatures will favor increasing dryness our results showed that the locations with the highest hsi can be clustered in two regions 1 tropical zones across all elevation ranges 2 along artic tundra and boreal zones for the first region at equatorial latitudes we found hydrologic sensitivity in tropical rainforests associated with changing water yields a majority of tropical regions show decreasing water yields while fewer regions show increasing trends fig 9 there is still no consensus as to whether reduced forest cover will increase or decrease water yields across these regions bruijnzeel 2004 zhou et al 2013 roudier et al 2014 reyer et al 2017 deb et al 2018 reduced forest cover which has been shown to alter precipitation patterns ellison et al 2012 van der ent et al 2010 resulting in reductions in leaf gas exchanges seddon et al 2016 clark et al 2003 staal et al 2018 wu et al 2019 along these regions is a potential explanation to the observed reductions in water yields placed in a large scale context a great portion of tropical forests rainfall is water recycled within these basins by forest evapotranspiration van der ent et al 2010 lenton et al 2008 for instance approximately one third of rainfall in the amazon staal et al 2018 van der ent et al 2010 lenton et al 2008 congo van der ent et al 2010 dyer et al 2017 and northern indonesia and papua new guinea basins is regional recycled precipitation van der ent et al 2010 hence a reduction in tropical forest cover leads to decreases in forest evapotranspiration which in turn results in reduced precipitation consequently reduced regional recycled precipitation at large scales implies a tendency toward decreasing water yields this highlights the hydrologic sensitivity of tropical regions to forest cover changes continuing deforestation and human land use and disturbances at continental scale currently highest in this terrestrial biome crowther et al 2015 have the potential to amplify the negative impact seen on water yields davidson et al 2012 in contrast regions south of indonesia and papua new guinea where ocean moisture is the main precipitation source shows some of the areas where forest cover loss is accompanied by increasing water yield trends van der ent et al 2010 in addition there is evidence that regional recycling ratios are amplified at mountainous regions globally since these areas are able to block moisture from entering continents or easily capture moisture from the atmosphere van der ent et al 2010 accelerating vegetation changes involving biodiversity loss and reduction of tropical alpine areas buytaert et al 2011 is therefore a plausible cause for decreased water yields along these regions for the second region at high latitudes in the past three decades temperatures have increased rapidly mainly in the northern hemisphere hartmann et al 2013 as a consequence rapid rates of snow melt have been observed in arctic tundra and boreal forests in response to warming temperatures lópez moreno et al 2020 najafi et al 2015 pepin et al 2015 myers smith et al 2015 lamprecht et al 2018 these regions are warming more rapidly than lower latitudes due to polar amplification of temperature water vapour and surface albedo feedbacks myers smith et al 2015 chapin 2005 hinzman et al 2013 there is also evidence that this effect is enhanced at high elevation regions where snow accumulation is greatest and changes in precipitation patterns are occurring e g regions in the tibetan plateau rocky mountains greater alpine region pepin et al 2015 ohmura 2012 zhang et al 2013 yan et al 2016 palazzi et al 2019 for example recent findings have shown increases in lake levels and volumes in the tibetan plateau related to temperature amplification resulting in enhanced precipitation from a faster warming rate compared to the mean global warming zhang et al 2020 also high latitude and mountainous regions of siberian and canadian arctic and boreal zones have seen increasing water yield trends due to ice sheet loss increasing precipitation thawing and shrub growth in steep slopes rodell et al 2018 myers smith et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 these lines of evidence are consistent with our findings of high hsi areas leaning toward higher water yields in these regions and particularly those along the siberian and easternmost canadian and euroasian arctic 5 concluding remarks we identified regions with hydrologic sensitivity to climate variability globally and at high spatial and temporal resolution within high and low latitudes at high latitudes boreal and arctic zones show heightened hydrologic sensitivity accompanied by increasing water yields while at low latitudes tropical rainforests show the largest hydrologic sensitivity with the majority of their sensitive area leaning towards decreasing water yields we found that hydrologic sensitivity is amplified at high elevations and steep sloped terrain outlining the importance of topography in modulating these effects with strong implications for high water yielding headwater catchments we direct the attention towards climate warming resulting in increasing snow melt and precipitation in arctic tundra and boreal forests and increasing tree cover loss in tropical forests as possible mechanisms driving the observed patterns although there is no clear consensus yet on the direction surface water yields would take in tropical zones as a result of climate variability our findings suggest that hydrologic sensitivity may be linked to vegetation changes other land cover changes associated with altered climatic patterns across high latitude regions may be contributing to changing hydrologic dynamics myers smith et al 2015 in areas displayed in our hsi analysis as highly sensitive locations globally boreal and tropical forests the two biomes producing the greatest water yields also display the greatest extent of hydrologic sensitive land this makes them hotspots for hydrologic surveillance to expected impacts from further increases in climatic shifts with the potential to significantly alter the global water cycle future work should determine if the hydrologic sensitivity patterns found in this study represent tipping points in changing hydrologic dynamics within each

4153,climate change is driving an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events with alterations to the functioning of the water cycle global scale assessments of shifts in the hydrologic response to climatic perturbations i e hydrologic sensitivity are needed to identify regions where mitigation efforts will be necessary to avert detrimental changes on terrestrial water resources in this work we quantified the hydrologic sensitivity of the terrestrial planet by assessing year to year changes in hydrologic response to the interannual variability in climate forcing during the 2001 2016 period while evaluating the role of major topoclimatic factors in modulating these responses using a metric derived from the inverse of the elasticity concept in budyko s space we produce a hydrologic sensitivity index hsi evaluating the hydrologic behavior of a location under variable climatic conditions by examining the extent of the changes in evaporative index aet p against the interannual variation in the dryness index pet p for consecutive years this approach produces hsi 1 for hydrologic sensitive regions and hsi 1 for hydrologically resilient locations while also allowing the detection of changes in water yields as well as wetting or drying conditions globally the results indicate that hydrologic sensitive areas are clustered at high and low latitudes at high latitudes boreal and arctic zones show heightened hydrologic sensitivity accompanied by increasing water yields while at low latitudes tropical rainforests show the largest hydrologic sensitivity with the majority of their sensitive area leaning towards decreasing water yields we found that hydrologic sensitivity is amplified at high elevations and steep sloped terrain outlining the importance of

sensitivity budyko climate variability 1 introduction 1 1 background global warming and human interventions are changing the behavior of earth s water cycle stott 2016 easterling et al 2017 sterling et al 2013 rodell et al 2018 tabari 2020 although there is evidence that extreme weather events and increasing climatic variability are intensifying hydrologic processes worldwide held soden 2006 milly et al 2005 huntington 2006 tabari 2020 creed et al 2014 there is still no consensus on the direction or the magnitude in which different components of the water cycle will respond in the world s major terrestrial ecosystems under these imposed changes stott 2016 zhan et al 2012 salmoral et al 2015 martens et al 2018 padrón et al 2017 as the current human population arrives at a critical environmental carrying capacity and the world enters a warmer climate our planet s ecosystems are changing and adapting seddon et al 2016 pecl et al 2017 bringing along changes in the way water is partitioned in the landscape milly et al 2005 held soden 2006 huntington 2006 creed et al 2014 tabari 2020 whether natural or human induced ecosystems alterations to the water cycle at the global scale need to be urgently assessed particularly in the face of increasing climate variability and the rising numbers and intensity of extreme weather events altering hydrologic processes worldwide stott 2016 milly et al 2005 zhan et al 2012 thus looking at variations in hydrologic response as a function of the variability in climatic forcing offers an opportunity to detect regions where hydrologic dynamics are changing gao et al 2016 furthermore identifying locations with changing hydrologic responses to climatic variability is important for detecting regions arriving at critical thresholds that may compromise the availability of water for both ecosystems and human settlements 1 2 concept of elasticity assessing the hydrologic sensitivity to climate variability can be approached from the concept of elasticity elasticity here is defined as the capacity of a system to keep a consistent response in spite of sudden perturbations and or extreme climatic variability i e hydrologic resilience creed et al 2014 thus in that sense hydrologic sensitivity is the inverse of elasticity and can be used to detect regions with unstable hydrologic systems the elasticity concept has been devised using the well known and widely used budyko s curve creed et al 2014 roderick et al 2014 helman et al 2017 sinha et al 2018 padrón et al 2017 which provides a reference condition on the behavior of the long term mean water balance as a function of the average climatic condition of an area trenberth 2011 roderick et al 2014 helman et al 2017 li et al 2019 budyko 1974 greve et al 2016 fig 1 it uses annual values of potential and actual evapotranspiration pet and aet respectively and precipitation p and examines changes in the evaporative index i e hydrologic response ei aet p against changes in the dryness index i e climate condition di pet p over defined periods of time simply put budyko s curve represents the historical average of multiple catchments across varying climate types therefore a region s ei can be obtained along the curve given information on its climate di thus elasticity e is quantified by how far the ei deviates from budyko s curve b relative to the change in di defined as the ratio between the range of the dryness index δdi and that of the evaporative index relative to the curve δeir δ ei b creed et al 2014 equation 1 positive deviation δei more aet indicates less water yield q water left over on earth s surface after evaporation has taken place while negative deviation δei less aet indicates greater water yield q fig 1 a catchment has

δeir sensitive 1 e δ d i δ e i r δ d i δ e i b 1 3 the need for a global assessment of hydrologic response to climatic variability although previous studies have documented regions undergoing hydrological changes using the concept of elasticity for showing how varying climate and the intensification of human activities can have a strong influence on year to year changes in hydrologic responses wu et al 2017b creed et al 2014 helman et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2017a they have only been assessed in a few catchments within geographically limited regions because of this limited geographic extent other important factors known to modulate climatic variability such as elevation slope and aspect have been ignored for example elevation and aspect in complex terrain alter temperature and humidity regimes across different land conditions within similar climatic zones elevation leads to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes which are further amplified by slope and aspect creating distinct microclimates gutiérrez jurado et al 2006 gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 srivastava et al 2020 together these factors influence the partitioning of water in the landscape and hence its hydrologic response over time gutiérrez jurado et al 2007 raising questions about which of them plays a major role in maintaining a consistent hydrologic behavior in spite of large climatic perturbations e g climatic deviations from the normal changes to hydrologic functioning in response to climatic perturbations are expected to vary widely according to land cover conditions topographic complexity of the terrain and geographic location sterling et al 2013 specifically in places where sensitive characteristics to these perturbations are relevant thus it is important to evaluate the hydrologic responses to climatic variability globally and to assess the recurrence frequency of heightened responses while evaluating the role of terrain properties in locations where relatively minor perturbations result in significant changes in hydrologic functioning in this study we evaluate the hydrologic responses to climatic variability globally and assess the frequency of these responses while evaluating the role of major topographic factors in modulating these responses given that different biomes climate types have unique characteristics and the way they respond to extreme climate forcing is inextricably linked to how it will affect water resources padrón et al 2017 motew and kucharik 2013 gudmundsson et al 2016 we explore the resulting hydrologic sensitive areas for each of the different terrestrial biomes in the world finally we document the average direction in which hydrologic changes occur in these sensitive areas noting if these regions are shifting to drier δdi or wetter state δdi and if they are yielding more δei or less δei water 2 methods 2 1 data collection we use annual values of the 3 key variables aet pet and p for the period of january 2001 to december 2016 due to the availability of datasets the main characteristics i e component product temporal resolution spatial resolution of the satellite products used are listed in table 1 aet is derived from penman monteith leuning version 2 pml v2 at 500 m resolution zhang et al 2019 the pml v2 product performs well against observations at 95 flux sites across the globe and is similar to or noticeably better than other major state of the art aet products such as pml v1 mod16 and gleam zhang et al 2019 pet is derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod16a2 version 6 onboard the terra satellite and produced at 500 m resolution running et al 2017 it has been validated over 46 eddy flux towers and the close agreement in the seasonality between data reveals the reasonability magnitude range and directions of variations for valid pixels running et al 2017 p is derived from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation dataset mswepv2 at 0 1 degree resolution beck et al 2019a this dataset mswepv2 combines gauge and satellite products with multiple corrections for regional differences and has shown to be a robust dataset when compared to other p products with high

classification system persiann ccs 0 04 overall the three products used in this study have been tested worldwide and span a variety of climates and land cover types providing the opportunity to apply these datasets for studies of global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes 2 2 conceptualization of a hydrologic sensitivity index this study focuses on identifying regions showing consistent large departures in hydrologic responses to interannual variations in climate forcings non elastic regions and which may change to an alternative or permanent state in hydrologic functioning thus we devised a metric called the hydrologic sensitivity index hsi by taking the inverse of the elasticity formulation and adapting it for interannual analyses as stated before the elasticity concept is based on budyko s framework which assumes steady state conditions greve et al 2016 that are seldomly observed at interannual scales because our intent is to produce interannual analysis the budyko s formulation needs an adjustment at sub annual and interannual timescales changes in water storage terms such as soil moisture groundwater snow storage or human interventions result in aet p additional water other than p violating the steady state assumptions greve et al 2016 consequently we apply the adapted budyko formulation presented by greve et al 2016 to account for changes in storage ba equation 2a and fig 2 using the parameter y0 which represents a measure of the maximum amount of additional water besides p being available to aet equation 2b 2a b a aet p 1 p e t p 1 1 y 0 k 1 pet p k 1 k 2b w h e r e y 0 aet p pet i f a e t p 0 the y0 parameter is calculated as the difference between aet and p only when aet p 0 normalized by pet note that the schematic of fig 2 is similar to the one in fig 1 with additional curves for the cases when y0 0 for example case a represents the scenario when a region is sensitive between a pair of years since the δeir δdi in this scenario each year s value of y0 determines which curve is used for calculating the deviations in eir following case a when y0 0 then eir ei b while at y0 0 2 eir ei ba 0 2 in similar fashion case b represents the scenario when a region is resilient so δeir δdi note that in this case green coordinates y0 0 2 therefore eir is in reference to the ba 0 2 curve also the deviation may occur in opposite direction for different years since ei can deviate towards positive greater q or negative directions lower q the parameter k is a free model constant that can be interpreted as a factor other than the aridity index that influences the water partitioning of ei this parameter can change spatially and it must be estimated in its global analysis of the modified budyko function accounting for non steady state water storage conditions greve et al 2016 found the k value yielding the best fit to the original budyko curve and determined k 2 6 as an appropriate value to use worldwide to verify this we performed a sensitivity analysis on k varying its values in between 0 6 and found our results were unaffected thus we use k 2 6 which corresponds to the best fit to the original budyko function greve et al 2016 once budyko s curve is adjusted to varying changes in y0 the interannual changes in hydrologic response δeir of a location or region relative to the adapted curve ba can be tracked that is its water yield deviation to interannual climatic variability δdi for consecutive years producing a value for its hydrologic sensitivity hsi can be calculated in the following manner 3 h s i δ e i r δ d i δ e i b a δ d i where sensitive regions will display hsi 1 and resilient locations will show hsi 1 equation 3 it is important to note that hsi evaluates the absolute difference between di and eir between successive years regardless of which year was warmest or wettest a conceptual diagram depicting the algorithm used is shown in fig 3 of which a detailed description is provided next hsi evaluates the absolute ratio between ranges in di and eir values between consecutive years e g h s i δ e i r δ d i δ e i r 2001 2002 δ d i 2001 2002 2 3 computing hsi 2 3 1 computing hsi frequency knowing the year to year hydrologic sensitivity is more meaningful when looked over a longer period of time regions consistently showing sensitive behavior can be identified by looking at the frequency with which hsi 1 is detected fig 3 displays the algorithm for computing hsi frequency first we compute annual values of aet pet p and y0 next we compute hsi for every successive pair of years from 2001 to 2016 all computations leading to the hsi are performed in the google earth engine platform gorelick et al 2017 a total of 15 hsi maps were obtained representing the hsi for each consecutive pair of years for each map where hsi 1 regions are classified as sensitive and for hsi 1 resilient to provide a synthesis of the general trend of global hydrologic sensitivity we display the frequency of hsi showing the recurrence of hsi 1 for every terrestrial location with a range of 0 low frequency to 15 high frequency regions where frequency hsi 7 are considered highly recurring and as such are deemed as the most hydrologically sensitive 2 3 2 computing mean sensitive area besides the geographic occurrence of hydrologic sensitive areas identifying the percentage of sensitive area relative to the total area in a biome can help inform the regions of the world where hydrologic response has been consistently changing fig 4 displays the algorithm for estimating the mean hydrologic sensitive area for each terrestrial biome for this analysis the biome boundaries were obtained from terrestrial ecosystems of the world teow shapefiles fig 5 by the world wildlife fund olson et al 2001 the 15 pairs of δeir s and δdi s per biome are used to quantify the hydrologic sensitivity for every consecutive pair of years hydrologic sensitive areas are represented by the colored quadrants blue and red or tan and blue all colored area shows that the interannual absolute change in evaporative index δei is greater than the interannual absolute change in the dryness index δdi which is equivalent to hsi 1 the diagram is split into 4 quadrants indicating the possible climate and water yield directions drier δdi wetter δdi and less water yield δei and more water yield δei sensitive area grid cells where hsi 1 δeir δdi equivalent to i δeir δdi less water yield and drier climate ii δeir δdi less water yield and wetter climate iii δeir δdi more water yield and wetter climate iv δeir δdi more water yield and drier climate sensitive area is defined by the percentage of sensitive grid cells hsi 1 to the total number of grid cells within each biome once we obtain all 15 values one per pair of years of sensitive area per biome we compute the temporal average additionally we display sensitive areas with direction of change by including the portion of sensitive area allocated toward drier vs wetter climate conditions fig 4a and less vs greater water yield fig 4b and direction of change for instance the percentage of sensitive grid values toward warmer drier δdi and colder wetter δdi values defines the climate direction while decreasing δei and increasing δei water yield defines the water yield direction also the fraction of the sensitive area is plotted relative to the global land area to provide a global areal extent of sensitivity for each biome separately we created two maps to spatially display the median climate and water yield trends only for regions with hsi 1 and frequency 7 2 3 3 evaluating the effect of elevation slope and aspect on hsi we evaluate the effect of topography on hydrologic sensitivity by plotting the average hsi frequency for all elevations ranges binned every 100 m aspects binned every 22 5 and slope steepness binned every 5 against latitudinal change for this analysis we used global digital elevation models dems from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 data 90 m resolution version 4 for latitudes 60 n and gtopo30 1 resolution http lta cr usgs gov gtopo30 for latitudes 60 n seen in table 1 slope and aspect maps were derived from the dems using standard gis based methods in arcmap 10 7 burrough et al 2015 elevation range used is 0 7000 meters above sea level m a s l aspect n ne e se s sw

precipitation to satisfy the annual aet y0 0 fig 6 except in locations where no data values in either aet or pet impeded the calculation of y0 gray areas in fig 6 particularly high values y0 0 2 occur along the yucatan peninsula y0 0 3 0 4 mexico california y0 0 30 0 35 and great plains y0 0 25 usa patagonia region y0 0 28 0 41 argentina tamil nadu and rajasthan y 0 0 3 0 4 india caatinga forest y0

high aet rates e g central valley california and central midwestern usa northern india northeastern china aeschbach hertig gleeson 2012 other areas with large y0 values show groundwater dependent ecosystems where vegetation has a continual access to water regardless of precipitation conditions yielding high annual aet e g yucatan peninsula uuh sonda et al 2018 other regions along high artic tundra northernmost boreal zones and equatorial tropical zones display no excess storage y0 0 while the remaining regions have slight excess water storage y0 0 0 20 see fig 6 3 2 global map of hsi frequency the areas exhibiting the most frequent hydrologic sensitivity during the 2001 2016 period were located in the tropical rainforests tropical subtropical moist broadleaf forest of central and south america amazon basin central western africa congo basin and southeast asia himalayan region indochinese peninsula and malay archipelago the arctic tundra parts of the boreal forest and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests scattered throughout north america and eurasia fig 7 overall arid and semiarid areas worldwide display low frequency 2 of hsi and the areas displaying the highest frequency 7 are in general surrounded by a zone of increasingly lower hsi frequency orange and yellow areas in fig 7 outwards the areas where no hydrologic sensitivity is detected hsi 1 during the period of study 2001 2016 are regions with large interannual variability in climatic conditions a map showing the coefficient of variation cv of the dryness index di reveals that the regions of the world where this coefficient is large values close to 1 show locations with high variability closely match those with no hydrologic sensitivity 0 frequency of hsi 1 fig 8 a in those places the interannual variability of the di outweighs any moderate or even large variabilities in evaporative index ei fig 8 b by contrast the areas where the highest frequency of hydrologic sensitivity is observed correspond to locations with low or moderate interannual variability in di and ei i e cv of di and ei 0 4 this suggests that hydrologic sensitivity as measured by hsi is largely dependent on the prevailing interannual variability of the fluctuations in climatic conditions expressed by the di this finding gives confidence in the ability of the hsi to detect those locations where in spite of having low year to year variations in climatic conditions relatively large variations in the evaporative index are occurring 3 3 mean sensitive area per biome w climate and water yield direction fig 9 displays mean sensitive area per biome arranged from least to largest hydrologic sensitive the biomes displaying the largest sensitive area in descending order are tropical rainforests the arctic tundra tropical and subtropical coniferous forests and boreal forests tropical subtropical rainforests and coniferous forests display decreasing water yields while tundra and boreal systems display increasing water yields relative to global land boreal forests have the greatest actual areal extent of hydrologic sensitive land followed by tropical rainforests and grasslands tropical subtropical grassland savannas and shrublands the hydrologic sensitive area in the majority of the biomes 12 out of 14 biomes have a clear tendency towards decreasing water yield conditions with the exception of the arctic tundra and temperate broadleaf mixed forests mixed forests which display a neutral behavior although the climate direction is roughly neutral for most biomes the hydrologic sensitive area in 9 out of 14 biomes is slightly inclined toward drier conditions with the exception of the arctic tundra mixed forests temperate coniferous forests tropical subtropical coniferous forests and tropical rainforests which lean toward wetter colder conditions 3 3 1 global map of water yield and climate direction for regions with high hsi frequency focusing on only those regions where hsi frequency 7 mainly equatorial and northern high latitudes the median direction in water yield δei and climate direction δdi is displayed in fig 10 and 11 respectively fig 10 displays dominant decreasing water yield tan for the majority of pixels within tropical forest equatorial zones while increasing water yields blue is evident in the northern high latitude regions particularly along alaskan easternmost canadian and eurasian arctic regions and boreal forests fig 11 displays a general neutral tendency in climate conditions in dry red vs wet blue for these same regions in particular nonetheless the map displays drying warmer conditions along southern part and southern edge of the amazon basin western and central congo basin and northeastern part canadian and eurasian continent colder wetter conditions are seen along northern part of the amazon basin and northmost siberian region 3 4 effect of elevation slope and aspect on hsi the topographic effects on hydrologic sensitive areas are most apparent along high latitude regions particularly at mountainous locations in both hemispheres including the tibetan plateau 33 n as seen in fig 12 a c for example in fig 12a elevation appears to be a defining parameter driving hydrologic sensitivity beyond 45 latitude in both north and south hemispheres conversely midlatitude regions between 20 and 40 in both south and north hemispheres appear to be somewhat hydrologically insensitive to changes in elevation but most markedly and for a larger latitudinal stretch in the southern hemisphere the latitudinal stretch on the northern hemisphere where hsi values are low across all elevation ranges is 5 shorter than in the southern hemisphere 20 to 40 vs 30 to 45 respectively along the equatorial belt in between 15 s and 7 n high hsi values appear at the lowlands 0 500 m a s l and above 1500 m a s l throughout all the elevation range with the highest sensitivity above 2000 m a s l in the same latitudes where high hsi is found across elevation gradients steep slopes slopes 30 display high hsi values in fig 12b mainly attributed to the various effects of mountainous landscapes that are generally associated with having steep sloped topography compared to low elevations riebe et al 2015 along the equatorial zone 7 n and 10 s high hsi values are found at the majority of slope angles but with highest sensitivity at slopes 15 in the northern hemisphere hsi gradually increases beginning at latitude 45 and beyond but has specific thin latitudinal stretches 2 of higher sensitivity at slopes 30 around 50 60 70 and 80 in the southern hemisphere especially at slopes 60 hsi increases abruptly with higher latitudes beginning at 40 and beyond while between latitudes of 20 and 40 location of arid lands appear to be insensitive at all slope angles and elevations in our analysis aspect orientation of the terrain did not show an effect on hsi fig 12c this is possibly due to the inability of the hsi data to capture the fine scale microclimatic variability in areas with complex terrain due to the native spatial resolution of the data 500 m there is evidence that varying aspects in complex terrain modulate the hydrologic response to extreme hydroclimatic events gutiérrez jurado et al 2013 gutiérrez jurado et al 2007 and could potentially amplify or mute the hsi of headwater catchments constituting some of the largest water yielding areas inland further studies addressing this shortcoming in the analysis with higher resolution data should provide a clearer picture on the impact of terrain attributes on the hsi of these regions 4 discussion in this study we showed a global map displaying excess storage water these regions agree with locations of some of the world s groundwater dependent ecosystems and groundwater fed irrigated croplands rodell et al 2018 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 regions displaying no excess water storage such as northern high latitude regions and equatorial tropical zones are mostly explained by being energy limited regions and receiving large amounts of precipitation resulting in larger moisture influxes relative to evapotranspiration outfluxes the relatively simple computation of y0 can provide a first insight into out of water balance areas that can alter the estimates of hydrologic sensitivity by raising aet totals substantially at the annual scale our analyses indicate that the majority of the regions detected as hydrologic sensitive areas are changing towards drier conditions with decreasing water yields this observation coincides with a phenomenon suggested by cook et al 2014 in which vast regions of land in the planet are experiencing at least moderate drying as a warmer climate generally more able to evaporate moisture from the land surface in combination with hotter temperatures will favor increasing dryness our results showed that the locations with the highest hsi can be clustered in two regions 1 tropical zones across all elevation ranges 2 along artic tundra and boreal zones for the first region at equatorial latitudes we found hydrologic sensitivity in tropical rainforests associated with changing water yields a majority of tropical regions show decreasing water yields while fewer regions show increasing trends fig 9 there is still no consensus as to whether reduced forest cover will increase or decrease water yields across these regions bruijnzeel 2004 zhou et al 2013 roudier et al 2014 reyer et al 2017 deb et al 2018 reduced forest cover which has been shown to alter precipitation patterns ellison et al 2012 van der ent et al 2010 resulting in reductions in leaf gas exchanges seddon et al 2016 clark et al 2003 staal et al 2018 wu et al 2019 along these regions is a potential explanation to the observed reductions in water yields placed in a large scale context a great portion of tropical forests rainfall is water recycled within these basins by forest evapotranspiration van der ent et al 2010 lenton et al 2008 for instance approximately one third of rainfall in the amazon staal et al 2018 van der ent et al 2010 lenton et al 2008 congo van der ent et al 2010 dyer et al 2017 and northern indonesia and papua new guinea basins is regional recycled precipitation van der ent et al 2010 hence a reduction in tropical forest cover leads to decreases in forest evapotranspiration which in turn results in reduced precipitation consequently reduced regional recycled precipitation at large scales implies a tendency toward decreasing water yields this highlights the hydrologic sensitivity of tropical regions to forest cover changes continuing deforestation and human land use and disturbances at continental scale currently highest in this terrestrial biome crowther et al 2015 have the potential to amplify the negative impact seen on water yields davidson et al 2012 in contrast regions south of indonesia and papua new guinea where ocean moisture is the main precipitation source shows some of the areas where forest cover loss is accompanied by increasing water yield trends van der ent et al 2010 in addition there is evidence that regional recycling ratios are amplified at mountainous regions globally since these areas are able to block moisture from entering continents or easily capture moisture from the atmosphere van der ent et al 2010 accelerating vegetation changes involving biodiversity loss and reduction of tropical alpine areas buytaert et al 2011 is therefore a plausible cause for decreased water yields along these regions for the second region at high latitudes in the past three decades temperatures have increased rapidly mainly in the northern hemisphere hartmann et al 2013 as a consequence rapid rates of snow melt have been observed in arctic tundra and boreal forests in response to warming temperatures lópez moreno et al 2020 najafi et al 2015 pepin et al 2015 myers smith et al 2015 lamprecht et al 2018 these regions are warming more rapidly than lower latitudes due to polar amplification of temperature water vapour and surface albedo feedbacks myers smith et al 2015 chapin 2005 hinzman et al 2013 there is also evidence that this effect is enhanced at high elevation regions where snow accumulation is greatest and changes in precipitation patterns are occurring e g regions in the tibetan plateau rocky mountains greater alpine region pepin et al 2015 ohmura 2012 zhang et al 2013 yan et al 2016 palazzi et al 2019 for example recent findings have shown increases in lake levels and volumes in the tibetan plateau related to temperature amplification resulting in enhanced precipitation from a faster warming rate compared to the mean global warming zhang et al 2020 also high latitude and mountainous regions of siberian and canadian arctic and boreal zones have seen increasing water yield trends due to ice sheet loss increasing precipitation thawing and shrub growth in steep slopes rodell et al 2018 myers smith et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 these lines of evidence are consistent with our findings of high hsi areas leaning toward higher water yields in these regions and particularly those along the siberian and easternmost canadian and euroasian arctic 5 concluding remarks we identified regions with hydrologic sensitivity to climate variability globally and at high spatial and temporal resolution within high and low latitudes at high latitudes boreal and arctic zones show heightened hydrologic sensitivity accompanied by increasing water yields while at low latitudes tropical rainforests show the largest hydrologic sensitivity with the majority of their sensitive area leaning towards decreasing water yields we found that hydrologic sensitivity is amplified at high elevations and steep sloped terrain outlining the importance of topography in modulating these effects with strong implications for high water yielding headwater catchments we direct the attention towards climate warming resulting in increasing snow melt and precipitation in arctic tundra and boreal forests and increasing tree cover loss in tropical forests as possible mechanisms driving the observed patterns although there is no clear consensus yet on the direction surface water yields would take in tropical zones as a result of climate variability our findings suggest that hydrologic sensitivity may be linked to vegetation changes other land cover changes associated with altered climatic patterns across high latitude regions may be contributing to changing hydrologic dynamics myers smith et al 2015 in areas displayed in our hsi analysis as highly sensitive locations globally boreal and tropical forests the two biomes producing the greatest water yields also display the greatest extent of hydrologic sensitive land this makes them hotspots for hydrologic surveillance to expected impacts from further increases in climatic shifts with the potential to significantly alter the global water cycle future work should determine if the hydrologic sensitivity patterns found in this study represent tipping points in changing hydrologic dynamics within each

4154,evapotranspiration et plays a vital role in the water cycle and energy cycle and serves as an important linkage between ecological and hydrological processes accurate estimation of et based on data driven methods is of great theoretical and practical significance for exploring soilevaporation plant transpiration and the regional hydrological balance most existing estimation approaches were proposed based on multiple meteorological variables this study proposed a novel hybrid estimation approach to estimate the monthly et using only historical et time series in the southeastern margins of the tengger desert china the approach consisted of three sections including data preprocessing parameter optimization and estimation the model evaluation demonstrated that the hybrid model based on the variational mode decomposition vmd method grey wolf optimizer gwo algorithm and support vector machine svm model achieved superior computational performance compared to the performance of other methods the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce increased from 0 8588 to 0 8754 and the mean absolute percentage error mape decreased from 28 42 to 23 22 in the testing stage thus we suggest

discrete wavelet transform dwt gocić et al 2015 pammar and deka 2017 or ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd rezaie balf et al 2019 to estimate et using only historical et time series were proposed gocić et al 2015 pammar and deka 2017 rezaie balf et al 2019 nevertheless wavelet technology has the disadvantage of sensitivity to the selection of thresholds and eemd suffers from an intrinsic drawback of endpoint effects dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 zuo et al 2020 variational mode decomposition vmd is a more robust and self adaptive data preprocessing method than dwt and eemd and thus vmd is widely used to extract effective features from nonlinear and nonstationary timeseries dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 zuo et al 2020 however few studies use vmd to extract the main variation features from the observed et time series for more precise estimation due to the highly nonlinear physical process and intrinsic complexity of et combining multiple methods to establish a hybrid estimation model without adequate meteorological data remains highly desirable feng et al 2016 wu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 in this paper we proposed a series of hybrid models based on data preprocessing techniques including the dwt eemd and vmd the grey wolf optimizer gwo algorithm mirjalili et al 2014 and the svm to estimate et using the existing observed et from january 1991 to december 2018 in the southeastern margins of the tengger desert china first the dwt eemd and vmd were employed to extract the basic characteristics from nonstationary et time series separately in order to counterbalance the weakness of directly estimating et which may lead to large errors the best data preprocessing technique was chosen according to the signal to noise ratio snr and root mean

this proposed model is able to simultaneously account for parameter optimization and data preprocessing achieve better computing performance than the other proposed hybrid and single svm models and can be applied to estimate et without adequate meteorological parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 1 study area and data collection the study site is located in the shapotou region of the southeastern margins of the tengger desert 37 32 n 105 02 e ningxia hui autonomous region china the average annual precipitation was 180 57 mm and the annual evaporation was 2520 4 mm soil evaporation is the main way of water loss while precipitation is the main source of soil water recharge in the southeastern margins of the tengger desert where the underground water level exceeds 60 m deep the location of the study area is illustrated in fig 1 the monthly et data were collected from the meteorological monitoring data from 1991 to 2018 by shapotou desert research and experiment station chinese academy of sciences statistical descriptions of collected et data at different time scales from 1991 to 2018 are shown in fig 2 using k means clustering the ets in 1992 2003 andfrom 2013 to 2018 were grouped into one category and the other ets were grouped into another category fig 2a furthermore the annual et time series had a significantly decreasing trend and highly nonlinear characteristics fig 2b and the et from april to august differed from that during other months fig 2c april august is just in the growing season from april to september fig 2d in addition the principles of k means clustering and linear trend analysis are mentioned in the appendix 2 2 theoretical model and calculation method in this study data preprocessing techniques including the dwt eemd and vmd were used to eliminate chaotic noise and extract effective features for collected et data the principles of the dwt eemd and vmd are mentioned in the appendix and the flowcharts of the dwt eemd and vmd are shown in fig 3 a in the data preprocessing the single et time series was decomposed into multiple additive signals and a few signals were chosen from these to obtain the best data preprocessing performance the snr and rmse were chosen as the criteria to determine the optimalparameters of each data preprocessing technique and evaluate the denoising performance of the dwt eemd and vmd rezaie balf et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 the dwt was used with daubechies wavelet order 4 db4 because db4 has only three wavelet filter coefficients with exact reconstruction possibilities gocić et al 2015 pammar and deka 2017 to obtain the decomposed wavelet coefficients db4 with levels 1 to 7 was tested and the snr and rmse were selected as the benchmarks to determine the optimal decomposition level as for eemd the number of intrinsic mode functions imfs was 8 which was determined by log 2 n where was the least integer function and n was the length of the input data wu and huang 2009 the final standard deviation of error ε ne was controlled with ε ne ε ne where the number of ensemble members ne 500 and the amplitudes of the added white noise ε 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 35 and 0 4 respectively the optimal amplitude of the added white noise and the outputs of eemd were determined according to the maximum snr and the minimum rmse the parameters of vmd are α 0 05 and τ 0 where α is the balancing parameter of the data fidelity constraint and τ is the time step of the dual ascent dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 the maximum number of modes k max was obtained if the snr and rmse stopped changing zuo et al 2020 the reasonable pre estimation of k was k max 1 and the kth imf wasdiscarded as chaotic noise the new time series generated by the dwt eemd and vmd were fed to the machine learning model to estimate the et the svm is a widely used machine learning model that can efficiently adapt to the nonlinear characteristics of et change compared to statistical models and artificial neural networks feng et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017 fan et al 2018 the main description of the svm is provided in the appendix and the longitudinal data selection method was adopted to determine the data structure of the integrated method zhao et al 2019 fu et al 2020 dong et al 2021 a schematicofthe longitudinal data selection method with input dimension d 3 is shown in fig 3b the optimal input dimension of each proposed model was determined by trial and error the dataset from january 1991 to december 2010 which had a total of 240 records or 72 of the entire dataset was used as the training set and the dataset from january 2011 to december 2018 which had a total of 96 records or 28 of the entire dataset was used as the testing set the ratio between the training and testing sets was approximately 7 2 the output dimensions of all the proposed estimation models were 1 namely 1 month ahead estimation was performed the output vector consisting of the 241st through 336th elements of each proposed model was regarded as the estimation result fig 3b before training the network the input and output data were normalized using the min max normalization method which is defined as x i x i x i min x i max x i min i 1 2 n where x i x i x i min and x i max are the normalized value observed value minimum value and maximum value respectively it is well known that the svm is characterized by employing the kernel trick to convert the lower dimensional input data to a higher dimensional feature space implicitly and perform a linear regression in this feature space vapnik 1998 pammar and deka 2017 rezaie balf et al 2019 in the simulation processes the radial basis function rbf was chosen as the kernelfunction of the svm pammar and deka 2017 and the gwo algorithm was adopted to optimize the penaltycoefficient and the radius of the kernelfunction descriptions of the gwo algorithm are provided in the appendix and the flowchart of the gwo svm is shown in fig 3c the svm hybridized with the gwo algorithm is denoted as gwo svm and vmd combined with the gwo svm is denoted as the vmd gwo svm the construction processes of the other hybrid eemd gwo svm dwt gwo svm vmd svm eemd svm dwt svm and gwo svm models are similar tothat of the vmd gwo svm the matlab software r2019a math works usa was utilized to conduct all computing processes the flowchart of the proposed models is shown in fig 3 and the main steps of the proposed models are as follows step 1 data preprocessing techniques including the dwt eemd and vmd were used to decompose the monthly et time series step 2 the snr and rmse were used to determine the optimal parameters of the dwt eemd and vmd and the best data preprocessing technique was chosen according to the snr and rmse step 3 the collected et time series and the outputs of the dwt eemd and vmd were divided into a training set and a testing set respectively the longitudinal data selection method was used to determine the input dimensions of the svm step 4 the gwo algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the svm step 5 hybrid vmd gwo svm eemd gwo svm dwt gwo svm vmd svm eemd svm dwt svm and gwo svm models and a single svm model were employed to estimate the monthly et step 6 the results of the proposed models were compared based on the evaluation criteria of the nsce pcc mape nmse rmse and mae the best hybrid model was chosen using the evaluation results 2 3 model performance assessment the accuracy of the proposed models was evaluated with multiple evaluation indexes majhi et al 2019 wu et al 2020 dong et al 2021 and the evaluation indexes of the snr nsce pcc mape nmse rmse and mae are defined in table 1 due to the different emphases of the evaluation index the evaluation directions of different evaluation indexes may be inconsistent e g the nsce and pcc are dimensionless metrics with the same evaluation direction implying that the higher the computing accuracy is the closer the evaluation index is to 1 furthermore the mape nmse rmse and mae have the same evaluation direction implying that the smaller their values are the higher the computing accuracy of the proposed model therefore the nsce and pcc can be regarded as positive indicators and the mape nmse rmse and mae can be regarded as negative indicators if the results of the different evaluation indexes with the same evaluation direction are found to be inconsistent with each other the nsce and mape will be selected as the final benchmarks 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preprocessing performance evaluation table 2 shows that the maximum snr and minimum rmse of the dwt were 40 8201 and 2 2127 respectively suggesting that the best level of db4 was 1 as for eemd table 2 indicates that the maximum snr and minimum rmse were 26 3839 and 11 6609 suggesting that the best amplitude of the added white noise is ε 0 1 in vmd the reasonable pre estimation of the number of modes is 5 since the snr and rmse remain unchanged for k 6 the observed and generated et time series of the dwt eemd and vmd with the optimal parameters are illustrated in fig 4 table 2 and fig 4 show that the dwt displayed better denoising performance than eemd from the overall or local point of view nevertheless this did notmean that the denoising performance of eemd was generally inferior to that of the dwt this occurred because the values at the starting and end points of the monthly et time series were not necessarily extreme values and the upper and lower envelopments experienced significant fluctuations at the starting and end points which significantly distorted the decomposition result and led to an endpoint effect compared with the dwt the snr of vmd with k 5 was observed to increase from 40 8201 to 42 6451 and the rmse decreased from 2 2127 to 1 7934 table 2 suggesting that the data preprocessing method of vmd performed better than that of the dwt in summary the denoising performance of vmd was the best among those data preprocessing techniques as the chaotic noise in the observed et time series was unknown the pcc between the denoised et time series and the residuals of each data preprocessing technique was computed to demonstrate the existence of chaotic noise in the collected et time series and the results were 0 1293 0 04 and 0 0202 suggesting that our collected et time series were disturbed by some types of noise eliminating chaotic noise from the observed datasets would be necessary for more credible estimation results 3 2 evaluation of the proposed models the proposed models were used to estimate the monthly et and the parameter set for each model found during training that was then used for testing is shown in table 3 the mape was chosen as the final benchmark among all the evaluation indicators to determine the optimal parameters of each proposed model the optimal input dimensions of the svm dwt svm eemd svm vmd svm and vmd gwo svm were 3 and the optimal input dimensions of the gwo svm dwt gwo svm and eemd gwo svm were 4 which were obtained by comparing the mape of each proposed model with different input dimensions table 3 the penaltycoefficient and the radius of the kernelfunction of the svm dwt svm eemd svm and vmd svm were 1 and 1 d respectively the purpose of choosing the hyperparameters of the svm as the default values was to conveniently compare the effects of data preprocessing and parameter optimization on the estimation performance as for the models integrated with the gwo algorithm the number of search agents was 20 and the range of the penaltycoefficient and the radius of the kernelfunction were 0 01 100 for each fixed input dimension d including d 2 3 4 5 and 6 the optimal hyperparameters of the svm and the estimated results of the hybrid gwo svm dwt gwo svm eemd gwo svm and vmd gwo svm models were chosen according to the minimum mape from 5 replications table 3 shows that the parameters used for model building influenced each other and varying the value of one parameter inevitably resulted in a change in the other parameters the estimation accuracy of the proposed models with different input dimensions had significant differences regardless of whether the hyperparameters of the svm were fixed or optimized for each fixed input dimension the effects of data preprocessing and parameter optimization on the estimation accuracy were significant as shown in table 3 the mapes of the hybrid models simultaneously accounted for parameter optimization and the data preprocessing decreased to varying degrees when compared with the single svm model implying that the estimation accuracy was significantly improved by combining the data preprocessing techniques and gwo algorithms with the svm the results of the proposed models with the optimalparameters are shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that all the proposed models could be employed to estimate the monthly et with high computingaccuracy by using only historical et time series the estimated values were on par with the observed middle range et values which constituted the majority of dataset points the extremely high and low values were overestimated especially in the testing stage in order to illustrate the practicabilityandeffectiveness of the proposed models scatter plots of the computing results and observed values in the training and testing stages are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the estimation performance of any model was better in training than in testing and the scatter diagrams of the observed and estimated monthly et values in the training stage show that the slopes of the fitted lines were all less than 1 except for that of the hybrid dwt gwo svm model fig 6 furthermore the regression coefficients between the observed and estimated values were all less than 1 in the testing stage fig 7 indicating that all the proposed models somewhat overestimated the monthly et overall the hybrid gwo svm dwt gwo svm eemd gwo svm and vmd gwo svm models with the optimal hyperparameters showed better performance than the hybrid dwt svm eemd svm vmd svm and svm models with default hyperparameters figs 6 and 7 the computing accuracies of the proposed models were assessed both in the training and testing stages and the results of evaluation indexes including nsce pcc mape nmse rmse and mae are illustrated in table 4 the average performance indexes of the hybrid gwo svm dwt gwo svm eemd gwo svm and vmd gwo svm models with the optimal input dimensions were obtained via 5 replications because the outputs of the models integrated with gwo were random the results of different evaluation indexes with the same evaluation direction were found to be inconsistent with each other on certain occasions to avoid confusion in the evaluation processes caused by multiple evaluation indexes the nsce and mape were chosen as the main benchmarks table 4 shows that the svm has its own advantages in the monthly et computing procedure however the computing accuracy of the svm should be improved by choosing the best data preprocessing technique as shown in table 4 the computing performance of the hybrid dwt svm and vmd svm models was better than that of the svm suggesting that both the dwt and vmd effectively extracted the basic characteristics from nonstationary et time series and improved the calculation accuracy the estimation performance of the hybrid eemd svm model was not found to be improved because the output of eemd was distorted to some extent due to endpoint effects this indicates that relying on one data preprocessing technique alone did not necessarily counterbalance the weakness of directly estimating et leading to large errors overall the computing performance of the hybrid vmd svm model was better than those of the dwt svm eemd svm and svm because the mape was observed to decrease from 28 42 to 27 46 in the testing stage table 4 shows that the hybrid gwo svm model exhibited higher estimation accuracy than the hybrid dwt svm eemd svm and vmd svm and single svm models the mape decreased from 28 42 to 24 56 suggesting that the svm hybridized with the gwo algorithm effectively improved the estimation performance the optimization of parameters was cruciallyimportant to obtain more precise estimation results compared with the hybrid gwo svm model the estimation performance of the hybrid eemd gwo svm model was not better than that of the hybrid gwo svm model due to the endpoint effects of eemd although there is a systematic overestimation in each proposed estimation model the estimation performance of the dwt gwo svm and vmd gwo svm were better than that of the gwo svm the positive indicators increased and the negative indicators decreasedto varyingdegrees compared with the hybrid dwt gwo svm model the hybrid vmd gwo svm model exhibited higher computing accuracy than the hybrid dwt gwo svm model the nsce increased from 0 8593 to 0 8754 and the mape decreased from 23 77 to 23 22 in the testing stage suggesting that choosing the best data preprocessing technique and optimal parameters by trial and error were crucially important to obtain the optimal estimation results the best estimation model was obtained only by fully considering the factors that affected the accuracy of the estimation results overall the positive and negative indicators in table 4 showed that the computing performance of the hybrid vmd gwo svm model was the best among the proposed models the nsce was observed to increase from 0 8588 to 0 8754 and the mape was found to decrease from 28 42 to 23 22 in the testing stage thus we suggest that the hybrid vmd gwo svm model will be the best choice for estimating et in the absence of regional meteorological monitoring 4 conclusions this paper presents an application of the svm hybridized with the gwo algorithm and data preprocessing methods including the dwt eemd and vmd for accurately estimating the monthly et using only historical et time series different from the existing et estimation models the proposed estimation model simultaneously conducts parameter optimization and the selection of data preprocessing techniques and requires fewer meteorological parameters for observation numerical simulation results showed that the hybrid vmd gwo svm model exhibited superior computational performance over other methods and thus the method could be highly recommended for estimating et without adequate meteorological parameters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

rmse stopped changing zuo et al 2020 the reasonable pre estimation of k was k max 1 and the kth imf wasdiscarded as chaotic noise the new time series generated by the dwt eemd and vmd were fed to the machine learning model to estimate the et the svm is a widely used machine learning model that can efficiently adapt to the nonlinear characteristics of et change compared to statistical models and artificial neural networks feng et al 2016 mehdizadeh et al 2017 fan et al 2018 the main description of the svm is provided in the appendix and the longitudinal data selection method was adopted to determine the data structure of the integrated method zhao et al 2019 fu et al 2020 dong et al 2021 a schematicofthe longitudinal data selection method with input dimension d 3 is shown in fig 3b the optimal input dimension of each proposed model was determined by trial and error the dataset from january 1991 to december 2010 which had a total of 240 records or 72 of the entire dataset was used as the training set and the dataset from january 2011 to december 2018 which had a total of 96 records or 28 of the entire dataset was used as the testing set the ratio between the training and testing sets was approximately 7 2 the output dimensions of all the proposed estimation models were 1 namely 1 month ahead estimation was performed the output vector consisting of the 241st through 336th elements of each proposed model was regarded as the estimation result fig 3b before training the network the input and output data were normalized using the min max normalization method which is defined as x i x i x i min x i max x i min i 1 2 n where x i x i x i min and x i max are the normalized value observed value minimum value and maximum value respectively it is well known that the svm is characterized by employing the kernel trick to convert the lower dimensional input data to a higher dimensional feature space implicitly and perform a linear regression in this feature space vapnik 1998 pammar and deka 2017 rezaie balf et al 2019 in the simulation processes the radial basis function rbf was chosen as the kernelfunction of the svm pammar and deka 2017 and the gwo algorithm was adopted to optimize the penaltycoefficient and the radius of the kernelfunction descriptions of the gwo algorithm are provided in the appendix and the flowchart of the gwo svm is shown in fig 3c the svm hybridized with the gwo algorithm is denoted as gwo svm and vmd combined with the gwo svm is denoted as the vmd gwo svm the construction processes of the other hybrid eemd gwo svm dwt gwo svm vmd svm eemd svm dwt svm and gwo svm models are similar tothat of the vmd gwo svm the matlab software r2019a math works usa was utilized to conduct all computing processes the flowchart of the proposed models is shown in fig 3 and the main steps of the proposed models are as follows step 1 data preprocessing techniques including the dwt eemd and vmd were used to decompose the monthly et time series step 2 the snr and rmse were used to determine the optimal parameters of the dwt eemd and vmd and the best data preprocessing technique was chosen according to the snr and rmse step 3 the collected et time series and the outputs of the dwt eemd and vmd were divided into a training set and a testing set respectively the longitudinal data selection method was used to determine the input dimensions of the svm step 4 the gwo algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the svm step 5 hybrid vmd gwo svm eemd gwo svm dwt gwo svm vmd svm eemd svm dwt svm and gwo svm models and a single svm model were employed to estimate the monthly et step 6 the results of the proposed models were compared based on the evaluation criteria of the nsce pcc mape nmse rmse and mae the best hybrid model was chosen using the evaluation results 2 3 model performance assessment the accuracy of the proposed models was evaluated with multiple evaluation indexes majhi et al 2019 wu et al 2020 dong et al 2021 and the evaluation indexes of the snr nsce pcc mape nmse rmse and mae are defined in table 1 due to the different emphases of the evaluation index the evaluation directions of different evaluation indexes may be inconsistent e g the nsce and pcc are dimensionless metrics with the same evaluation direction implying that the higher the computing accuracy is the closer the evaluation index is to 1 furthermore the mape nmse rmse and mae have the same evaluation direction implying that the smaller their values are the higher the computing accuracy of the proposed model therefore the nsce and pcc can be regarded as positive indicators and the mape nmse rmse and mae can be regarded as negative indicators if the results of the different evaluation indexes with the same evaluation direction are found to be inconsistent with each other the nsce and mape will be selected as the final benchmarks 3 results and discussion 3 1 data preprocessing performance evaluation table 2 shows that the maximum snr and minimum rmse of the dwt were 40 8201 and 2 2127 respectively suggesting that the best level of db4 was 1 as for eemd table 2 indicates that the maximum snr and minimum rmse were 26 3839 and 11 6609 suggesting that the best amplitude of the added white noise is ε 0 1 in vmd the reasonable pre estimation of the number of modes is 5 since the snr and rmse remain unchanged for k 6 the observed and generated et time series of the dwt eemd and vmd with the optimal parameters are illustrated in fig 4 table 2 and fig 4 show that the dwt displayed better denoising performance than eemd from the overall or local point of view nevertheless this did notmean that the denoising performance of eemd was generally inferior to that of the dwt this occurred because the values at the starting and end points of the monthly et time series were not necessarily extreme values and the upper and lower envelopments experienced significant fluctuations at the starting and end points which significantly distorted the decomposition result and led to an endpoint effect compared with the dwt the snr of vmd with k 5 was observed to increase from 40 8201 to 42 6451 and the rmse decreased from 2 2127 to 1 7934 table 2 suggesting that the data preprocessing method of vmd performed better than that of the dwt in summary the denoising performance of vmd was the best among those data preprocessing techniques as the chaotic noise in the observed et time series was unknown the pcc between the denoised et time series and the residuals of each data preprocessing technique was computed to demonstrate the existence of chaotic noise in the collected et time series and the results were 0 1293 0 04 and 0 0202 suggesting that our collected et time series were disturbed by some types of noise eliminating chaotic noise from the observed datasets would be necessary for more credible estimation results 3 2 evaluation of the proposed models the proposed models were used to estimate the monthly et and the parameter set for each model found during training that was then used for testing is shown in table 3 the mape was chosen as the final benchmark among all the evaluation indicators to determine the optimal parameters of each proposed model the optimal input dimensions of the svm dwt svm eemd svm vmd svm and vmd gwo svm were 3 and the optimal input dimensions of the gwo svm dwt gwo svm and eemd gwo svm were 4 which were obtained by comparing the mape of each proposed model with different input dimensions table 3 the penaltycoefficient and the radius of the kernelfunction of the svm dwt svm eemd svm and vmd svm were 1 and 1 d respectively the purpose of choosing the hyperparameters of the svm as the default values was to conveniently compare the effects of data preprocessing and parameter optimization on the estimation performance as for the models integrated with the gwo algorithm the number of search agents was 20 and the range of the penaltycoefficient and the radius of the kernelfunction were 0 01 100 for each fixed input dimension d including d 2 3 4 5 and 6 the optimal hyperparameters of the svm and the estimated results of the hybrid gwo svm dwt gwo svm eemd gwo svm and vmd gwo svm models were chosen according to the minimum mape from 5 replications table 3 shows that the parameters used for model building influenced each other and varying the value of one parameter inevitably resulted in a change in the other parameters the estimation accuracy of the proposed models with different input dimensions had significant differences regardless of whether the hyperparameters of the svm were fixed or optimized for each fixed input dimension the effects of data preprocessing and parameter optimization on the estimation accuracy were significant as shown in table 3 the mapes of the hybrid models simultaneously accounted for parameter optimization and the data preprocessing decreased to varying degrees when compared with the single svm model implying that the estimation accuracy was significantly improved by combining the data preprocessing techniques and gwo algorithms with the svm the results of the proposed models with the optimalparameters are shown in fig 5 fig 5 shows that all the proposed models could be employed to estimate the monthly et with high computingaccuracy by using only historical et time series the estimated values were on par with the observed middle range et values which constituted the majority of dataset points the extremely high and low values were overestimated especially in the testing stage in order to illustrate the practicabilityandeffectiveness of the proposed models scatter plots of the computing results and observed values in the training and testing stages are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the estimation performance of any model was better in training than in testing and the scatter diagrams of the observed and estimated monthly et values in the training stage show that the slopes of the fitted lines were all less than 1 except for that of the hybrid dwt gwo svm model fig 6 furthermore the regression coefficients between the observed and estimated values were all less than 1 in the testing stage fig 7 indicating that all the proposed models somewhat overestimated the monthly et overall the hybrid gwo svm dwt gwo svm eemd gwo svm and vmd gwo svm models with the optimal hyperparameters showed better performance than the hybrid dwt svm eemd svm vmd svm and svm models with default hyperparameters figs 6 and 7 the computing accuracies of the proposed models were assessed both in the training and testing stages and the results of evaluation indexes including nsce pcc mape nmse rmse and mae are illustrated in table 4 the average performance indexes of the hybrid gwo svm dwt gwo svm eemd gwo svm and vmd gwo svm models with the optimal input dimensions were obtained via 5 replications because the outputs of the models integrated with gwo were random the results of different evaluation indexes with the same evaluation direction were found to be inconsistent with each other on certain occasions to avoid confusion in the evaluation processes caused by multiple evaluation indexes the nsce and mape were chosen as the main benchmarks table 4 shows that the svm has its own advantages in the monthly et computing procedure however the computing accuracy of the svm should be improved by choosing the best data preprocessing technique as shown in table 4 the computing performance of the hybrid dwt svm and vmd svm models was better than that of the svm suggesting that both the dwt and vmd effectively extracted the basic characteristics from nonstationary et time series and improved the calculation accuracy the estimation performance of the hybrid eemd svm model was not found to be improved because the output of eemd was distorted to some extent due to endpoint effects this indicates that relying on one data preprocessing technique alone did not necessarily counterbalance the weakness of directly estimating et leading to large errors overall the computing performance of the hybrid vmd svm model was better than those of the dwt svm eemd svm and svm because the mape was observed to decrease from 28 42 to 27 46 in the testing stage table 4 shows that the hybrid gwo svm model exhibited higher estimation accuracy than the hybrid dwt svm eemd svm and vmd svm and single svm models the mape decreased from 28 42 to 24 56 suggesting that the svm hybridized with the gwo algorithm effectively improved the estimation performance the optimization of parameters was cruciallyimportant to obtain more precise estimation results compared with the hybrid gwo svm model the estimation performance of the hybrid eemd gwo svm model was not better than that of the hybrid gwo svm model due to the endpoint effects of eemd although there is a systematic overestimation in each proposed estimation model the estimation performance of the dwt gwo svm and vmd gwo svm were better than that of the gwo svm the positive indicators increased and the negative indicators decreasedto varyingdegrees compared with the hybrid dwt gwo svm model the hybrid vmd gwo svm model exhibited higher computing accuracy than the hybrid dwt gwo svm model the nsce increased from 0 8593 to 0 8754 and the mape decreased from 23 77 to 23 22 in the testing stage suggesting that choosing the best data preprocessing technique and optimal parameters by trial and error were crucially important to obtain the optimal estimation results the best estimation model was obtained only by fully considering the factors that affected the accuracy of the estimation results overall the positive and negative indicators in table 4 showed that the computing performance of the hybrid vmd gwo svm model was the best among the proposed models the nsce was observed to increase from 0 8588 to 0 8754 and the mape was found to decrease from 28 42 to 23 22 in the testing stage thus we suggest that the hybrid vmd gwo svm model will be the best choice for estimating et in the absence of regional meteorological monitoring 4 conclusions this paper presents an application of the svm hybridized with the gwo algorithm and data preprocessing methods including the dwt eemd and vmd for accurately estimating the monthly et using only historical et time series different from the existing et estimation models the proposed estimation model simultaneously conducts parameter optimization and the selection of data preprocessing techniques and requires fewer meteorological parameters for observation numerical simulation results showed that the hybrid vmd gwo svm model exhibited superior computational performance over other methods and thus the method could be highly recommended for estimating et without adequate meteorological parameters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
