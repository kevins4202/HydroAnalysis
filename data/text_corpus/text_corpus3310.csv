standard curves with corresponding r 2 0 99 and 100 10 efficiencies were considered reliable for use in subsequent quantitative analyses data analysis all statistical analyses were performed in the r program v4 0 http www r project org using various packages the detailed analytical procedure is described in the supplemental information results environmental gradients along the water column the water of the amd lake exhibited strong vertical variations in physicochemical properties fig 1 and table s1 apart from t and doc almost all physicochemical properties were significantly influenced by depth in particular the surface layer at 0 5 m significantly differed from the other depths i e 5 10 and 15 m in physicochemical conditions table s2 overall the ph values nutrient contents tc tn and tp and ion concentrations ec so 4 2 tfe fe ⅱ mg al and mn in the upper layer of the amd lake were relatively lower but oxidizing potentials do and orp were higher fig 1 these results suggeste that the amd lake had hydrochemical stratification with severe environmental gradients along the water column prokaryotic microbial diversity and structure along the depth profile a total of 120 654 reads were obtained after quality control and rarefication and these were clustered into 1085 otus at a 97 similarity level the species accumulation curve approaching an asymptote suggested that the sequencing effort recovered most of the local species diversity which was confirmed by the coverage values 0 99 fig s2a and table s3 the rank abundance curves became smoother and wider with the increasing depth which confirmed that species richness and evenness were higher at greater depths fig s2b and table s3 moreover phylogenetic diversity also increased with depth whereas prokaryotic abundance as measured by qpcr increased initially and then decreased fig 2 a to explore the overall variability in community composition we performed principal coordinate analysis which revealed that depth explained 85 of the variance fig 2b in accordance with their low heterogeneity in environmental conditions 5 and 10 m were similar in microbial community structure table s2 nevertheless communities in the amd lake generally clustered by depth implying a microbial stratification coupled with hydrochemical variations fig s3 the relative abundances of microbial taxa were investigated at the phylum level fig 2c samples from 0 5 m were dominated by proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria at intermediate depths 5 and 10 m firmicutes and euryarchaeota were most abundant but taxonomic composition at the phylum level showed great similarity at 15 m near the sediments proteobacteria increased in relative abundance again and firmicutes decreased linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse scores were computed for taxa differentially abundant across depths fig 2d the results showed that bacterial lineages that were mainly enriched at 0 5 m included members from alphaproteobacteria and actinobacteria such as acidiphilium and ferrithrix alicyclobacillus and acidibacillus from firmicutes as well as members from euryarchaeota were enriched at 5 and 10 m while acidobacteria and its subgroups were more representative at 15 m the predicted functional profiles were further assessed using faprotax fig s4 a total of 20 functional groups were obtained to annotate microbial community functions which were divided into five major categories energy source carbon cycle nitrogen cycle sulfur cycle and other predicted functions the results showed that the community at 0 5 m had a high percentage of populations otus with a chemoheterotrophy function as well as aerobic chemoheterotrophy functions related to the carbon cycle were also more abundant in surface water than in deep layers in general the amd lake exhibited vertical functional differences based on faprotax assembly processes and species coexistence of prokaryotic microbial community across depths to explore the mechanisms underpinning the observed distribution patterns a null model based framework was employed to quantify various community assembly processes fig 3 a the significantly positive relationship between nti and depth indicated that the extent of phylogenetic clustering increased with depth there was also a strong relationship between βnti and depth difference implying that the determinacy of microbial assembly increased with the depth difference between communities null model analysis further revealed the community assembly process across the water column heterogeneous selection was the primary driver of community assembly at 0 5 m whereas at greater depths stochastic processes i e undominated became more important in addition significantly higher values for mean habitat niche breadth bcom were observed at deeper layers microbial co occurrence networks were established to estimate species coexistence at different depths fig 3c although there were fewer microbial nodes at 0 5 m they exhibited more interconnections than those at deeper layers as confirmed by the node level and network level topological features fig 3b and s5 table s4 furthermore network properties used to predict microbial network stability i e modularity and negative positive cohesion were reduced with depth table s4 the potential topological roles of taxa in the networks were also assessed according to their within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi values although the majority of nodes in each network were peripherals with most of their links inside their modules the proportion and number of keystone module members i e network and module hubs and connectors increased with depth and were generally affiliated with proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria fig 3d and s6 environmental drivers of prokaryotic microbial vertical variation in the amd lake to explore the intrinsic factors driving variation in the amd community along the water column the main environmental predictors for species richness phylogenetic diversity and functional difference were identified by random forest rf analysis respectively fig 4 a the ph was found to be the relatively important variable for predicting all three indices throughout the vertical profiles and do was also important for predicting species richness and phylogenetic diversity in addition βnti was significantly correlated with the ph differences so was the negative positive cohesion that predicted predict stability in co occurrence networks fig 4b furthermore vertical variations of the community assembly process and coexistence in the amd lake were summarized and were correlated with the ph gradient along the depth profile fig 4c although the correlation coefficients of some metrics were not high the trends along the water column could be generally identified discussion although distinct populations at geographically separated amd habitats have been well documented local heterogeneity is still poorly understood méndez garcía et al 2014 in this study we investigated the vertical distribution of prokaryotic microorganisms in a stratified amd lake and examined community assembly and species coexistence along the geochemical gradient the results demonstrated high heterogeneity of prokaryotic microbial community in the water column accompanied by the significant variations in community assembly and species coexistence along environmental gradients by correlating microbial diversity patterns with geochemistry this study illustrates how extremophiles faced with environmental gradients construct communities and coexist in extremely acidic habitats variations of prokaryotic microbial diversity and structure are coupled with hydrochemical changes in the water column stratified water columns widely exist in the hydrosphere and are more common and obvious in amd lakes due to their unique geometry and hydrology castendyk et al 2015 the amd lake in this study also exhibited vertically stratified physicochemical properties fig 1 specifically the surface water at 0 5 m exhibited lower ph values nutrient contents and ion concentrations but higher oxidation potential suggesting more extreme and distinctive hydrochemistry at the surface than at greater depths 5 10 and 15 m table s2 this finding is consistent with the vertical hydrochemical variations of the reported meromictic amd lakes españa et al 2009 santofimia et al 2013 a potential explanation is that when amd which is rich in ferrous and ferric iron reaches the surface it fully oxidizes and hydrolyzes resulting in the precipitation of secondary iron minerals such as schwertmannite that were found in our previous study she et al 2021 the hydrolysis and precipitation of secondary iron minerals will produce a large amount of acid dold 2014 in addition amd generated by oxidative dissolution of waste ore accumulated around the lake could also be collected into the lake through surface runoff thus resulting in more acidic surface water xin et al 2021 amd systems typically have tight coupling between biological and geochemical processes huang et al 2016 in the present study physicochemical and microbial variations were significantly correlated in the amd lake fig s3 consistent with observations in other amd lakes falagán et al 2014 santofimia et al 2013 taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities were reduced in the surface water which contained highly dominant species fig 2a most of the sequences detected at 0 5 m were affiliated with the genus acidiphilium fig 2c an obligately heterotrophic acidophile with fe iii reducing ability harrison jr 1981 li et al 2020 this genus was previously reported to predominate in shallow amd impacted waters or the upper layers of amd lakes and to contribute to the rich ferrous ions therein ayala muñoz et al 2020 lear et al 2009 lukhele et al 2019 acidiphilium typically has tenacious associations with chemoautotrophic iron oxidizers such as ferrovum and promotes their growth through syntrophic interactions liu et al 2011 which were also enriched in the upper layer of this amd lake fig 2d different from other reported amd lakes abundant firmicutes were found in the intermediate layers in the present study including members from the classes clostridia and bacilli falagán et al 2014 santofimia et al 2013 these acidophilic acid tolerant sulfate reducing bacteria typically thrive in amd impacted environments with relatively abundant organic matter and actively participate in sulfate and iron reduction processes bao et al 2021 gupta et al 2018 dynamic sulfate reduction processes in the chemocline of amd lakes have been reported falagán et al 2014 wendt potthoff et al 2012 and were confirmed by the abundant s cycling functions predicted in this study fig s4 taken together local prokaryotic microbial communities exhibited significant variations in diversity structure and function in the heterogeneous water column such local heterogeneity was largely ignored in previous large scale sampling but it is necessary to deeply understand the amd biogeochemical cycle in addition the amd lake also showed some characteristics different from the reported shallow amd waters for example the heterotrophic acidophiles occupying the amd lake that differed from the chemolithotrophy based populations in shallow amd waters kay et al 2013 méndez garcía et al 2014 a possible explanation is that in general shallow amd waters are newly generated from the acidification of waste ore whereas amd lakes typically form relatively stable autochthonous taxa and metallic networks after long term succession zhang et al 2021 prokaryotic microorganisms exhibit distinctive community assembly process and species coexistence patterns across vertical environmental gradients we further examined the community assembly processes driving microbial community diversity and distribution patterns similar to other amd habitats the dramatically low microbial diversities in the amd lake especially in the surface water indicated strong habitat filtration this result was supported by the positive nti values at all depths fig 3a suggesting that these nonrandom populations were more phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance under environmental selection pressures horner devine and bohannan 2006 pontarp et al 2012 moreover communities with greater differences in depth had more significant phylogenetic variations reflecting significant deterministic community assembly processes between communities at different depths according to the null model framework described by stegen et al 2013 heterogeneous selection gained significance in the surface water while random processes became more pronounced at deeper layers indicating weakened environmental selection with depth it is reasonable that heterogeneous selection process was dominant in the surface water because only species that can adapt to the low ph and oligotrophic condition can survive belnap et al 2011 chen et al 2015 however with the weakening of acidity at greater depths the dominant species in the upper layer could lose their growth advantage microorganisms especially the less abundant microbial populations that could have distinctively physiological respond to the reduction in acid stress and increase in nutrients would have more nutrients and energy for growth without having to resist stronger acid stress malik et al 2020 such growth could enhance stochastic processes of birth death colonization extinction and random changes in relative population abundance zhou et al 2014 this could lead to a significant increase in the evenness and diversity of the microbial communities at deeper depths different from the typical species dominance in the surface water fig 2 moreover the deeper layers with relatively high ph and nutrients could weaken niche selection as shown by wider niche breadth at greater depth which suggests a more metabolically flexible community fig 3a jiao et al 2020 wu et al 2018 consequently although still in an extreme habitat local environmental heterogeneity can also cause distinctive community assembly processes and ultimately result in variations in microbial diversity and structure although there was stronger environmental selection from acid stress phylogenetic clustering strength as suggested by nti was reduced in the surface water this result was contrary to previous studies that reported that greater environmental selection promoted stronger phylogenetic clustering he et al 2021 jiao et al 2021 however a recent study in extreme high salinity deserts also found that the microbial community was less phylogenetically clustered in more saline soils zhang et al 2019 a possible explanation is that surface water in the amd lake had relatively greater acid stress and lower nutrient availability which may have led to the competitive exclusion of some closely related taxa thus disrupting phylogenetic conservatism whereas distant taxa may coexist due to functional complementation kuang et 2017 ning et al 2020 microbial co occurrence patterns further provide us with an overall better mechanistic understanding of the maintenance of species diversity across environmental gradients microbial otus at 0 5 m exhibited closer interconnections than those at greater depths as confirmed by the node level and network level topological features fig 3b c and table s4 this finding indicates that species co occur more frequently in the more extreme surface water this finding is consistent with the microbial response to sharp amd pollution gradients xu et al 2020 however such high connectivity can also cause the microbial network to be difficult to divide into more modules that reflect shared ecological functions guidi et al 2016 spatial heterogeneity cram et al 2015 or similar habitat preferences faust et al 2012 in the amd lake network modularity decreased with depth indicating that the microbial community in the surface water may be more unstable because high modularity limits the impact of species loss on the whole community and vice versa hernandez et al 2021 moreover a greater number of positive links existed in the microbial network of surface water representing high niche overlap and or positive interactions between taxa this is in line with the gradient stress hypothesis because species can cooperate in detoxification or cross feeding such as syntrophic interactions between acidiphilium and ferrovum in the surface water hammarlund and harcombe 2019 piccardi et al 2019 however such positive interactions can destabilize microbial communities due to the potential for mutual downfall among the taxa reliant on the feedback loop coyte et al 2015 stone 2020 in addition with increasing depth keystone taxa increased which has been shown to promote the assembly and stability of microbial communities banerjee et al 2018 xun et al 2021 the ph is the key environmental driver for microbial diversity and community assembly in amd lake early studies based on large scale ecological investigations revealed that contemporary environmental variation determines the distinct populations at geographically separated amds kuang et al 2013 the ph temperature concentrations of dissolved metals and other solutes organic carbon and dissolved oxygen were identified as the primary environmental factors that shape microbial community structure méndez garcía et al 2015 in the present study ph was also identified as one of the most important variables for predicting species richness phylogenetic diversity and functional differences along a depth profile fig 4a our results indicated that subtle but significant changes in acid stress promoted local microbial community succession in the extremely acidic environment meanwhile do appeared to influence phylogenetic diversity and the composition of communities microorganisms with different adaptations and demands for oxygen may be strictly distributed with depth méndez garcía et al 2014 we propose a conceptual paradigm fig 4c to describe prokaryotic microbial diversity and community assembly across vertical environmental gradients in the amd lake in surface water high acidity has strong selective pressure on the microbial community and results in reduced diversity and dominant species meanwhile in this stressful environment microbial taxa show frequent and positive connections which yet could destabilize the community in contrary along the hydrochemical gradient as the ph increases with depth the environmental pressure on microorganisms lessens correspondingly deterministic environmental selection on microbial community decreases with depth as the environment becomes more benign the less abundant but metabolically flexible microbial taxa have more nutrients and energy for growth rather than acid stress tolerance such growth could enhance stochastic ecological processes and increase microbial diversity and evenness at deeper depths these results provide us with an overall better mechanistic understanding of the maintenance and generation of species diversity across environmental gradients in amd lake considering microbial key role in amd biogeochemical cycle it is crucial to uncover the microbial diversity and community assembly in amd lake for understanding extreme ecological succession and conducting effective pollution control conclusions this study reveals distinct heterogeneity of the local prokaryotic microbial community in an amd lake with strong vertical biogeochemical variations and illustrates the underlying community assembly mechanisms across stress gradients providing potential insight into understanding how microbial diversity is generated and maintained across stress gradients in extreme environments hydrochemical and microbial variations were tightly coupled in the amd lake along vertical environmental gradients including ph and do microbial community diversity and structure varied significantly taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity increased with depth proteobacteria dominated the surface water with firmicutes and euryarchaeota increasing at greater depths environmental selection was more prominent in surface water and random processes become more significant with depth in the upper layers microbial co occurrences especially positive interactions were more frequent and network modularity decreased implying reduced community stability with depth the ph was identified as the key driver for the vertical distribution pattern of microbial communities in the amd lake the stronger acid stresses drove more prominent environmental selection in the upper layers resulting in a significant decrease in microbial diversity as well as more frequent species co occurrence and fragile modularity author contribution zhixiang she and xin pan microbial

program v4 0 http www r project org using various packages the detailed analytical procedure is described in the supplemental information results environmental gradients along the water column the water of the amd lake exhibited strong vertical variations in physicochemical properties fig 1 and table s1 apart from t and doc almost all physicochemical properties were significantly influenced by depth in particular the surface layer at 0 5 m significantly differed from the other depths i e 5 10 and 15 m in physicochemical conditions table s2 overall the ph values nutrient contents tc tn and tp and ion concentrations ec so 4 2 tfe fe ⅱ mg al and mn in the upper layer of the amd lake were relatively lower but oxidizing potentials do and orp were higher fig 1 these results suggeste that the amd lake had hydrochemical stratification with severe environmental gradients along the water column prokaryotic microbial diversity and structure along the depth profile a total of 120 654 reads were obtained after quality control and rarefication and these were clustered into 1085 otus at a 97 similarity level the species accumulation curve approaching an asymptote suggested that the sequencing effort recovered most of the local species diversity which was confirmed by the coverage values 0 99 fig s2a and table s3 the rank abundance curves became smoother and wider with the increasing depth which confirmed that species richness and evenness were higher at greater depths fig s2b and table s3 moreover phylogenetic diversity also increased with depth whereas prokaryotic abundance as measured by qpcr increased initially and then decreased fig 2 a to explore the overall variability in community composition we performed principal coordinate analysis which revealed that depth explained 85 of the variance fig 2b in accordance with their low heterogeneity in environmental conditions 5 and 10 m were similar in microbial community structure table s2 nevertheless communities in the amd lake generally clustered by depth implying a microbial stratification coupled with hydrochemical variations fig s3 the relative abundances of microbial taxa were investigated at the phylum level fig 2c samples from 0 5 m were dominated by proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria at intermediate depths 5 and 10 m firmicutes and euryarchaeota were most abundant but taxonomic composition at the phylum level showed great similarity at 15 m near the sediments proteobacteria increased in relative abundance again and firmicutes decreased linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse scores were computed for taxa differentially abundant across depths fig 2d the results showed that bacterial lineages that were mainly enriched at 0 5 m included members from alphaproteobacteria and actinobacteria such as acidiphilium and ferrithrix alicyclobacillus and acidibacillus from firmicutes as well as members from euryarchaeota were enriched at 5 and 10 m while acidobacteria and its subgroups were more representative at 15 m the predicted functional profiles were further assessed using faprotax fig s4 a total of 20 functional groups were obtained to annotate microbial community functions which were divided into five major categories energy source carbon cycle nitrogen cycle sulfur cycle and other predicted functions the results showed that the community at 0 5 m had a high percentage of populations otus with a chemoheterotrophy function as well as aerobic chemoheterotrophy functions related to the carbon cycle were also more abundant in surface water than in deep layers in general the amd lake exhibited vertical functional differences based on faprotax assembly processes and species coexistence of prokaryotic microbial community across depths to explore the mechanisms underpinning the observed distribution patterns a null model based framework was employed to quantify various community assembly processes fig 3 a the significantly positive relationship between nti and depth indicated that the extent of phylogenetic clustering increased with depth there was also a strong relationship between βnti and depth difference implying that the determinacy of microbial assembly increased with the depth difference between communities null model analysis further revealed the community assembly process across the water column heterogeneous selection was the primary driver of community assembly at 0 5 m whereas at greater depths stochastic processes i e undominated became more important in addition significantly higher values for mean habitat niche breadth bcom were observed at deeper layers microbial co occurrence networks were established to estimate species coexistence at different depths fig 3c although there were fewer microbial nodes at 0 5 m they exhibited more interconnections than those at deeper layers as confirmed by the node level and network level topological features fig 3b and s5 table s4 furthermore network properties used to predict microbial network stability i e modularity and negative positive cohesion were reduced with depth table s4 the potential topological roles of taxa in the networks were also assessed according to their within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi values although the majority of nodes in each network were peripherals with most of their links inside their modules the proportion and number of keystone module members i e network and module hubs and connectors increased with depth and were generally affiliated with proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria fig 3d and s6 environmental drivers of prokaryotic microbial vertical variation in the amd lake to explore the intrinsic factors driving variation in the amd community along the water column the main environmental predictors for species richness phylogenetic diversity and functional difference were identified by random forest rf analysis respectively fig 4 a the ph was found to be the relatively important variable for predicting all three indices throughout the vertical profiles and do was also important for predicting species richness and phylogenetic diversity in addition βnti was significantly correlated with the ph differences so was the negative positive cohesion that predicted predict stability in co occurrence networks fig 4b furthermore vertical variations of the community assembly process and coexistence in the amd lake were summarized and were correlated with the ph gradient along the depth profile fig 4c although the correlation coefficients of some metrics were not high the trends along the water column could be generally identified discussion although distinct populations at geographically separated amd habitats have been well documented local heterogeneity is still poorly understood méndez garcía et al 2014 in this study we investigated the vertical distribution of prokaryotic microorganisms in a stratified amd lake and examined community assembly and species coexistence along the geochemical gradient the results demonstrated high heterogeneity of prokaryotic microbial community in the water column accompanied by the significant variations in community assembly and species coexistence along environmental gradients by correlating microbial diversity patterns with geochemistry this study illustrates how extremophiles faced with environmental gradients construct communities and coexist in extremely acidic habitats variations of prokaryotic microbial diversity and structure are coupled with hydrochemical changes in the water column stratified water columns widely exist in the hydrosphere and are more common and obvious in amd lakes due to their unique geometry and hydrology castendyk et al 2015 the amd lake in this study also exhibited vertically stratified physicochemical properties fig 1 specifically the surface water at 0 5 m exhibited lower ph values nutrient contents and ion concentrations but higher oxidation potential suggesting more extreme and distinctive hydrochemistry at the surface than at greater depths 5 10 and 15 m table s2 this finding is consistent with the vertical hydrochemical variations of the reported meromictic amd lakes españa et al 2009 santofimia et al 2013 a potential explanation is that when amd which is rich in ferrous and ferric iron reaches the surface it fully oxidizes and hydrolyzes resulting in the precipitation of secondary iron minerals such as schwertmannite that were found in our previous study she et al 2021 the hydrolysis and precipitation of secondary iron minerals will produce a large amount of acid dold 2014 in addition amd generated by oxidative dissolution of waste ore accumulated around the lake could also be collected into the lake through surface runoff thus resulting in more acidic surface water xin et al 2021 amd systems typically have tight coupling between biological and geochemical processes huang et al 2016 in the present study physicochemical and microbial variations were significantly correlated in the amd lake fig s3 consistent with observations in other amd lakes falagán et al 2014 santofimia et al 2013 taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities were reduced in the surface water which contained highly dominant species fig 2a most of the sequences detected at 0 5 m were affiliated with the genus acidiphilium fig 2c an obligately heterotrophic acidophile with fe iii reducing ability harrison jr 1981 li et al 2020 this genus was previously reported to predominate in shallow amd impacted waters or the upper layers of amd lakes and to contribute to the rich ferrous ions therein ayala muñoz et al 2020 lear et al 2009 lukhele et al 2019 acidiphilium typically has tenacious associations with chemoautotrophic iron oxidizers such as ferrovum and promotes their growth through syntrophic interactions liu et al 2011 which were also enriched in the upper layer of this amd lake fig 2d different from other reported amd lakes abundant firmicutes were found in the intermediate layers in the present study including members from the classes clostridia and bacilli falagán et al 2014 santofimia et al 2013 these acidophilic acid tolerant sulfate reducing bacteria typically thrive in amd impacted environments with relatively abundant organic matter and actively participate in sulfate and iron reduction processes bao et al 2021 gupta et al 2018 dynamic sulfate reduction processes in the chemocline of amd lakes have been reported falagán et al 2014 wendt potthoff et al 2012 and were confirmed by the abundant s cycling functions predicted in this study fig s4 taken together local prokaryotic microbial communities exhibited significant variations in diversity structure and function in the heterogeneous water column such local heterogeneity was largely ignored in previous large scale sampling but it is necessary to deeply understand the amd biogeochemical cycle in addition the amd lake also showed some characteristics different from the reported shallow amd waters for example the heterotrophic acidophiles occupying the amd lake that differed from the chemolithotrophy based populations in shallow amd waters kay et al 2013 méndez garcía et al 2014 a possible explanation is that in general shallow amd waters are newly generated from the acidification of waste ore whereas amd lakes typically form relatively stable autochthonous taxa and metallic networks after long term succession zhang et al 2021 prokaryotic microorganisms exhibit distinctive community assembly process and species coexistence patterns across vertical environmental gradients we further examined the community assembly processes driving microbial community diversity and distribution patterns similar to other amd habitats the dramatically low microbial diversities in the amd lake especially in the surface water indicated strong habitat filtration this result was supported by the positive nti values at all depths fig 3a suggesting that these nonrandom populations were more phylogenetically clustered than expected by chance under environmental selection pressures horner devine and bohannan 2006 pontarp et al 2012 moreover communities with greater differences in depth had more significant phylogenetic variations reflecting significant deterministic community assembly processes between communities at different depths according to the null model framework described by stegen et al 2013 heterogeneous selection gained significance in the surface water while random processes became more pronounced at deeper layers indicating weakened environmental selection with depth it is reasonable that heterogeneous selection process was dominant in the surface water because only species that can adapt to the low ph and oligotrophic condition can survive belnap et al 2011 chen et al 2015 however with the weakening of acidity at greater depths the dominant species in the upper layer could lose their growth advantage microorganisms especially the less abundant microbial populations that could have distinctively physiological respond to the reduction in acid stress and increase in nutrients would have more nutrients and energy for growth without having to resist stronger acid stress malik et al 2020 such growth could enhance stochastic processes of birth death colonization extinction and random changes in relative population abundance zhou et al 2014 this could lead to a significant increase in the evenness and diversity of the microbial communities at deeper depths different from the typical species dominance in the surface water fig 2 moreover the deeper layers with relatively high ph and nutrients could weaken niche selection as shown by wider niche breadth at greater depth which suggests a more metabolically flexible community fig 3a jiao et al 2020 wu et al 2018 consequently although still in an extreme habitat local environmental heterogeneity can also cause distinctive community assembly processes and ultimately result in variations in microbial diversity and structure although there was stronger environmental selection from acid stress phylogenetic clustering strength as suggested by nti was reduced in the surface water this result was contrary to previous studies that reported that greater environmental selection promoted stronger phylogenetic clustering he et al 2021 jiao et al 2021 however a recent study in extreme high salinity deserts also found that the microbial community was less phylogenetically clustered in more saline soils zhang et al 2019 a possible explanation is that surface water in the amd lake had relatively greater acid stress and lower nutrient availability which may have led to the competitive exclusion of some closely related taxa thus disrupting phylogenetic conservatism whereas distant taxa may coexist due to functional complementation kuang et 2017 ning et al 2020 microbial co occurrence patterns further provide us with an overall better mechanistic understanding of the maintenance of species diversity across environmental gradients microbial otus at 0 5 m exhibited closer interconnections than those at greater depths as confirmed by the node level and network level topological features fig 3b c and table s4 this finding indicates that species co occur more frequently in the more extreme surface water this finding is consistent with the microbial response to sharp amd pollution gradients xu et al 2020 however such high connectivity can also cause the microbial network to be difficult to divide into more modules that reflect shared ecological functions guidi et al 2016 spatial heterogeneity cram et al 2015 or similar habitat preferences faust et al 2012 in the amd lake network modularity decreased with depth indicating that the microbial community in the surface water may be more unstable because high modularity limits the impact of species loss on the whole community and vice versa hernandez et al 2021 moreover a greater number of positive links existed in the microbial network of surface water representing high niche overlap and or positive interactions between taxa this is in line with the gradient stress hypothesis because species can cooperate in detoxification or cross feeding such as syntrophic interactions between acidiphilium and ferrovum in the surface water hammarlund and harcombe 2019 piccardi et al 2019 however such positive interactions can destabilize microbial communities due to the potential for mutual downfall among the taxa reliant on the feedback loop coyte et al 2015 stone 2020 in addition with increasing depth keystone taxa increased which has been shown to promote the assembly and stability of microbial communities banerjee et al 2018 xun et al 2021 the ph is the key environmental driver for microbial diversity and community assembly in amd lake early studies based on large scale ecological investigations revealed that contemporary environmental variation determines the distinct populations at geographically separated amds kuang et al 2013 the ph temperature concentrations of dissolved metals and other solutes organic carbon and dissolved oxygen were identified as the primary environmental factors that shape microbial community structure méndez garcía et al 2015 in the present study ph was also identified as one of the most important variables for predicting species richness phylogenetic diversity and functional differences along a depth profile fig 4a our results indicated that subtle but significant changes in acid stress promoted local microbial community succession in the extremely acidic environment meanwhile do appeared to influence phylogenetic diversity and the composition of communities microorganisms with different adaptations and demands for oxygen may be strictly distributed with depth méndez garcía et al 2014 we propose a conceptual paradigm fig 4c to describe prokaryotic microbial diversity and community assembly across vertical environmental gradients in the amd lake in surface water high acidity has strong selective pressure on the microbial community and results in reduced diversity and dominant species meanwhile in this stressful environment microbial taxa show frequent and positive connections which yet could destabilize the community in contrary along the hydrochemical gradient as the ph increases with depth the environmental pressure on microorganisms lessens correspondingly deterministic environmental selection on microbial community decreases with depth as the environment becomes more benign the less abundant but metabolically flexible microbial taxa have more nutrients and energy for growth rather than acid stress tolerance such growth could enhance stochastic ecological processes and increase microbial diversity and evenness at deeper depths these results provide us with an overall better mechanistic understanding of the maintenance and generation of species diversity across environmental gradients in amd lake considering microbial key role in amd biogeochemical cycle it is crucial to uncover the microbial diversity and community assembly in amd lake for understanding extreme ecological succession and conducting effective pollution control conclusions this study reveals distinct heterogeneity of the local prokaryotic microbial community in an amd lake with strong vertical biogeochemical variations and illustrates the underlying community assembly mechanisms across stress gradients providing potential insight into understanding how microbial diversity is generated and maintained across stress gradients in extreme environments hydrochemical and microbial variations were tightly coupled in the amd lake along vertical environmental gradients including ph and do microbial community diversity and structure varied significantly taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity increased with depth proteobacteria dominated the surface water with firmicutes and euryarchaeota increasing at greater depths environmental selection was more prominent in surface water and random processes become more significant with depth in the upper layers microbial co occurrences especially positive interactions were more frequent and network modularity decreased implying reduced community stability with depth the ph was identified as the key driver for the vertical distribution pattern of microbial communities in the amd lake the stronger acid stresses drove more prominent environmental selection in the upper layers resulting in a significant decrease in microbial diversity as well as more frequent species co occurrence and fragile modularity author contribution zhixiang she and xin pan microbial

16551,in this study we applied a flexible strategy to manufacture a microalgal biochar based membrane mbcm due to the hierarchical surface topography on a micro nano scale the mbcm was found to have both underwater superoleophobic and underoil superhydrophobic properties combining an underoil superhydrophobic oil containing region ocr with an underwater superoleophobic water containing region wcr achieved the successive filtration of multiphase emulsions the mbcm also served as a high performance carbocatalyst for advanced oxidation processes aops due to the n functionalities 5 08 of the graphene like structure this was caused by the high temperature pyrolysis of rich proteins and alkaline salts in the algal residue as a result the mbcm aops system achieved greater than 99 5 emulsions separation efficiency in different emulsion mixtures while also achieving an outstanding degradation rate 99 8 of soluble organic contaminants socs this in depth exploration resulted in a low cost and green strategy for developing multifunctional membranes to treat complex wastewater the paper explains the mechanisms used by mbcm to synchronously remove emulsions and socs from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgal residue biochar based membrane advanced oxidation process carbocatalysis synchronous pollutant removal 1 introduction frequent accidents involving oil and chemical leaks from industrial wastewater or hospital sewage have significantly impacted the aquatic environment these accidents also create potential ecological threats carballa et al 2005 obaid et al 2017 tanudjaja et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 this highlights the importance of identifying methods for simultaneously removing insoluble and soluble organic contaminants from water li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 developing an efficient simple and reliable technique is needed to treat complex water matrices chiou et al 2001 kim et al 2019 kwon et al 2012 liu et al 2018 generally treating oily water involves both oil water separation and demulsification bai and zhang 2020 it is challenging to completely separate the two substances because of the coexistence of oil in water and water in oil emulsions cao et al 2019 ge et al 2018 recently some membranes especially carbonaceous superwetting membranes csms have attracted considerable interest as tools for recovering emulsions due to their rapid filtration efficiency with low environmental impacts li et al 2013 prince et al 2016 wang et al 2015 introducing csms can individually filter water in oil or oil in water emulsions due to their functionalized superwetting properties however most superhydrophobic superoleophilic csms are ineffective for filtering a water in light oil emulsion because the de emulsified water molecules form a barrier between the membrane and the emulsion this significantly inhibits oil penetration wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 furthermore the efficient filtration of heavy oil in water emulsions is often challenging because the separation using superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic membranes can be easily blocked by heavy oil or the membranes can be decomposed because of water swelling desamala et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 few studies have reported the successive simultaneous filtration of both water in oil and oil in water multiphase emulsions via csms cao et al 2019 with the exception of multiphase emulsions few systematic studies have explored multiphase emulsions recovery associated with eliminating socs cao et al 2020 further the associated removal mechanism remains unknown these scientific gaps lead to the inability of csms to meet practical demands and applications many socs derived from pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs are highly toxic have long term chemical stability and have a slow degradation rate these substances are usually discharged with the emulsions containing wastewater this is because organic solvents such as chloroform methylbenzene and dimethylbenzene are often used as the main chemical during the extraction process chen et al 2020 peng et al 2021 also as the main socs in water organic dyes released from textile and paper industries usually co exist with emulsions because methylbenzene often serves as the main solvent during textile coating zhang et al 2015 unfortunately most current water treatment techniques such as filtration chemical degradation and adsorption cannot efficiently separate emulsions while also removing socs this makes them largely impractical this highlights the need for a simple low cost and highly efficient system to simultaneously treat emulsions and socs recently carbonaceous materials have emerged as attractive tools in environmental catalysis because of their higher ssas porous structure graphitic lattice defective edge and oxygen functional group ho et al 2019 carbocatalysts can decompose socs in wastewater by activating the peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps to generate reactive oxygen species ros during the aops moreover modifying carbon nanomaterials with heteroatom dopants such as b n s and p can significantly improve their activity in aops many nanocarbon catalysts are not practical candidates for wastewater treatment due to their high manufacturing cost and instability in wastewater however the graphitic biochar derived from biomass waste has emerged as a promising candidate because of its low production cost catalytic ability and low environmental impacts cai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 ye et al 2020a today s focus on health has led to people taking daily supplements algae mediated products are a popular choice for these supplements because several bioactive molecules e g c phycocyanin in algae have been widely approved with tremendous health benefits gao et al 2017 however as the market for algae mediated products increases worldwide there are concerns about the safe disposal of the remaining extracted algal biomass waste a lack of safety protocols may lead to severe ecological damage due to high levels of inorganic salts i e iron and potassium salts in the algal wastes dahoumane et al 2017 large amounts of inorganic salts a natural pore forming and graphitization agent and protein a natural n doping agent are present in industrial c phycocyanin extracted microalgal residue as such for this study we designed a novel hybrid underwater superoleophobic and underoil superhydrophobic microalgae derived biochar membrane mbcm from c phycocyanin extracted microalgal residue when coupled with aops the mbcm efficiently processed multiphase emulsions wastewater containing socs mitigating the limitations of conventional membrane filtration in addition to recovering the emulsions mbcm also provided a breakthrough in lowering the use of the ps catalyst and enhancing the soc degradability in aops the study also included a comprehensive analysis of the corresponding mechanisms at the mbcm interface overall this study s results can be used to design a green and sustainable microalgal based membrane at the micro nano level and with n doped defects these features create a membrane that can continuously recover emulsions and remove socs providing a new option for the practical treatment of complex wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 materials absolute ethanol chloroform c dimethylbenzene d dichloroethane dc

derived biochar membrane mbcm the c phycocyanin extracted microalgal residue was collected from the east algae factory in fuzhou fujian province china the residue was washed with deionized water to remove impurities and was then dried at 50 c for 24 h the microalgal graphite biochar mgbc was produced from the microalgal residue in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 950 c applying pyrolysis for 2 h at a rate of 2 c min to remove the remaining inorganic impurities and coal tar produced by the high temperature treatment the mgbc was then cleaned ultrasonically using 1 m hcl and water then to maintain graphitization the purified mgbc powder was freeze dried using a vacuum afterwards 0 1 g mgbc was added in pure ethanol and was dispersed using magnetic stirring for 30 min subsequentially 1 g polyurethane pu was added drop by drop at a ph 11 to obtain proper superwetting properties the suspension was then immediately filtered onto a pvdf membrane and dried overnight at room temperature to obtain the microalgae derived biochar membrane mbcm the physicochemical properties of the prepared samples were characterized using several technologies detailed information is provided in text s1 2 3 separation of three phase emulsions first half of the mbcm was prewetted with ultrapure water to prepare a water containing region wcr the other half was prewetted with heavy oil to form an oil containing region ocr the mbcm was subsequently secured between two fixtures the lower fixture had two outlets the outlets were each individually attached to the two tubes placed under the wcr and ocr details of the separation of the three phase emulsions are described in text s2 2 4 degradation of soluble organic pollutants socs the soc degradation was conducted in a

microscope oberkochen japan chen et al 2007 2 6 computational models and methodology to describe the role of different types of nitrogen doping on mgbc including gn graphite nitrogen at different sites pdn pyridine nitrogen at different edges and prn pyrrole nitrogen we conducted spin unrestricted density functional theory dft calculations using the dmol3 module in material studio delley 2000 details about the dft calculation are provided in text s3 for the s2o8 2 adsorbed on the graphene like structure at the edge of mgbc the adsorption energy eads was defined as e a d s e p d s g e p d s

global electrophilicity index ω of ps were defined to describe how different active sites adsorbed ps as described in text s3 parr et al 1999 1977 to further determine the optimal pathway with the minimum energy barrier needed to activate and cleave the s o bond in the ps to generate free radicals we conducted transition states tss searches using the linear synchronous transit quadratic synchronous transit lst qst search method halgren and lipscomb 1977 the fukui function representing free radical attacks f0 was also adopted to evaluate the reactive sites of the organic molecule to better describe the socs degradation pathways in the mbcm aops system parr and yang 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterizations of mbcm the sem image fig 1 a shows that the pvdf membrane was composed of a smooth polymer fiber net in contrast the mbcm surface was rough due to the irregular microalgae residue microspheres with graphitic structures each individual microsphere contained hollow pores ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers in diameter the hierarchical surface topography of mbcm was mainly formed from the rough hollow surface of the microspheres this feature may contribute to the liquid storage capacity and enhanced wettability cao et al 2020 an fe sem image of mgbc also confirmed the presence of many micropores on the surface this was supported by a bet test supplementary table s1 and supplementary fig s1 after high temperature pyrolysis the ssa of mgbc improved from the original 53 669 to 1775 170 the larger ssa and more micropores offer a significant number of active sites contributing to pollutant adsorption and ps activation moreover the tem image and selected area electron diffraction saed presented the graphene like nanosheets at the edge of the microsphere fig 1a the crystal spacing was 0 34 nm which was close to the spacing of the 002 plane of graphite this demonstrates that the mgbc is highly graphitic as a result the graphene like nanostructures were rich at the edge of the microspheres possibly serving as active sites for aops the xps spectra show that the n 1 s peak 5 08 at supplementary table s3 was only observed in the mbcm fig 1b this may result from the nitrogen dopants from the protein in the microalgae the c 1 s peak of mbcm fig 1c was fitted to c c 284 2 ev c c cn 285 2 ev c o epoxy and alkoxy 286 7 ev and c o 288 6 ev of these the calculated ratio 58 76 of c c at 284 2 ev indicated the graphitization this is consistent with the raman spectrum fig 1d indicating that the id ig ratio of mgbc reached 0 79 the intense 2d band at about 2700 cm 1 is aligned with a two phonon double resonance liu et al 2016 ye et al 2020b the four fitted peaks of 398 4 399 6 400 75 and 403 0 ev in the magnified n 1 s spectrum fig 1e are attributed to pdn prn gn and pyridinic n o respectively this indicates that nitrogen dopants were successfully incorporated as the species with the highest proportion pdn may have played a pivotal role in the catalysis pu was seen in the ft ir supplementary fig 2 indicating that mbcm had a tough membrane that could deform without cracking which was also illustrated in a previous study cao et al 2019 water or oil droplets are observed with contact angles cas of 0 on the mbcm in the air fig 1f left this allowed the mbcm to be easily prewetted in the air to form wcr or ocr and to continuously separate emulsions furthermore after immersing the mbcm in water the mbcm became superoleophobic it became superhydrophobic after being immersed in oil the underoil water droplet and the underwater oil droplet attained quasi spherical shapes on the mbcm with cas of 151 and 154 respectively fig 1f right supplementary fig 3 shows that the underwater superoleophobicity ability of mbcm was measured with a series of oil droplets the corresponding cas for dichloroethane chloroform and tetrachloromethane all exceeded 150 similarly the underoil superhydrophobicity of mbcm resulted in the water also exhibiting cas of 150 when exposed to dimethylbenzene hexane and methylbenzene the dynamic adhesion was measured to evaluate the anti fouling properties of mbcm with underoil water and underwater oils water or oils were first preloaded to the mbcm surface and were then slowly unloaded the shapes of the underoil water droplet and underwater oil droplet remained spherical with a low adhesion force during the unloading process fig 1g digital photos of the separation process on the mbcm and the base pvdf are shown in supplementary fig 4 the water or oil droplets adhered to the unmodified pvdf membrane these results indicate that mbcm with ocr or wcr has excellent water or oil repellency in underoil or underwater environments overall these results showed that the mbcm exhibited superior wettability water or oil could be fully absorbed over the hierarchical surface to form the corresponding wcr or ocr when the mbcm was prewetted with the appropriate liquid additionally when another non miscible liquid was introduced the prewetted surface of the mbcm maintained intact as a two phase interface and repelled the second liquid 3 2 separation of insoluble multiphase emulsions via mbcm aops system the wettability of mbcm could be tailored to simultaneously filtrate multiphase emulsions after being prewetted with both oil and water the separation process used to separate insoluble multiphase emulsions is shown in fig 2 a left the mbcm was first exposed to heavy oil in the water in heavy oil emulsion the heavy oil was repelled by the wcr but simultaneously permeated the ocr this resulted in the selective removal of heavy oil when the mbcm subsequently reached the water phase holding the oil in water emulsion also containing socs the water phase was also repelled by the ocr however the purified water permeated the wcr resulting in the separation of the water phase socs were simultaneously removed by aops using a catalytical membrane during water separation finally the remaining light oil filtrate permeated the ocr and migrated into the light oil container the separation efficiency of the mbcm was evaluated using different combinations of the surfactant stabilized three phase emulsions fig 2a right displays the separations of w m m w and w c emulsions which contained different dyes to facilitate observation digital and microscope pictures of different emulsions showed that the filtrate lower was transparent compared to the turbid feed upper the water in oil and differently sized water droplets were also removed the opaque m w became colorless and transparent and the organic dyes were decolorized due to oxidation by aops furthermore there was a significant difference in emulsion droplet size between the filtrate and the corresponding feeding for the feed dense droplets filled the entire image before filtrating in contrast no droplets were observed in the filtrate a subsequent check using dynamic light scattering dls supplementary fig 5 and 6 revealed that only the nano sized droplets 12 nm on average were found in the filtrate indicating the successful separation of all three emulsions w m light oil m oil w and w c heavy oil in all groups the feed left was milky white and the filtrate right was transparent this indicates that the tailored mbcm could successfully recover and treat the multiphase emulsions after analysis the concentration of the emulsions in all the filtrate was below 50 ppm consequently the separation efficiency of all the phases exceeded 99 5 indicating a high level of separation fig 2b this indicates that the mbcm aops system was better than other csms for treating complicated emulsions regardless of the nature of the water phase oil phase and the presence of socs cao et al 2019 these results indicate that mbcm aops system achieved an efficient fast and continuous separation process simultaneously separating the multiphase emulsions and decomposing socs fig 2c shows the stability test of the conventional stirring system and mbcm aops system over four cycles in a typical heterogeneous system the organic intermediates cover the active sites of carbocatalysts and inhibit their interaction with ps via a hydrogen bond strong π π interaction and or electrostatic interaction fig 2d up duan et al 2019 2016 li et al 2017 in contrast the mbcm aops system maintained high separation efficiency in all the cycles because of the short interaction period and the self cleaning action of the membrane during the filtration processes fig 2d bottom the sem image of the mbcm supplementary fig 7 showed that the surface was clean and free of other substances eventually socs were effectively oxidized by the mbcm aops system with satisfactory stability which benefits long term operation 3 3 socs degradation and toxicity via mbcm aops system the effectiveness of the mbcm aops system was measured using different socs as the target pollutants in the water phase e1 detailed in text s2 in the absence of ps the socs reached an equilibrium adsorption on the mbcm within a few minutes supplementary fig 8 but removed less than 10 of socs in contrast the complete degradation of socs was rapidly achieved in the mbcm aops system under continuous operation fig 3 a shows that after the reaction reached equilibrium the contaminant levels in the filtrate declined rapidly which indicated that bpa phenol smx and stz were significantly oxidized by the ps added into the mbcm aops system moreover fig 3b shows the uv vis spectra of the mb mo cr and rb solutions before and after catalytic oxidation prior to the treatment mb and mo showed strong absorbances the higher baseline was due to the scattering of uv light by the emulsion droplets after the treatment the solution became transparent and the absorbances of mb mo cr and rb decreased significantly this indicated that the dye in the water completely degraded fig 3b and c to further evaluate its practical applicability the mbcm aops system was assessed to determine the effects of background factors in real water supplementary fig 9 shows that solution ph and the presence of inorganic anions did not significantly impact the degradation of socs this indicates that the developed mbcm aops system is promising for treating complex wastewater it can be used to treat both multiphase emulsions and remove different socs but is not susceptible to background interference by other substances chemical quenching agents meoh nan3 and p bq were used to identify the ros that contributed to bpa degradation in the mbcm aops system meoh quenches both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals with rapid reaction rates in contrast p bq prefers to react with o2 and nan3 can scavenge 1o2 37 38 fig 3f shows that most quenching agents did not significantly inhibit the mbcm aops system indicating that so4 and 1o2 were not the dominant ross during bpa degradation however p bq caused partial inhibition and bpa removal decreased from 100 to 80 this indicated that o2 contributed to the oxidation adding meoh and p bq had the most significant impact with a 98 7 decrease in the reaction rate both dmpo oh and dmpo o2 were observed in the epr test fig 3g while the epr spectrum showed negligible signals for temp 1o2 this indicated that both oh and o2 were the primary ross in the mbcm aops system with a lower contribution associated with non radical pathways compared to a conventional heterogeneous aops system the mbcm aops system required a smaller volume while providing similar catalytic performance we also examined the ratio of living to dead cells in all oil in water phases before and after a series of multiphase emulsion separations figs 3h the living to dead ratio increased sharply from 0 05 to 99 0 after the filtration process through the mbcm aops system the corresponding fluorescence images before and after separation are shown in supplementary fig 10 the increase in the living to dead ratio may be due to the removal of highly toxic organic components light oil and heavy oil and soluble organic contaminants from the water phase emulsion the results also illustrated that treatment with the mbcm reduced the toxicity of the wastewater while not introducing other hazardous compounds as a result the filtrated water through the mbcm aops system met the ecological demand 3 4 socs degradation mechanism and pathway via mbcm aops system past studies have reported that ketonic c o groups facilitated ps and pms decomposition and generated 1o2 because they acted as the lewis basic sites with lone pair electrons this effectively increased the electron density of the neighboring carbon atoms and promoted nonradical reactions mian and liu 2020 however in this study the xps o1 s region supplementary fig 11 of c o 530 08 ev and the intensity of c o peak 1716 cm 1 in ft ir supplementary fig 2 showed a small population of c o in the mbcm this is because high temperature pyrolysis decomposed the oxygen functional groups which did not support the nonradical pathway this is consistent with the quenching and epr experimental results fig 3f and g besides the versatile oxygen functional groups the imperfect hexagonal units with vacancies zigzag armchair edges in the sp2 carbon lattice served as active sites during heterogeneous catalysis ye et al 2020b the fesem image and raman spectra both illustrated that mbcm had a certain number of defects fig 1a and d which served as active sites for ps activation previous studies reported that only a minor level of n doping 0 8 significantly enhanced the decomposition of socs this induced an uneven distribution of the charge of adjacent c atoms facilitating ps adsorption and activation duan et al 2015 the abundant n dopants in mbcm largely improved the aops catalytic activity in this study to better identify the active sites and reveal the activation mechanism of ps on n doped mgbc a graphene nanosheet model was established with n dopants at the defective edges and in the basal plane six types of n functionalities fig 4 a including graphite nitrogen gn at different sites pyridine nitrogen pdn at different edges zigzag armchair and pyrrole nitrogen prn were considered supplementary fig 12 illustrates the configurations of s2o8 2 anions on different models several descriptors were calculated including the eads atomic charge on s2o8 2 anion length of s o ls o and length of s o lo o the results are summarized in fig 4b and supplementary table s4 the electrophilic index ω was adopted to evaluate the oxidative capacity of activated s2o8 2 anions a greater value of ω indicates a higher oxidative capacity leading to more electron transfers between organics and ps over the carbocatalyst the active sites were determined using the descriptors in this study with respect to the pristine graphene g the eads for prn and gn doped graphene increased significantly the exception was the eads for interior gn gni this is mainly because the defective edge at the boundary of the sp2 hybridized framework has a closer femi level to the bulk structure and has a unique electronic state because of the delocalized π electrons as such it exhibits synergies with the nitrogen dopants toward enhanced catalysis ouyang et al 2019 the eads value for s2o8 2 anions adsorbed pdn doped graphene was small additionally the edge types had significantly impacted on eads including a zigzag edge pdn pdnz and armchair edge pdn pdna fig 4b shows that the zigzag edges of the mbcm were likely the active sites for ps activation this may have been because the π electrons could not be confined by the edge carbons sun et al 2012 the eads values varied with the position and the species of n atoms the corresponding eads values were as follows in descending order zigzag edge gn gnz prn armchair edge gn gna g pdnz gni pdna this indicated that gn and prn significantly contributed to the adsorption of ps the same type of n atoms doped on zigzag edges consistently showed a greater eads compared to those on armchair edges this was reconfirmed by most of the homo and lumo orbitals located on the zigzag edges in supplementary fig 13 indicating the excellent electronic activity of the zigzag edges around the fermi level however an opposite trend was observed for the bond length a higher eads led to a stretch of ls o whereas a shrink of lo o in ps was observed the ω value which indicates the oxidative ability showed a similar enhancement trend with the length of ls o as documented in supplementary table s5 this differed from the trends seen with eads and loo for example gnz and prn doped graphene both had higher eads values compared to g but had low corresponding ω values this indicated that gn and prn were not the intrinsic active sites for ps activation moreover pdnz and pdna showed much lower eads values compared to g while a higher ω was observed in fig 4b thus the stretch of ls o triggered the fission of the s o bond and reflected the oxidative capacity of the adsorbed ps to react with contaminants this indicated that the pdnz and pdna species primarily facilitated the catalytic performance the epr results indicate that o2 and oh were the main free radicals this leads to the assumption that ps was activated by mgbc through radical generation pathways eq 1 and 2 furman et al 2010 initially the proposed mechanism was the activation of one s o bond of ps with the assistance of mgbc after that the s o bond stretched and underwent fission generating peroxomonosulfate so5 2 and sulfate so4 2 as shown in eq 3 then the same cleavage occurred with the other s o bond in so5 2 establishing sulfate and hydroperoxide ho2 eq 4 the ho2 reduced another persulfate molecule into a sulfate radical so4 and sulfate anion while hydroperoxide transformed into a superoxide radical o2 as shown in eq 5 since the micron environment around mbcm was alkaline the oh quenched so4 and became the main active species eq 2 1 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 3 so 4 2 so 4 o 2 4 h 2 so 4 o h o h so 4 2 3 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o so 5 2 so 4 2 2 h 4 so 5 2 h 2 o ho o so 4 2 h 5 ho o s 2 o 8 2 so 4 2 so 4 o 2 h to further explore the intrinsic active site of mbcm the energy barriers eb of the cleavage of the s o bond reaction the initial step of ps were determined using the transition state searching method in the dmol3 package the eb values of different n doping are shown in fig 4d their adsorption and further activation models are shown in supplementary fig 14 without the assistance of a catalyst the eb of s o bond cleavage was 1 45 ev the two lowest eb during this process were 0 50 ev on pdnz and 0 77ev on pdna the eb value of prn was 1 02 ev while the highest eb 1 47 ev of gnz demonstrated a low ps activation efficiency these results illustrate that the highest catalytic reactivity was mainly due to the combined contribution of pdn and zigzag edges therefore when ps was first adsorbed on pdn doped mgbc the c atoms bonded with the pdn atom activated ps and elongated the s o bond from 1 73 å to 1 83 å this was due to the electron transfer from n to adjacent c as shown in the electrostatic potential analysis supplementary fig 15 then the activated ps reacted with the surrounding water and dissociated into so4 2 and so5 2 furthermore the sulfate radical was quenched into the hydroxyl radical oh to clarify the degradation pathway of socs in the mbcm aops system real time lc tof ms screening was applied to investigate the degradation pathway of bpa supplementary table s6 lists the detected intermediates to further elucidate the degradation pathway mayer bond orders and fukui index representing a radical attack f0 of the atoms on the bpa molecule were calculated supplementary table s7 the red marked atoms in fig 4e with larger f0 values c2 c6 c12 and c16 were more vulnerable to radical attack in addition the yellow marked bonds showed smaller numbers in mayer bond orders indicating they were more likely to be cleaved in the reaction based on the detected intermediates and dft calculations fig 4f illustrates the bpa degradation pathway the initial steps of the degradation and formation of mono hydroxylated bpa identified in the ms spectra supplementary fig 16 were divided into two main routes on two different attack sites the homos and lumos of bpa supplementary fig 17 were mostly present in the benzene ring and the isopropyl carbon in the center the radicals first reacted with these active orbitals the hydroxyl radicals had a short life but played a vital role by reacting with the aromatic ring to generate hydroxyl radical adducts previous studies found that oh is non selective and prefers to swiftly react with the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain fukahori et al 2003 however in terms of the non selectivity of oh there was still a prioritization among the potential sites for the oh attack the presence of the electron donating hydroxyl led to an increase in the electron density of the aromatic ring making the phenyl groups more vulnerable to the electrophilic attack the attack of oh onto the aromatic ring of bpa preferentially occurred at the ortho position due to the ortho and para orientation activity of the ring in the presence of hydroxyl similar to the data generated by the fukui index the potential site for oh attack can be somewhat clarified for the ring hydroxylation reaction the c2 and c12 with the highest f0 0 063 and 0 061 were more likely to be attacked by radicals this caused the formation of the mono hydroxylated bpa a at m z 243 oxidized intermediates with aldehyde and quinone groups m z 257 c and 241 b respectively were subsequently generated by the attack of oh and o2 of hydroxylated bpa a next the c1 c6 of intermediate b was unstable due to the lowest mayer bond order 0 88 this allowed the bi carboxylic acid derivative d m z 275 to be transformed this by product was also reported during the photocatalytic degradation of bpa darsinou et al 2015 an intermediate at m z 257 c was also detected the aldehydic c9 showed the highest fukui index and lowest bond order after two methyl losses of intermediate c the isopropyl chain finally cleaved leading to the formation of the small molecule at m z 136 in the other route two intermediates m z 93 g and 134 f were formed through the cleavage of the single bond between the isopropylidene carbon and the phenyl groups in bpa this can be explained by the elimination of water from hydroxyl radical adducts to form the phenoxyl bpa radical followed by beta scission to produce isopropenyl phenol and phenoxy radicals darsinou et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 validating this explanation a mayer bond order analysis showed consistent results the bonds connecting to c7 and the aromatic rings all had the lowest values finally these intermediates were further attacked by o2 or oh and were decomposed into smaller molecules or mineralized into co2 and h2o fig 4c shows that most of the oxidized products reached their maximum concentrations at different time intervals demonstrating that the hydroxylation and beta scission occurred in successive order the concentration of intermediate a increased rapidly within the first few minutes this indicated that the ring hydroxylation reaction occurred at the beginning of the degradation process then intermediate a was gradually attacked by the free radicals generated from ps and was then transformed into intermediate f m z 143 meanwhile the isopropylidene carbon of bpa was also attacked and underwent beta scission generating similar intermediate f and other intermediates 4 conclusion in this study a bi functional membrane was developed using microalgal residue derived biochar as the building block the integrated mbcm aops system can continuously separate water in light oil oil in water and water in heavy oil multi phase emulsions using combined oil and water containing regions to overcome the continuous separation of multiphase emulsions simultaneously the mgbc can degrade different socs the study also assessed the performance and corresponding mechanisms involved in the separation of emulsions and soc removal through the mbcm aops system overall this study highlights a novel strategy for simultaneously separating multiphase emulsions and removing socs using a green and multifunctional biochar based membrane system this proof of concept study can further inform the design of an

16551,in this study we applied a flexible strategy to manufacture a microalgal biochar based membrane mbcm due to the hierarchical surface topography on a micro nano scale the mbcm was found to have both underwater superoleophobic and underoil superhydrophobic properties combining an underoil superhydrophobic oil containing region ocr with an underwater superoleophobic water containing region wcr achieved the successive filtration of multiphase emulsions the mbcm also served as a high performance carbocatalyst for advanced oxidation processes aops due to the n functionalities 5 08 of the graphene like structure this was caused by the high temperature pyrolysis of rich proteins and alkaline salts in the algal residue as a result the mbcm aops system achieved greater than 99 5 emulsions separation efficiency in different emulsion mixtures while also achieving an outstanding degradation rate 99 8 of soluble organic contaminants socs this in depth exploration resulted in a low cost and green strategy for developing multifunctional membranes to treat complex wastewater the paper explains the mechanisms used by mbcm to synchronously remove emulsions and socs from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgal residue biochar based membrane advanced oxidation process carbocatalysis synchronous pollutant removal 1 introduction frequent accidents involving oil and chemical leaks from industrial wastewater or hospital sewage have significantly impacted the aquatic environment these accidents also create potential ecological threats carballa et al 2005 obaid et al 2017 tanudjaja et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 this highlights the importance of identifying methods for simultaneously removing insoluble and soluble organic contaminants from water li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 developing an efficient simple and reliable technique is needed to treat complex water matrices chiou et al 2001 kim et al 2019 kwon et al 2012 liu et al 2018 generally treating oily water involves both oil water separation and demulsification bai and zhang 2020 it is challenging to completely separate the two substances because of the coexistence of oil in water and water in oil emulsions cao et al 2019 ge et al 2018 recently some membranes especially carbonaceous superwetting membranes csms have attracted considerable interest as tools for recovering emulsions due to their rapid filtration efficiency with low environmental impacts li et al 2013 prince et al 2016 wang et al 2015 introducing csms can individually filter water in oil or oil in water emulsions due to their functionalized superwetting properties however most superhydrophobic superoleophilic csms are ineffective for filtering a water in light oil emulsion because the de emulsified water molecules form a barrier between the membrane and the emulsion this significantly inhibits oil penetration wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 furthermore the efficient filtration of heavy oil in water emulsions is often challenging because the separation using superhydrophilic underwater superoleophobic membranes can be easily blocked by heavy oil or the membranes can be decomposed because of water swelling desamala et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 few studies have reported the successive simultaneous filtration of both water in oil and oil in water multiphase emulsions via csms cao et al 2019 with the exception of multiphase emulsions few systematic studies have explored multiphase emulsions recovery associated with eliminating socs cao et al 2020 further the associated removal mechanism remains unknown these scientific gaps lead to the inability of csms to meet practical demands and applications many socs derived from pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs are highly toxic have long term chemical stability and have a slow degradation rate these substances are usually discharged with the emulsions containing wastewater this is because organic solvents such as chloroform methylbenzene and dimethylbenzene are often used as the main chemical during the extraction process chen et al 2020 peng et al 2021 also as the main socs in water organic dyes released from textile and paper industries usually co exist with emulsions because methylbenzene often serves as the main solvent during textile coating zhang et al 2015 unfortunately most current water treatment techniques such as filtration chemical degradation and adsorption cannot efficiently separate emulsions while also removing socs this makes them largely impractical this highlights the need for a simple low cost and highly efficient system to simultaneously treat emulsions and socs recently carbonaceous materials have emerged as attractive tools in environmental catalysis because of their higher ssas porous structure graphitic lattice defective edge and oxygen functional group ho et al 2019 carbocatalysts can decompose socs in wastewater by activating the peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps to generate reactive oxygen species ros during the aops moreover modifying carbon nanomaterials with heteroatom dopants such as b n s and p can significantly improve their activity in aops many nanocarbon catalysts are not practical candidates for wastewater treatment due to their high manufacturing cost and instability in wastewater however the graphitic biochar derived from biomass waste has emerged as a promising candidate because of its low production cost catalytic ability and low environmental impacts cai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 ye et al 2020a today s focus on health has led to people taking daily supplements algae mediated products are a popular choice for these supplements because several bioactive molecules e g c phycocyanin in algae have been widely approved with tremendous health benefits gao et al 2017 however as the market for algae mediated products increases worldwide there are concerns about the safe disposal of the remaining extracted algal biomass waste a lack of safety protocols may lead to severe ecological damage due to high levels of inorganic salts i e iron and potassium salts in the algal wastes dahoumane et al 2017 large amounts of inorganic salts a natural pore forming and graphitization agent and protein a natural n doping agent are present in industrial c phycocyanin extracted microalgal residue as such for this study we designed a novel hybrid underwater superoleophobic and underoil superhydrophobic microalgae derived biochar membrane mbcm from c phycocyanin extracted microalgal residue when coupled with aops the mbcm efficiently processed multiphase emulsions wastewater containing socs mitigating the limitations of conventional membrane filtration in addition to recovering the emulsions mbcm also provided a breakthrough in lowering the use of the ps catalyst and enhancing the soc degradability in aops the study also included a comprehensive analysis of the corresponding mechanisms at the mbcm interface overall this study s results can be used to design a green and sustainable microalgal based membrane at the micro nano level and with n doped defects these features create a membrane that can continuously recover emulsions and remove socs providing a new option for the practical treatment of complex wastewater 2 material and methods 2 1 materials absolute ethanol chloroform c dimethylbenzene d dichloroethane dc

derived biochar membrane mbcm the c phycocyanin extracted microalgal residue was collected from the east algae factory in fuzhou fujian province china the residue was washed with deionized water to remove impurities and was then dried at 50 c for 24 h the microalgal graphite biochar mgbc was produced from the microalgal residue in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 950 c applying pyrolysis for 2 h at a rate of 2 c min to remove the remaining inorganic impurities and coal tar produced by the high temperature treatment the mgbc was then cleaned ultrasonically using 1 m hcl and water then to maintain graphitization the purified mgbc powder was freeze dried using a vacuum afterwards 0 1 g mgbc was added in pure ethanol and was dispersed using magnetic stirring for 30 min subsequentially 1 g polyurethane pu was added drop by drop at a ph 11 to obtain proper superwetting properties the suspension was then immediately filtered onto a pvdf membrane and dried overnight at room temperature to obtain the microalgae derived biochar membrane mbcm the physicochemical properties of the prepared samples were characterized using several technologies detailed information is provided in text s1 2 3 separation of three phase emulsions first half of the mbcm was prewetted with ultrapure water to prepare a water containing region wcr the other half was prewetted with heavy oil to form an oil containing region ocr the mbcm was subsequently secured between two fixtures the lower fixture had two outlets the outlets were each individually attached to the two tubes placed under the wcr and ocr details of the separation of the three phase emulsions are described in text s2 2 4 degradation of soluble organic pollutants socs the soc degradation was conducted in a

then measured using the live dead baclight viability kit the cells were stained using a standard staining procedure then the fluorescence signals were obtained using a bx53 olympus fluorescence microscope oberkochen japan chen et al 2007 2 6 computational models and methodology to describe the role of different types of nitrogen doping on mgbc including gn graphite nitrogen at different sites pdn pyridine nitrogen at different edges and prn pyrrole nitrogen we conducted spin unrestricted density functional theory dft calculations using the dmol3 module in material studio delley 2000 details about the dft calculation are provided in text s3 for the s2o8 2 adsorbed on the graphene like structure at the edge of mgbc the adsorption energy eads was defined as e a d s e p d s g e p d s e g dft calculations were used to calculate the energies of the highest occupied orbitals homos and the lowest occupied orbitals lumos the energy gap eg chemical potential μ chemical hardness η and global electrophilicity index ω of ps were defined to describe how different active sites adsorbed ps as described in text s3 parr et al 1999 1977 to further determine the optimal pathway with the minimum energy barrier needed to activate and cleave the s o bond in the ps to generate free radicals we conducted transition states tss searches using the linear synchronous transit quadratic synchronous transit lst qst search method halgren and lipscomb 1977 the fukui function representing free radical attacks f0 was also adopted to evaluate the reactive sites of the organic molecule to better describe the socs degradation pathways in the mbcm aops system parr and yang 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterizations of mbcm the sem image fig 1 a shows that the pvdf membrane was composed of a smooth polymer fiber net in contrast the mbcm surface was rough due to the irregular microalgae residue microspheres with graphitic structures each individual microsphere contained hollow pores ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometers in diameter the hierarchical surface topography of mbcm was mainly formed from the rough hollow surface of the microspheres this feature may contribute to the liquid storage capacity and enhanced wettability cao et al 2020 an fe sem image of mgbc also confirmed the presence of many micropores on the surface this was supported by a bet test supplementary table s1 and supplementary fig s1 after high temperature pyrolysis the ssa of mgbc improved from the original 53 669 to 1775 170 the larger ssa and more micropores offer a significant number of active sites contributing to pollutant adsorption and ps activation moreover the tem image and selected area electron diffraction saed presented the graphene like nanosheets at the edge of the microsphere fig 1a the crystal spacing was 0 34 nm which was close to the spacing of the 002 plane of graphite this demonstrates that the mgbc is highly graphitic as a result the graphene like nanostructures were rich at the edge of the microspheres possibly serving as active sites for aops the xps spectra show that the n 1 s peak 5 08 at supplementary table s3 was only observed in the mbcm fig 1b this may result from the nitrogen dopants from the protein in the microalgae the c 1 s peak of mbcm fig 1c was fitted to c c 284 2 ev c c cn 285 2 ev c o epoxy and alkoxy 286 7 ev and c o 288 6 ev of these the calculated ratio 58 76 of c c at 284 2 ev indicated the graphitization this is consistent with the raman spectrum fig 1d indicating that the id ig ratio of mgbc reached 0 79 the intense 2d band at about 2700 cm 1 is aligned with a two phonon double resonance liu et al 2016 ye et al 2020b the four fitted peaks of 398 4 399 6 400 75 and 403 0 ev in the magnified n 1 s spectrum fig 1e are attributed to pdn prn gn and pyridinic n o respectively this indicates that nitrogen dopants were successfully incorporated as the species with the highest proportion pdn may have played a pivotal role in the catalysis pu was seen in the ft ir supplementary fig 2 indicating that mbcm had a tough membrane that could deform without cracking which was also illustrated in a previous study cao et al 2019 water or oil droplets are observed with contact angles cas of 0 on the mbcm in the air fig 1f left this allowed the mbcm to be easily prewetted in the air to form wcr or ocr and to continuously separate emulsions furthermore after immersing the mbcm in water the mbcm became superoleophobic it became superhydrophobic after being immersed in oil the underoil water droplet and the underwater oil droplet attained quasi spherical shapes on the mbcm with cas of 151 and 154 respectively fig 1f right supplementary fig 3 shows that the underwater superoleophobicity ability of mbcm was measured with a series of oil droplets the corresponding cas for dichloroethane chloroform and tetrachloromethane all exceeded 150 similarly the underoil superhydrophobicity of mbcm resulted in the water also exhibiting cas of 150 when exposed to dimethylbenzene hexane and methylbenzene the dynamic adhesion was measured to evaluate the anti fouling properties of mbcm with underoil water and underwater oils water or oils were first preloaded to the mbcm surface and were then slowly unloaded the shapes of the underoil water droplet and underwater oil droplet remained spherical with a low adhesion force during the unloading process fig 1g digital photos of the separation process on the mbcm and the base pvdf are shown in supplementary fig 4 the water or oil droplets adhered to the unmodified pvdf membrane these results indicate that mbcm with ocr or wcr has excellent water or oil repellency in underoil or underwater environments overall these results showed that the mbcm exhibited superior wettability water or oil could be fully absorbed over the hierarchical surface to form the corresponding wcr or ocr when the mbcm was prewetted with the appropriate liquid additionally when another non miscible liquid was introduced the prewetted surface of the mbcm maintained intact as a two phase interface and repelled the second liquid 3 2 separation of insoluble multiphase emulsions via mbcm aops system the wettability of mbcm could be tailored to simultaneously filtrate multiphase emulsions after being prewetted with both oil and water the separation process used to separate insoluble multiphase emulsions is shown in fig 2 a left the mbcm was first exposed to heavy oil in the water in heavy oil emulsion the heavy oil was repelled by the wcr but simultaneously permeated the ocr this resulted in the selective removal of heavy oil when the mbcm subsequently reached the water phase holding the oil in water emulsion also containing socs the water phase was also repelled by the ocr however the purified water permeated the wcr resulting in the separation of the water phase socs were simultaneously removed by aops using a catalytical membrane during water separation finally the remaining light oil filtrate permeated the ocr and migrated into the light oil container the separation efficiency of the mbcm was evaluated using different combinations of the surfactant stabilized three phase emulsions fig 2a right displays the separations of w m m w and w c emulsions which contained different dyes to facilitate observation digital and microscope pictures of different emulsions showed that the filtrate lower was transparent compared to the turbid feed upper the water in oil and differently sized water droplets were also removed the opaque m w became colorless and transparent and the organic dyes were decolorized due to oxidation by aops furthermore there was a significant difference in emulsion droplet size between the filtrate and the corresponding feeding for the feed dense droplets filled the entire image before filtrating in contrast no droplets were observed in the filtrate a subsequent check using dynamic light scattering dls supplementary fig 5 and 6 revealed that only the nano sized droplets 12 nm on average were found in the filtrate indicating the successful separation of all three emulsions w m light oil m oil w and w c heavy oil in all groups the feed left was milky white and the filtrate right was transparent this indicates that the tailored mbcm could successfully recover and treat the multiphase emulsions after analysis the concentration of the emulsions in all the filtrate was below 50 ppm consequently the separation efficiency of all the phases exceeded 99 5 indicating a high level of separation fig 2b this indicates that the mbcm aops system was better than other csms for treating complicated emulsions regardless of the nature of the water phase oil phase and the presence of socs cao et al 2019 these results indicate that mbcm aops system achieved an efficient fast and continuous separation process simultaneously separating the multiphase emulsions and decomposing socs fig 2c shows the stability test of the conventional stirring system and mbcm aops system over four cycles in a typical heterogeneous system the organic intermediates cover the active sites of carbocatalysts and inhibit their interaction with ps via a hydrogen bond strong π π interaction and or electrostatic interaction fig 2d up duan et al 2019 2016 li et al 2017 in contrast the mbcm aops system maintained high separation efficiency in all the cycles because of the short interaction period and the self cleaning action of the membrane during the filtration processes fig 2d bottom the sem image of the mbcm supplementary fig 7 showed that the surface was clean and free of other substances eventually socs were effectively oxidized by the mbcm aops system with satisfactory stability which benefits long term operation 3 3 socs degradation and toxicity via mbcm aops system the effectiveness of the mbcm aops system was measured using different socs as the target pollutants in the water phase e1 detailed in text s2 in the absence of ps the socs reached an equilibrium adsorption on the mbcm within a few minutes supplementary fig 8 but removed less than 10 of socs in contrast the complete degradation of socs was rapidly achieved in the mbcm aops system under continuous operation fig 3 a shows that after the reaction reached equilibrium the contaminant levels in the filtrate declined rapidly which indicated that bpa phenol smx and stz were significantly oxidized by the ps added into the mbcm aops system moreover fig 3b shows the uv vis spectra of the mb mo cr and rb solutions before and after catalytic oxidation prior to the treatment mb and mo showed strong absorbances the higher baseline was due to the scattering of uv light by the emulsion droplets after the treatment the solution became transparent and the absorbances of mb mo cr and rb decreased significantly this indicated that the dye in the water completely degraded fig 3b and c to further evaluate its practical applicability the mbcm aops system was assessed to determine the effects of background factors in real water supplementary fig 9 shows that solution ph and the presence of inorganic anions did not significantly impact the degradation of socs this indicates that the developed mbcm aops system is promising for treating complex wastewater it can be used to treat both multiphase emulsions and remove different socs but is not susceptible to background interference by other substances chemical quenching agents meoh nan3 and p bq were used to identify the ros that contributed to bpa degradation in the mbcm aops system meoh quenches both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals with rapid reaction rates in contrast p bq prefers to react with o2 and nan3 can scavenge 1o2 37 38 fig 3f shows that most quenching agents did not significantly inhibit the mbcm aops system indicating that so4 and 1o2 were not the dominant ross during bpa degradation however p bq caused partial inhibition and bpa removal decreased from 100 to 80 this indicated that o2 contributed to the oxidation adding meoh and p bq had the most significant impact with a 98 7 decrease in the reaction rate both dmpo oh and dmpo o2 were observed in the epr test fig 3g while the epr spectrum showed negligible signals for temp 1o2 this indicated that both oh and o2 were the primary ross in the mbcm aops system with a lower contribution associated with non radical pathways compared to a conventional heterogeneous aops system the mbcm aops system required a smaller volume while providing similar catalytic performance we also examined the ratio of living to dead cells in all oil in water phases before and after a series of multiphase emulsion separations figs 3h the living to dead ratio increased sharply from 0 05 to 99 0 after the filtration process through the mbcm aops system the corresponding fluorescence images before and after separation are shown in supplementary fig 10 the increase in the living to dead ratio may be due to the removal of highly toxic organic components light oil and heavy oil and soluble organic contaminants from the water phase emulsion the results also illustrated that treatment with the mbcm reduced the toxicity of the wastewater while not introducing other hazardous compounds as a result the filtrated water through the mbcm aops system met the ecological demand 3 4 socs degradation mechanism and pathway via mbcm aops system past studies have reported that ketonic c o groups facilitated ps and pms decomposition and generated 1o2 because they acted as the lewis basic sites with lone pair electrons this effectively increased the electron density of the neighboring carbon atoms and promoted nonradical reactions mian and liu 2020 however in this study the xps o1 s region supplementary fig 11 of c o 530 08 ev and the intensity of c o peak 1716 cm 1 in ft ir supplementary fig 2 showed a small population of c o in the mbcm this is because high temperature pyrolysis decomposed the oxygen functional groups which did not support the nonradical pathway this is consistent with the quenching and epr experimental results fig 3f and g besides the versatile oxygen functional groups the imperfect hexagonal units with vacancies zigzag armchair edges in the sp2 carbon lattice served as active sites during heterogeneous catalysis ye et al 2020b the fesem image and raman spectra both illustrated that mbcm had a certain number of defects fig 1a and d which served as active sites for ps activation previous studies reported that only a minor level of n doping 0 8 significantly enhanced the decomposition of socs this induced an uneven distribution of the charge of adjacent c atoms facilitating ps adsorption and activation duan et al 2015 the abundant n dopants in mbcm largely improved the aops catalytic activity in this study to better identify the active sites and reveal the activation mechanism of ps on n doped mgbc a graphene nanosheet model was established with n dopants at the defective edges and in the basal plane six types of n functionalities fig 4 a including graphite nitrogen gn at different sites pyridine nitrogen pdn at different edges zigzag armchair and pyrrole nitrogen prn were considered supplementary fig 12 illustrates the configurations of s2o8 2 anions on different models several descriptors were calculated including the eads atomic charge on s2o8 2 anion length of s o ls o and length of s o lo o the results are summarized in fig 4b and supplementary table s4 the electrophilic index ω was adopted to evaluate the oxidative capacity of activated s2o8 2 anions a greater value of ω indicates a higher oxidative capacity leading to more electron transfers between organics and ps over the carbocatalyst the active sites were determined using the descriptors in this study with respect to the pristine graphene g the eads for prn and gn doped graphene increased significantly the exception was the eads for interior gn gni this is mainly because the defective edge at the boundary of the sp2 hybridized framework has a closer femi level to the bulk structure and has a unique electronic state because of the delocalized π electrons as such it exhibits synergies with the nitrogen dopants toward enhanced catalysis ouyang et al 2019 the eads value for s2o8 2 anions adsorbed pdn doped graphene was small additionally the edge types had significantly impacted on eads including a zigzag edge pdn pdnz and armchair edge pdn pdna fig 4b shows that the zigzag edges of the mbcm were likely the active sites for ps activation this may have been because the π electrons could not be confined by the edge carbons sun et al 2012 the eads values varied with the position and the species of n atoms the corresponding eads values were as follows in descending order zigzag edge gn gnz prn armchair edge gn gna g pdnz gni pdna this indicated that gn and prn significantly contributed to the adsorption of ps the same type of n atoms doped on zigzag edges consistently showed a greater eads compared to those on armchair edges this was reconfirmed by most of the homo and lumo orbitals located on the zigzag edges in supplementary fig 13 indicating the excellent electronic activity of the zigzag edges around the fermi level however an opposite trend was observed for the bond length a higher eads led to a stretch of ls o whereas a shrink of lo o in ps was observed the ω value which indicates the oxidative ability showed a similar enhancement trend with the length of ls o as documented in supplementary table s5 this differed from the trends seen with eads and loo for example gnz and prn doped graphene both had higher eads values compared to g but had low corresponding ω values this indicated that gn and prn were not the intrinsic active sites for ps activation moreover pdnz and pdna showed much lower eads values compared to g while a higher ω was observed in fig 4b thus the stretch of ls o triggered the fission of the s o bond and reflected the oxidative capacity of the adsorbed ps to react with contaminants this indicated that the pdnz and pdna species primarily facilitated the catalytic performance the epr results indicate that o2 and oh were the main free radicals this leads to the assumption that ps was activated by mgbc through radical generation pathways eq 1 and 2 furman et al 2010 initially the proposed mechanism was the activation of one s o bond of ps with the assistance of mgbc after that the s o bond stretched and underwent fission generating peroxomonosulfate so5 2 and sulfate so4 2 as shown in eq 3 then the same cleavage occurred with the other s o bond in so5 2 establishing sulfate and hydroperoxide ho2 eq 4 the ho2 reduced another persulfate molecule into a sulfate radical so4 and sulfate anion while hydroperoxide transformed into a superoxide radical o2 as shown in eq 5 since the micron environment around mbcm was alkaline the oh quenched so4 and became the main active species eq 2 1 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o 3 so 4 2 so 4 o 2 4 h 2 so 4 o h o h so 4 2 3 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o so 5 2 so 4 2 2 h 4 so 5 2 h 2 o ho o so 4 2 h 5 ho o s 2 o 8 2 so 4 2 so 4 o 2 h to further explore the intrinsic active site of mbcm the energy barriers eb of the cleavage of the s o bond reaction the initial step of ps were determined using the transition state searching method in the dmol3 package the eb values of different n doping are shown in fig 4d their adsorption and further activation models are shown in supplementary fig 14 without the assistance of a catalyst the eb of s o bond cleavage was 1 45 ev the two lowest eb during this process were 0 50 ev on pdnz and 0 77ev on pdna the eb value of prn was 1 02 ev while the highest eb 1 47 ev of gnz demonstrated a low ps activation efficiency these results illustrate that the highest catalytic reactivity was mainly due to the combined contribution of pdn and zigzag edges therefore when ps was first adsorbed on pdn doped mgbc the c atoms bonded with the pdn atom activated ps and elongated the s o bond from 1 73 å to 1 83 å this was due to the electron transfer from n to adjacent c as shown in the electrostatic potential analysis supplementary fig 15 then the activated ps reacted with the surrounding water and dissociated into so4 2 and so5 2 furthermore the sulfate radical was quenched into the hydroxyl radical oh to clarify the degradation pathway of socs in the mbcm aops system real time lc tof ms screening was applied to investigate the degradation pathway of bpa supplementary table s6 lists the detected intermediates to further elucidate the degradation pathway mayer bond orders and fukui index representing a radical attack f0 of the atoms on the bpa molecule were calculated supplementary table s7 the red marked atoms in fig 4e with larger f0 values c2 c6 c12 and c16 were more vulnerable to radical attack in addition the yellow marked bonds showed smaller numbers in mayer bond orders indicating they were more likely to be cleaved in the reaction based on the detected intermediates and dft calculations fig 4f illustrates the bpa degradation pathway the initial steps of the degradation and formation of mono hydroxylated bpa identified in the ms spectra supplementary fig 16 were divided into two main routes on two different attack sites the homos and lumos of bpa supplementary fig 17 were mostly present in the benzene ring and the isopropyl carbon in the center the radicals first reacted with these active orbitals the hydroxyl radicals had a short life but played a vital role by reacting with the aromatic ring to generate hydroxyl radical adducts previous studies found that oh is non selective and prefers to swiftly react with the aromatic ring or aliphatic chain fukahori et al 2003 however in terms of the non selectivity of oh there was still a prioritization among the potential sites for the oh attack the presence of the electron donating hydroxyl led to an increase in the electron density of the aromatic ring making the phenyl groups more vulnerable to the electrophilic attack the attack of oh onto the aromatic ring of bpa preferentially occurred at the ortho position due to the ortho and para orientation activity of the ring in the presence of hydroxyl similar to the data generated by the fukui index the potential site for oh attack can be somewhat clarified for the ring hydroxylation reaction the c2 and c12 with the highest f0 0 063 and 0 061 were more likely to be attacked by radicals this caused the formation of the mono hydroxylated bpa a at m z 243 oxidized intermediates with aldehyde and quinone groups m z 257 c and 241 b respectively were subsequently generated by the attack of oh and o2 of hydroxylated bpa a next the c1 c6 of intermediate b was unstable due to the lowest mayer bond order 0 88 this allowed the bi carboxylic acid derivative d m z 275 to be transformed this by product was also reported during the photocatalytic degradation of bpa darsinou et al 2015 an intermediate at m z 257 c was also detected the aldehydic c9 showed the highest fukui index and lowest bond order after two methyl losses of intermediate c the isopropyl chain finally cleaved leading to the formation of the small molecule at m z 136 in the other route two intermediates m z 93 g and 134 f were formed through the cleavage of the single bond between the isopropylidene carbon and the phenyl groups in bpa this can be explained by the elimination of water from hydroxyl radical adducts to form the phenoxyl bpa radical followed by beta scission to produce isopropenyl phenol and phenoxy radicals darsinou et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 validating this explanation a mayer bond order analysis showed consistent results the bonds connecting to c7 and the aromatic rings all had the lowest values finally these intermediates were further attacked by o2 or oh and were decomposed into smaller molecules or mineralized into co2 and h2o fig 4c shows that most of the oxidized products reached their maximum concentrations at different time intervals demonstrating that the hydroxylation and beta scission occurred in successive order the concentration of intermediate a increased rapidly within the first few minutes this indicated that the ring hydroxylation reaction occurred at the beginning of the degradation process then intermediate a was gradually attacked by the free radicals generated from ps and was then transformed into intermediate f m z 143 meanwhile the isopropylidene carbon of bpa was also attacked and underwent beta scission generating similar intermediate f and other intermediates 4 conclusion in this study a bi functional membrane was developed using microalgal residue derived biochar as the building block the integrated mbcm aops system can continuously separate water in light oil oil in water and water in heavy oil multi phase emulsions using combined oil and water containing regions to overcome the continuous separation of multiphase emulsions simultaneously the mgbc can degrade different socs the study also assessed the performance and corresponding mechanisms involved in the separation of emulsions and soc removal through the mbcm aops system overall this study highlights a novel strategy for simultaneously separating multiphase emulsions and removing socs using a green and multifunctional biochar based membrane system this proof of concept study can further inform the design of an integrated water treatment technology to simultaneously remove insoluble and soluble organic substances from household and industrial wastewater the study also provides valuable insights about waste

16552,thauera as one of the core members of wastewater biological treatment systems plays an important role in the process of nitrogen and phosphorus removal from low carbon source sewage however there is a lack of systematic understanding of thauera s metabolic pathway and genomics here we report on the newly isolated thauera sp rt1901 which is capable of denitrification using variety carbon sources including aromatic compounds by comparing the denitrification processes under the conditions of insufficient adequate and surplus carbon sources it was found that strain rt1901 could simultaneously use soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps as electron donors for denitrification strain rt1901 was also found to be a denitrifying phosphate accumulating bacterium able to use nitrate nitrite or oxygen as electron acceptors during poly β hydroxybutyrate phb catabolism the annotated genome was used to reconstruct the complete nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism pathways of rt1901 in the process of denitrifying phosphorus accumulation glycolysis was the only pathway for glycogen metabolism and the glyoxylic acid cycle replaced the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca to supplement the reduced energy in addition the abundance of conventional phosphorus accumulating bacteria decreased significantly and the removal rates of total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod increased after the addition of rt1901 in the low carbon nitrogen c n ratio of anaerobic aerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactor aoa sbr this research indicated that the diverse metabolic capabilities of thauera made it more competitive than other bacteria in the wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thauera sp denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps genome 1 introduction in biological wastewater treatment systems the removal of pollutants is completed primarily by the microbial community the structure and function of the microbial community will determine the performance of the entire process santos et al 2020 wang and he 2020 thauera are members of the β subclass of proteobacteria as typical denitrifying bacteria they are widely present in various types of biological wastewater treatment processes huang et al 2021 thomsen et al 2007 wan et al 2019 researchers have collected activated sludge samples from 269 wwtps in 86 cities 23 countries and 6 continents thauera bacteria have been identified as one of 28 core bacterial members by deep sequencing and analysis of 16s rrna genes wu et al 2019 many studies have shown that the carbon nitrogen c n ratio in wastewater influent affects the abundance of thauera in the microbial community han et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 for example the abundance of thauera in an air flotation sequential batch reactor increased from 0 19 to 35 42 as the c n ratio decreased from 4 to 1 luo et al 2014 and the abundance of thauera in an sequencing batch reactor increased from 11 25 to 19 5 as the c n ratio decreased from 10 to 5 zhang et al 2018 in summary thauera appears to have an ecological advantage over competitors in low carbon domestic sewage treatment systems studies have investigated nearly 60 strains of thauera found in the environment and divided them into eight species since the beginning researchers have found that thauera having high ability of pollutant degradation including aromatic compounds which are generally difficult to degrade bongkeun et al 2000 shinoda et al 2004 indeed many have reported that thauera is capable of degrading various aromatic compounds and halogenated derivatives using nitrate as electron acceptor anders et al 1995 foss and harder 1998 macy et al 1993 mechichi et al 2002 scholten et al 1999 furthermore the ability of species of thauera to metabolize polyhydroxybutyrate phb to accumulate phosphate has recently been revealed sun et al 2015 wang and he 2020 these findings suggest that thauera plays an important role in the removal of c n and p from wastewater recently the role of soluble microbial products smp as electron donors to improve the efficiency of denitrification has attracted a lot of attention from scholars cao et al 2019 ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a smp are organic compounds produced by microbial metabolism during biomass degradation in biological wastewater treatment systems barker and stuckey 1999 laspidou and rittmann 2002 according to the unified theory smp can be divided into utilization related products uap and biomass related products bap bap are thought to be produced by produced by the hydrolysis of extracellular polymeric substances eps shao et al 2019 wang et al 2019b yang et al 2017 its components include proteins polysaccharides amino acids nucleic acids humic acids fulvic acid and other unknown components xie et al 2013 to date there has been no research on thauera using smp as a carbon source for denitrification yet several studies have found that the addition of thauera to a sbbr resulted in changes to the composition of eps and a significant improvement in removal efficiency of nitrogen lu et al 2019 in this study a strain of thauera isolated under laboratory conditions was studied and characterized its physiological and biochemical properties were determined and in order to understand its metabolic diversity its ability to maintain nitrogen removal related to phosphate accumulation was studied the denitrifying carbon source utilization strategy of this thauera strain was examined by providing multiple sources including external carbon sources smp and eps in addition we conducted the draft genome sequencing and annotation

at 12 000 rpm for 10 min to collect the supernatant as intracellular substance zhou et al 2017 the collected intracellular material was acidified to the final concentration of 0 6 m hydrochloric acid

determined using peterson s modification of the lowry method peterson 1977 the polysaccharides ps content was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 with glucose as the

using the mothur version v 1 30 software package the obtained 16s rrna gene sequence was deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number srp124409 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of strain rt1901 the purified bacteria were then inoculated onto lb medium containing agar and after incubating for 36 h at 30 c the morphological characteristics were observed under plate and light microscopes shown in fig 1 a colonies with regular edges had grown on the plate they were opaque ivory in color and convex with a round shape approximately 1 3 mm in diameter supplementary table s1 lists the physiological and biochemical characteristics of pure bacterial colonies according to the physiological and biochemical characteristics the pure strain was identified as a facultative anaerobic it was gram negative and spore free with polar flagella 0 5 0 7 μm 2 3 μm the partial 16s rrna gene 1470 bp of the colonies was amplified sequenced and deposited in genbank under accession number mt568559 1 the 16s rrna gene was most similar to members of the genus thauera among which it shared the highest sequence similarity 99 with thauera sp based on these results the new isolate was determined to be a novel member of the thauera genus and named rt1901 the corresponding rootless phylogenetic tree was constructed as shown in fig 1c 3 2 removal of nitrogen by strain rt1901 3 2 1 effect of environment factors on the removal of nitrogen in this study nitrate was the only nitrogen source in the denitrification medium and the c n ratio was controlled by adjusting the concentration of sodium acetate the optimal ph and temperature for denitrification by strain rt1901 were determined in an environment with a c n ratio of 10 1 as shown in fig 2 a the inorganic tn removal efficiency was more than 95 when the ph was 7 8 and 9 however the tin concentration did not change over the 30 h time period at ph 4 and 5 the acidic environments appeared to inhibit growth and reproduction while the neutral and alkaline environments were suitable for strain rt1901 which was common among denitrifying bacteria lu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b the higher ph 9 0 of the wastewater treatment system was conducive to the enrichment of thauera qian et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b the batch experiment also showed that the optimal temperature for strain rt1901 was 30 c the optimum temperature for the growth of most thauera was 35 50 c and low temperature seemed to have a great impact on its growth yu et al 2018 therefore ph and temperature were kept at 8 and 30 c respectively in the following experiments while maintaining a c n ratio of 10 1 the denitrification efficiency of strain rt1901 was studied using methyl alcohol sodium acetate glucose benzoate ethyl phenylacetate and phenol as carbon sources fig 2c showed that the highest tin removal over 36 h achieved by strain rt1901 was 98 4 using sodium acetate as a carbon source where the greatest cell growth also occurred 0 236 od600 when methyl alcohol or glucose was used as carbon sources the tin removal efficiency also exceeded 90 when benzoate phenylacetate and phenol were used as carbon sources the tin removal efficiencies after 30 h were 55 4 68 3 and 36 4 respectively these results showed that strain rt1901 could utilize a variety of aromatic compounds for denitrification which was consistent with previous studies qu et al 2016 schneider et al 1997 schühle et al 2003 fig 2d showed the tin removal efficiency of strain rt1901 under different c n ratios using only sodium acetate as the carbon source over 30 h tin removal efficiencies with c n ratios of 4 6 8 and 10 were 96 3 97 5 96 7 and 98 7 respectively in the first 12 h the removal rate of tin reached 56 1 when the c n ratio was 2 which was close to that of other c n after the carbon source was exhausted denitrification was difficult due to the lack of electron donors he et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the final effective removal rate of tin was only about 60 these results indicated that changing the c n ratio had little effect on nitrogen removal rate the c n ratio was not the determining factor for denitrification mediated by strain rt1901 this demonstrated that thauera sp rt1901 can effectively conduct denitrification at relatively low c n ratios 3 2 2 nitrogen removal rate in the batch experiments designed to determine nitrogen removal rates the ph was 8 the temperature was 30 c the carbon source was sodium acetate and the c n ratio was 3 it could be seen that the no3 n concentration decreased to 3 9 mg l after 24 h when nitrate was the sole nitrogen source fig 3 a corresponding to the rapid decrease in cod concentration the average removal rate of no3 n was 3 17 mg l h and the concentration of no2 n was consistently maintained at a low concentration when nitrite was as the sole nitrogen source fig 3b no2 n was removed completely within 16 h at a rate of 4 94 mg l h the denitrification rates by strain rt1901 measured here were higher than those of previously identified denitrifying isolates such as klebsiella pneumonia padhi et al 2013 pseudomonas stutzeri chen et al 2021 and rhodococcus sp chen et al 2012 the reduction rate was faster for no2 n than no3 n and the reduction rate of no3 n was significantly lower when nitrate and nitrite were both present fig 3c this demonstrated that strain rt1901 used electrons to preferentially perform the no2 n reduction reaction and also explained why no2 n did not accumulate fig 3a this may be attributed to the regulation of fumarate and nitrate reducing fnr protein crack et al 2016 according to the genomic analysis the strain rt1901 contains the fnr gene supplementary table s4 which is the same as that of paracoccus denitrificans bouchal et al 2010 neisseria meningitidis edwards et al 2010 and escherichia coli tolla and savageau 2010 nitrate reductase nar is strictly controlled by fnr protein at the transcriptional level fnr protein is negatively regulated by oxygen and nitrite crack et al 2016 nearly all no3 n and no2 n of three experiments were removed though the denitrification process but the time and efficiency varied the conversion rates of gaseous nitrogen reached 90 2 93 3 and 90 8 for the three experiments the final tn was less than 10 of the initial tn in all systems which was lower than that of other denitrifying bacteria in previous studies boltyanskaya et al 2007 fan et al 2021 lang et al 2020 this finding suggested that the removal of nitrogen by strain rt1901 depended mainly on the denitrification pathway 3 2 3 eps smp as electron donors for denitrification fig 4 a showed the changes in organic carbon and nitrogen pollutants when the influent sodium acetate concentration was adjusted to an insufficient level 200 mg l of sodium acetate 80 mg l of no3 n for denitrification as sodium acetate was metabolized the concentration of smp and eps increased gradually and uap became the main smp jiang et al 2010 ni et al 2010 four hours from hours 8 to 12 before sodium acetate depletion the concentrations of sodium acetate and smp decreased by 47 14 mg l and 14 13 mgcod l respectively this indicated that strain rt1901 was able to simultaneously utilize uap and influent organic carbon as electron donors jiang et al 2008 further experiments adjusted the carbon source just enough to sustain denitrification 310 mg l of sodium acetate c n ratio of 3 as shown in fig 4b after 16 h sodium acetate had been completely depleted the no3 n concentration had decreased to 20 3 mg l and no2 n and nh4 n had not accumulated but the smp and eps concentrations had increased to 36 5 and 74 6 mgcod l respectively subsequently bacteria shifted from the substrate metabolism and entered the endogenous metabolic stage during which the production of smp mainly came from bap produced via eps hydrolysis yang et al 2016 with decreases of smp and eps to 5 4 and 33 8 mgcod l respectively the concentration of no3 n in the medium also gradually decreased to 2 1 mg l there was no obvious accumulation of smp which indicated that bap was a suitable found electron donor for denitrification and no external organic addition was required yang et al 2017 this proved that the utilization of smp and eps as carbon sources for denitrification could reach at least 25 6 when the c n ratio was 3 in another treatment an excessive amount of sodium acetate was made available for use as electron donors for denitrification 620 mg l of sodium acetate c n ratio of 6 shown in fig 4c the concentrations of no3 n and sodium acetate decreased to 2 1 and 194 3 mg l respectively after 20 h with excessive sodium acetate both smp and eps increased steadily at the rate of 2 13 and 3 94 mgcod l 1 h 1 respectively ps pn and humic acid are the most common components in smp and eps cao et al 2019 niu et al 2021 this study focused on the changes of pn and ps in the denitrification experiment due to the low detected levels of humic acid as shown in fig 4f when there was an abundant external carbon source pn and ps accumulated over time after 32 h the concentrations of ps and pn in smp reached 15 1 mg l and 29 8 mg l respectively this indicated that the uap of this thauera strain was mainly composed of pn during denitrification the results of lb eps and tb eps were opposite to those of uap the pn of lb eps and tb eps decreased after inorganic nitrogen depletion indicating that the bacteria preferentially used the organic nitrogen in eps as a supplementary nitrogen source this was consistent with the behavior of acinetobacter sp fyf8 fan et al 2021 as shown in fig 4e when sodium acetate had been exhausted 16 h the ps and pn in smp had reached 14 3 mg l and 23 1 mg l respectively and the ps in lb eps and tb eps peaked at 22 3 mg l and 32 5 mg l respectively this indicated that ps constituted the main component of eps during the exogenous metabolic stage which was consistent with the trends in fig 4f in the endogenous respiration stage 16 32 h ps and pn in smp decreased to 4 5 mg l and 2 3 mg l respectively which indicated that ps and pn in uap and bap could serve as effective electron donors for denitrification the pn in bap appeared to be more easily degraded than ps which was also shown in fig 4d however the pn in lb eps and tb eps accumulated along the same timeline reaching their peaks 24 5 mg l and 26 3 mg l respectively at 24 h this indicated that ps was more biodegradable than pn in eps and preferentially hydrolyzed to smp during the endogenous denitrification stage the concentration of pn in eps was accumulated which indicated it was more closely related to cell synthesis 3 2 4 denitrifying phosphate accumulation in previous experiments the accumulation of poly p and phb particles within strain rt1901 was demonstrated using granule staining further experiments confirmed that strain rt1901 absorbed extracellular phosphate during phb catabolism as shown in fig 5 during sodium acetate catabolism under anaerobic conditions the intracellular phb concentration increased from 5 89 7 22 mg l to peak around 18 03 22 89 mg l meanwhile the intracellular glycogen concentration decreased from 13 11 14 78 mg l to 4 15 4 89 mg l and the extracellular phosphate concentration increased from 5 89 6 22 mg l to 21 11 23 45 mg l after adding nitrate nitrite or oxygen the absorption of phosphate was measured revealing a decrease in phosphate concentration to 1 11 1 87 mg l the phosphate concentration in the blank group shown in fig 5d did not decrease members of the candidate genus accumulibacter are thought to be the main functional group responsible for removal of phosphates from wastewater kotlyarov et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 this study showed that nitrate nitrite and oxygen can be used as electron acceptors by strain rt1901 during phosphate accumulation so the roles of traditional paos in the removal of phosphates would have to be reconsidered hu et al 2002 liu et al 2019 3 3 whole genome sequencing 3 3 1 genome features the detailed results using third generation sequencing data filtering are shown in supplementary table s2 after nanopore sequencing of the thauera sp rt1901 genome the complete genome sequence of rt1901 revealed a 5 mbp circular chromosome with 65 38 gc content supplementary table s3 and fig 6 the circular chromosome contained 4642 predicted cdss with coding intensities of 99 30 a total of 121 rna genes including 12 rrna 62 trna and 47 ncrna were found in the circular chromosome the complete genome sequence of rt1901 has been deposited in the ncbi database accession number srr12011546 according to the go database annotation genes were mainly distributed in 4 functional categories catalytic activity binding metabolic process and cellular process supplementary fig s1 by ncbi cog mapping 3301 proteins were assigned to cog categories supplementary fig s2 of which general functional prediction only had the highest number of genes 469 that were not unambiguously assigned to a particular group this was followed by replication recombination and repair 334 and amino acid transport and metabolism 295 as the most gene rich classes in the cog groupings 295 genes involved in energy production and conversion were identified these findings were consistent with the previously studied secondary metabolites of rt1901 3 3 2 metabolic reconstruction the annotation of the thauera sp rt1901 genome showed that many of its genes were involved in central metabolic pathways these pathways include the glycolysis gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle glyoxylate cycle and polyphosphate metabolism supplementary table s4 thauera sp rt1901 had genes key to inorganic phosphorus trans membrane transport including the low affinity inorganic phosphate transport system pit and high affinity phosphate abc transport system pst sengottaiyan et al 2013 strain rt1901 also had genes related to polyphosphate metabolism including polyphosphate kinase 1 ppk 1 exophosphatase ppx zhang et al 2019b polyphosphate amp phosphotransferase pap ishige and noguchi 2000 and adenylate kinase adk brune et al 1985 these observations suggested that strain rt1901 had numerous components of the polyphosphate metabolic machinery during the anaerobic stage the intracellular polyphosphate was degraded to pi which was transported out of the cell using proton power to generate energy and support the substrate absorption subsequently during the aerobic phase the internal polyphosphate stores were supplemented by the large amount of pi absorbed from the external environment martín et al 2006 anaerobically acetyl coa was converted to pha containing phb phv ph2mv by reducing an equivalent amount of nad p h provided by glycogen degradation the mino model or the tca cycle the comeau wentzel model comeau et al 1986 mino et al 1998 glycogen degradation through the embden meyerhof parnas emp or the entner doudoroff ed pathways has been long debated the genome sequence of strain rt1901 unambiguously indicated that the emp pathway was being employed because the key gene ec 4 1 2 21 in the ed pathway was absent according to the pereira model glycolysis only provides 70 of the reduction power for pha synthesis and the remaining reduction power is supplemented by the tca pathway however the anaerobic operation mode of the tca cycle has also always been controversial three anaerobic tca cycle modes have been proposed including the complete mode comeau et al 1986 glyoxylic acid diversion mode louie et al 2000 and splitting mode hesselmann et al 2000 however in complete mode the flavin adenine dinucleotide fadh2 produced by succinate dehydrogenase sdh needs to be reoxidized to realize the continued operation of the tca cycle martín et al 2006 proposed a novel cytochrome b b6 that can serve as an electron acceptor to complete the oxidation of fadh2 thus realizing the anaerobic tca cycle in this study no genes related to the synthesis of cytochrome b b6 were found at the same time the absence of the gene encoding pyruvate carboxylase ec 6 4 1 1 in strain rt1901 genome made it unlikely that the tca cycle used the splitting mode therefore the glyoxylate cycle and glycolysis likely provided the reduction equivalent for pha production in thauera sp rt1901 the specific metabolic pathway is shown in fig 7 a aerobically as shown in fig 7b the pha stored in cells was metabolized into acetyl coa and succinyl coa by poly 3 hydroxyalkanoate depolymerase these subsequently entered the tca cycle to produce nadh and fadh2 complex i nadh dehydrogenase consisted of 14 subunits nuoabcdefghijklmn ec 7 1 1 2 that can transfer electrons from nadh to ubiquinol uq the transfer of each electron pair can displace four protons on the membrane which means the reduction of uq can consume two protons from the cytoplasm yip et al 2011 complex ⅱ succinate dehydrogenase sdhabcd ec 1 3 5 1 can transfer electrons from fadh2 to uq tropeano et al 2018 the function of complex ⅲ quinol cytochrome bc1 reductase ec 7 1 1 8 was to transfer electrons from uqh2 in the cell membrane to cytochrome c in the periplasm the protons released from the oxidation of uqh2 exist in a free state form in the periplasm and cytochrome c reductase can initiate the q cycle to conduct trans membrane proton conduction berry et al 2000 the function of complex ⅳ cytochrome c oxidase ec 7 1 1 9 was to transfer electrons from cytochrome to oxygen which required the consumption of four protons from the cytoplasm svensson ek et al 2002 the dynamic potential of protons produced by the respiratory chain was used to synthesize atp f1f0 atpase ec 7 1 2 2 and absorb pi pit the synthesized atp was used to transport pi and synthesize polyphosphate pst martín et al 2006 at the same time the glyoxylate cycle and phv metabolism were used to accumulate oxaloacetate which was used in the gluconeogenesis pathway to produce glycogen he and mcmahon 2011 in the basic respiratory pathway strain rt1901 had periplasmic nitrate reductase nap nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos which together could realize complete denitrification the gene encoding periplasmic nitrate reductase napfdaghbc has been shown to play a key role in aerobic denitrification bell and ferguson 1991 compared to nitrate reductase narhij the inhibition of nap by dissolved oxygen was weak allowing it to compete for electrons under aerobic conditions and catalyze nitrate reduction jacques et al 2014 subsequently nitrite reductase nirs nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz could then accept the electrons provided by cytochrome c to complete the denitrification process in conclusion thauera sp rt1901 was able to absorb extracellular phosphorus and synthesize polyphosphate under aerobic conditions through nitrate respiration in addition we found that the genome of strain rt1901 contained genes central to amino acid metabolism sugar metabolism and fatty acid metabolism as well as the complete pathway for metabolizing aromatic compounds to acetyl coa and pyruvate supplementary table s4 supplementary fig s3 this supported the conclusion in previous experiments that bacteria use smp and eps for denitrification because amino acids proteins polysaccharides and humic acids were the most common components in smp the ability of strain rt1901 to metabolize aromatic compounds also enables them to occupy a wider niche than other bacteria 3 4 enhanced removal of nitrogen and phosphate in the sbr by thauera 3 4 1 long term sbr nutrient removal performance fig 8 and supplementary table s5 present the influent and effluent pollutant concentrations and removal efficiencies for the different aoa sbr system operating periods the c n ratio during phase ⅰ was 5 5 during phase ⅱ it was 4 5 during phase ⅲ it was 3 5 and in phase ⅳ thauera sp rt1901 was added the average cod removal efficiencies of stable stage from phase ⅰ to phase ⅳ were 82 67 81 57 82 55 and 88 67 respectively the cod removal rate had no obvious change with decreased influent c n ratio while the addition of thauera sp rt1901 significantly increased the cod removal rate which resulted in the maximum cod removal rate the cod removal loading rates in this study were 0 2754 0 2993 0 2977 0 3134 0 3167 and 0 3187 gl 1 d 1 from phases ⅲ to ⅳ the cod removal loading rates of activated sludge showed an increasing trend with the addition of thauera sp rt1901 these results indicated that the addition of strain rt1901 highly benefitted cod removal within the system this may be related to the resulting decrease of smp in the wastewater zhang et al 2019a the c n ratio of the influent greatly influenced the tn removal efficiencies as shown in fig 8c and supplementary table s5 the average tn removal efficiencies of the stable stages were 77 09 75 38 and 71 19 for phases ⅰ to ⅲ with decreased influent carbon no2 n did not accumulate and no3 n represented the majority of the inorganic tn in the effluent the tn removal rate increased to 77 71 after strain rt1901 was added meanwhile the aerobic removal rates of tn in this study were 1 43 3 11 8 22 and 14 22 mg g 1mlvss d 1 from phase ⅰ to ⅳ respectively based on the data of the first three phases it seemed that the decreased c n ratio was more conducive to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification from the data of the first three phases jia et al 2020 the aerobic removal rate of tn increased 1 73 folds after strain rt1901 was added which may have been related to its function in denitrifying phosphorus removal wang and he 2020 compared to the values of phase ⅰ the nox n anoxic removal rates during phases ⅱ and ⅲ were reduced by 26 34 and 56 62 respectively compared to the values of phase ⅲ the nox n anoxic removal rate during phase ⅳ was 50 46 higher apparently because strain rt1901 enhanced the denitrification activity in the anoxic environment which may have been related to the availability of smp and eps as electron donors zhang et al 2019a as shown in fig 8d the average tp removal efficiencies of the stable stages from phases ⅰ to ⅳ were 82 33 97 62 95 51 and 98 28 respectively the results showed that aoa sbr was more conducive to enhanced phosphorus removal which was consistent with previous studies kishida et al 2006 liu et al 2020 strain rt1901 was added in phase ⅳ which enhanced the denitrification performance without affecting the phosphorus removal efficiency this was due to the denitrifying phosphorus removal capacity of strain rt1901 the anaerobic release rate of tp and aerobic anoxic removal rate of tp were increased during phase iv consistent with the above results 3 4 2 pollutant removal during typical system operation the typical operational periods of phase 3 and 4 are shown in fig 9 both of which show a degree of no3 n accumulation which was mainly due to the particularity of aoa sbr process and low influent c n ratio the aoa sbr system was more inclined to strengthen phosphorus removal and the main way of nitrogen removal was denitrifying phosphorus removal in the aerobic stage liu and li 2015 the influent c n ratio was 3 5 which was far lower than the previous study liu et al 2020 have studied the ability of an aoa sbr system to remove c n and p from municipal wastewater wherein their influent c n ratio was controlled at about 10 liu et al 2020 liu and li 2015 the main purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of thauera on aoa sbr system under low carbon operating conditions the addition of strain rt1901 significantly reduced the concentrations of cod and no3 n fig 9b showed that the nh4 n concentrations before and after the aerobic stage were 24 1 and 0 7 mg l respectively with corresponding nox n concentrations of 0 21 and 15 9 mg l based on the common n balance the results showed the degree of n loss during the aerobic stage zimmo et al 2004 the difference between nh4 n consumption and nox n production during phase ⅳ was 7 72 mg l which was 4 12 mg l greater than that during phase ⅲ these results showed that the addition of strain rt1901 promoted simultaneous nitrification and denitrification during the anoxic stage the differences in nox n concentrations increased from 3 76 mg l in phase ⅲ to 6 89 mg l in phase ⅳ and the difference between of cod concentrations increased from 9 34 mg l to 13 4 mg l this also indicated that strain rt1901 enrichment enhanced the utilization of smp and eps as carbon sources for denitrification in the system 3 4 3 biodiversity and distribution of microbial communities sludge samples for high throughput pyrosequencing analysis were collected upon completion of the aeration stage on days 1 80 100 120 140 160 and 180 of reactor operation the sequencing results have been deposited in the ncbi database accession number sub8845515 species richness and diversity estimators including otus chao1 shannon simpson ace and coverage were calculated as summarized in supplementary table s6 the coverage indices of all seven samples were greater than 0 99 which indicated the sequencing results reflected the actual condition of the samples the number of otus obtained from the seven samples was 593 477 496 486 565 556 and 571 respectively the microbial community structure at the phylum level is shown in fig 10 a proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi nitrospirae actinobacteria and acidobacteria were abundant in all samples the sum of these six phyla accounted for 95 67 94 48 93 59 92 40 93 51 92 77 and 83 31 of the bacterial community in the samples from days 1 through 180 respectively these six phyla have been commonly found in activated sludge and usually show good organic matter degradation abilities and nitrogen phosphate removal performances linwei wu 2019 wang et al 2016 the total percentage of the bacterial community represented by these six phyla remained essentially unchanged in the seven samples but notable changes within each phyla were detected this indicated that enrichment by strain rt1901 significantly affected the microbial community structure of activated sludge in the reactor the taxonomic diversity at the genus level is shown in fig 10b after the addition of strain rt1901 the relative abundance of thauera from day 140 to day 180 increased from 1 4 2 48 to 4 72 8 86 candidatus competibacter decreased from 9 11 18 55 to 4 73 7 19 candidatus accumulibacter decreased from 12 12 18 83 to 3 76 5 71 and zoogloea decreased from 6 58 10 79 to 2 31 8 08 these changes were related to the ability of strain rt1901 to remove nitrogen and phosphorus which gave it a wider niche in these experiments strain rt1901 was able to use oxygen no3 n and no2 n as electron acceptors to consume phb for phosphorus accumulation this allowed strain rt1901 to outcompete the traditional phosphate accumulating bacteria in the low dissolved oxygen environment wang et al 2015 meanwhile smp and eps were used as electron donors for denitrification which further enhanced the competitiveness of rt1901 relative to other denitrifying bacteria such as zoogloea at low c n ratios the relative abundance of nitrospira increased from 1 00 1 85 to 7 53 13 84 which demonstrated that as traditional phosphate accumulating bacteria were reduced more do was made available for nitrification iannacone et al 2021 4 conclusion the novel thauera sp rt1901 was isolated from a waste water treatment plant and its abilities to perform denitrification and phosphate accumulation were examined the strain rt1901 used pha for nitrate respiration and to absorb extracellular phosphate and it was also able to use smp and eps as an electron donor for denitrification analysis of the whole genome confirmed the presence of the metabolic pathway for denitrifying phosphorus removal and provided insight into this species diversity of metabolic mechanisms for utilizing refractory substances moreover the removal efficiencies of tn and cod were clearly enhanced when rt1901 was added to an aoa sbr with low carbon availability as the abundance of thauera sp rt1901 in the microbial community increased while the abundances of conventional phosphorus accumulating bacteria significantly decreased this work revealed that the ecological advantages of thauera were related to its diversity of

16552,thauera as one of the core members of wastewater biological treatment systems plays an important role in the process of nitrogen and phosphorus removal from low carbon source sewage however there is a lack of systematic understanding of thauera s metabolic pathway and genomics here we report on the newly isolated thauera sp rt1901 which is capable of denitrification using variety carbon sources including aromatic compounds by comparing the denitrification processes under the conditions of insufficient adequate and surplus carbon sources it was found that strain rt1901 could simultaneously use soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps as electron donors for denitrification strain rt1901 was also found to be a denitrifying phosphate accumulating bacterium able to use nitrate nitrite or oxygen as electron acceptors during poly β hydroxybutyrate phb catabolism the annotated genome was used to reconstruct the complete nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism pathways of rt1901 in the process of denitrifying phosphorus accumulation glycolysis was the only pathway for glycogen metabolism and the glyoxylic acid cycle replaced the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca to supplement the reduced energy in addition the abundance of conventional phosphorus accumulating bacteria decreased significantly and the removal rates of total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod increased after the addition of rt1901 in the low carbon nitrogen c n ratio of anaerobic aerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactor aoa sbr this research indicated that the diverse metabolic capabilities of thauera made it more competitive than other bacteria in the wastewater treatment system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords thauera sp denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos soluble microbial products smp extracellular polymeric substances eps genome 1 introduction in biological wastewater treatment systems the removal of pollutants is completed primarily by the microbial community the structure and function of the microbial community will determine the performance of the entire process santos et al 2020 wang and he 2020 thauera are members of the β subclass of proteobacteria as typical denitrifying bacteria they are widely present in various types of biological wastewater treatment processes huang et al 2021 thomsen et al 2007 wan et al 2019 researchers have collected activated sludge samples from 269 wwtps in 86 cities 23 countries and 6 continents thauera bacteria have been identified as one of 28 core bacterial members by deep sequencing and analysis of 16s rrna genes wu et al 2019 many studies have shown that the carbon nitrogen c n ratio in wastewater influent affects the abundance of thauera in the microbial community han et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 for example the abundance of thauera in an air flotation sequential batch reactor increased from 0 19 to 35 42 as the c n ratio decreased from 4 to 1 luo et al 2014 and the abundance of thauera in an sequencing batch reactor increased from 11 25 to 19 5 as the c n ratio decreased from 10 to 5 zhang et al 2018 in summary thauera appears to have an ecological advantage over competitors in low carbon domestic sewage treatment systems studies have investigated nearly 60 strains of thauera found in the environment and divided them into eight species since the beginning researchers have found that thauera having high ability of pollutant degradation including aromatic compounds which are generally difficult to degrade bongkeun et al 2000 shinoda et al 2004 indeed many have reported that thauera is capable of degrading various aromatic compounds and halogenated derivatives using nitrate as electron acceptor anders et al 1995 foss and harder 1998 macy et al 1993 mechichi et al 2002 scholten et al 1999 furthermore the ability of species of thauera to metabolize polyhydroxybutyrate phb to accumulate phosphate has recently been revealed sun et al 2015 wang and he 2020 these findings suggest that thauera plays an important role in the removal of c n and p from wastewater recently the role of soluble microbial products smp as electron donors to improve the efficiency of denitrification has attracted a lot of attention from scholars cao et al 2019 ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a smp are organic compounds produced by microbial metabolism during biomass degradation in biological wastewater treatment systems barker and stuckey 1999 laspidou and rittmann 2002 according to the unified theory smp can be divided into utilization related products uap and biomass related products bap bap are thought to be produced by produced by the hydrolysis of extracellular polymeric substances eps shao et al 2019 wang et al 2019b yang et al 2017 its components include proteins polysaccharides amino acids nucleic acids humic acids fulvic acid and other unknown components xie et al 2013 to date there has been no research on thauera using smp as a carbon source for denitrification yet several studies have found that the addition of thauera to a sbbr resulted in changes to the composition of eps and a significant improvement in removal efficiency of nitrogen lu et al 2019 in this study a strain of thauera isolated under laboratory conditions was studied and characterized its physiological and biochemical properties were determined and in order to understand its metabolic diversity its ability to maintain nitrogen removal related to phosphate accumulation was studied the denitrifying carbon source utilization strategy of this thauera strain was examined by providing multiple sources including external carbon sources smp and eps in addition we conducted the draft genome sequencing and annotation

identification of strain rt1901 the purified bacteria were then inoculated onto lb medium containing agar and after incubating for 36 h at 30 c the morphological characteristics were observed under plate and light microscopes shown in fig 1 a colonies with regular edges had grown on the plate they were opaque ivory in color and convex with a round shape approximately 1 3 mm in diameter supplementary table s1 lists the physiological and biochemical characteristics of pure bacterial colonies according to the physiological and biochemical characteristics the pure strain was identified as a facultative anaerobic it was gram negative and spore free with polar flagella 0 5 0 7 μm 2 3 μm the partial 16s rrna gene 1470 bp of the colonies was amplified sequenced and deposited in genbank under accession number mt568559 1 the 16s rrna gene was most similar to members of the genus thauera among which it shared the highest sequence similarity 99 with thauera sp based on these results the new isolate was determined to be a novel member of the thauera genus and named rt1901 the corresponding rootless phylogenetic tree was constructed as shown in fig 1c 3 2 removal of nitrogen by strain rt1901 3 2 1 effect of environment factors on the removal of nitrogen in this study nitrate was the only nitrogen source in the denitrification medium and the c n ratio was controlled by adjusting the concentration of sodium acetate the optimal ph and temperature for denitrification by strain rt1901 were determined in an environment with a c n ratio of 10 1 as shown in fig 2 a the inorganic tn removal efficiency was more than 95 when the ph was 7 8 and 9 however the tin concentration did not change over the 30 h time period at ph 4 and 5 the acidic environments appeared to inhibit growth and reproduction while the neutral and alkaline environments were suitable for strain rt1901 which was common among denitrifying bacteria lu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b the higher ph 9 0 of the wastewater treatment system was conducive to the enrichment of thauera qian et al 2019 as shown in fig 2b the batch experiment also showed that the optimal temperature for strain rt1901 was 30 c the optimum temperature for the growth of most thauera was 35 50 c and low temperature seemed to have a great impact on its growth yu et al 2018 therefore ph and temperature were kept at 8 and 30 c respectively in the following experiments while maintaining a c n ratio of 10 1 the denitrification efficiency of strain rt1901 was studied using methyl alcohol sodium acetate glucose benzoate ethyl phenylacetate and phenol as carbon sources fig 2c showed that the highest tin removal over 36 h achieved by strain rt1901 was 98 4 using sodium acetate as a carbon source where the greatest cell growth also occurred 0 236 od600 when methyl alcohol or glucose was used as carbon sources the tin removal efficiency also exceeded 90 when benzoate phenylacetate and phenol were used as carbon sources the tin removal efficiencies after 30 h were 55 4 68 3 and 36 4 respectively these results showed that strain rt1901 could utilize a variety of aromatic compounds for denitrification which was consistent with previous studies qu et al 2016 schneider et al 1997 schühle et al 2003 fig 2d showed the tin removal efficiency of strain rt1901 under different c n ratios using only sodium acetate as the carbon source over 30 h tin removal efficiencies with c n ratios of 4 6 8 and 10 were 96 3 97 5 96 7 and 98 7 respectively in the first 12 h the removal rate of tin reached 56 1 when the c n ratio was 2 which was close to that of other c n after the carbon source was exhausted denitrification was difficult due to the lack of electron donors he et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the final effective removal rate of tin was only about 60 these results indicated that changing the c n ratio had little effect on nitrogen removal rate the c n ratio was not the determining factor for denitrification mediated by strain rt1901 this demonstrated that thauera sp rt1901 can effectively conduct denitrification at relatively low c n ratios 3 2 2 nitrogen removal rate in the batch experiments designed to determine nitrogen removal rates the ph was 8 the temperature was 30 c the carbon source was sodium acetate and the c n ratio was 3 it could be seen that the no3 n concentration decreased to 3 9 mg l after 24 h when nitrate was the sole nitrogen source fig 3 a corresponding to the rapid decrease in cod concentration the average removal rate of no3 n was 3 17 mg l h and the concentration of no2 n was consistently maintained at a low concentration when nitrite was as the sole nitrogen source fig 3b no2 n was removed completely within 16 h at a rate of 4 94 mg l h the denitrification rates by strain rt1901 measured here were higher than those of previously identified denitrifying isolates such as klebsiella pneumonia padhi et al 2013 pseudomonas stutzeri chen et al 2021 and rhodococcus sp chen et al 2012 the reduction rate was faster for no2 n than no3 n and the reduction rate of no3 n was significantly lower when nitrate and nitrite were both present fig 3c this demonstrated that strain rt1901 used electrons to preferentially perform the no2 n reduction reaction and also explained why no2 n did not accumulate fig 3a this may be attributed to the regulation of fumarate and nitrate reducing fnr protein crack et al 2016 according to the genomic analysis the strain rt1901 contains the fnr gene supplementary table s4 which is the same as that of paracoccus denitrificans bouchal et al 2010 neisseria meningitidis edwards et al 2010 and escherichia coli tolla and savageau 2010 nitrate reductase nar is strictly controlled by fnr protein at the transcriptional level fnr protein is negatively regulated by oxygen and nitrite crack et al 2016 nearly all no3 n and no2 n of three experiments were removed though the denitrification process but the time and efficiency varied the conversion rates of gaseous nitrogen reached 90 2 93 3 and 90 8 for the three experiments the final tn was less than 10 of the initial tn in all systems which was lower than that of other denitrifying bacteria in previous studies boltyanskaya et al 2007 fan et al 2021 lang et al 2020 this finding suggested that the removal of nitrogen by strain rt1901 depended mainly on the denitrification pathway 3 2 3 eps smp as electron donors for denitrification fig 4 a showed the changes in organic carbon and nitrogen pollutants when the influent sodium acetate concentration was adjusted to an insufficient level 200 mg l of sodium acetate 80 mg l of no3 n for denitrification as sodium acetate was metabolized the concentration of smp and eps increased gradually and uap became the main smp jiang et al 2010 ni et al 2010 four hours from hours 8 to 12 before sodium acetate depletion the concentrations of sodium acetate and smp decreased by 47 14 mg l and 14 13 mgcod l respectively this indicated that strain rt1901 was able to simultaneously utilize uap and influent organic carbon as electron donors jiang et al 2008 further experiments adjusted the carbon source just enough to sustain denitrification 310 mg l of sodium acetate c n ratio of 3 as shown in fig 4b after 16 h sodium acetate had been completely depleted the no3 n concentration had decreased to 20 3 mg l and no2 n and nh4 n had not accumulated but the smp and eps concentrations had increased to 36 5 and 74 6 mgcod l respectively subsequently bacteria shifted from the substrate metabolism and entered the endogenous metabolic stage during which the production of smp mainly came from bap produced via eps hydrolysis yang et al 2016 with decreases of smp and eps to 5 4 and 33 8 mgcod l respectively the concentration of no3 n in the medium also gradually decreased to 2 1 mg l there was no obvious accumulation of smp which indicated that bap was a suitable found electron donor for denitrification and no external organic addition was required yang et al 2017 this proved that the utilization of smp and eps as carbon sources for denitrification could reach at least 25 6 when the c n ratio was 3 in another treatment an excessive amount of sodium acetate was made available for use as electron donors for denitrification 620 mg l of sodium acetate c n ratio of 6 shown in fig 4c the concentrations of no3 n and sodium acetate decreased to 2 1 and 194 3 mg l respectively after 20 h with excessive sodium acetate both smp and eps increased steadily at the rate of 2 13 and 3 94 mgcod l 1 h 1 respectively ps pn and humic acid are the most common components in smp and eps cao et al 2019 niu et al 2021 this study focused on the changes of pn and ps in the denitrification experiment due to the low detected levels of humic acid as shown in fig 4f when there was an abundant external carbon source pn and ps accumulated over time after 32 h the concentrations of ps and pn in smp reached 15 1 mg l and 29 8 mg l respectively this indicated that the uap of this thauera strain was mainly composed of pn during denitrification the results of lb eps and tb eps were opposite to those of uap the pn of lb eps and tb eps decreased after inorganic nitrogen depletion indicating that the bacteria preferentially used the organic nitrogen in eps as a supplementary nitrogen source this was consistent with the behavior of acinetobacter sp fyf8 fan et al 2021 as shown in fig 4e when sodium acetate had been exhausted 16 h the ps and pn in smp had reached 14 3 mg l and 23 1 mg l respectively and the ps in lb eps and tb eps peaked at 22 3 mg l and 32 5 mg l respectively this indicated that ps constituted the main component of eps during the exogenous metabolic stage which was consistent with the trends in fig 4f in the endogenous respiration stage 16 32 h ps and pn in smp decreased to 4 5 mg l and 2 3 mg l respectively which indicated that ps and pn in uap and bap could serve as effective electron donors for denitrification the pn in bap appeared to be more easily degraded than ps which was also shown in fig 4d however the pn in lb eps and tb eps accumulated along the same timeline reaching their peaks 24 5 mg l and 26 3 mg l respectively at 24 h this indicated that ps was more biodegradable than pn in eps and preferentially hydrolyzed to smp during the endogenous denitrification stage the concentration of pn in eps was accumulated which indicated it was more closely related to cell synthesis 3 2 4 denitrifying phosphate accumulation in previous experiments the accumulation of poly p and phb particles within strain rt1901 was demonstrated using granule staining further experiments confirmed that strain rt1901 absorbed extracellular phosphate during phb catabolism as shown in fig 5 during sodium acetate catabolism under anaerobic conditions the intracellular phb concentration increased from 5 89 7 22 mg l to peak around 18 03 22 89 mg l meanwhile the intracellular glycogen concentration decreased from 13 11 14 78 mg l to 4 15 4 89 mg l and the extracellular phosphate concentration increased from 5 89 6 22 mg l to 21 11 23 45 mg l after adding nitrate nitrite or oxygen the absorption of phosphate was measured revealing a decrease in phosphate concentration to 1 11 1 87 mg l the phosphate concentration in the blank group shown in fig 5d did not decrease members of the candidate genus accumulibacter are thought to be the main functional group responsible for removal of phosphates from wastewater kotlyarov et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 this study showed that nitrate nitrite and oxygen can be used as electron acceptors by strain rt1901 during phosphate accumulation so the roles of traditional paos in the removal of phosphates would have to be reconsidered hu et al 2002 liu et al 2019 3 3 whole genome sequencing 3 3 1 genome features the detailed results using third generation sequencing data filtering are shown in supplementary table s2 after nanopore sequencing of the thauera sp rt1901 genome the complete genome sequence of rt1901 revealed a 5 mbp circular chromosome with 65 38 gc content supplementary table s3 and fig 6 the circular chromosome contained 4642 predicted cdss with coding intensities of 99 30 a total of 121 rna genes including 12 rrna 62 trna and 47 ncrna were found in the circular chromosome the complete genome sequence of rt1901 has been deposited in the ncbi database accession number srr12011546 according to the go database annotation genes were mainly distributed in 4 functional categories catalytic activity binding metabolic process and cellular process supplementary fig s1 by ncbi cog mapping 3301 proteins were assigned to cog categories supplementary fig s2 of which general functional prediction only had the highest number of genes 469 that were not unambiguously assigned to a particular group this was followed by replication recombination and repair 334 and amino acid transport and metabolism 295 as the most gene rich classes in the cog groupings 295 genes involved in energy production and conversion were identified these findings were consistent with the previously studied secondary metabolites of rt1901 3 3 2 metabolic reconstruction the annotation of the thauera sp rt1901 genome showed that many of its genes were involved in central metabolic pathways these pathways include the glycolysis gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle glyoxylate cycle and polyphosphate metabolism supplementary table s4 thauera sp rt1901 had genes key to inorganic phosphorus trans membrane transport including the low affinity inorganic phosphate transport system pit and high affinity phosphate abc transport system pst sengottaiyan et al 2013 strain rt1901 also had genes related to polyphosphate metabolism including polyphosphate kinase 1 ppk 1 exophosphatase ppx zhang et al 2019b polyphosphate amp phosphotransferase pap ishige and noguchi 2000 and adenylate kinase adk brune et al 1985 these observations suggested that strain rt1901 had numerous components of the polyphosphate metabolic machinery during the anaerobic stage the intracellular polyphosphate was degraded to pi which was transported out of the cell using proton power to generate energy and support the substrate absorption subsequently during the aerobic phase the internal polyphosphate stores were supplemented by the large amount of pi absorbed from the external environment martín et al 2006 anaerobically acetyl coa was converted to pha containing phb phv ph2mv by reducing an equivalent amount of nad p h provided by glycogen degradation the mino model or the tca cycle the comeau wentzel model comeau et al 1986 mino et al 1998 glycogen degradation through the embden meyerhof parnas emp or the entner doudoroff ed pathways has been long debated the genome sequence of strain rt1901 unambiguously indicated that the emp pathway was being employed because the key gene ec 4 1 2 21 in the ed pathway was absent according to the pereira model glycolysis only provides 70 of the reduction power for pha synthesis and the remaining reduction power is supplemented by the tca pathway however the anaerobic operation mode of the tca cycle has also always been controversial three anaerobic tca cycle modes have been proposed including the complete mode comeau et al 1986 glyoxylic acid diversion mode louie et al 2000 and splitting mode hesselmann et al 2000 however in complete mode the flavin adenine dinucleotide fadh2 produced by succinate dehydrogenase sdh needs to be reoxidized to realize the continued operation of the tca cycle martín et al 2006 proposed a novel cytochrome b b6 that can serve as an electron acceptor to complete the oxidation of fadh2 thus realizing the anaerobic tca cycle in this study no genes related to the synthesis of cytochrome b b6 were found at the same time the absence of the gene encoding pyruvate carboxylase ec 6 4 1 1 in strain rt1901 genome made it unlikely that the tca cycle used the splitting mode therefore the glyoxylate cycle and glycolysis likely provided the reduction equivalent for pha production in thauera sp rt1901 the specific metabolic pathway is shown in fig 7 a aerobically as shown in fig 7b the pha stored in cells was metabolized into acetyl coa and succinyl coa by poly 3 hydroxyalkanoate depolymerase these subsequently entered the tca cycle to produce nadh and fadh2 complex i nadh dehydrogenase consisted of 14 subunits nuoabcdefghijklmn ec 7 1 1 2 that can transfer electrons from nadh to ubiquinol uq the transfer of each electron pair can displace four protons on the membrane which means the reduction of uq can consume two protons from the cytoplasm yip et al 2011 complex ⅱ succinate dehydrogenase sdhabcd ec 1 3 5 1 can transfer electrons from fadh2 to uq tropeano et al 2018 the function of complex ⅲ quinol cytochrome bc1 reductase ec 7 1 1 8 was to transfer electrons from uqh2 in the cell membrane to cytochrome c in the periplasm the protons released from the oxidation of uqh2 exist in a free state form in the periplasm and cytochrome c reductase can initiate the q cycle to conduct trans membrane proton conduction berry et al 2000 the function of complex ⅳ cytochrome c oxidase ec 7 1 1 9 was to transfer electrons from cytochrome to oxygen which required the consumption of four protons from the cytoplasm svensson ek et al 2002 the dynamic potential of protons produced by the respiratory chain was used to synthesize atp f1f0 atpase ec 7 1 2 2 and absorb pi pit the synthesized atp was used to transport pi and synthesize polyphosphate pst martín et al 2006 at the same time the glyoxylate cycle and phv metabolism were used to accumulate oxaloacetate which was used in the gluconeogenesis pathway to produce glycogen he and mcmahon 2011 in the basic respiratory pathway strain rt1901 had periplasmic nitrate reductase nap nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrous oxide reductase nos which together could realize complete denitrification the gene encoding periplasmic nitrate reductase napfdaghbc has been shown to play a key role in aerobic denitrification bell and ferguson 1991 compared to nitrate reductase narhij the inhibition of nap by dissolved oxygen was weak allowing it to compete for electrons under aerobic conditions and catalyze nitrate reduction jacques et al 2014 subsequently nitrite reductase nirs nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz could then accept the electrons provided by cytochrome c to complete the denitrification process in conclusion thauera sp rt1901 was able to absorb extracellular phosphorus and synthesize polyphosphate under aerobic conditions through nitrate respiration in addition we found that the genome of strain rt1901 contained genes central to amino acid metabolism sugar metabolism and fatty acid metabolism as well as the complete pathway for metabolizing aromatic compounds to acetyl coa and pyruvate supplementary table s4 supplementary fig s3 this supported the conclusion in previous experiments that bacteria use smp and eps for denitrification because amino acids proteins polysaccharides and humic acids were the most common components in smp the ability of strain rt1901 to metabolize aromatic compounds also enables them to occupy a wider niche than other bacteria 3 4 enhanced removal of nitrogen and phosphate in the sbr by thauera 3 4 1 long term sbr nutrient removal performance fig 8 and supplementary table s5 present the influent and effluent pollutant concentrations and removal efficiencies for the different aoa sbr system operating periods the c n ratio during phase ⅰ was 5 5 during phase ⅱ it was 4 5 during phase ⅲ it was 3 5 and in phase ⅳ thauera sp rt1901 was added the average cod removal efficiencies of stable stage from phase ⅰ to phase ⅳ were 82 67 81 57 82 55 and 88 67 respectively the cod removal rate had no obvious change with decreased influent c n ratio while the addition of thauera sp rt1901 significantly increased the cod removal rate which resulted in the maximum cod removal rate the cod removal loading rates in this study were 0 2754 0 2993 0 2977 0 3134 0 3167 and 0 3187 gl 1 d 1 from phases ⅲ to ⅳ the cod removal loading rates of activated sludge showed an increasing trend with the addition of thauera sp rt1901 these results indicated that the addition of strain rt1901 highly benefitted cod removal within the system this may be related to the resulting decrease of smp in the wastewater zhang et al 2019a the c n ratio of the influent greatly influenced the tn removal efficiencies as shown in fig 8c and supplementary table s5 the average tn removal efficiencies of the stable stages were 77 09 75 38 and 71 19 for phases ⅰ to ⅲ with decreased influent carbon no2 n did not accumulate and no3 n represented the majority of the inorganic tn in the effluent the tn removal rate increased to 77 71 after strain rt1901 was added meanwhile the aerobic removal rates of tn in this study were 1 43 3 11 8 22 and 14 22 mg g 1mlvss d 1 from phase ⅰ to ⅳ respectively based on the data of the first three phases it seemed that the decreased c n ratio was more conducive to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification from the data of the first three phases jia et al 2020 the aerobic removal rate of tn increased 1 73 folds after strain rt1901 was added which may have been related to its function in denitrifying phosphorus removal wang and he 2020 compared to the values of phase ⅰ the nox n anoxic removal rates during phases ⅱ and ⅲ were reduced by 26 34 and 56 62 respectively compared to the values of phase ⅲ the nox n anoxic removal rate during phase ⅳ was 50 46 higher apparently because strain rt1901 enhanced the denitrification activity in the anoxic environment which may have been related to the availability of smp and eps as electron donors zhang et al 2019a as shown in fig 8d the average tp removal efficiencies of the stable stages from phases ⅰ to ⅳ were 82 33 97 62 95 51 and 98 28 respectively the results showed that aoa sbr was more conducive to enhanced phosphorus removal which was consistent with previous studies kishida et al 2006 liu et al 2020 strain rt1901 was added in phase ⅳ which enhanced the denitrification performance without affecting the phosphorus removal efficiency this was due to the denitrifying phosphorus removal capacity of strain rt1901 the anaerobic release rate of tp and aerobic anoxic removal rate of tp were increased during phase iv consistent with the above results 3 4 2 pollutant removal during typical system operation the typical operational periods of phase 3 and 4 are shown in fig 9 both of which show a degree of no3 n accumulation which was mainly due to the particularity of aoa sbr process and low influent c n ratio the aoa sbr system was more inclined to strengthen phosphorus removal and the main way of nitrogen removal was denitrifying phosphorus removal in the aerobic stage liu and li 2015 the influent c n ratio was 3 5 which was far lower than the previous study liu et al 2020 have studied the ability of an aoa sbr system to remove c n and p from municipal wastewater wherein their influent c n ratio was controlled at about 10 liu et al 2020 liu and li 2015 the main purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of thauera on aoa sbr system under low carbon operating conditions the addition of strain rt1901 significantly reduced the concentrations of cod and no3 n fig 9b showed that the nh4 n concentrations before and after the aerobic stage were 24 1 and 0 7 mg l respectively with corresponding nox n concentrations of 0 21 and 15 9 mg l based on the common n balance the results showed the degree of n loss during the aerobic stage zimmo et al 2004 the difference between nh4 n consumption and nox n production during phase ⅳ was 7 72 mg l which was 4 12 mg l greater than that during phase ⅲ these results showed that the addition of strain rt1901 promoted simultaneous nitrification and denitrification during the anoxic stage the differences in nox n concentrations increased from 3 76 mg l in phase ⅲ to 6 89 mg l in phase ⅳ and the difference between of cod concentrations increased from 9 34 mg l to 13 4 mg l this also indicated that strain rt1901 enrichment enhanced the utilization of smp and eps as carbon sources for denitrification in the system 3 4 3 biodiversity and distribution of microbial communities sludge samples for high throughput pyrosequencing analysis were collected upon completion of the aeration stage on days 1 80 100 120 140 160 and 180 of reactor operation the sequencing results have been deposited in the ncbi database accession number sub8845515 species richness and diversity estimators including otus chao1 shannon simpson ace and coverage were calculated as summarized in supplementary table s6 the coverage indices of all seven samples were greater than 0 99 which indicated the sequencing results reflected the actual condition of the samples the number of otus obtained from the seven samples was 593 477 496 486 565 556 and 571 respectively the microbial community structure at the phylum level is shown in fig 10 a proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi nitrospirae actinobacteria and acidobacteria were abundant in all samples the sum of these six phyla accounted for 95 67 94 48 93 59 92 40 93 51 92 77 and 83 31 of the bacterial community in the samples from days 1 through 180 respectively these six phyla have been commonly found in activated sludge and usually show good organic matter degradation abilities and nitrogen phosphate removal performances linwei wu 2019 wang et al 2016 the total percentage of the bacterial community represented by these six phyla remained essentially unchanged in the seven samples but notable changes within each phyla were detected this indicated that enrichment by strain rt1901 significantly affected the microbial community structure of activated sludge in the reactor the taxonomic diversity at the genus level is shown in fig 10b after the addition of strain rt1901 the relative abundance of thauera from day 140 to day 180 increased from 1 4 2 48 to 4 72 8 86 candidatus competibacter decreased from 9 11 18 55 to 4 73 7 19 candidatus accumulibacter decreased from 12 12 18 83 to 3 76 5 71 and zoogloea decreased from 6 58 10 79 to 2 31 8 08 these changes were related to the ability of strain rt1901 to remove nitrogen and phosphorus which gave it a wider niche in these experiments strain rt1901 was able to use oxygen no3 n and no2 n as electron acceptors to consume phb for phosphorus accumulation this allowed strain rt1901 to outcompete the traditional phosphate accumulating bacteria in the low dissolved oxygen environment wang et al 2015 meanwhile smp and eps were used as electron donors for denitrification which further enhanced the competitiveness of rt1901 relative to other denitrifying bacteria such as zoogloea at low c n ratios the relative abundance of nitrospira increased from 1 00 1 85 to 7 53 13 84 which demonstrated that as traditional phosphate accumulating bacteria were reduced more do was made available for nitrification iannacone et al 2021 4 conclusion the novel thauera sp rt1901 was isolated from a waste water treatment plant and its abilities to perform denitrification and phosphate accumulation were examined the strain rt1901 used pha for nitrate respiration and to absorb extracellular phosphate and it was also able to use smp and eps as an electron donor for denitrification analysis of the whole genome confirmed the presence of the metabolic pathway for denitrifying phosphorus removal and provided insight into this species diversity of metabolic mechanisms for utilizing refractory substances moreover the removal efficiencies of tn and cod were clearly enhanced when rt1901 was added to an aoa sbr with low carbon availability as the abundance of thauera sp rt1901 in the microbial community increased while the abundances of conventional phosphorus accumulating bacteria significantly decreased this work revealed that the ecological advantages of thauera were related to its diversity of metabolic pathways which makes it an important contributor to the treatment of low carbon source wastewater credit authorship contribution statement tong ren conceptualization methodology data

16553,faecal indicator organisms fios are limited in their ability to protect public health from the microbial contamination of drinking water because of their transience and time required to deliver a result we evaluated alternative rapid and potentially more resilient approaches against a benchmark fio of thermotolerant coliforms ttcs to characterise faecal contamination over 14 months at 40 groundwater sources in a ugandan town rapid approaches included in situ tryptophan like fluorescence tlf humic like fluorescence hlf turbidity sanitary inspections and total bacterial cells by flow cytometry ttcs varied widely in six sampling visits a third of sources tested both positive and negative 50 of sources had a range of at least 720 cfu 100 ml and a two day heavy rainfall event increased median ttcs five fold using source medians tlf was the best predictor in logistic regression models of ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml auc 0 88 and best correlated to ttc enumeration ρs 0 81 with hlf performing similarly relationships between tlf or hlf and ttcs were stronger in the wet season than the dry season when tlf and hlf were instead more associated with total bacterial cells source rank order between sampling rounds was considerably more consistent according to cross correlations using tlf or hlf min ρs 0 81 than ttcs min ρs 0 34 furthermore dry season tlf and hlf cross correlated more strongly ρs 0 68 than dry season ttcs ρs 0 50 with wet season ttcs when ttcs were elevated in situ tlf or hlf are more rapid and resilient indicators of faecal contamination risk than ttcs keywords tryptophan like fluorescence humic like fluorescence coliforms microbial contamination groundwater indicator 1 introduction microbial contamination of drinking water remains a primary water quality concern in low middle and high income countries hunter et al 2010 who 2017b the greatest public health risk relates to the consumption of drinking water contaminated with human and animal faeces to which at least two billion people are currently exposed worldwide who 2019 faecal contamination of drinking water sources has traditionally been assessed by overnight culturing of surrogate faecal indicator organisms fios to infer the potential presence of enteric pathogens however drinking water compliance monitoring using fios provides ineffective protection of public health stelma jr and wymer 2012 who 2017a and waterborne outbreaks remain common even in high income countries collier et al 2021 the main concerns relating to fios are that microbial contamination is highly variable temporally which is not characterised by infrequent e g quarterly annual fio sampling in many circumstances hrudey and hrudey 2004 and results are delivered after exposure has occurred furthermore fio analysis requires well trained personnel restricting the extent of nationally representative surveys and because no result is provided in situ at the source communication of risks and behavioural change is also inhibited unicef who 2017 to address some of these limitations with fio monitoring the world health organisation who recommends a risk based management approach to ensure water safety who 2017b a risk based approach often includes sanitary inspections of the source kelly et al 2020 and operational monitoring of parameters that can be quantified rapidly to indicate changes in source water quality who 2017b notably turbidity who 2017d in addition to fio culturing there is also a current drive by unicef who 2017 for the development of new water quality approaches for the more rapid detection of faecal contamination risk fluorescence spectroscopy is a rapid reagentless technique used to characterise fluorescent natural organic matter nom in water bieroza et al 2009 carstea et al 2010 fellman et al 2010 hudson et al 2007 there is substantial evidence that natural waters contaminated with wastewater display enhanced fluorescent nom baker 2001 baker and inverarity 2004 carstea et al 2016 goldman et al 2012 lapworth et al 2008 reynolds and ahmad 1997 zhou et al 2016 of particular interest has been a fluorescence peak at an excitation λex emission λem wavelength pair around 280 350 nm termed tryptophan like fluorescence tlf tlf has long been considered an indicator of biological activity in water cammack et al 2004 elliott et al 2006 sorensen et al 2020b and occurs in high concentrations in human and animal wastes baker 2001 2002 this latter observation led to the suggestion that fluorescence spectroscopy could be a useful early warning indicator for the wastewater contamination of drinking water dalterio et al 1986 fox et al 2017 stedmon et al 2011 fluorescence can be quantified either instantaneously in situ using portable sensors carstea et al 2020 or in real time during online deployment at piped water sources sorensen et al 2018a there is now growing evidence fluorescence spectroscopy is an instantaneous indicator of faecally contaminated drinking water as determined by the relationship between tlf and the fio thermotolerant faecal coliforms ttcs sorensen et al 2015a sorensen et al 2016 sorensen et al 2018b ward et al 2020 or specifically escherichia coli baker et al 2015 fox et al 2017 frank et al 2017 mendoza et al 2020 nowicki et al 2019 sorensen et al 2018a furthermore laboratory studies have shown that e coli directly produce tlf and excrete compounds that fluoresce in the tlf region dalterio et al 1986 fox et al 2017 in a collation of groundwater and surface data across four countries n 564 a tlf threshold of 1 3 ppb dissolved tryptophan could classify ttc and e coli presence absence with false negative and false positive error rates of 4 and 15 respectively sorensen et al 2018b there was also a very strong correlation ρs 0 80 between tlf intensity and ttc and e coli enumeration importantly there is also provisional evidence that tlf is a more resilient indicator of faecal contamination risk than ttcs in groundwater sorensen et al 2015a we have demonstrated that modelled faecal contamination risk using tlf remained perennially elevated in some contaminated sources whilst risks suggested by ttcs were only seasonally elevated sorensen et al 2015a some studies have also demonstrated strong relationships between humic like fluorescence hlf λem of 400 480 nm and e coli either in the laboratory fox et al 2017 or in groundwater frank et al 2017 sorensen et al 2018a although any relationship between fios and hlf is less well documented than fios and tlf hlf has typically been considered of terrestrial origin in freshwater coble et al 2014 but it is elevated in wastewater hur et al 2010 sihan et al 2021 and can also be produced in situ by bacteria including e coli fox et al 2017 kida et al 2019 in this study we evaluate the utility of both tlf and hlf as instantaneous in situ indicators of faecal contamination risk in groundwater the world s largest store of freshwater and the primary source of drinking water for up to two billion people gleeson et al 2010 we repeatedly sampled 40 groundwater sources in a community in uganda across a period of fourteen months for ttcs and alternative rapid approaches that could be used to indicate faecal contamination the rapid indicators included standard approaches of sanitary inspections turbidity and electrical conductivity alongside the more novel indicators of in situ fluorescence spectroscopy and total planktonic bacterial cells tbcs by flow cytometry we aim to demonstrate 1 in situ tlf and hlf are the superior rapid indicators of ttcs and 2 the seasonal nature of the associations amongst tlf hlf ttcs and tbcs 2 methods 2 1 study area lukaya is a town in central uganda around 100 km southwest of the capital city kampala and close to the shores of lake victoria fig 1 a the town s population was 24 000 in the last census ubos 2014 with a density of c 640 inhabitants per km2 within the built up area that is growing at 3 per year pdp 2017 to the east of town is the lweera swamp where commercial rice farming is practised fig 1b the climate is humid with a mean annual rainfall of 890 mm nayebare et al 2020 that is bimodal and focussed within the rainy seasons of march to may and september to november fig 1c the town predominantly sits on precambrian basement rocks with aquifers developed within the weathered overburden and fractured bedrock with a shallow water table between 0 5 and 9 m below ground level bgl groundwater is the primary source of water for the town with the majority obtained from hand pumped wells and springs piped water is used by 1 of households nayebare 2021 which is obtained from a borehole operated by the national water sewerage corporation nwsc to the south of the town fig 1b nayebare et al 2020 the town possesses neither a sewer network nor a wastewater treatment facility on site sanitation facilities number around 2100 and predominantly comprise partially lined pit latrines that are elevated because of the shallow water table the pits are not emptied when full faecal matter is moved from one pit to another or a new pit is dug many pits also have overflow outlets in case of inundation during the rainy seasons nayebare et al 2020 2 2 hydrological monitoring tipping bucket rainfall gauges lambrecht meteo model 15189 lambrecht meteo gmbh germany were installed in two locations 1 and 2 fig 1b and data were aggregated to daily sums a rainfall timeseries for the study period was produced using the data from station 1 in the centre of lukaya unless records were absent or failed quality checks in which case data were replaced using records from station 2 groundwater levels in the weathered overburden were monitored in three boreholes screened at the following depth intervals 10 2 16 1 11 4 17 3 and 23 5 29 4 m bgl all boreholes are located within 20 m of each other at the surface fig 1b levels were monitored using rugged troll 100 data loggers in situ usa 2 3 water sampling and analysis 2 3 1 water sources and sampling rounds an exhaustive survey of all water sources in the town was previously undertaken by nayebare et al 2020 and identified 56 shallow hand dug wells equipped with hand pumps shallow 4 boreholes deep and 7 unprotected springs the shallow sources vary between 3 and 8 m depth and boreholes are at least 30 m deep including the nwsc water supply well drilled to 61 m bgl nayebare et al 2020 all shallow and deep sources are protected and considered improved water sources and the springs are unimproved who 2017c a stratified sampling approach was implemented to sample 40 of the water sources fig 1b the selected sources included three deep sources with the fourth having no accessible sampling location and five springs with the other two springs being such gentle seepages that groundwater inputs were not visible and these springs were not heavily utilised by the community finally 32 of the 56 shallow sources were selected to maximise the spatial spread of shallow sources across the town whilst accounting for some sources which had become non functional sources were sampled in six rounds r across 14 months r1 4 were undertaken in 2018 from late april to late may when monthly rainfall typically peaks fig 1c each round was separated by six to nine days r5 and r6 were undertaken in 2019 from mid to late june when monthly rainfall is close to its annual minimum and the rounds were separated by four days in r5 and r6 four of the hand pumps on the shallow sources had become non functional and only 36 sources were sampled note that rainfall had progressed through two wet and dry seasons between r4 and r5 2 3 2 water sampling and analysis all shallow and deep water sources were unlocked and in frequent use by the community or owner throughout daylight hours nevertheless all sources were allowed to flow for an additional minute before sampling to ensure all pipework was adequately flushed all unprotected springs were sampled from the surface water channel as close to the point of groundwater discharge as possible each source was sampled for a range of possible rapid indicators of faecal contamination tlf and hlf were quantified using separate uvilux fluorimeters chelsea technologies limited uk targeting excitation emission values of 280 360 λex λem and 280 450 nm λex λem respectively whilst the hlf λem targeted the established peak the λex was matched to that of tlf to monitor the extent of optical overlap between the two regions the bandpass filters for λex and λem were 15 and 27 5 nm respectively for both fluorimeters figure s1 the tlf fluorimeter was calibrated using eight standards 0 1 2 5 10 50 and 100 ppb of l tryptophan dissolved in ultrapure water the factory calibration was implemented for the hlf sensor which expresses intensity in quinine sulphate units qsu this is a standardised unit relating the fluorescence intensity at λex 347 5 nm and λem 450 nm from 1 ppb of quinine sulphate dissolved in 0 105 m perchloric acid to direct calibration of the hlf sensor with pyrene tetrasulphonic acid in deionised water the tlf ppb dissolved tryptophan data can be converted to qsu by division by 2 5037 or 2 3696 in rounds 1 4 and 5 6 respectively to allow calculation of tlf hlf ratios fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were taken by submerging the fluorimeter in 150 ml of groundwater contained in a polypropylene beaker each measurement was taken in the dark by placing the beaker and fluorimeter within a covered stainless steel container given the sensitivity of the fluorimeters all measurements were taken in duplicate or repeated further to obtain reproducible data field repeatability σ of tlf and hlf measurements were calculated as 0 4 ppb and 0 1 qsu respectively across all data in r5 and 6 specific electrical conductivity sec ph and temperature were monitored using a multi parameter manta 2 sonde eureka waterprobes usa turbidity was measured using a dr 890 portable colorimeter hach usa including blank correction with deionised water before each measurement except during r4 when the manta 2 was used to account for absolute differences between the turbidimeters the turbidity data were min max normalised in each round fluorescence data did not require linear correction for temperature quenching khamis et al 2015 with only a range between 22 4 25 6 c the ph of the samples was 4 6 6 7 hence ph would not appreciably have impacted the fluorescence reynolds 2003 sanitary risk inspections were undertaken at each source by the same assessor during sampling in r5 who 2020 the surveys consisted of a list of nine yes no questions table s1 to identify sources of contamination observable at the surface pathways for contaminants to enter the source and breakdowns in barriers to contamination kelly et al 2020 the questions differed for the shallow deep sources and springs because of different potential pathways leading to contamination the total number of positive responses to the questions equates to the sanitary risk score srs flow cytometry analysis for total planktonic bacteria cells tbcs was conducted in the laboratory on preserved samples but the analysis can also be undertaken rapidly and online at a water source safford and bischel 2019 samples 2 ml were collected in 4 5 ml polypropylene cryovials starlab uk that were pre loaded with the preservative glutaraldehyde sigma aldrich uk and the surfactant pluronic f68 gibco usa marie et al 2014 at final concentrations of 1 and 0 01 respectively the samples were kept in a cool box for up to 8 h then frozen at 18 c defrosted overnight during transit to the uk in a cool box and then analysed the following morning analysis was conducted using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer utilising a 488 nm solid state laser becton dickinson uk ltd uk water samples 500 μl were stained with a 1 50 v v solution of sybr green i sigma aldrich uk to a final concentration of 1 10 000 v v for 20 min in the dark at room temperature samples were run at a slow flow rate 14 ml min 10 mm core for 5 min and a detection threshold of 1500 on channel fl1 a single manually drawn gate was created to discriminate bacterial cells from particulate background and cells per ml were calculated using the total cell count in 5 min divided by the reported volume run in μl sorensen et al 2018a thermotolerant faecal coliforms ttcs were selected as the fio of contamination ttcs include the preferred fio e coli who 2017b in addition to other genera such as klebsiella spp that are less likely to originate from a faecal source leclerc et al 2001 nevertheless ttcs are considered acceptable fio alternatives to e coli by the who 2017b as the majority of ttcs comprise e coli in most circumstances indeed 99 of ttcs were confirmed as e coli in shallow groundwater contaminated by on site sanitation in a similar climatological and hydrogeological setting in kampala uganda howard et al 2003 ttc samples were collected in sterile 250 ml polypropylene bottles and stored in a cool box up to 8 h before analysis ttcs were isolated and enumerated using the membrane filtration method with membrane lauryl sulphate broth mlsb oxoid ltd uk as the selective medium sorensen et al 2015a typically 100 ml of the water sample was passed through a 0 45 µm cellulose nitrate filter ge whatman uk however a smaller filtrate volume 1 50 ml was used for a minority of samples to ensure colonies were not too numerous to count tntc with the volume selected according to the corresponding tlf measurement and previous ttc analyses at the source the filter was placed on an absorbent pad pall gelman germany saturated with mlsb broth in a plate and incubated at 44 c for 18 24 h in a paqualab 50 ele international uk plates were inspected within 15 mins of removal from the incubator and all cream to yellow colonies greater than 1 mm considered ttcs where plates were tntc the analysis was repeated the following day using a smaller volume of the remaining sample that had been kept refrigerated at 4 c 2 4 statistical analysis and modelling rapid approaches to assess faecal contamination were tested against the benchmark fio of ttcs using r v4 0 3 r core team 2020 and base commands unless otherwise stated logistic regression models were developed for each rapid approach as a predictor of 10 cfu 100 ml ttcs there were insufficient data n 1 where ttcs 1 cfu 100 ml to develop models for ttc presence absence model performance was assessed using the area under the receive operating curve auc mandrekar 2010 which is a plot of the proportion of true positive results against the proportion of false positive results as the threshold of the predictor is varied a perfect classifier has an auc of 1 and a random classifier has a value of 0 5 furthermore we consider auc values of 0 7 to 0 8 0 8 to 0 9 and 0 9 and greater as acceptable excellent and outstanding respectively hosmer et al 2013 rank correlations between rapid approaches and ttcs were estimated using the non parametric spearman s rank ρs spearman 1904 given the non gaussian distribution of many of the variables coefficients of 0 80 1 00 0 60 0 79 0 40 0 59 0 20 0 39 0 00 0 19 were considered very strong strong moderate weak and very weak respectively multiple linear regression was applied to investigate what combination of rapid approaches was optimal for the prediction of ttc enumeration a forward stepwise algorithm was used using 10 fold cross validation within the r package car fox and weisberg 2018 one predictor is added to the model at a time to achieve the largest decrease in the root mean square error rmse until no further reduction can be yielded the normality of model residuals was evaluated using q q plots initial models produced non gaussian residuals in violation of the assumptions so all variables with a skewness 1 were natural log transformed an addition of 1 was made to ttcs to ensure the logarithm could be defined differences in both rapid approaches and ttcs between sampling rounds were explored using the friedman test in the r package pmcmr pohlert 2014 with post hoc nemenyi tests demšar 2006 the friedman test is a non parametric alternative to the repeated measures anova and tests the null hypothesis that at least one group does not belong to the same population if the friedman test is significant p 0 05 the subsequent multiple comparison nemenyi tests report significant p 0 05 differences between each pair of groups if their corresponding mean ranks differ by at least the critical difference demšar 2006 pohlert 2014 the comparative resilience of rapid approaches and ttcs were evaluated by cross correlating each variable with itself between sampling rounds additionally tlf and hlf were cross correlated with ttcs and tbcs across the sampling rounds to explore the seasonal nature of any associations spearman s rank was used because the variables were non gaussian and because we were most interested in the rank order of the sources as an indicator of relative risk across the community groundwater levels gwls for the most complete record bh alp 3 were hindcasted by 24 days to contextualise groundwater conditions before and during r1 and 2 where gwl observations were not collected hindcasting was conducted using a forward model implementing the water table fluctuation method and assuming diffuse recharge from daily rainfall observations cuthbert et al 2019 the model was parameterised using a linear rainfall recharge relationship with a rainfall threshold of 10 mm an exponential recession coefficient of 1 1 10 3 day 1 to a base of 1149 m asl and a specific yield of 5 the model effectively captures which rainfall events result in groundwater recharge the timing of gwl responses and the rate of recession with an r2 of 0 85 and rmse of 0 23 m figure s2 3 results 3 1 widespread prevalence and high variability of ttcs all sources show evidence of at least intermittent faecal contamination inferred through the presence of ttcs fig 2 a b fifty percent of the sources have median ttcs of at least 88 cfu 100 ml fig 2a with a range in median counts between 1 and 5101 cfu 100 ml the shallow sources cover the entire range in median counts whilst median ttcs at springs and deep sources are in the upper 50 and lower 53 of all sources respectively fig 2a ttcs vary widely at each source with 50 of sources having a range of at least 720 cfu 100 ml fig 2b the range in ttcs at a source is at least 8 cfu 100 ml and up to 34 000 cfu 100 ml with all but two sources varying between risk categories based upon the order of magnitude of ttcs previously defined by who 1997 a third of the sources transit between testing negative and positive for ttcs including the only source with a median count of 1 cfu 100 ml fig 3 d there is a tendency for spring sources to have greater ranges in ttcs than the other types of source fig 2b 3 2 tlf and hlf are superior rapid approaches to indicate ttcs using source medians median tlf is the only significant predictor of median ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml according to logistic regression models β 1 09 p value 0 042 fig 3a table s2 the auc using tlf as a classifier is 0 88 which is closer to the perfect classifier value of 1 than the random selector of 0 5 fig 3a and considered excellent an optimal tlf threshold of 2 2 ppb can be defined to classify ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml with associated false negative and false positive rates of 16 and 25 respectively fig 3c the auc when classifying median ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml using hlf is 0 85 and considered excellent with the logistic regression model being borderline significant β 1 90 p value 0 059 fig 3a a hlf threshold of 0 85 qsu can classify median ttcs of 10 cfu 100 ml with identical error rates to those as the proposed tlf threshold in fact if the tlf ppb threshold is converted into qsu then it is almost equivalent to the hlf threshold the auc is acceptable for sanitary risk scores srs and median total bacterial cells tbcs and demonstrates that sec and turbidity performed no better than a random classifier fig 3a considering only the shallow sources n 32 srs is a significant predictor β 0 90 p value 0 038 with an acceptable auc of 0 79 only one individual sanitary inspection question whether drainage was inadequate is a significant predictor p value 0 05 of median ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml for shallow and deep sources where sanitary inspection questions were identical the auc for inadequate drainage as a classifier is 0 75 and considered acceptable f3 median tlf is very strongly correlated with median ttcs ρs 0 81 fig 3d being the most correlated rapid approach fig 3b all types of water source follow the same rising trend fig 3d with two notable outliers one outlier is a shallow source which has a median tlf of 65 9 ppb more than three times the tlf intensity of any other source although median ttcs are also high at 296 cfu 100 ml the second outlier is a deep source with median ttcs of 89 cfu 100 ml yet the lowest median tlf of 0 5 ppb as well as being the only site with a zero srs median hlf is similarly correlated with median ttcs ρs 0 79 as tlf with identical outliers median tbcs correlate moderately with median ttcs but other rapid indicators are only weakly related to median ttcs fig 3b no other rapid approaches provide additive performance to ln tlf for the prediction of median ln ttcs using the stepwise forward linear regression algorithm the linear regression model has an r2 of 0 51 and p value 0 001 eq 1 omitting ln tlf only ln hlf is included by the algorithm and the model has an r2 of 0 48 and p value 0 001 eq 2 natural log transforms of ttcs tlf and hlf where required in the linear regression models to ensure the model residuals were gaussian see figure s3 for q q plots 1 ln t t c 1 1 66 ln t l f 2 19 2 ln t t c 1 1 44 ln h l f 3 73 3 3 relationships between rapid approaches and ttcs by sampling round ttcs are significantly different between the wet season rounds of r1 r2 and r4 and the dry season rounds of r5 and r6 fig 4 a b median ttcs were higher during than wet season up to 382 cfu 100 ml r1 than the dry season as low as 13 cfu 100 ml r5 fig 4b ttcs rapidly reduced in the absence of large rainfall events for example median ttcs reduced from 382 to 55 cfu 100 ml within 17 23 days between rounds r1 and r3 the two large successive daily rainfall events of 40 mm preceding round r4 resulted in substantial groundwater recharge an almost five fold increase in median ttcs to 262 cfu 100 ml and increases in ttcs at 73 sources tlf shows a similar trend to ttcs across sampling rounds fig 4b significant differences exist between wet and dry season rounds with median tlf being highest in round r1 and lowest in rounds r5 and r6 hlf and tbcs also show significant differences only between wet and dry season rounds with both at minima in the dry season turbidity and sec show the least variability by sampling round with fewest significant differences between rounds tlf is generally the most strongly correlated rapid approach with ttcs in each sampling round fig 4c positive correlations are very strong or strong during the wet season rounds r1 4 but only moderate or weak in dry season rounds r5 and r6 respectively fig 4d the strongest coefficient is during round r4 following the two large successive rainfall events correlation coefficients between hlf and ttcs are similar or marginally lower notably in round r4 than between tlf and ttcs with significant correlations in all rounds fig 4c apart from r6 where significance is borderline p 0 051 tlf and hlf are also better predictors of ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml in the wet season rounds mean auc 0 84 and 0 73 respectively than dry season rounds mean auc 0 68 for both tbcs are intermittently significantly correlated with ttcs with strong ρs 0 70 and moderate ρs 0 56 correlations during rounds r4 and r1 respectively other rapid approaches are rarely significantly correlated with ttcs and coefficients are typically weak or very weak fig 4c only tbcs in the dry season and srs in the wet season have an auc 0 70 for classifying ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml both mean seasonal auc 0 71 there are also notable associations between rapid approaches during rounds r5 and r6 there is an almost perfect positive correlation between tlf and hlf mean ρs 0 97 ρs remains very strong but is lower in rounds r1 4 mean r2 0 88 figure s4 the tlf hlf ratio is higher in rounds r1 4 median 0 95 than r5 6 median 0 70 with the percentage of samples having a ratio 1 also decreasing from 45 to 7 the lower tlf hlf ratio in r5 6 is a result of a greater reduction in tlf relative to hlf fig 4c in rounds r5 and r6 when the relationships between tlf hlf and ttcs weaken tlf and hlf are both strongly positively correlated with tbcs mean ρs 0 62 3 4 cross correlations between rapid approaches and ttcs across sampling rounds there are very strong positive rank cross correlations for both hlf and tlf between sampling rounds at the 36 sources but rank cross correlations are weaker and more varied for ttcs fig 5 a b d the source rank order by hlf is most consistent with a mean ρs of 0 91 σ 0 04 all p values 0 001 and remarkably a ρs of 0 95 between rounds r1 and r6 fig 5b separated by 14 months the mean ρs for tlf is 0 86 with consistently very strong correlations between all rounds σ 0 03 all p values 0 001 the rank order of sources by ttcs is inconsistent moderately correlated on average ρs mean 0 57 σ 0 11 but with only a weak correlation between rounds r1 and r6 fig 5d bulk hydrochemistry rank order of sources as indicated by sec is also consistent between rounds ρs mean 0 90 σ 0 07 fig 5d but sec is unrelated to ttcs fig 4c a survey of tlf or hlf across the community in either the dry or the wet season relates to ttcs during the wet season when ttcs are elevated ranking the sources based on hlf intensity during any sampling round correlates well ρs mean 0 68 σ 0 06 all p values 0 001 with the rank order of the sources by ttcs during the wet season rounds r1 4 fig 5f tlf cross correlates similarly to hlf with ttcs over the same time period ρs mean 0 67 σ 0 09 92 p values 0 001 although some coefficients for round r1 with ttcs are weaker fig 5e note because of the very strong rank correlation between hlf and tlf in the dry season rounds mean ρs 0 97 both rank correlate near identically and strongly with ttcs during the wet season rounds importantly dry season tlf and hlf both mean ρs 0 68 σ 0 05 all p values 0 001 both correlate more strongly than dry season ttcs mean ρs 0 50 σ 0 10 38 p values 0 001 with wet season ttcs 4 discussion 4 1 in situ tlf hlf as rapid approaches to indicate faecal contamination in our study tlf hlf are the superior rapid approaches to indicate faecal contamination of groundwater sources as determined by ttcs to set these results in a wider context we re analysed existing published datasets from contrasting hydrogeological settings following the same statistical approach fig 6 the datasets were collated from i boreholes drilled to a consistent depth in an alluvial aquifer in bihar india n 145 sorensen et al 2016 and ii boreholes n 50 and shallow hand dug wells n 61 tapping either quartzite dolomite or the overlying weathered saprolite laterite respectively in zambia sorensen et al 2015a the re analysis of these datasets demonstrates tlf is an effective significant predictor of the presence absence of ttcs in a 100 ml sample in these other settings fig 6a logistic regression models using tlf are significant p 0 001 and the auc is 0 89 0 94 srs and turbidity perform no better than a random classifier in india whilst both are significant predictors p 0 05 in boreholes in zambia their aucs are much lower than tlf fig 6a the shallow wells in zambia were typically always contaminated with ttcs present in all but 5 of the 61 samples so aucs were not estimated tlf is the most correlated rapid indicator of the number of ttcs in our study and the re analysis of other published data fig 6b in india there is a significant relationship between tlf and ttcs but not between either srs or turbidity and ttcs in zambia tlf is strongly correlated with ttcs in boreholes but only weak relationships exist between srs or turbidity and ttcs correlation coefficients with ttcs also remain strongest for tlf from the rapid approaches in the shallow wells an online application of tlf in groundwater derived public water supplies in the uk has also demonstrated that tlf was better correlated ρs 0 71 with e coli than online turbidity ρs 0 48 sorensen et al 2018a there are alternative groundwater studies that have presented evidence that tlf has been unrelated to fios in groundwater nevertheless tlf has still served as an effective in situ indicator of contamination deriving from faecal matter in these studies for example sorensen et al 2020b showed tlf was related to the density of on site sanitation and associated nitrate but not ttcs beneath dakar senegal this study was also undertaken during the dry season and the results of our study suggests tlf hlf relationships with fios are seasonal and it is possible that during the wet season tlf hlf could relate to fios in dakar alternatively the fluorophores in dakar could relate to historic faecal contamination as also observed at a source adjacent to an abandoned pit latrine in malawi containing perennially high tlf but sporadic and low ttc counts ward et al 2021 there remains inconsistent evidence regarding the use of turbidity and sec buckerfield et al 2019 jung et al 2014 pronk et al 2006 pronk et al 2009 valenzuela et al 2009 or sanitary inspections bain et al 2014 kelly et al 2020 misati et al 2017 to determine faecal contamination risk in groundwater turbidity and sec can derive from a variety of common sources including the re mobilisation of particles within the aquifer and the relationship with faecal indicator bacteria in the literature is consequentially inconsistent who 2017d we consider that tlf hlf are more appropriate indicators of variations in source water quality that relate to faecal contamination a recent review by kelly et al 2020 suggested it was inappropriate to use sanitary inspections as indicators of microbial water quality they argued that microbial samples from the same source are highly varied whereas a sanitary inspection serves as a lasting condition of the water source other limitations of srs are they only represent conditions local to the source whereas rapid subsurface transport of enteric pathogens can occur over large distances in fracture flow aquifers worthington and smart 2017 and it is not possible to assess failure of the sanitary seal subsurface nevertheless sanitary inspections are undoubtedly invaluable irrespective of whether they are indicative of microbial water quality particularly as they provide information about potential risks and causes of contamination to inform interventions 4 2 tlf and hlf are more resilient indicators of faecal contamination risk than ttcs tlf and hlf are more resilient faecal contamination indicators in groundwater than ttcs within our study we highlight comparable observations in zambia where tlf remained elevated in several shallow sources over a period of four months whereas ttcs were only elevated in the wet season sorensen et al 2015a this dynamic was also recently suggested at five water sources in malawi by ward et al 2021 despite tlf remaining seasonally elevated in several zambian sources there was an overall trend towards higher median tlf and ttcs in the wet season 7 1 ppb and 48 cfu 100 ml relative to the dry season 2 8 ppb and 2 cfu 100 ml re analysis of the zambia data demonstrates that the relationship between tlf and ttcs is stronger in the wet ρ 0 82 than the dry season ρ 0 67 moreover there is also a stronger cross correlation between dry season tlf and elevated wet season ttcs ρ 0 80 than dry and wet season ttcs ρ 0 60 in summary both tlf and ttc vary seasonally in uganda and zambia but ranking the sources within a community by faecal contamination risk using tlf is a more temporally robust approach than using ttcs contrasting seasonal variations and relationships between tlf hlf and ttcs suggest tlf hlf differ from ttcs in one or more properties i their source ii their transport properties and or iii their persistence in the subsurface the dominant source term for both types of faecal indicator is likely to be effluent from on site sanitation in urban low income settings where present except potentially where there are naturally high levels of sedimentary fluorescent nom or water is contaminated with fluorescent xenobiotic compounds such as diesel carstea et al 2010 inputs from on site sanitation are likely to be greatest during the wet season particularly following large rainfall events when latrines can be inundated and overflow nayebare et al 2020 and accumulated faecal matter on the ground surface can be mobilised howard et al 2003 there is also likely to be a continuous input function from on site sanitation as pit latrines and septic tanks leak year round the faecal indicators have different transport properties frank et al 2021 demonstrated that dissolved tryptophan was comparable in transit time and recovery to the conservative dye tracer uranine over short distance 2 h tracer tests with no evidence of retardation frank et al also demonstrated similar recovery for a humic acid although there was some evidence of retardation and the tracer peak was marginally delayed by five minutes in comparison to uranine it is unclear what proportion of tlf hlf can be attributed to dissolved pure tryptophan or the humic acid used in any given setting although tlf hlf fluorophores are predominantly extracellular in groundwater sorensen et al 2020a nevertheless there will also be an element of sorption and desorption of dissolved om between groundwater and the aquifer matrix and soils shen et al 2015 particularly for more hydrophobic molecules which may have a tlf hlf component as well as a minor component contained within cells ttcs can be transported more rapidly than solutes notably in heterogeneous media such as weather crystalline rocks but are subject to appreciable attenuation taylor et al 2004 ttcs tend to accumulate and be transported laterally when flow velocities increase who 2017b such as during a rainfall event generating groundwater recharge therefore tlf hlf fluorophores are likely to be more readily and continuously transported than ttcs in groundwater the persistence of tlf hlf fluorophores and ttcs are likely to differ in groundwater hlf is expected to be the most persistent indicator demonstrating the strongest rank order cross correlation between sampling rounds furthermore although hlf decreases in the dry season there is a proportionally greater loss in tlf indicating either preferential breakdown or more efficient lateral transport of tlf fluorophores hlf has been demonstrated to be more recalcitrant resistant to breakdown than tlf in surface water and wastewater cory and kaplan 2012 ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 and a greater proportion of fluorophores are like to be recalcitrant in groundwater where nom is typically less bioavailable chapelle 2021 shen et al 2015 the refractory nature of some hlf fluorophores led zheng et al 2020 to suggest that hlf is an effective tracer of wastewater in groundwater there is also potential for the in situ production of tlf or hlf from nom entering an aquifer system fox et al 2017 yang et al 2020 therefore fluorophore persistence in the subsurface could be a result of the continuous recycling and microbial transformation of nom arriving in the system as opposed to the accumulation of recalcitrant molecules benk et al 2019 roth et al 2019 the dry season relationships between tlf hlf and tbcs when faecal inputs are more limited as also observed in senegal sorensen et al 2020b suggest bacteria are using the nom as a substrate and potentially generating fluorophores in situ irrespective of the relative persistence of either tlf or hlf either wavelength pair would provide a similar indicator of faecal contamination risk given their co correlation in our study and the optical overlap between the peaks ttcs are generally only considered indicative of recent contamination with die off within 16 45 days taylor et al 2004 in contrast to the more persistent fluorescence indicators the more efficient transport of tlf hlf fluorophores and their greater persistence in the subsurface in comparison to ttcs could explain why dry season tlf hlf relates to wet season ttcs firstly more efficient transport could facilitate the perennial transport of tlf hlf fluorophores from a faecal source to a water source whereas ttcs are predominantly mobilised following rainfall in the wet season it should also be re iterated that tlf hlf does also respond to rainfall with higher intensity in the wet season indicating higher seasonal risks secondly faecal contamination events at a water source would remain detectable for a longer period by fluorescing more persistent tlf hlf fluorophores than ttcs if these events are focussed in the wet season as observed here then the proportion of tlf hlf persisting into the dry season may relate to wet season ttcs given the two types of indicator correlate very strongly after heavy rainfall e g tlf ρs 0 83 r4 4 3 remaining uncertainties instrumentation improvements and future work there are a range of potential interferents with in situ fluorescence measurements that are discussed in a review by carstea et al 2020 but these have not adversely impacted previous tlf fio studies sorensen et al 2018b or this study across a range of settings corrections for temperature turbidity and absorbance of light by the sample matrix the inner filtering effect are not likely to be necessary in the majority of groundwater settings khamis et al 2015 sorensen et al 2015a moreover the next generation of commercially available portable fluorimeters are now capable of automatic corrections ph does not have an appreciable impact on tlf hlf between values of 5 and 8 reynolds 2003 spencer et al 2007 and groundwater outside this range is unlikely to be suitable for drinking high concentrations of metal ions could quench fluorescence yang et al 2018 which is most likely where water is contaminated by mining and industry certain water treatments including chlorination also quench fluorescence henderson et al 2009 so the well owner or other informed individuals should be interviewed to assess if the water has been treated prior to testing as would be undertaken before fio sampling alternatively a chlorine residual test could be performed there is the potential for tlf or hlf fluorophores to originate from contamination unrelated to faecal sources such as diesel and fuel derivatives food waste paper mills and pesticides carstea et al 2016 in these instances a source displaying high tlf hlf should still be considered a higher faecal contamination risk than one displaying low tlf hlf as there would be evidence that a pathway is present to a source of anthropogenic waste sedimentary fluorescent nom contained within the aquifer could also potentially be problematic when comparing faecal contamination risks determined by tlf hlf particularly between study areas in which case deviation from baseline fluorescence intensity in uncontaminated sources would be more important than the absolute value for determining risk relatively high upfront costs undoubtedly constrain widespread adoption of in situ fluorescence spectroscopy the present generation of single peak fluorimeters cost in the region of us 5000 7000 before considering accessories that can cost a further us 2000 3000 sorensen et al 2018b however there is substantial scope to reduce these costs through the development of lower cost portable fluorimeters engineered specifically to provide an in situ indication of faecal contamination risk at a water source multiple researchers have developed prototype fluorimeters with various benefits over commercial alternatives bedell et al 2020 bridgeman et al 2015 simões et al 2021 but field validation and a discussion of indicative costs are absent or limited as part of our study we successfully developed and demonstrated the efficacy of a lower cost prototype portable multi wavelength led based fluorimeter on duplicate samples in rounds r5 and r6 figure s5 the prototype provided comparable results to the uvilux sensors in both the laboratory table s5 and field for example the prototype derived hlf data from r5 and r6 both correlate strongly with ttcs in r4 mean ρs 0 69 therefore a low cost portable fluorimeter to indicate faecal contamination risk could be produced for a total component cost of 1100 further details are provided in the supplementary information s1 in addition to reducing costs future development should investigate the production of low cost sealed long life containers of tlf hlf standards these containers would enable calibration checks ideally annually and negative controls to be performed by the end user without return to the manufacturer or access to a well equipped laboratory with reagents and high quality deionised water sorensen et al 2018b it remains unclear how tlf hlf relate to the presence of enteric pathogens or risks posed to human health there is one published study showing a relationship between tlf and dna markers of enteric pathogens although this study is limited to 22 sources in one town sorensen et al 2015b future work should explore the potential link between tlf hlf and enteric pathogens using molecular approaches as well as exploring the viability of pathogens where possible furthermore studies should investigate if and how tlf hlf could effectively be used for on site risk communication to induce behavioural change in communities and reduce the disease burden relating to the consumption of faecally contamination drinking water 5 conclusions in situ fluorescence spectroscopy provides an instantaneous assessment of water source quality that relates to faecal contamination risk determined by faecal indicator organisms fios consequently faecal contamination risks can be assessed immediately including in real time and could be communicated on site to consumers to reduce exposure to contamination whilst confirmative regulatory fio analysis is undertaken furthermore in situ fluorescence can extend fio sampling programs because data can be collected rapidly by users who require minimal training nor are there consumable costs for additional samples tlf and hlf are more resilient indicators of faecal contamination risk than fios both types of indicator respond to rainfall and contamination events with the strongest relationships between the indicators observed in the wet season notably immediately after heavy rainfall e g tlf ttc ρs 0 83 however ranking the sources across a community by risk using fios is more variable cross correlations ρs 0 34 72 between sampling rounds than using tlf or hlf cross correlations ρs 0 81 97 this ranking of sources using tlf hlf at any point in time relates to ttcs during the wet season when ttcs are significantly elevated and risks to human health would consequently also be expected to be greatest furthermore the source rank orders in the dry season using tlf hlf cross correlate more strongly both mean ρs 0 68 with wet season ttcs than dry season ttcs mean ρs 0 50 therefore the comparative faecal contamination risks between sources generated by a dry season survey of tlf hlf would be more accurate than using highly transient fios to indicate the comparative risks occurring in the wet season when risks are elevated this characteristic is advantageous given water quality surveys are infrequent for private water supplies globally as well as across low income countries tlf hlf provide a more repeatable and temporally robust approach than

keywords tryptophan like fluorescence humic like fluorescence coliforms microbial contamination groundwater indicator 1 introduction microbial contamination of drinking water remains a primary water quality concern in low middle and high income countries hunter et al 2010 who 2017b the greatest public health risk relates to the consumption of drinking water contaminated with human and animal faeces to which at least two billion people are currently exposed worldwide who 2019 faecal contamination of drinking water sources has traditionally been assessed by overnight culturing of surrogate faecal indicator organisms fios to infer the potential presence of enteric pathogens however drinking water compliance monitoring using fios provides ineffective protection of public health stelma jr and wymer 2012 who 2017a and waterborne outbreaks remain common even in high income countries collier et al 2021 the main concerns relating to fios are that microbial contamination is highly variable temporally which is not characterised by infrequent e g quarterly annual fio sampling in many circumstances hrudey and hrudey 2004 and results are delivered after exposure has occurred furthermore fio

detection of faecal contamination risk fluorescence spectroscopy is a rapid reagentless technique used to characterise fluorescent natural organic matter nom in water bieroza et al 2009 carstea et al 2010 fellman et al 2010 hudson et al 2007 there is substantial evidence that natural waters contaminated with wastewater display enhanced fluorescent nom baker 2001 baker and inverarity 2004 carstea et al 2016 goldman et al 2012 lapworth et al 2008 reynolds and ahmad 1997 zhou et al 2016 of particular interest has been a fluorescence peak at an excitation λex emission λem wavelength pair around 280 350 nm termed tryptophan like fluorescence tlf tlf has long been considered an indicator of biological activity in water cammack et al 2004 elliott et al 2006 sorensen et al 2020b and occurs in high concentrations in human and animal wastes baker 2001 2002 this latter observation led to the suggestion that fluorescence spectroscopy could be a useful early warning indicator for the wastewater contamination of drinking water dalterio et al 1986 fox et al 2017 stedmon et al 2011 fluorescence can be quantified either instantaneously in situ using portable sensors carstea et al 2020 or in real time during online deployment at piped water sources sorensen et al 2018a there is now growing evidence fluorescence spectroscopy is an instantaneous indicator of faecally contaminated drinking water as determined by the relationship between tlf and the fio thermotolerant faecal coliforms ttcs sorensen et al 2015a sorensen et al 2016 sorensen et al 2018b ward et al 2020 or specifically escherichia coli baker et al 2015 fox et al 2017 frank et al 2017 mendoza et al 2020 nowicki et al 2019 sorensen et al 2018a furthermore laboratory studies have shown that e coli directly produce tlf and excrete compounds that fluoresce in the tlf region dalterio et al 1986 fox et al 2017 in a collation of groundwater and surface data across four countries n 564 a tlf threshold of 1 3 ppb dissolved tryptophan could classify ttc and e coli presence absence with false negative and false positive error rates of 4 and 15 respectively sorensen et al 2018b there was also a very strong correlation ρs 0 80 between tlf intensity and ttc and e coli enumeration importantly there is also provisional evidence that tlf is a more resilient indicator of faecal contamination risk than ttcs in groundwater sorensen et al 2015a we have demonstrated that modelled faecal contamination risk using tlf remained perennially elevated in some contaminated sources whilst risks suggested by ttcs were only seasonally elevated sorensen et al 2015a some studies have also demonstrated strong relationships between humic like fluorescence hlf λem of 400 480 nm and e coli either in the laboratory fox et al 2017 or in groundwater frank et al 2017 sorensen et al 2018a although any relationship between fios and hlf is less well documented than fios and tlf hlf has typically been considered of terrestrial origin in freshwater coble et al 2014 but it is elevated in wastewater hur et al 2010 sihan et al 2021 and can also be produced in situ by bacteria including e coli fox et al 2017 kida et al 2019 in this study we evaluate the utility of both tlf and hlf as instantaneous in situ indicators of faecal contamination risk in groundwater the world s largest store of freshwater and the primary source of drinking water for up to two billion people gleeson et al 2010 we repeatedly sampled 40 groundwater sources in a community in uganda across a period of fourteen months for ttcs and alternative rapid approaches that could be used to indicate faecal contamination the rapid indicators included standard approaches of sanitary inspections turbidity and electrical conductivity alongside the more novel indicators of in situ fluorescence spectroscopy and total planktonic bacterial cells tbcs by flow cytometry we aim to demonstrate 1 in situ tlf and hlf are the superior rapid indicators of ttcs and 2 the seasonal nature of the associations amongst tlf hlf ttcs and tbcs 2 methods 2 1 study area lukaya is a town in central uganda around 100 km southwest of the capital city kampala and close to the shores of lake victoria fig 1 a the town s population was 24 000 in the last census ubos 2014 with a density of c 640 inhabitants per km2 within the built up area that is growing at 3 per year pdp 2017 to the east of town is the lweera swamp where commercial rice farming is practised fig 1b the climate is humid with a mean annual rainfall of 890 mm nayebare et al 2020 that is bimodal and focussed within the rainy seasons of march to may and september to november fig 1c the town predominantly sits on precambrian basement rocks with aquifers developed within the weathered overburden and fractured bedrock with a shallow water table between 0 5 and 9 m below ground level bgl groundwater is the primary source of water for the town with the majority obtained from hand pumped wells and springs piped water is used by 1 of households nayebare 2021 which is obtained from a borehole operated by the national water sewerage corporation nwsc to the south of the town fig 1b nayebare et al 2020 the town possesses neither a sewer network nor a wastewater treatment facility on site sanitation facilities number around 2100 and predominantly comprise partially lined pit latrines that are elevated because of the shallow water table the pits are not emptied when full faecal matter is moved from one pit to another or a new pit is dug many pits also have overflow outlets in case of inundation during the rainy seasons nayebare et al 2020 2 2 hydrological monitoring tipping bucket rainfall gauges lambrecht meteo model 15189 lambrecht meteo gmbh germany were installed in two locations 1 and 2 fig 1b and data were aggregated to daily sums a rainfall timeseries for the study period was produced using the data from station 1 in the centre of lukaya unless records were absent or failed quality checks in which case data were replaced using records from station 2 groundwater levels in the weathered overburden were monitored in three boreholes screened at the following depth intervals 10 2 16 1 11 4 17 3 and 23 5 29 4 m bgl all boreholes are located within 20 m of each other at the surface fig 1b levels were monitored using rugged troll 100 data loggers in situ usa 2 3 water sampling and analysis 2 3 1 water sources and sampling rounds an exhaustive survey of all water sources in the town was previously undertaken by nayebare et al 2020 and identified 56 shallow hand dug wells equipped with hand pumps shallow 4 boreholes deep and 7 unprotected springs the shallow sources vary between 3 and 8 m depth and boreholes are at least 30 m deep including the nwsc water supply well drilled to 61 m bgl nayebare et al 2020 all shallow and deep sources are protected and considered improved water sources and the springs are unimproved who 2017c a stratified sampling approach was implemented to sample 40 of the water sources fig 1b the selected sources included three deep sources with the fourth having no accessible sampling location and five springs with the other two springs being such gentle seepages that groundwater inputs were not visible and these springs were not heavily utilised by the community finally 32 of the 56 shallow sources were selected to maximise the spatial spread of shallow sources across the town whilst accounting for some sources which had become non functional sources were sampled in six rounds r across 14 months r1 4 were undertaken in 2018 from late april to late may when monthly rainfall typically peaks fig 1c each round was separated by six to nine days r5 and r6 were undertaken in 2019 from mid to late june when monthly rainfall is close to its annual minimum and the rounds were separated by four days in r5 and r6 four of the hand pumps on the shallow sources had become non functional and only 36 sources were sampled note that rainfall had progressed through two wet and dry seasons between r4 and r5 2 3 2 water sampling and analysis all shallow and deep water sources were unlocked and in frequent use by the community or owner throughout daylight hours nevertheless all sources were allowed to flow for an additional minute before sampling to ensure all pipework was adequately flushed all unprotected springs were sampled from the surface water channel as close to the point of groundwater discharge as possible each source was sampled for a range of possible rapid indicators of faecal contamination tlf and hlf were quantified using separate uvilux fluorimeters chelsea technologies limited uk targeting excitation emission values of 280 360 λex λem and 280 450 nm λex λem respectively whilst the hlf λem targeted the established peak the λex was matched to that of tlf to monitor the extent of optical overlap between the two regions the bandpass filters for λex and λem were 15 and 27 5 nm respectively for both fluorimeters figure s1 the tlf fluorimeter was calibrated using eight standards 0 1 2 5 10 50 and 100 ppb of l tryptophan dissolved in ultrapure water the factory calibration was implemented for the hlf sensor which expresses intensity in quinine sulphate units qsu this is a standardised unit relating the fluorescence intensity at λex 347 5 nm and λem 450 nm from 1 ppb of quinine sulphate dissolved in 0 105 m perchloric acid to direct calibration of the hlf sensor with pyrene tetrasulphonic acid in deionised water the tlf ppb dissolved tryptophan data can be converted to qsu by division by 2 5037 or 2 3696 in rounds 1 4 and 5 6 respectively to allow calculation of tlf hlf ratios fluorescence spectroscopy measurements were taken by submerging the fluorimeter in 150 ml of groundwater contained in a polypropylene beaker each measurement was taken in the dark by placing the beaker and fluorimeter within a covered stainless steel container given the sensitivity of the fluorimeters all measurements were taken in duplicate or repeated further to obtain reproducible data field repeatability σ of tlf and hlf measurements were calculated as 0 4 ppb and 0 1 qsu respectively across all data in r5 and 6 specific electrical conductivity sec ph and temperature were monitored using a multi parameter manta 2 sonde eureka waterprobes usa turbidity was measured using a dr 890 portable colorimeter hach usa including blank correction with deionised water before each measurement except during r4 when the manta 2 was used to account for absolute differences between the turbidimeters the turbidity data were min max normalised in each round fluorescence data did not require linear correction for temperature quenching khamis et al 2015 with only a range between 22 4 25 6 c the ph of the samples was 4 6 6 7 hence ph would not appreciably have impacted the fluorescence reynolds 2003 sanitary risk inspections were undertaken at each source by the same assessor during sampling in r5 who 2020 the surveys consisted of a list of nine yes no questions table s1 to identify sources of contamination observable at the surface pathways for contaminants to enter the source and breakdowns in barriers to contamination kelly et al 2020 the questions differed for the shallow deep sources and springs because of different potential pathways leading to contamination the total number of positive responses to the questions equates to the sanitary risk score srs flow cytometry analysis for total planktonic bacteria cells tbcs was conducted in the laboratory on preserved samples but the analysis can also be undertaken rapidly and online at a water source safford and bischel 2019 samples 2 ml were collected in 4 5 ml polypropylene cryovials starlab uk that were pre loaded with the preservative glutaraldehyde sigma aldrich uk and the surfactant pluronic f68 gibco usa marie et al 2014 at final concentrations of 1 and 0 01 respectively the samples were kept in a cool box for up to 8 h then frozen at 18 c defrosted overnight during transit to the uk in a cool box and then analysed the following morning analysis was conducted using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer utilising a 488 nm solid state laser becton dickinson uk ltd uk water samples 500 μl were stained with a 1 50 v v solution of sybr green i sigma aldrich uk to a final concentration of 1 10 000 v v for 20 min in the dark at room temperature samples were run at a slow flow rate 14 ml min 10 mm core for 5 min and a detection threshold of 1500 on channel fl1 a single manually drawn gate was created to discriminate bacterial cells from particulate background and cells per ml were calculated using the total cell count in 5 min divided by the reported volume run in μl sorensen et al 2018a thermotolerant faecal coliforms ttcs were selected as the fio of contamination ttcs include the preferred fio e coli who 2017b in addition to other genera such as klebsiella spp that are less likely to originate from a faecal source leclerc et al 2001 nevertheless ttcs are considered acceptable fio alternatives to e coli by the who 2017b as the majority of ttcs comprise e coli in most circumstances indeed 99 of ttcs were confirmed as e coli in shallow groundwater contaminated by on site sanitation in a similar climatological and hydrogeological setting in kampala uganda howard et al 2003 ttc samples were collected in sterile 250 ml polypropylene bottles and stored in a cool box up to 8 h before analysis ttcs were isolated and enumerated using the membrane filtration method with membrane lauryl sulphate broth mlsb oxoid ltd uk as the selective medium sorensen et al 2015a typically 100 ml of the water sample was passed through a 0 45 µm cellulose nitrate filter ge whatman uk however a smaller filtrate volume 1 50 ml was used for a minority of samples to ensure colonies were not too numerous to count tntc with the volume selected according to the corresponding tlf measurement and previous ttc analyses at the source the filter was placed on an absorbent pad pall gelman germany saturated with mlsb broth in a plate and incubated at 44 c for 18 24 h in a paqualab 50 ele international uk plates were inspected within 15 mins of removal from the incubator and all cream to yellow colonies greater than 1 mm considered ttcs where plates were tntc the analysis was repeated the following day using a smaller volume of the remaining sample that had been kept refrigerated at 4 c 2 4 statistical analysis and modelling rapid approaches to assess faecal contamination were tested against the benchmark fio of ttcs using r v4 0 3 r core team 2020 and base commands unless otherwise stated logistic regression models were developed for each rapid approach as a predictor of 10 cfu 100 ml ttcs there were insufficient data n 1 where ttcs 1 cfu 100 ml to develop models for ttc presence absence model performance was assessed using the area under the receive operating curve auc mandrekar 2010 which is a plot of the proportion of true positive results against the proportion of false positive results as the threshold of the predictor is varied a perfect classifier has an auc of 1 and a random classifier has a value of 0 5 furthermore we consider auc values of 0 7 to 0 8 0 8 to 0 9 and 0 9 and greater as acceptable excellent and outstanding respectively hosmer et al 2013 rank correlations between rapid approaches and ttcs were estimated using the non parametric spearman s rank ρs spearman 1904 given the non gaussian distribution of many of the variables coefficients of 0 80 1 00 0 60 0 79 0 40 0 59 0 20 0 39 0 00 0 19 were considered very strong strong moderate weak and very weak respectively multiple linear regression was applied to investigate what combination of rapid approaches was optimal for the prediction of ttc enumeration a forward stepwise algorithm was used using 10 fold cross validation within the r package car fox and weisberg 2018 one predictor is added to the model at a time to achieve the largest decrease in the root mean square error rmse until no further reduction can be yielded the normality of model residuals was evaluated using q q plots initial models produced non gaussian residuals in violation of the assumptions so all variables with a skewness 1 were natural log transformed an addition of 1 was made to ttcs to ensure the logarithm could be defined differences in both rapid approaches and ttcs between sampling rounds were explored using the friedman test in the r package pmcmr pohlert 2014 with post hoc nemenyi tests demšar 2006 the friedman test is a non parametric alternative to the repeated measures anova and tests the null hypothesis that at least one group does not belong to the same population if the friedman test is significant p 0 05 the subsequent multiple comparison nemenyi tests report significant p 0 05 differences between each pair of groups if their corresponding mean ranks differ by at least the critical difference demšar 2006 pohlert 2014 the comparative resilience of rapid approaches and ttcs were evaluated by cross correlating each variable with itself between sampling rounds additionally tlf and hlf were cross correlated with ttcs and tbcs across the sampling rounds to explore the seasonal nature of any associations spearman s rank was used because the variables were non gaussian and because we were most interested in the rank order of the sources as an indicator of relative risk across the community groundwater levels gwls for the most complete record bh alp 3 were hindcasted by 24 days to contextualise groundwater conditions before and during r1 and 2 where gwl observations were not collected hindcasting was conducted using a forward model implementing the water table fluctuation method and assuming diffuse recharge from daily rainfall observations cuthbert et al 2019 the model was parameterised using a linear rainfall recharge relationship with a rainfall threshold of 10 mm an exponential recession coefficient of 1 1 10 3 day 1 to a base of 1149 m asl and a specific yield of 5 the model effectively captures which rainfall events result in groundwater recharge the timing of gwl responses and the rate of recession with an r2 of 0 85 and rmse of 0 23 m figure s2 3 results 3 1 widespread prevalence and high variability of ttcs all sources show evidence of at least intermittent faecal contamination inferred through the presence of ttcs fig 2 a b fifty percent of the sources have median ttcs of at least 88 cfu 100 ml fig 2a with a range in median counts between 1 and 5101 cfu 100 ml the shallow sources cover the entire range in median counts whilst median ttcs at springs and deep sources are in the upper 50 and lower 53 of all sources respectively fig 2a ttcs vary widely at each source with 50 of sources having a range of at least 720 cfu 100 ml fig 2b the range in ttcs at a source is at least 8 cfu 100 ml and up to 34 000 cfu 100 ml with all but two sources varying between risk categories based upon the order of magnitude of ttcs previously defined by who 1997 a third of the sources transit between testing negative and positive for ttcs including the only source with a median count of 1 cfu 100 ml fig 3 d there is a tendency for spring sources to have greater ranges in ttcs than the other types of source fig 2b 3 2 tlf and hlf are superior rapid approaches to indicate ttcs using source medians median tlf is the only significant predictor of median ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml according to logistic regression models β 1 09 p value 0 042 fig 3a table s2 the auc using tlf as a classifier is 0 88 which is closer to the perfect classifier value of 1 than the random selector of 0 5 fig 3a and considered excellent an optimal tlf threshold of 2 2 ppb can be defined to classify ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml with associated false negative and false positive rates of 16 and 25 respectively fig 3c the auc when classifying median ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml using hlf is 0 85 and considered excellent with the logistic regression model being borderline significant β 1 90 p value 0 059 fig 3a a hlf threshold of 0 85 qsu can classify median ttcs of 10 cfu 100 ml with identical error rates to those as the proposed tlf threshold in fact if the tlf ppb threshold is converted into qsu then it is almost equivalent to the hlf threshold the auc is acceptable for sanitary risk scores srs and median total bacterial cells tbcs and demonstrates that sec and turbidity performed no better than a random classifier fig 3a considering only the shallow sources n 32 srs is a significant predictor β 0 90 p value 0 038 with an acceptable auc of 0 79 only one individual sanitary inspection question whether drainage was inadequate is a significant predictor p value 0 05 of median ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml for shallow and deep sources where sanitary inspection questions were identical the auc for inadequate drainage as a classifier is 0 75 and considered acceptable f3 median tlf is very strongly correlated with median ttcs ρs 0 81 fig 3d being the most correlated rapid approach fig 3b all types of water source follow the same rising trend fig 3d with two notable outliers one outlier is a shallow source which has a median tlf of 65 9 ppb more than three times the tlf intensity of any other source although median ttcs are also high at 296 cfu 100 ml the second outlier is a deep source with median ttcs of 89 cfu 100 ml yet the lowest median tlf of 0 5 ppb as well as being the only site with a zero srs median hlf is similarly correlated with median ttcs ρs 0 79 as tlf with identical outliers median tbcs correlate moderately with median ttcs but other rapid indicators are only weakly related to median ttcs fig 3b no other rapid approaches provide additive performance to ln tlf for the prediction of median ln ttcs using the stepwise forward linear regression algorithm the linear regression model has an r2 of 0 51 and p value 0 001 eq 1 omitting ln tlf only ln hlf is included by the algorithm and the model has an r2 of 0 48 and p value 0 001 eq 2 natural log transforms of ttcs tlf and hlf where required in the linear regression models to ensure the model residuals were gaussian see figure s3 for q q plots 1 ln t t c 1 1 66 ln t l f 2 19 2 ln t t c 1 1 44 ln h l f 3 73 3 3 relationships between rapid approaches and ttcs by sampling round ttcs are significantly different between the wet season rounds of r1 r2 and r4 and the dry season rounds of r5 and r6 fig 4 a b median ttcs were higher during than wet season up to 382 cfu 100 ml r1 than the dry season as low as 13 cfu 100 ml r5 fig 4b ttcs rapidly reduced in the absence of large rainfall events for example median ttcs reduced from 382 to 55 cfu 100 ml within 17 23 days between rounds r1 and r3 the two large successive daily rainfall events of 40 mm preceding round r4 resulted in substantial groundwater recharge an almost five fold increase in median ttcs to 262 cfu 100 ml and increases in ttcs at 73 sources tlf shows a similar trend to ttcs across sampling rounds fig 4b significant differences exist between wet and dry season rounds with median tlf being highest in round r1 and lowest in rounds r5 and r6 hlf and tbcs also show significant differences only between wet and dry season rounds with both at minima in the dry season turbidity and sec show the least variability by sampling round with fewest significant differences between rounds tlf is generally the most strongly correlated rapid approach with ttcs in each sampling round fig 4c positive correlations are very strong or strong during the wet season rounds r1 4 but only moderate or weak in dry season rounds r5 and r6 respectively fig 4d the strongest coefficient is during round r4 following the two large successive rainfall events correlation coefficients between hlf and ttcs are similar or marginally lower notably in round r4 than between tlf and ttcs with significant correlations in all rounds fig 4c apart from r6 where significance is borderline p 0 051 tlf and hlf are also better predictors of ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml in the wet season rounds mean auc 0 84 and 0 73 respectively than dry season rounds mean auc 0 68 for both tbcs are intermittently significantly correlated with ttcs with strong ρs 0 70 and moderate ρs 0 56 correlations during rounds r4 and r1 respectively other rapid approaches are rarely significantly correlated with ttcs and coefficients are typically weak or very weak fig 4c only tbcs in the dry season and srs in the wet season have an auc 0 70 for classifying ttcs 10 cfu 100 ml both mean seasonal auc 0 71 there are also notable associations between rapid approaches during rounds r5 and r6 there is an almost perfect positive correlation between tlf and hlf mean ρs 0 97 ρs remains very strong but is lower in rounds r1 4 mean r2 0 88 figure s4 the tlf hlf ratio is higher in rounds r1 4 median 0 95 than r5 6 median 0 70 with the percentage of samples having a ratio 1 also decreasing from 45 to 7 the lower tlf hlf ratio in r5 6 is a result of a greater reduction in tlf relative to hlf fig 4c in rounds r5 and r6 when the relationships between tlf hlf and ttcs weaken tlf and hlf are both strongly positively correlated with tbcs mean ρs 0 62 3 4 cross correlations between rapid approaches and ttcs across sampling rounds there are very strong positive rank cross correlations for both hlf and tlf between sampling rounds at the 36 sources but rank cross correlations are weaker and more varied for ttcs fig 5 a b d the source rank order by hlf is most consistent with a mean ρs of 0 91 σ 0 04 all p values 0 001 and remarkably a ρs of 0 95 between rounds r1 and r6 fig 5b separated by 14 months the mean ρs for tlf is 0 86 with consistently very strong correlations between all rounds σ 0 03 all p values 0 001 the rank order of sources by ttcs is inconsistent moderately correlated on average ρs mean 0 57 σ 0 11 but with only a weak correlation between rounds r1 and r6 fig 5d bulk hydrochemistry rank order of sources as indicated by sec is also consistent between rounds ρs mean 0 90 σ 0 07 fig 5d but sec is unrelated to ttcs fig 4c a survey of tlf or hlf across the community in either the dry or the wet season relates to ttcs during the wet season when ttcs are elevated ranking the sources based on hlf intensity during any sampling round correlates well ρs mean 0 68 σ 0 06 all p values 0 001 with the rank order of the sources by ttcs during the wet season rounds r1 4 fig 5f tlf cross correlates similarly to hlf with ttcs over the same time period ρs mean 0 67 σ 0 09 92 p values 0 001 although some coefficients for round r1 with ttcs are weaker fig 5e note because of the very strong rank correlation between hlf and tlf in the dry season rounds mean ρs 0 97 both rank correlate near identically and strongly with ttcs during the wet season rounds importantly dry season tlf and hlf both mean ρs 0 68 σ 0 05 all p values 0 001 both correlate more strongly than dry season ttcs mean ρs 0 50 σ 0 10 38 p values 0 001 with wet season ttcs 4 discussion 4 1 in situ tlf hlf as rapid approaches to indicate faecal contamination in our study tlf hlf are the superior rapid approaches to indicate faecal contamination of groundwater sources as determined by ttcs to set these results in a wider context we re analysed existing published datasets from contrasting hydrogeological settings following the same statistical approach fig 6 the datasets were collated from i boreholes drilled to a consistent depth in an alluvial aquifer in bihar india n 145 sorensen et al 2016 and ii boreholes n 50 and shallow hand dug wells n 61 tapping either quartzite dolomite or the overlying weathered saprolite laterite respectively in zambia sorensen et al 2015a the re analysis of these datasets demonstrates tlf is an effective significant predictor of the presence absence of ttcs in a 100 ml sample in these other settings fig 6a logistic regression models using tlf are significant p 0 001 and the auc is 0 89 0 94 srs and turbidity perform no better than a random classifier in india whilst both are significant predictors p 0 05 in boreholes in zambia their aucs are much lower than tlf fig 6a the shallow wells in zambia were typically always contaminated with ttcs present in all but 5 of the 61 samples so aucs were not estimated tlf is the most correlated rapid indicator of the number of ttcs in our study and the re analysis of other published data fig 6b in india there is a significant relationship between tlf and ttcs but not between either srs or turbidity and ttcs in zambia tlf is strongly correlated with ttcs in boreholes but only weak relationships exist between srs or turbidity and ttcs correlation coefficients with ttcs also remain strongest for tlf from the rapid approaches in the shallow wells an online application of tlf in groundwater derived public water supplies in the uk has also demonstrated that tlf was better correlated ρs 0 71 with e coli than online turbidity ρs 0 48 sorensen et al 2018a there are alternative groundwater studies that have presented evidence that tlf has been unrelated to fios in groundwater nevertheless tlf has still served as an effective in situ indicator of contamination deriving from faecal matter in these studies for example sorensen et al 2020b showed tlf was related to the density of on site sanitation and associated nitrate but not ttcs beneath dakar senegal this study was also undertaken during the dry season and the results of our study suggests tlf hlf relationships with fios are seasonal and it is possible that during the wet season tlf hlf could relate to fios in dakar alternatively the fluorophores in dakar could relate to historic faecal contamination as also observed at a source adjacent to an abandoned pit latrine in malawi containing perennially high tlf but sporadic and low ttc counts ward et al 2021 there remains inconsistent evidence regarding the use of turbidity and sec buckerfield et al 2019 jung et al 2014 pronk et al 2006 pronk et al 2009 valenzuela et al 2009 or sanitary inspections bain et al 2014 kelly et al 2020 misati et al 2017 to determine faecal contamination risk in groundwater turbidity and sec can derive from a variety of common sources including the re mobilisation of particles within the aquifer and the relationship with faecal indicator bacteria in the literature is consequentially inconsistent who 2017d we consider that tlf hlf are more appropriate indicators of variations in source water quality that relate to faecal contamination a recent review by kelly et al 2020 suggested it was inappropriate to use sanitary inspections as indicators of microbial water quality they argued that microbial samples from the same source are highly varied whereas a sanitary inspection serves as a lasting condition of the water source other limitations of srs are they only represent conditions local to the source whereas rapid subsurface transport of enteric pathogens can occur over large distances in fracture flow aquifers worthington and smart 2017 and it is not possible to assess failure of the sanitary seal subsurface nevertheless sanitary inspections are undoubtedly invaluable irrespective of whether they are indicative of microbial water quality particularly as they provide information about potential risks and causes of contamination to inform interventions 4 2 tlf and hlf are more resilient indicators of faecal contamination risk than ttcs tlf and hlf are more resilient faecal contamination indicators in groundwater than ttcs within our study we highlight comparable observations in zambia where tlf remained elevated in several shallow sources over a period of four months whereas ttcs were only elevated in the wet season sorensen et al 2015a this dynamic was also recently suggested at five water sources in malawi by ward et al 2021 despite tlf remaining seasonally elevated in several zambian sources there was an overall trend towards higher median tlf and ttcs in the wet season 7 1 ppb and 48 cfu 100 ml relative to the dry season 2 8 ppb and 2 cfu 100 ml re analysis of the zambia data demonstrates that the relationship between tlf and ttcs is stronger in the wet ρ 0 82 than the dry season ρ 0 67 moreover there is also a stronger cross correlation between dry season tlf and elevated wet season ttcs ρ 0 80 than dry and wet season ttcs ρ 0 60 in summary both tlf and ttc vary seasonally in uganda and zambia but ranking the sources within a community by faecal contamination risk using tlf is a more temporally robust approach than using ttcs contrasting seasonal variations and relationships between tlf hlf and ttcs suggest tlf hlf differ from ttcs in one or more properties i their source ii their transport properties and or iii their persistence in the subsurface the dominant source term for both types of faecal indicator is likely to be effluent from on site sanitation in urban low income settings where present except potentially where there are naturally high levels of sedimentary fluorescent nom or water is contaminated with fluorescent xenobiotic compounds such as diesel carstea et al 2010 inputs from on site sanitation are likely to be greatest during the wet season particularly following large rainfall events when latrines can be inundated and overflow nayebare et al 2020 and accumulated faecal matter on the ground surface can be mobilised howard et al 2003 there is also likely to be a continuous input function from on site sanitation as pit latrines and septic tanks leak year round the faecal indicators have different transport properties frank et al 2021 demonstrated that dissolved tryptophan was comparable in transit time and recovery to the conservative dye tracer uranine over short distance 2 h tracer tests with no evidence of retardation frank et al also demonstrated similar recovery for a humic acid although there was some evidence of retardation and the tracer peak was marginally delayed by five minutes in comparison to uranine it is unclear what proportion of tlf hlf can be attributed to dissolved pure tryptophan or the humic acid used in any given setting although tlf hlf fluorophores are predominantly extracellular in groundwater sorensen et al 2020a nevertheless there will also be an element of sorption and desorption of dissolved om between groundwater and the aquifer matrix and soils shen et al 2015 particularly for more hydrophobic molecules which may have a tlf hlf component as well as a minor component contained within cells ttcs can be transported more rapidly than solutes notably in heterogeneous media such as weather crystalline rocks but are subject to appreciable attenuation taylor et al 2004 ttcs tend to accumulate and be transported laterally when flow velocities increase who 2017b such as during a rainfall event generating groundwater recharge therefore tlf hlf fluorophores are likely to be more readily and continuously transported than ttcs in groundwater the persistence of tlf hlf fluorophores and ttcs are likely to differ in groundwater hlf is expected to be the most persistent indicator demonstrating the strongest rank order cross correlation between sampling rounds furthermore although hlf decreases in the dry season there is a proportionally greater loss in tlf indicating either preferential breakdown or more efficient lateral transport of tlf fluorophores hlf has been demonstrated to be more recalcitrant resistant to breakdown than tlf in surface water and wastewater cory and kaplan 2012 ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 and a greater proportion of fluorophores are like to be recalcitrant in groundwater where nom is typically less bioavailable chapelle 2021 shen et al 2015 the refractory nature of some hlf fluorophores led zheng et al 2020 to suggest that hlf is an effective tracer of wastewater in groundwater there is also potential for the in situ production of tlf or hlf from nom entering an aquifer system fox et al 2017 yang et al 2020 therefore fluorophore persistence in the subsurface could be a result of the continuous recycling and microbial transformation of nom arriving in the system as opposed to the accumulation of recalcitrant molecules benk et al 2019 roth et al 2019 the dry season relationships between tlf hlf and tbcs when faecal inputs are more limited as also observed in senegal sorensen et al 2020b suggest bacteria are using the nom as a substrate and potentially generating fluorophores in situ irrespective of the relative persistence of either tlf or hlf either wavelength pair would provide a similar indicator of faecal contamination risk given their co correlation in our study and the optical overlap between the peaks ttcs are generally only considered indicative of recent contamination with die off within 16 45 days taylor et al 2004 in contrast to the more persistent fluorescence indicators the more efficient transport of tlf hlf fluorophores and their greater persistence in the subsurface in comparison to ttcs could explain why dry season tlf hlf relates to wet season ttcs firstly more efficient transport could facilitate the perennial transport of tlf hlf fluorophores from a faecal source to a water source whereas ttcs are predominantly mobilised following rainfall in the wet season it should also be re iterated that tlf hlf does also respond to rainfall with higher intensity in the wet season indicating higher seasonal risks secondly faecal contamination events at a water source would remain detectable for a longer period by fluorescing more persistent tlf hlf fluorophores than ttcs if these events are focussed in the wet season as observed here then the proportion of tlf hlf persisting into the dry season may relate to wet season ttcs given the two types of indicator correlate very strongly after heavy rainfall e g tlf ρs 0 83 r4 4 3 remaining uncertainties instrumentation improvements and future work there are a range of potential interferents with in situ fluorescence measurements that are discussed in a review by carstea et al 2020 but these have not adversely impacted previous tlf fio studies sorensen et al 2018b or this study across a range of settings corrections for temperature turbidity and absorbance of light by the sample matrix the inner filtering effect are not likely to be necessary in the majority of groundwater settings khamis et al 2015 sorensen et al 2015a moreover the next generation of commercially available portable fluorimeters are now capable of automatic corrections ph does not have an appreciable impact on tlf hlf between values of 5 and 8 reynolds 2003 spencer et al 2007 and groundwater outside this range is unlikely to be suitable for drinking high concentrations of metal ions could quench fluorescence yang et al 2018 which is most likely where water is contaminated by mining and industry certain water treatments including chlorination also quench fluorescence henderson et al 2009 so the well owner or other informed individuals should be interviewed to assess if the water has been treated prior to testing as would be undertaken before fio sampling alternatively a chlorine residual test could be performed there is the potential for tlf or hlf fluorophores to originate from contamination unrelated to faecal sources such as diesel and fuel derivatives food waste paper mills and pesticides carstea et al 2016 in these instances a source displaying high tlf hlf should still be considered a higher faecal contamination risk than one displaying low tlf hlf as there would be evidence that a pathway is present to a source of anthropogenic waste sedimentary fluorescent nom contained within the aquifer could also potentially be problematic when comparing faecal contamination risks determined by tlf hlf particularly between study areas in which case deviation from baseline fluorescence intensity in uncontaminated sources would be more important than the absolute value for determining risk relatively high upfront costs undoubtedly constrain widespread adoption of in situ fluorescence spectroscopy the present generation of single peak fluorimeters cost in the region of us 5000 7000 before considering accessories that can cost a further us 2000 3000 sorensen et al 2018b however there is substantial scope to reduce these costs through the development of lower cost portable fluorimeters engineered specifically to provide an in situ indication of faecal contamination risk at a water source multiple researchers have developed prototype fluorimeters with various benefits over commercial alternatives bedell et al 2020 bridgeman et al 2015 simões et al 2021 but field validation and a discussion of indicative costs are absent or limited as part of our study we successfully developed and demonstrated the efficacy of a lower cost prototype portable multi wavelength led based fluorimeter on duplicate samples in rounds r5 and r6 figure s5 the prototype provided comparable results to the uvilux sensors in both the laboratory table s5 and field for example the prototype derived hlf data from r5 and r6 both correlate strongly with ttcs in r4 mean ρs 0 69 therefore a low cost portable fluorimeter to indicate faecal contamination risk could be produced for a total component cost of 1100 further details are provided in the supplementary information s1 in addition to reducing costs future development should investigate the production of low cost sealed long life containers of tlf hlf standards these containers would enable calibration checks ideally annually and negative controls to be performed by the end user without return to the manufacturer or access to a well equipped laboratory with reagents and high quality deionised water sorensen et al 2018b it remains unclear how tlf hlf relate to the presence of enteric pathogens or risks posed to human health there is one published study showing a relationship between tlf and dna markers of enteric pathogens although this study is limited to 22 sources in one town sorensen et al 2015b future work should explore the potential link between tlf hlf and enteric pathogens using molecular approaches as well as exploring the viability of pathogens where possible furthermore studies should investigate if and how tlf hlf could effectively be used for on site risk communication to induce behavioural change in communities and reduce the disease burden relating to the consumption of faecally contamination drinking water 5 conclusions in situ fluorescence spectroscopy provides an instantaneous assessment of water source quality that relates to faecal contamination risk determined by faecal indicator organisms fios consequently faecal contamination risks can be assessed immediately including in real time and could be communicated on site to consumers to reduce exposure to contamination whilst confirmative regulatory fio analysis is undertaken furthermore in situ fluorescence can extend fio sampling programs because data can be collected rapidly by users who require minimal training nor are there consumable costs for additional samples tlf and hlf are more resilient indicators of faecal contamination risk than fios both types of indicator respond to rainfall and contamination events with the strongest relationships between the indicators observed in the wet season notably immediately after heavy rainfall e g tlf ttc ρs 0 83 however ranking the sources across a community by risk using fios is more variable cross correlations ρs 0 34 72 between sampling rounds than using tlf or hlf cross correlations ρs 0 81 97 this ranking of sources using tlf hlf at any point in time relates to ttcs during the wet season when ttcs are significantly elevated and risks to human health would consequently also be expected to be greatest furthermore the source rank orders in the dry season using tlf hlf cross correlate more strongly both mean ρs 0 68 with wet season ttcs than dry season ttcs mean ρs 0 50 therefore the comparative faecal contamination risks between sources generated by a dry season survey of tlf hlf would be more accurate than using highly transient fios to indicate the comparative risks occurring in the wet season when risks are elevated this characteristic is advantageous given water quality surveys are infrequent for private water supplies globally as well as across low income countries tlf hlf provide a more repeatable and temporally robust approach than fios to ranking sources by faecal contamination risk across a community to strategise prioritisation of sources for drinking or interventions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16554,shortwave radiation longwave radiation photovoltaic pv panel air and near surface water temperature data were measured for a floating pv system installed in a shallow tropical reservoir similar air and water temperature measurements were conducted in open water ambient condition for comparison the data indicate that shortwave radiation is reduced significantly under the pv panels while the longwave radiation increased and in fact became higher than the shortwave radiation as compared to open water conditions the air temperature and the water temperature under the pv panels are higher than in open water a numerical model was developed to predict the pv panel temperature air and water temperatures beneath the panels and to investigate the heat balance at the reservoir surface beneath the panels the modelled air and pv panel temperatures were in good agreement with the field data the modelled surface water temperature also replicated field measurements showing an increase of about 0 5 c as compared to the open water temperature heat budget analysis showed that the thermal dynamics under the pv panels is mainly controlled by the longwave radiation from the pv panels and reduction in latent heat flux the altered flux conditions beneath the panels result in a higher equilibrium temperature near the water surface compared to open water conditions 1 introduction energy production from renewable technologies has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade contributing 26 of global energy generation in 2018 and having an estimated additional capacity of 181 gw in 2018 net capacity additions for renewable power also were higher than for fossil fuels and nuclear combined from 2015 to 2018 ren21 2019 part of this growth trend can be attributed to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change e g ellabban et al 2014 cazzaniga and rosa clot 2020 and to a lesser extent concerns about the viability of nuclear power chu and majumdar 2012 joskow and parsons 2012 lechtenböhmer and samadi 2013 nesheiwat and cross 2013 levelized costs for renewables are decreasing ren21 2019 cazzaniga and rosa clot 2020 and mathiesen et al 2011 note that renewables can have positive socio economic impact photovoltaic pv power generation is one of the renewable energy sources that has received interest with global capacity experiencing a 10 fold increase in the five years prior to 2014 ellabban et al 2014 and a 28 increase in capacity in 2015 alone greater than any other renewable energy source ren21 2016 photovoltaic technology directly converts sunlight into energy without the need of a heat engine and is flexible enough as a standalone system to have a range of applications from microscale e g individual sensors for a smart city to megawatt utility scale power plants parida et al 2011 hosenuzzaman et al 2015 sahu et al 2016 utility scale pv plants are land intensive and as a result countries around the world including singapore japan south korea and china are starting to investigate the use of floating pv systems installed in lakes reservoirs and coastal zones choi et al 2016 sahu et al 2016 waithiru et al 2018 gorjian et al 2021 floating pv systems have also been proposed to be used in hybrid energy generation systems solomin et al 2021 trapani and redon santafe 2015 reviewed 19 floating pv installations from countries including japan u s a canada italy spain france south korea and singapore a number of these installations were sited in irrigation ponds or reservoirs an additional reported advantage of floating pv systems over land based pv systems is a general higher generation efficiency due to the cooling effect of the water waithiru et al 2018 el hammoumi et al 2021 zsiborács et al 2016 note that the generation efficiency for crystalline silicon pv which is most commonly employed in pv generally decreases by 0 5 with each 1 c increase in temperature sahu et al 2016 reported that floating pv installations have on average an 11 higher generation efficiency due to cooler temperatures while trapani and redon santafe 2015 indicated that for a demonstration project in italy a 20 25 increase in efficiency was observed due to the cooler water temperatures floating pv installations are a more recent development than land based pv generation modules and as such little work has been done to assess water quality and ecosystem impacts from floating pv installations da silva and branco 2018 gorjian et al 2021 some studies have indicated with no empirical measurements that algae growth will be reduced due to shading and this will improve water quality trapani and redon santafe 2015 sahu et al 2016 cazzaniga and rosa clot 2020 in a more recent modelling effort yang et al submitted showed that algal levels in a reservoir with a 49 cover from solar panels are expected to decrease with attendant increases in water column total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations it also has been suggested but without empirical evidence that floating pv installations will reduce evaporation from the water body ferrer gisbert et al 2013 trapani and redon santafe 2015 sahu et al 2016 perez et al 2018 gorjian et al 2021 the concept of reducing reservoir evaporation using some type of surface cover is not new e g crow 1973 assouline et al 2011 but the effect of the pv configuration and thermal response have not been thoroughly investigated this thermal response may be complicated because only about 20 of absorbed light energy is transformed into electricity with conventional pv technology while most of the remaining energy is turned into heat within the solar cell saadah et al 2017 the impact of the shift in radiation and energy balances and the effect on water temperature and heat balance and hence evaporation has not been studied in detail given the growing importance of pv installations and particularly the new focus on floating pv together with our limited understanding of the environmental impacts of such installations the overall aim of our study was to elucidate the heat transfer process between the floating pv panels and the water surface beneath the panels this includes the development of a numerical model to estimate the near surface water temperature under the panels in future this numerical model could be incorporated in a lake model to provide the radiative fluxes at the water surface for investigations of lake hydrodynamics and ecology with this overall aim in mind the specific objectives of this paper were i empirically assess the impact of pv installation on radiation non radiative energy and temperature by analysing continuous temperature and radiometer measurements from paired sites in open water and below a floating pv installation ii develop a numerical model by considering the heat transfer process between the pv panel and water surface to predict the pv panel air and near surface water temperatures beneath the pv panels and iii understand water temperature change through a study of the heat budget under the pv panels 2 study site and data used the study was conducted as part of a floating pv test bed conducted by pub singapore s national water agency and the economic development board edb singapore the entire pv test bed covered an area of 1 ha on tengeh reservoir but consisted of a number of different pv module clusters of approximately 900 m2 in size provided by different suppliers details of the test bed configuration and energy production are provided by liu et al 2018 radiometers kipp zonen cnr4 were operated from 06 feb 2017 to 31 dec 2017 to measure and log at 10 minute intervals shortwave and longwave radiation under the pv panels and installed atop an access floating walkway to represent below panel and open water conditions respectively fig 1 each radiometer is made up of two thermopile pyranometers for incoming outgoing shortwave radiation measurements two pyrgeometers for incoming outgoing longwave radiation measurements and a temperature sensor the uncertainty in daily total of the pyranometer and pyrgeometer is 5 and 10 respectively air temperature was measured using thermistors with an accuracy of approximately 0 2 c two ysi 6920 datasondes also were installed on site one was attached from the railing of the walkway fig 1 c adjacent to the radiometer to represent open water conditions while the other was installed under one cluster of the test bed on 21 june 2017 fig 1 b the ysi suspended from the walkway beneath the open water radiometer is hereafter referred to as the open water ysi while the ysi under the larger solar panel configuration is referred to as the below panel ysi the ysi units were programmed to record temperature at 15 minute intervals at a depth of 0 8 m below the water surface routine data download and sensor cleaning were done on a weekly basis and all sensors were calibrated prior to installation following procedures outlined by irvine et al 2005 and irvine et al 2011 lastly the temperature of solar panels was also measured the radiation measurements overlap with ysi and panel temperature measurements for a three week period from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 3 analysis 3 1 heat budget radiation at the water surface comprises incoming and reflected shortwave radiation 300 2800 nm and longwave radiation 2800 nm which is made up of incoming reflected and radiation emitted by the waterbody to understand the impact of the pv panels we compared the energy budget for open water and underneath the pv panels in general the energy budget across the water surface is a balance of radiative and non radiative heat energies adapted from oke 2002 1 q net surface q sw in q sw out q lw in q lw out q s q l where qnet surface is

either measured or calculated from air temperature under open water conditions under the panel the net long wave radiation qlw net qlw net qlw in qlw out can be estimated by duffie and beckman 2006 2

the values of εpv and εwater adopted were 0 91 hammami et al 2017 and 0 96 respectively for open water conditions the calculation of qs and ql follows the standard bulk formula by hicks 1972 3 q s ρ a

are calculated 3 2 heat transfer for pv panels eq 2 requires knowledge of tpv which is driven by solar heating and follows a diurnal pattern of heating during the daytime and cooling almost equilibrating with ambient air temperature at night a numerical model was developed adopting the approach similar to studies by armstrong and hurley 2010 siddiqui et al 2012 and kaplani 2014 which take into account convective heat transfer in the form of free convection and forced convection and radiative heat transfer between the atmosphere pv panel and air layer a schematic diagram for the model is shown in fig 2 the heat transfer between the panel and air layer is governed by 9 ρ i c p i t i x y t q q i where cp i is the specific heat capacity of each layer cp for the pv panel 677 j kg

qi is the heat generated inside the pv panels the following assumptions were made i the temperature across the thickness of the pv panel was allowed to vary in response to different conditions at the upper and lower edges of the panel ii the temperature of the outer edges of the panel and air layer below the panel were set to ambient temperature and iii only the panel material was considered in the heat budget calculations the supporting panel frames and other structures were neglected the internal heat generation qi which stems from solar radiation is calculated using the following equation siddiqui et al 2012 10 q i 1 η pv q sw a panel v pv cell where η pv is the electrical efficiency of the pv panel taken as 0 1 siddiqui et al 2012 a panel is the front area of the pv panel and the v pv cell is the volume of the pv cells in the panel the ratio of v pv cell a panel is about the thickness of the pv panels which is about 5 cm convection and radiation boundary conditions were applied to the top and bottom surface of the pv panels as well as of the air layer below the convective heat transfer at these boundaries is given as 11 q boundary h conv δ t where hconv is the convective heat transfer coefficient and δ t is the temperature difference across the air pv boundaries hconv at either the top or bottom surfaces is a sum of forced and free components 12 h c o n v h c o n v f o r c e d h c o n v f r e e where hconv forced and hconv free are the forced and free convective heat transfer coefficients respectively following siddiqui et al 2012 hconv forced and hconv free at either the top or bottom surfaces were calculated using the nusselt number nu 13 n u h conv l k a where ka is the thermal conductivity of air 0 02588 w 1 m 1 k 1 at 30 c l is the length of the module along

similarly hconv free was determined by adopting lloyd and moran 1974 15 n u 0 76 r a 1 4 when 10 4 r a 10 7 0 15 r a 1 3 when 10 7 r a 3 10 7 the rayleigh number ra was calculated by incropera and

model are summarised in tables s1 and s2 as supplementary material the numerical model predicts tpv ta and ts beneath the panels from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 when complete field data were available for comparison the modelling procedure is shown in fig 3 the initial conditions beneath the panels were set to the same as open water conditions which were obtained via measurement the measured values for ts qsw qlw tamb rhamb and wind speed at 19 00 21 june 2017 were adopted as the initial condition the choice of qsw tamb and rhamb as inputs was deliberate since these measurements are readily available and secondly is consistent with the inputs used in a lake model at each time interval the first step in the computational procedure involves the calculation of the convective heat transfer coefficients following eq 12 to 16 then the partial differential equation toolbox in matlab was used to solve eq 9 for tpv and ta next qlw net under the panel was calculated using eq 2 where ts from the previous time step was used as an approximation since ts for the current time step has not been determined yet this results in a lag of 1 hr which is considered acceptable given that heating cooling cycles at a time scale of 24 hrs and changes to ts are gradual due to the high value of cpwater vapor pressure or relative humidity is a factor influencing evaporation rates from the water surface and is required in eq 6 and 7 to calculate qs and ql under the panels where rh may decrease owing to the increase in ta however this may in turn increase evaporation rates increasing the vapour pressure driving rh closer to ambient conditions thus rhpv may be less than rhamb since ta tamb however if evaporation rates beneath the panels are greater than open water this may result in rhpv rhamb the actual values of rhpv are not known since they were not measured however two cases were investigated by making the following approximations i rha rhamb and ii ea eamb and calculating rha at temperature ta the model was run independently using these two approximations and the utility of either of these approaches was made based on the comparison of the measured and calculated values ts beneath the panel since rha is expected to directly affect ts with this all the necessary components for the determination of qnet surface are known and δts could be determined based on eq 8 in this case for a depth of 0 8 m 4 results and discussion 4 1 field measurements simultaneous time series measurements of qsw qlw tpv ta and ts from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 for both open water and below panel conditions are presented in fig 4 which shows that qsw net under the pv panels fig 4 a is low most of the time with a peak value of about 20 w m2 this is much lower than qsw net in open water which peaks between 500 and 1000 w m2 the alteration to qlw net fig 4 b is just as significant where qlw net under the pv panels is considerably greater compared to open water furthermore while qlw net for open water is always negative qlw net shows large positive peaks during the day with values up to 100 w m2 as a result of heating from the panels under the panels qlw net is negative at night although less negative compared to open water conditions as a result qlw net is positive on average under the panels although qlw net is greater on the whole however the net radiation or qsw net qlw net is smaller mainly due to the large reduction in qsw net from 153 w m2 in open water to 4 7 w m2 below the panel fig 4 c shows tpv and compares tamb and ts amb for open water and ta and ts beneath the pv panels the heat capacity effect is apparent as a clear lag exists in the temperature peaks between ta and ts photovoltaic panels are known to heat significantly and peak values of up to 50 c were observed in the measurements the pv panels in turn heat up the air layer under the panels and thus ta is consistently higher than tamb solar radiation in the tropics has little variation over the course of a year only showing distinct daily variations on a typical day coupled with relatively low values of cpair and cppanel tpv and ta respond strongly to changes in qsw net and exhibit a clear diurnal pattern with increasing values during the day during the daytime peak ta is typically 5 6 c higher than tamb with the difference becoming only about 1 c during the night these trends are noticeably weaker on days when albedo is high as observed in fig 4 c the diurnal heating pattern is less distinct on 23 june 27 june and 05 july 2017 when qsw net is reduced due to cloud cover and rainfall and tpv and ta are observed to be significantly lower than other days in open water conditions average ts amb is higher than average ambient air temperature tamb during the measurement period which gives rise to cooling at the water surface in open water the average value of ts is greater than ta with ts and ta about 29 3 c and 28 2 c respectively under the panels the average values of ts and ta are similar about 29 8 c the increase in water surface temperature over open water conditions is also clear with the surface water under the panels consistently about 0 5 c higher than open water the equality in temperature across the air water interface under the panels can reduce the surface cooling 4 2 comparison of calculated ts tpv and ta with measured data temperature distributions predicted by the numerical model within the pv panel and air layer below the panels are shown in fig 5 for 1 july 2017 00 00 midnight and 12 00 noon temperatures are close to tamb at midnight consistent with measurements shown in fig 4 c at noon the pv panel heats up which creates a vertical temperature gradient the panel temperature is in excess of 40 c while air temperature near the water surface is about 34 c in close agreement with measurements the results of ts tpv and ta estimated from the two approximations for rh are compared with measured data for the period 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 comparison of average values and error statistics are provided in table 1 and detailed time series comparisons are shown in fig 6 it is apparent from fig 6 a that the rha rhamb assumption gives a better estimate of ts providing better agreement with the measurements of ts and would suggest that rha is close to rhamb with the exception of 29 june the computed ts matches the measured data well with the trends in calculated results following the measured data the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r values are 0 30 c and 0 70 p 05 respectively consistent with field observations ts is consistently higher than the open water surface temperature by about 0 5 c the good general agreement between the modelled ts with measurements indicate that the results are reasonable for heat budget calculations calculated values of tpv are compared against measurements in fig 6 b although measured data are available for only a limited time period the comparison is good with the rmse and r between the calculated and measured tpv being approximately 1 2 c and 0 99 p 05 respectively calculated values of ta from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 are compared against measurements in fig 6 c once again there is good agreement between the measured and calculated ta values with rmse r values of about 1 2 c 0 95 p 05 respectively the heating process is governed by variations in insolation during the daytime the pv panels are heated and tpv increases quickly up to as high as 50 c due to the relatively small value of cp panel the air layer under the pv panels is also heated quickly up to 40 c since cp air is only slightly larger than cp panel tpv and ta peak at about the same time the change in conditions in the air layer induced by panel heating creates an artificial condition above the water surface the change in ts is governed by the radiative exchange at the water surface through qnet surface which is discussed in section 4 3 suffice it to say here that the artificially imposed condition above the water surface results in an increase in ts compared to open water the actual value of ts would have to be determined by radiative balance conditions which is discussed in section 4 3 in addition to prescribing rha rhamb or ea eamb in the calculation of ts zero wind condition under the panels was also assumed as a first approximation the good agreement between the calculated and measured ts seems to justify these assumptions however measurements of rha and wind will be necessary to validate these assumptions because of the large specific heat capacity of water the model shows that the peak in ts up to 31 c occurs about 2 to 3 h after the peak in tpv and ta the dependence on insolation is also apparent on days where there was significant rainfall and high levels of albedo recorded on 22 june 26 june and 5 july 2017 during these three days the diurnal heating pattern of the surface water temperature is less distinct and temperature peaks are modest at night when qsw is absent the pv panels and the air layer cool quickly with ta almost reaching ambient levels fig 6 c consequently ts decreases but remains higher than the open water temperature by around 0 5 c the time lag of 2 to 3 h is also observed in the cooling process the model is capable of capturing these trends in the measured data with a good level of accuracy 4 3 comparison of heat budgets in calculating the radiative energy entering the water surface qlw net must be known in open water this is either measured or estimated from temperature measurements beneath the panels qlw net was estimated using eq 2 and comparison of the calculated and measured qlw net beneath the panels is made in table 1 and fig 7 the figure shows a strong correspondence between modelled and measured insolation with the r being 0 98 p 05 since the calculation involves tpv and ts both of these temperatures are also well predicted the reduction in qlw net during the three days 22 june 26 june and 5 july 2017 with heavy rainfall is also apparent as noted previously the diurnal behaviour of the major surface heating components can be seen from a 24 hr ensemble of the data shown in fig 8 although the data is for a limited period daily insolation patterns do not vary much in the tropics and the results shown are reflective of conditions throughout a year in open water surface water temperature is solely heated by shortwave radiation the sensible heat in open water ranges from 5 to 10 w m2 fig 8 a the sensible heat contributes only 1 of cooling the water temperature during the daytime and 4 during the nighttime the longwave radiation in open water ranges from 50 to 30 w m2 the daytime cooling effect due to longwave radiation in open water is about 12 of total energy loss and the nighttime is even larger 18 in total the long wave radiation contributes around 30 of the heat loss of surface water on a daily basis in open water condition latent heat in open water ranges from 120 to 50 w m2 and contributes about 65 of heat loss over a 24 hr period with equal amounts occurring during the day night the magnitudes of the energy components below the pv panels are much smaller than in open water the water surface below the pv panels receives only about 3 of original shortwave radiation with a mean of about 5 w m2 the qlw net from the pv panels becomes the most dominant energy component for the surface water under the pv panels fluctuating from 20 to 100 w m2 during the daytime it contributes around 72 of the heat source while during the night it contributes 48 of the heat loss as wind speed would be reduced underneath the pv panels the qs and ql are much less efficient in cooling compared to open water qs ranges between 13 to 5 w m2 and contributes about 11 of heating energy during the daytime and 6 of cooling energy during the night ql occurs within the range of 20 to 2 w m2 contributing 47 of the heat loss with 18 occurring during the daytime and 29 during the night the heat budgets averaged over the 14 day period for open water and beneath the pv panels for the measurement period are summarised in table 2 the open water heat budgets are in agreement with results of the 60 day period from 13 april 2007 to 11 june 2007 reported by xing et al 2012 for the kranji reservoir which is located close to tengeh the values of net radiation or qsw net qlw net qs and ql reported by xing et al 2012 are 91 1 8 5 and 77 6 w m2 respectively xing et al 2012 reported an imbalance of 5 w m2 for the four major heat components whereas an imbalance of 9 w m2 table 2 was obtained in the present study this is considered acceptable given that the current analysis was conducted for a limited period of 14 days and 10 years later over a longer period with concurrent measurement on the two reservoirs these differences are expected to even out nevertheless the general agreement between the current results and the 60 day assessment by xing et al 2012 provides an indication that the measurements reported herein can be considered to be representative of open water conditions and can be used as a basis for comparison with the heat budget beneath the panel as summarized in table 2 the imbalance beneath the panels is about 5 7 w m2 which can be attributed to uncertainties in estimates of ql due to approximations of zero wind speed and equality of rha with rhamb the pv panel exerts significant influence on the energy budget in open water heating effects of qsw net are mainly balanced by evaporative cooling and qlw net beneath the panels this radiative flux condition is drastically altered qsw net is significantly reduced both ql and qs become positive and the latent heat flux is much reduced these results show that the alteration of the heat flux conditions across the water surface results in the energy balance occurring at an equilibrium temperature ts which is higher than ts amb this accounts for the increase in surface water temperatures beneath the panels compared to open water shown in fig 4 c lastly the energy flux below the panels is reduced considerably by a factor of 6 5 times in open water rendering the energy balance condition sensitive to small changes to radiation conditions in the system 5 conclusions this study provides a first estimate of the heat budget below floating pv panels the study proposes a complete workflow from data collection heat budget calculation procedure and numerical model to study the heat transfer process between the panel and water surface the model can be used to calculate the air temperature and surface water temperature and can be coupled with a lake model to understand floating pv effects on thermal structure the following can be concluded from this study i an analysis of continuous measurements of radiation and temperature from a paired open water reservoir site and below a floating pv installation showed that both radiation and temperature are significantly altered beneath the panels shortwave radiation is reduced to approximately 20 w m2 from daily peaks of 500 1000 w m2 longwave radiation is increased due to the heating of the pv panels and varies with insolation showing strong peaks of approximately 100 w m2 net longwave radiation under the panel is positive compared to open water which is always negative the temperatures of the pv panel and air layer below the panel likewise vary strongly with insolation panel temperatures peak at 50 c while the temperature of the air layer is higher than the ambient air temperature significantly the average air and water temperatures are similar compared to open water where the average water temperature is higher than air temperature this equality in temperatures reduces the potential for the surface layer to cool ii a numerical model simulating the heat transfer process between the panel air and water layers was developed the model captures the radiation and temperature dynamics which are strongly driven by insolation predictions of longwave radiation and pv panel air layer and near surface water temperatures compared well with field measurements iii the model results were used to calculate the heat budget under the panel which was compared to the open water condition in open water cooling exerted by sensible and latent heat fluxes and net longwave radiation is balanced by heating from sunlight panel placement imposes a change to this energy balance resulting in heating and cooling largely driven by long wave radiation as the water surface is sheltered from the short wave radiation and wind the surface energy balance beneath the panels occurs at a higher water temperature the model assumption that the relative humidity beneath the panel is equal to ambient conditions produces better agreement for predictions of the near surface water temperature suggesting that the relative humidities are similar the assumption of zero wind speed below the panels also appears reasonable as a first approximation but further measurements are required to validate our assumptions here quantitative assessments of pv systems to date generally focus on production performance that may be influenced by a host of meteorological variables the data and model presented here approach the issue from the opposite direction and considerably advance the relatively limited quantitative information available on the environmental impacts of floating pv with a specific focus on energy budgets moving forward some of our model assumptions need further verification through additional empirical measurements and the energy budget model needs to be seamlessly incorporated within a reservoir model to examine potential water quality and

16554,shortwave radiation longwave radiation photovoltaic pv panel air and near surface water temperature data were measured for a floating pv system installed in a shallow tropical reservoir similar air and water temperature measurements were conducted in open water ambient condition for comparison the data indicate that shortwave radiation is reduced significantly under the pv panels while the longwave radiation increased and in fact became higher than the shortwave radiation as compared to open water conditions the air temperature and the water temperature under the pv panels are higher than in open water a numerical model was developed to predict the pv panel temperature air and water temperatures beneath the panels and to investigate the heat balance at the reservoir surface beneath the panels the modelled air and pv panel temperatures were in good agreement with the field data the modelled surface water temperature also replicated field measurements showing an increase of about 0 5 c as compared to the open water temperature heat budget analysis showed that the thermal dynamics under the pv panels is mainly controlled by the longwave radiation from the pv panels and reduction in latent heat flux the altered flux conditions beneath the panels result in a higher equilibrium temperature near the water surface compared to open water conditions 1 introduction energy production from renewable technologies has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade contributing 26 of global energy generation in 2018 and having an estimated additional capacity of 181 gw in 2018 net capacity additions for renewable power also were higher than for fossil fuels and nuclear combined from 2015 to 2018 ren21 2019 part of this growth trend can be attributed to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change e g ellabban et al 2014 cazzaniga and rosa clot 2020 and to a lesser extent concerns about the viability of nuclear power chu and majumdar 2012 joskow and parsons 2012 lechtenböhmer and samadi 2013 nesheiwat and cross 2013 levelized costs for renewables are decreasing ren21 2019 cazzaniga and rosa clot 2020 and mathiesen et al 2011 note that renewables can have positive socio economic impact photovoltaic pv power generation is one of the renewable energy sources that has received interest with global capacity experiencing a 10 fold increase in the five years prior to 2014 ellabban et al 2014 and a 28 increase in capacity in 2015 alone greater than any other renewable energy source ren21 2016 photovoltaic technology directly converts sunlight into energy without the need of a heat engine and is flexible enough as a standalone system to have a range of applications from microscale e g individual sensors for a smart city to megawatt utility scale power plants parida et al 2011 hosenuzzaman et al 2015 sahu et al 2016 utility scale pv plants are land intensive and as a result countries around the world including singapore japan south korea and china are starting to investigate the use of floating pv systems installed in lakes reservoirs and coastal zones choi et al 2016 sahu et al 2016 waithiru et al 2018 gorjian et al 2021 floating pv systems have also been proposed to be used in hybrid energy generation systems solomin et al 2021 trapani and redon santafe 2015 reviewed 19 floating pv installations from countries including japan u s a canada italy spain france south korea and singapore a number of these installations were sited in irrigation ponds or reservoirs an additional reported advantage of floating pv systems over land based pv systems is a general higher generation efficiency due to the cooling effect of the water waithiru et al 2018 el hammoumi et al 2021 zsiborács et al 2016 note that the generation efficiency for crystalline silicon pv which is most commonly employed in pv generally decreases by 0 5 with each 1 c increase in temperature sahu et al 2016 reported that floating pv installations have on average an 11 higher generation efficiency due to cooler temperatures while trapani and redon santafe 2015 indicated that for a demonstration project in italy a 20 25 increase in efficiency was observed due to the cooler water temperatures floating pv installations are a more recent development than land based pv generation modules and as such little work has been done to assess water quality and ecosystem impacts from floating pv installations da silva and branco 2018 gorjian et al 2021 some studies have indicated with no empirical measurements that algae growth will be reduced due to shading and this will improve water quality trapani and redon santafe 2015 sahu et al 2016 cazzaniga and rosa clot 2020 in a more recent modelling effort yang et al submitted showed that algal levels in a reservoir with a 49 cover from solar panels are expected to decrease with attendant increases in water column total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations it also has been suggested but without empirical evidence that floating pv installations will reduce evaporation from the water body ferrer gisbert et al 2013 trapani and redon santafe 2015 sahu et al 2016 perez et al 2018 gorjian et al 2021 the concept of reducing reservoir evaporation using some type of surface cover is not new e g crow 1973 assouline et al 2011 but the effect of the pv configuration and thermal response have not been thoroughly investigated this thermal response may be complicated because only about 20 of absorbed light energy is transformed into electricity with conventional pv technology while most of the remaining energy is turned into heat within the solar cell saadah et al 2017 the impact of the shift in radiation and energy balances and the effect on water temperature and heat balance and hence evaporation has not been studied in detail given the growing importance of pv installations and particularly the new focus on floating pv together with our limited understanding of the environmental impacts of such installations the overall aim of our study was to elucidate the heat transfer process between the floating pv panels and the water surface beneath the panels this includes the development of a numerical model to estimate the near surface water temperature under the panels in future this numerical model could be incorporated in a lake model to provide the radiative fluxes at the water surface for investigations of lake hydrodynamics and ecology with this overall aim in mind the specific objectives of this paper were i empirically assess the impact of pv installation on radiation non radiative energy and temperature by analysing continuous temperature and radiometer measurements from paired sites in open water and below a floating pv installation ii develop a numerical model by considering the heat transfer process between the pv panel and water surface to predict the pv panel air and near surface water temperatures beneath the pv panels and iii understand water temperature change through a study of the heat budget under the pv panels 2 study site and data used the study was conducted as part of a floating pv test bed conducted by pub singapore s national water agency and the economic development board edb singapore the entire pv test bed covered an area of 1 ha on tengeh reservoir but consisted of a number of different pv module clusters of approximately 900 m2 in size provided by different suppliers details of the test bed configuration and energy production are provided by liu et al 2018 radiometers kipp zonen cnr4 were operated from 06 feb 2017 to 31 dec 2017 to measure and log at 10 minute intervals shortwave and longwave radiation under the pv panels and installed atop an access floating walkway to represent below panel and open water conditions respectively fig 1 each radiometer is made up of two thermopile pyranometers for incoming outgoing shortwave radiation measurements two pyrgeometers for incoming outgoing longwave radiation measurements and a temperature sensor the uncertainty in daily total of the pyranometer and pyrgeometer is 5 and 10 respectively air temperature was measured using thermistors with an accuracy of approximately 0 2 c two ysi 6920 datasondes also were installed on site one was attached from the railing of the walkway fig 1 c adjacent to the radiometer to represent open water conditions while the other was installed under one cluster of the test bed on 21 june 2017 fig 1 b the ysi suspended from the walkway beneath the open water radiometer is hereafter referred to as the open water ysi while the ysi under the larger solar panel configuration is referred to as the below panel ysi the ysi units were programmed to record temperature at 15 minute intervals at a depth of 0 8 m below the water surface routine data download and sensor cleaning were done on a weekly basis and all sensors were calibrated prior to installation following procedures outlined by irvine et al 2005 and irvine et al 2011 lastly the temperature of solar panels was also measured the radiation measurements overlap with ysi and panel temperature measurements for a three week period from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 3 analysis 3 1 heat budget radiation at the water surface comprises incoming and reflected shortwave radiation 300 2800 nm and longwave radiation 2800 nm which is made up of incoming reflected and radiation emitted by the waterbody to understand the impact of the pv panels we compared the energy budget for open water and underneath the pv panels in general the energy budget across the water surface is a balance of radiative and non radiative heat energies adapted from oke 2002 1 q net surface q sw in q sw out q lw in q lw out q s q l where qnet surface is

either measured or calculated from air temperature under open water conditions under the panel the net long wave radiation qlw net qlw net qlw in qlw out can be estimated by duffie and beckman 2006 2

the values of εpv and εwater adopted were 0 91 hammami et al 2017 and 0 96 respectively for open water conditions the calculation of qs and ql follows the standard bulk formula by hicks 1972 3 q s ρ a

kg to balance the net heat flux qnet surface below the panel in the numerical model presented in section 3 3 with the exception of qsw net which was measured other heat components qlw net qs and ql are calculated 3 2 heat transfer for pv panels eq 2 requires knowledge of tpv which is driven by solar heating and follows a diurnal pattern of heating during the daytime and cooling almost equilibrating with ambient air temperature at night a numerical model was developed adopting the approach similar to studies by armstrong and hurley 2010 siddiqui et al 2012 and kaplani 2014 which take into account convective heat transfer in the form of free convection and forced convection and radiative heat transfer between the atmosphere pv panel and air layer a schematic diagram for the model is shown in fig 2 the heat transfer between the panel and air layer is governed by 9 ρ i c p i t i x y t q q i where cp i is the specific heat capacity of each layer cp for the pv panel 677 j kg

qi is the heat generated inside the pv panels the following assumptions were made i the temperature across the thickness of the pv panel was allowed to vary in response to different conditions at the upper and lower edges of the panel ii the temperature of the outer edges of the panel and air layer below the panel were set to ambient temperature and iii only the panel material was considered in the heat budget calculations the supporting panel frames and other structures were neglected the internal heat generation qi which stems from solar radiation is calculated using the following equation siddiqui et al 2012 10 q i 1 η pv q sw a panel v pv cell where η pv is the electrical efficiency of the pv panel taken as 0 1 siddiqui et al 2012 a panel is the front area of the pv panel and the v pv cell is the volume of the pv cells in the panel the ratio of v pv cell a panel is about the thickness of the pv panels which is about 5 cm convection and radiation boundary conditions were applied to the top and bottom surface of the pv panels as well as of the air layer below the convective heat transfer at these boundaries is given as 11 q boundary h conv δ t where hconv is the convective heat transfer coefficient and δ t is the temperature difference across the air pv boundaries hconv at either the top or bottom surfaces is a sum of forced and free components 12 h c o n v h c o n v f o r c

similarly hconv free was determined by adopting lloyd and moran 1974 15 n u 0 76 r a 1 4 when 10 4 r a 10 7 0 15 r a 1 3 when 10 7 r a 3 10 7 the rayleigh number ra was calculated by incropera and

model are summarised in tables s1 and s2 as supplementary material the numerical model predicts tpv ta and ts beneath the panels from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 when complete field data were available for comparison the modelling procedure is shown in fig 3 the initial conditions beneath the panels were set to the same as open water conditions which were obtained via measurement the measured values for ts qsw qlw tamb rhamb and wind speed at 19 00 21 june 2017 were adopted as the initial condition the choice of qsw tamb and rhamb as inputs was deliberate since these measurements are readily available and secondly is consistent with the inputs used in a lake model at each time interval the first step in the computational procedure involves the calculation of the convective heat transfer coefficients following eq 12 to 16 then the partial differential equation toolbox in matlab was used to solve eq 9 for tpv and ta next qlw net under the panel was calculated using eq 2 where ts from the previous time step was used as an approximation since ts for the current time step has not been determined yet this results in a lag of 1 hr which is considered acceptable given that heating cooling cycles at a time scale of 24 hrs and changes to ts are gradual due to the high value of cpwater vapor pressure or relative humidity is a factor influencing evaporation rates from the water surface and is required in eq 6 and 7 to calculate qs and ql under the panels where rh may decrease owing to the increase in ta however this may in turn increase evaporation rates increasing the vapour pressure driving rh closer to ambient conditions thus rhpv may be less than rhamb since ta tamb however if evaporation rates beneath the panels are greater than open water this may result in rhpv rhamb the actual values of rhpv are not known since they were not measured however two cases were investigated by making the following approximations i rha rhamb and ii ea eamb and calculating rha at temperature ta the model was run independently using these two approximations and the utility of either of these approaches was made based on the comparison of the measured and calculated values ts beneath the panel since rha is expected to directly affect ts with this all the necessary components for the determination of qnet surface are known and δts could be determined based on eq 8 in this case for a depth of 0 8 m 4 results and discussion 4 1 field measurements simultaneous time series measurements of qsw qlw tpv ta and ts from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 for both open water and below panel conditions are presented in fig 4 which shows that qsw net under the pv panels fig 4 a is low most of the time with a peak value of about 20 w m2 this is much lower than qsw net in open water which peaks between 500 and 1000 w m2 the alteration to qlw net fig 4 b is just as significant where qlw net under the pv panels is considerably greater compared to open water furthermore while qlw net for open water is always negative qlw net shows large positive peaks during the day with values up to 100 w m2 as a result of heating from the panels under the panels qlw net is negative at night although less negative compared to open water conditions as a result qlw net is positive on average under the panels although qlw net is greater on the whole however the net radiation or qsw net qlw net is smaller mainly due to the large reduction in qsw net from 153 w m2 in open water to 4 7 w m2 below the panel fig 4 c shows tpv and compares tamb and ts amb for open water and ta and ts beneath the pv panels the heat capacity effect is apparent as a clear lag exists in the temperature peaks between ta and ts photovoltaic panels are known to heat significantly and peak values of up to 50 c were observed in the measurements the pv panels in turn heat up the air layer under the panels and thus ta is consistently higher than tamb solar radiation in the tropics has little variation over the course of a year only showing distinct daily variations on a typical day coupled with relatively low values of cpair and cppanel tpv and ta respond strongly to changes in qsw net and exhibit a clear diurnal pattern with increasing values during the day during the daytime peak ta is typically 5 6 c higher than tamb with the difference becoming only about 1 c during the night these trends are noticeably weaker on days when albedo is high as observed in fig 4 c the diurnal heating pattern is less distinct on 23 june 27 june and 05 july 2017 when qsw net is reduced due to cloud cover and rainfall and tpv and ta are observed to be significantly lower than other days in open water conditions average ts amb is higher than average ambient air temperature tamb during the measurement period which gives rise to cooling at the water surface in open water the average value of ts is greater than ta with ts and ta about 29 3 c and 28 2 c respectively under the panels the average values of ts and ta are similar about 29 8 c the increase in water surface temperature over open water conditions is also clear with the surface water under the panels consistently about 0 5 c higher than open water the equality in temperature across the air water interface under the panels can reduce the surface cooling 4 2 comparison of calculated ts tpv and ta with measured data temperature distributions predicted by the numerical model within the pv panel and air layer below the panels are shown in fig 5 for 1 july 2017 00 00 midnight and 12 00 noon temperatures are close to tamb at midnight consistent with measurements shown in fig 4 c at noon the pv panel heats up which creates a vertical temperature gradient the panel temperature is in excess of 40 c while air temperature near the water surface is about 34 c in close agreement with measurements the results of ts tpv and ta estimated from the two approximations for rh are compared with measured data for the period 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 comparison of average values and error statistics are provided in table 1 and detailed time series comparisons are shown in fig 6 it is apparent from fig 6 a that the rha rhamb assumption gives a better estimate of ts providing better agreement with the measurements of ts and would suggest that rha is close to rhamb with the exception of 29 june the computed ts matches the measured data well with the trends in calculated results following the measured data the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r values are 0 30 c and 0 70 p 05 respectively consistent with field observations ts is consistently higher than the open water surface temperature by about 0 5 c the good general agreement between the modelled ts with measurements indicate that the results are reasonable for heat budget calculations calculated values of tpv are compared against measurements in fig 6 b although measured data are available for only a limited time period the comparison is good with the rmse and r between the calculated and measured tpv being approximately 1 2 c and 0 99 p 05 respectively calculated values of ta from 21 june 2017 to 12 july 2017 are compared against measurements in fig 6 c once again there is good agreement between the measured and calculated ta values with rmse r values of about 1 2 c 0 95 p 05 respectively the heating process is governed by variations in insolation during the daytime the pv panels are heated and tpv increases quickly up to as high as 50 c due to the relatively small value of cp panel the air layer under the pv panels is also heated quickly up to 40 c since cp air is only slightly larger than cp panel tpv and ta peak at about the same time the change in conditions in the air layer induced by panel heating creates an artificial condition above the water surface the change in ts is governed by the radiative exchange at the water surface through qnet surface which is discussed in section 4 3 suffice it to say here that the artificially imposed condition above the water surface results in an increase in ts compared to open water the actual value of ts would have to be determined by radiative balance conditions which is discussed in section 4 3 in addition to prescribing rha rhamb or ea eamb in the calculation of ts zero wind condition under the panels was also assumed as a first approximation the good agreement between the calculated and measured ts seems to justify these assumptions however measurements of rha and wind will be necessary to validate these assumptions because of the large specific heat capacity of water the model shows that the peak in ts up to 31 c occurs about 2 to 3 h after the peak in tpv and ta the dependence on insolation is also apparent on days where there was significant rainfall and high levels of albedo recorded on 22 june 26 june and 5 july 2017 during these three days the diurnal heating pattern of the surface water temperature is less distinct and temperature peaks are modest at night when qsw is absent the pv panels and the air layer cool quickly with ta almost reaching ambient levels fig 6 c consequently ts decreases but remains higher than the open water temperature by around 0 5 c the time lag of 2 to 3 h is also observed in the cooling process the model is capable of capturing these trends in the measured data with a good level of accuracy 4 3 comparison of heat budgets in calculating the radiative energy entering the water surface qlw net must be known in open water this is either measured or estimated from temperature measurements beneath the panels qlw net was estimated using eq 2 and comparison of the calculated and measured qlw net beneath the panels is made in table 1 and fig 7 the figure shows a strong correspondence between modelled and measured insolation with the r being 0 98 p 05 since the calculation involves tpv and ts both of these temperatures are also well predicted the reduction in qlw net during the three days 22 june 26 june and 5 july 2017 with heavy rainfall is also apparent as noted previously the diurnal behaviour of the major surface heating components can be seen from a 24 hr ensemble of the data shown in fig 8 although the data is for a limited period daily insolation patterns do not vary much in the tropics and the results shown are reflective of conditions throughout a year in open water surface water temperature is solely heated by shortwave radiation the sensible heat in open water ranges from 5 to 10 w m2 fig 8 a the sensible heat contributes only 1 of cooling the water temperature during the daytime and 4 during the nighttime the longwave radiation in open water ranges from 50 to 30 w m2 the daytime cooling effect due to longwave radiation in open water is about 12 of total energy loss and the nighttime is even larger 18 in total the long wave radiation contributes around 30 of the heat loss of surface water on a daily basis in open water condition latent heat in open water ranges from 120 to 50 w m2 and contributes about 65 of heat loss over a 24 hr period with equal amounts occurring during the day night the magnitudes of the energy components below the pv panels are much smaller than in open water the water surface below the pv panels receives only about 3 of original shortwave radiation with a mean of about 5 w m2 the qlw net from the pv panels becomes the most dominant energy component for the surface water under the pv panels fluctuating from 20 to 100 w m2 during the daytime it contributes around 72 of the heat source while during the night it contributes 48 of the heat loss as wind speed would be reduced underneath the pv panels the qs and ql are much less efficient in cooling compared to open water qs ranges between 13 to 5 w m2 and contributes about 11 of heating energy during the daytime and 6 of cooling energy during the night ql occurs within the range of 20 to 2 w m2 contributing 47 of the heat loss with 18 occurring during the daytime and 29 during the night the heat budgets averaged over the 14 day period for open water and beneath the pv panels for the measurement period are summarised in table 2 the open water heat budgets are in agreement with results of the 60 day period from 13 april 2007 to 11 june 2007 reported by xing et al 2012 for the kranji reservoir which is located close to tengeh the values of net radiation or qsw net qlw net qs and ql reported by xing et al 2012 are 91 1 8 5 and 77 6 w m2 respectively xing et al 2012 reported an imbalance of 5 w m2 for the four major heat components whereas an imbalance of 9 w m2 table 2 was obtained in the present study this is considered acceptable given that the current analysis was conducted for a limited period of 14 days and 10 years later over a longer period with concurrent measurement on the two reservoirs these differences are expected to even out nevertheless the general agreement between the current results and the 60 day assessment by xing et al 2012 provides an indication that the measurements reported herein can be considered to be representative of open water conditions and can be used as a basis for comparison with the heat budget beneath the panel as summarized in table 2 the imbalance beneath the panels is about 5 7 w m2 which can be attributed to uncertainties in estimates of ql due to approximations of zero wind speed and equality of rha with rhamb the pv panel exerts significant influence on the energy budget in open water heating effects of qsw net are mainly balanced by evaporative cooling and qlw net beneath the panels this radiative flux condition is drastically altered qsw net is significantly reduced both ql and qs become positive and the latent heat flux is much reduced these results show that the alteration of the heat flux conditions across the water surface results in the energy balance occurring at an equilibrium temperature ts which is higher than ts amb this accounts for the increase in surface water temperatures beneath the panels compared to open water shown in fig 4 c lastly the energy flux below the panels is reduced considerably by a factor of 6 5 times in open water rendering the energy balance condition sensitive to small changes to radiation conditions in the system 5 conclusions this study provides a first estimate of the heat budget below floating pv panels the study proposes a complete workflow from data collection heat budget calculation procedure and numerical model to study the heat transfer process between the panel and water surface the model can be used to calculate the air temperature and surface water temperature and can be coupled with a lake model to understand floating pv effects on thermal structure the following can be concluded from this study i an analysis of continuous measurements of radiation and temperature from a paired open water reservoir site and below a floating pv installation showed that both radiation and temperature are significantly altered beneath the panels shortwave radiation is reduced to approximately 20 w m2 from daily peaks of 500 1000 w m2 longwave radiation is increased due to the heating of the pv panels and varies with insolation showing strong peaks of approximately 100 w m2 net longwave radiation under the panel is positive compared to open water which is always negative the temperatures of the pv panel and air layer below the panel likewise vary strongly with insolation panel temperatures peak at 50 c while the temperature of the air layer is higher than the ambient air temperature significantly the average air and water temperatures are similar compared to open water where the average water temperature is higher than air temperature this equality in temperatures reduces the potential for the surface layer to cool ii a numerical model simulating the heat transfer process between the panel air and water layers was developed the model captures the radiation and temperature dynamics which are strongly driven by insolation predictions of longwave radiation and pv panel air layer and near surface water temperatures compared well with field measurements iii the model results were used to calculate the heat budget under the panel which was compared to the open water condition in open water cooling exerted by sensible and latent heat fluxes and net longwave radiation is balanced by heating from sunlight panel placement imposes a change to this energy balance resulting in heating and cooling largely driven by long wave radiation as the water surface is sheltered from the short wave radiation and wind the surface energy balance beneath the panels occurs at a higher water temperature the model assumption that the relative humidity beneath the panel is equal to ambient conditions produces better agreement for predictions of the near surface water temperature suggesting that the relative humidities are similar the assumption of zero wind speed below the panels also appears reasonable as a first approximation but further measurements are required to validate our assumptions here quantitative assessments of pv systems to date generally focus on production performance that may be influenced by a host of meteorological variables the data and model presented here approach the issue from the opposite direction and considerably advance the relatively limited quantitative information available on the environmental impacts of floating pv with a specific focus on energy budgets moving forward some of our model assumptions need further verification through additional empirical measurements and the energy budget model needs to be seamlessly incorporated within a reservoir model to examine potential water quality and
