14990,the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp er is a large scale multi decade infrastructure project aiming to divert substantial amounts of water 45 billion m3 yr 1 to alleviate water shortage in comparatively arid regions of northern china the project has ramifications for hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic matter dom in regional lakes affected by the project we carried out an extensive field sampling campaign along the snwdp er in different hydrological seasons of 2018 and monthly observations in lake hongze and lake luoma from april 2018 to june 2021 we found the lakes connecting to the snwdp er had higher mean doc specific uv absorbance higher ratio of humic like to protein like fluorophores humic protein and shallower spectral slope s 275 295 in the wet season compared to the wet to dry transition and dry seasons the southern lakes and yangtze river had lower doc concentration bioavailable doc bdoc and higher dom aromaticity compared to the northern two downstream lakes ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms revealed higher relative abundance of cho containing and aromatic compounds in the yangtze river and the southern three upstream lakes compared to the northern two lakes the data from lake hongze and lake luoma studied in different hydrological seasons suggest that water delivery had high consistency in dom composition and bdoc over the season we conclude that positioning along the watercourse and seasonally variable hydrological conditions play an important role in influencing the dom composition and bioavailability of key lakes connecting to the snwdp er our results indicated that the water diversion project delivers water with low doc concentration and higher aromaticity and thus is of higher quality since it has higher dom removal potential during drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water diversion project dissolved organic matter bdoc doc ft icr ms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes and other inland waters receive process and transport up to 5 1 pgc yr 1 despite only covering 3 7 of the earth s non glaciated land area verpoorter et al 2014 large fluvial plains now support the livelihood of 75 of the human population globally and are increasingly being developed with urbanization and industrialization paerl and paul 2012 lakes serve as vital water supplies to large and mega cities in many countries worldwide and dissolved organic matter dom in particular affects lake ecosystem services including the quality of water used for drinking water high levels of dom contribute considerably to the cost of drinking water treatments as required for dom removal with flocculants the removal of dom prior to disinfection is particularly important for three reasons i low levels of dom reduce the possibilities of bacterial regrowth within the distribution system ii dom is a precursor of carcinogenic disinfection by products that are created during the chlorination step and iii dom may contribute unpleasant odors and taste to water baghoth et al 2011 kothawala et al 2017 however not all dom is the same in terms of functional characteristics whereby the chemical composition of dom is highly relevant for predicting how easily dom can be removed by flocculation or as an energy source for bacteria the chemical composition of dom in lakes is influenced by the combination of watershed landscape hydrology and anthropogenic disturbances he et al 2020 johnston et al 2020 huang et al 2021 kurek et al 2023 anthropogenic disturbances including damming water diversion urbanization agricultural activities and soil destabilization have all changed the biogeochemical cycling of dom in lake ecosystems yao et al 2011 hur et al 2014 xenopoulos et al 2021 household effluents discharged from residential areas contain high levels of aliphatic compounds that are highly bio labile hosen et al 2014 zhou et al 2022 lake eutrophication induced by excessive external nutrient loading can lead to the proliferation and degradation of algae cells and release of algal dom lowered dissolved oxygen with negative effects on other aquatic organisms zhang et al 2017 wen et al 2022 impoundment of reservoirs can result in selective loss of aromatic organic matter and enrichment of aliphatic dom in reservoir waters hur et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 he et al 2020 water diversion and inter basin water transfer projects have been launched to solve water crises that threaten many large cities globally for example the snowy mountains scheme of australia redistributes water from the snowy river to the murray darling basin to provide water for hydropower irrigated agriculture and cities in dryer regions of southern australia huang et al 2018 another example is the california state water project in california which supplies water to approximately 27 million people in southern california the san francisco bay area and the san joaquin valley jing and blum 2021 the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china draws water from the upstream middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and redistributes the water to sub humid areas prone to drought and semi arid regions in northern china yu et al 2020 despite the increasing demand of water and the application of large scale water diversion projects it remains unclear how the chemical composition and bioavailability of dom is impacted across large scale and long distance water diversion projects the snwdp was designed to transport 45 billion m3 of water annually from the yangtze river via three canal or pipeline systems and was launched in 2002 long et al 2020 the eastern route of the snwdp snwdp er is projected to divert 14 8 billion m3 of water to service more than 140 million people and approximately twenty large cities in northern china including tianjin and jinan fig 1 the chain of lakes connecting to the snwdp er serve as water regulation and storage that serve as drinking water supply to the residential areas in the downstream linked large cities the chemical composition and bioavailability of dom in these lakes is therefore of great interest due to concerns around the production of disinfection by products and microbial regrowth in water distribution networks stedmon et al 2011 we aimed to unravel the source and fate of dom in the lakes connecting to the snwdp er and how the water diversion project may influence the chemical composition and bioavailability of dom understanding these processes can help provide advanced lake water management schemes and help improve water security of the diversion project we carried out field sampling campaigns in these lakes in different seasons in 2018 in the mainstream of the yangtze river in april 2018 and monthly observations were further conducted in the middle reach connecting the snwdp er i e lake hongze and lake luoma for 3 years from april 2018 to june 2021 optical measurements and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms were used to trace the chemical composition of dom and laboratory bio incubations were further carried out for all the samples to examine the bioavailability of dom in these environments we hypothesize that dom in the northern regions of the snwdp er would have lower aromaticity and higher doc concentrations due to a lower annual precipitation and therefore lower terrestrial soil organic matter inputs and accompanied lower local dilution of residential dom we further hypothesized that dom bioavailability would change along the north south gradient of the snwdp er being in the northern lakes with higher population density 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling collection the snwdp er draws water from the lower reach of the mainstream of the yangtze river at jiangdu and delivers water through lake gaoyou lake hongze lake luoma lake nansi and lake dongping successively via the beijing to hangzhou great canal the longest canal worldwide fig 1 lake gaoyou has a surface area of 761 km2 and lake hongze ranks as the fourth largest freshwater lake in china and has a surface area of 1577 km2 and these two lakes receive water from the river huai fig 1 lake luoma has an area of 290 km2 and its upstream lake nansi has an area of 1266 km2 fig 1 lake dongping covers an area of 627 km2 and flows into the yellow huanghe river fig 1 this chain of lakes serves as important water sources supplying water to more than 10 million residents in the surrounding area and a further 140 million residents in the downstream linked large and mega cities in northern semi arid areas prone to drought including tianjin and jinan fig 1 due to the rapid economic development and intense urbanization in recent decades the key lakes connecting to the snwdp er have been affected by water diversion and anthropogenic disturbances from the surrounding residential landscapes which impacts their water quality and the chemical composition of dom a total of eighteen samples were collected from lake gaoyou n 8 and lake luoma n 10 in january 2018 fig 1 lake gaoyou n 14 lake hongze n 16 lake luoma n 20 lake nansi n 24 and lake dongping n 10 were sampled in april and july 2018 and the main stream of the yangtze river n 11 was sampled in april 2018 in addition 667 samples were collected from lake hongze n 339 and lake luoma n 328 monthly from april 2018 to june 2021 sampling sites were distributed evenly in the studied lakes surface 0 5 m water samples were collected on boat with 1 5 l acid washed pet bottles that were rinsed with site specific water prior to sampling and stored in a vehicle mounted refrigerator in the field before transportation to the laboratory water samples were filtered within 6 h and all laboratory measurements were finished within 3 d of field sampling 2 2 dissolved organic carbon doc and bioavailable doc bdoc water samples were passed through whatman gf f 0 7 μm glass fiber filters to remove particulate organic matter and concentrations of doc were determined after acidification with 10 μl 85 h3po4 on npoc mode using toc vcpn shimadzu tokyo japan analyzer with high temperature combustion at 680 c a 100 ml water sample was passed through millipore membrane cellulose filters 0 22 μm to remove microbes and then transferred to 120 ml acid cleaned brown glass vials following the protocol 2 ml site specific water filtered through gf d 2 7 μm filters to remove debris was added to each incubation vial to introduce a bacterial inoculum vonk et al 2015 additional inorganic nutrients were added to the samples to increase the ambient concentrations by 80 μm nh4 n and 10 μm po43 p to prevent nutrient limitation during the bio incubation period abbott et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 the vials were loosely capped and gently shaken several times a day to maintain oxygenation but were capped to limit evaporation all vials were incubated for 28 days in darkness at room temperature 20 2 c after 28 days of bio incubation the samples were re filtered through 0 7 μm filters to measure doc concentration again biodegradable doc bdoc was calculated from the ratio of doc consumed compared with the initial doc concentration after 28 days of laboratory bio incubation 2 3 dom optical measurements water samples filtered through millipore membrane filters 0 22 μm were used to measure dom absorbance and fluorescence the absorbance spectra were measured using a shimadzu uv 2550 pc uv vis spectrophotometer with matching 5 cm quartz cells the spectral range was set from 200 to 800 nm 1 nm interval and milli q water was used in the reference cell the absorbance spectra were baseline corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm and the absorption coefficients were calculated by multiplying 2 303 r where r is the cuvette path length in m in this study the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is used to trace the aromaticity of dom and suva254 has been shown to increase with increasing aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 dom spectral slope s 275 295 was estimated using a nonlinear regression method whereby the s 275 295 is an optical index that decreases with increasing terrestrial dom signals helms et al 2008 excitation emission matrices eems of dom were determined on an f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan with a 700 voltage xenon lamp at room temperature 20 2 the excitation and emission spectrum ranged from 230 to 450 nm 5 nm interval and 250 to 550 nm 1 nm interval respectively with a scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 water raman scatter peaks were corrected by subtracting the eems of milli q water blank from measured water samples rayleigh scatter effects were eliminated by linear interpolation using the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the inner filter effect was calibrated using the absorbance at corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths mcknight et al 2001 humification index hix is calculated with the ratio of fluorescence intensity integration at 435 480 nm to 300 345 nm which increases with increasing dom aromaticity zsolnay et al 1999 fluorescence index fi370 is defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength of 470 nm to that of 520 nm both excited at 370 nm and fi370 increased with decreasing dom aromaticity cory and mcknight 2005 the autochthonous biological contribution index bix is defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 380 nm to that at 430 nm both excited at 310 nm and bix increases with increasing contribution of autochthonous dom huguet et al 2009 2 4 parafac modeling parafac modeling was performed with dreem toolbox in matlab r2019b murphy et al 2013 the eem array consisted of 744 samples including 11 samples from the yangtze river 22 samples from lake gaoyou 339 samples from lake hongze 338 samples from lake luoma 24 samples from lake nansi and 10 samples from lake dongping the data array consisted of 251 emission wavelengths and 45 excitation wavelengths and was divided into 6 random dataset halves three calibration three validation halves with five to ten component models developed for each dataset murphy et al 2013 a seven component model was validated by split half validation random initialization and residual analysis fig s1 fig s2 the spectral characteristics of the seven components were compared with those identified in other ecosystems using an online spectral library called openfluor murphy et al 2014 fig s1 fig s2 c1 e x e m 245 412 nm and c2 e x e m 230 436 nm were similar to microbial or agricultural humic like substances stedmon et al 2003 c3 e x e m 275 324 nm was categorized as amino acid like related to the blue shifted tryptophan like fluorophore murphy et al 2011 c4 e x e m 230 285 340 nm and c7 e x e m 245 300 364 nm were characterized as tryptophan like fluorescent substances stedmon and markager 2005 kowalczuk et al 2009 c5 e x e m 265 350 444 nm displayed spectral shapes congruent with terrestrial humic like fluorophore c6 e x e m 230 270 300 nm was classified as tyrosine like substance murphy et al 2011 among them c1 c2 and c5 are humic like substance and c3 c4 c6 and c7 are protein like substances mainly associated with inputs of anthropogenic effluents and bio degradation fig s1 fig s2 in this study the ratio of summed fluorescence intensity of humic like to protein like components i e humic protein was used to trace the variability in the relative importance of humic like substances along the water bodies of snwdp er 2 5 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and data analysis ft icr ms was conducted on eight samples including six samples collected from the waters connecting to the snwdp er and two samples after 28 days of laboratory bio incubation and they were used to explore the effects of water transfer activity on dom molecular composition ppl bond elut 3 ml agilent resins were used to solid phase extract according to methods described elsewhere zhou et al 2022 briefly approximately 40 ml depending on doc concentrations to ensure a similar loading of 60 μgc filtered water through 0 22 μm samples were acidified to ph 2 with reagent grade hcl ppl columns were pre cleaned with 6 ml ulc ms grade methanol sealed and soaked overnight with 1 5 ml methanol ppl columns were then rinsed with 3 ml 0 01 m hcl 3 ml methanol and 3 ml 0 01 m hcl successively the calculated volume of acidified water sample flowed through ppl columns with a flow rate 5 ml min 1 ppl columns were rinsed twice with 0 01 m hcl to remove inorganic material before ppl columns were dried under high purity n2 gas 99 999 and finally eluted dom from the column with 1 ml methanol the extracts were diluted 1 1 v v with milli q water and were measured with a 15 tesla ft icr ms and negative mode electrospray ionization choi et al 2019 molecular formulae were assigned to signal 6σ root mean square baseline noise within the theoretical framework of c4 60h4 80o1

hydrological data information on the monthly mean rainfall in the river huai watershed and the monthly mean inflow discharge of the river huai to lake hongze at bengbu and yi river to lake luoma at linyi from 2017 to 2021 were attained from the huai river commission of the ministry of water resources in china http www hrc gov cn data on the monthly mean inflow discharge of dawen river to lake dongping at the daicunba from 2017 to 2020 was obtained from yellow river water conservancy commission ministry of water resources in china http www yrcc gov cn 2 7 statistical analyses spatial distribution of the sampling sites was performed with arcgis 10 2 software a reduced dataset summarizing the major variability in the variables can be produced using principal component analysis pca bro and smilde 2014 pca of dom related indices was performed using matlab r2019b statistical analyses including mean values standard deviations sd kruskal wallis rank sum test k w test and linear regressions were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 software with p 0 05 being reported as significant 3 results 3 1 dom characteristics in different lakes connecting to the snwdp er the river huai watershed had high monthly mean precipitation from may to october 45 4 212 mm fig s3a we found high monthly mean inflow discharge for bengbu linyi and daicunba starting from july and lasting until september fig s3b d july was therefore classified as the wet season april as the wet to dry transition season since precipitation increases in may and january was classified as the dry season according to the monthly mean rainfall and inflow discharge that was near baseflow conditions fig s3 we found higher mean doc concentration in the five lakes along the snwdp er in the wet season 4 7 0 9 mg l 1 than in the wet to dry transition season 3 7 0 8 mg l 1 k w test p 0 001 and the dry season 4 2 0 3 mg l 1 k w test p 0 005 and lower mean doc concentrations for the samples from the three upstream southern lakes and the mainstream of the yangtze river than the remaining northern two lakes i e lake dongping 4 6 0 6 mg l 1 and lake nansi 5 0 0 2 mg l 1 k w test p 0 001 fig 2a bdoc for all samples ranged from 1 4 to 38 8 with a mean of 18 3 10 5 we found lower mean bdoc in the southern three lakes than the northern lake dongping 25 5 7 2 and lake nansi 24 1 3 8 in the wet season k w test p 0 05 fig 2b and higher mean suva254 hix and humic protein and lower mean s 275 295 in the wet than in the wet to dry transition period k w test p 0 05 fig 2c f shallower s 275 295 and lower bix values bix 1 and higher suva254 hix and humic protein values were found in the lakes in southern china especially in yangtze river lake gaoyou and lake hongze k w test p 0 001 fig 2 we found higher fi370 in lake luoma compared with the remaining waters in the wet and wet to dry transition seasons fig 2 3 2 principal component analysis pca modeling results a pca was performed to investigate the optical compositional variability in dom samples collected from the yangtze river and the lakes connecting to the snwdp er the first two axes pc1 and pc2 explained 36 8 and 20 9 respectively of the variation in the dom related indices fig 3a the tryptophan like c3 and c7 tyrosine like c4 and c6 and s 275 295 showed positive pc1 loadings while humic like c1 c2 and c5 hix and humic protein exhibited negative loadings indicating that pc1 was positively associated with anthropogenic associated protein like dom inputs lower mean pc1 scores were recorded for samples collected from the waters in the south including yangtze river lake gaoyou and lake hongze compared with the northern three lakes i e lake luoma lake nansi and lake dongping k w test p 0 001 fig 3b indicating that a large amount of humic like dom was selectively lost during the water diversion to the northern lakes 3 3 variability in dom optical composition of intensively studied lake hongze and lake luoma we found higher doc suva254 and humic protein in lake hongze during summer than in winter k w test p 0 001 fig 4a c d and higher doc bdoc and suva254 in lake luoma during summer than in winter k w test p

collected from lake hongze 20 6 10 2 and lake luoma 19 5 7 2 in spring than in the other seasons k w test p 0 05 fig 4b the mean bdoc of samples collected from lake hongze 20 2 8 3 and lake luoma 20 0

that from lake luoma k w test p 0 005 fig 4a c d we found consistency of the optical indices between lake hongze and lake luoma fig 4 suva254 and humic protein of the two lakes from june to october 2020 were significantly higher than that in the remaining sampling seasons k w test p 0 05 fig 4c d 3 4 relationships of dom related parameters between lake hongze and lake luoma lake hongze receives water from the river huai while lake luoma receives water primarily from the river yi and these two lakes belong to different watersheds we linked the dom related parameters between these two lakes to unravel the potential impacts of the snwdp er we found the mean of doc bdoc suva254 and humic protein in lake hongze was significantly and positively correlated with that in the snwdp er downstream linked lake luoma p 0 005 fig 5b d we further elucidated the impact of the snwdp er on the chemical composition of dom we found that doc bdoc suva254 and humic protein in the outflowing site of lake hongze was significantly and positively related to the inflowing river mouth site for lake luoma that connects to the snwdp er fig 5 g h a pca was performed to investigate the quantitative and compositional difference of dom samples collected from lake hongze and downstream lake luoma the first two axes pc1 and pc2 explained 39 1 and 24 9 respectively of the variability of dom related indices fig 6a the humic like c1 c2 and c5 hix suva254 and humic protein showed positive pc1 loadings while tryptophan like peaks c3 c4 c7 clustered closely together tyrosine like c6 and s 275 295 represented negative loadings indicating that pc1 was significantly related to terrestrial humic like dom inputs we found higher mean pc1 scores were recorded for samples collected from the lake hongze compared with lake luoma k w test p 0 0001 fig 6b suggesting that humic like dom in lake hongze was higher than that in downstream lake loma we further found the mean pc1 scores of lake hongze increased significantly with increasing mean pc1 scores of lake luoma during each sampling occasion p 0 005 fig 6c 3 5 ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms results we found higher relative abundance weight contribution ra of polycyclic condensed aromatics and polyphenolic compounds corresponding to lower ra of aliphatic peptide like and sugar like compounds in the southern yangtze river and the three lakes i e lake gaoyou lake hongze and lake luoma compared with the northern two lakes connecting to snwdp er i e lake nansi and lake dongping fig 7a f we found higher relative abundance weighted aimod and ra of cho containing formulae and chon containing formulae and lower ra chos containing formulae in the south yangtze river lake gaoyou lake hongze and lake luoma compared with the northern lakes lake nansi and lake dongping fig 7 table s1 ft icr ms results showed that the ratio of mean mass to charge m z for lake gaoyou increased from 392 pre incubation to 417 post incubation and m z increased from 400 to 435 for lake dongping after 28 days of bio incubation fig 7 g h meanwhile the ra of aliphatic peptide like and sugar like compounds decreased corresponding to an increased ra of polycyclic condensed aromatics polyphenolic and highly unsaturated compounds in the two lakes after 28 days of bio incubation fig 7i j 4 discussion hydrological connectivity influenced variability in doc concentration the chemical composition of dom and doc bioavailability in lakes connecting to the snwdp er doc concentrations in the five lakes connecting to snwdp er were significantly higher in the wet season than in the wet to dry transition and dry seasons fig 2a this is consistent with previous studies showing doc concentrations to increase with increasing catchment rainfall and river discharge yoon and raymond 2012 fasching et al 2016 there were higher terrestrial aromatic dom signatures in the southern upstream lakes compared with the northern lakes and higher suva254 hix and humic protein and correspondingly shallower s 275 295 in the lakes connecting to the snwdp er in the wet season than in the wet to dry transition and dry seasons fig 2c f it has been suggested that suva254 hix and humic protein increase while s 275 295 fi370 and bix decreases with increasing aromatic nature of dom in various aquatic ecosystems cory and mcknight 2005 helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 previous studies have revealed that increasing precipitation and flushing during the wet season result in mobilization of fresh soil and litter layer leachates and urban residential effluents with elevated bdoc osburn et al 2012 yang et al 2013 household effluents from residential areas provide an important contribution to the increased protein like signals in the dom pool zhou et al 2016 however the optical signal of domestic wastewater is usually masked by the signal of soil organic matter from terrestrial sources as wastewater is usually treated before it is discharged which eliminates the most biodegradable organic matter agriculture is the dominate land use in the catchments of the lake studied and it is expected that these anthropogenic disturbances would mobilize substantial soil dom to the aquatic environment drake et al 2019 the southern upstream lakes connecting to the snwdp er lake gaoyou and lake hongze had higher aromaticity likely owing to higher catchment precipitation and thereby enhanced mobilization of soil organic matter compared with the northern lakes fig 2c f we found that doc concentrations in northern downstream lakes lake nansi and lake dongping were significantly higher than in southern lakes connecting to the snwdp er fig 2a which contrasts with previous studies showing that doc concentrations usually increase with increasing precipitation in the catchment yoon and raymond 2012 this difference may be attributed to a lower water level and thereby limited local dilution of residential dom inputs coupled with higher catchment population density in the northern than the southern lakes in our study previous studies have revealed that the water diversion project caused a gradual deterioration in water quality of the lakes along the snwdp er with a cumulative impact of anthropogenic pressures carrying over to the northern lakes li et al 2012 organic carbon discharged over impervious urban landscapes including household effluents draining into the northern lakes connecting to the snwdp er can be highly bioavailable and thus likely explains the higher bdoc 23 5 8 2 measured in the northern two lakes i e lake dongping and lake nansi than the upstream southern three lakes bdoc 13 8 7 5 fig 2b bdoc is closely and inversely linked to the aromaticity of dom in lakes reflecting that aliphatic doc with low molecular mass is more likely to directly pass across the cell membranes of microorganisms and be rapidly utilized battin et al 2008 accordingly bdoc is found to generally increase with decreasing suva254 for terrestrial dom fellman et al 2009 mu et al 2017 furthermore we found that bdoc increased with increasing protein rich dom as evidenced by the higher bdoc levels and pc1 scores in the northern two lakes compared with the southern three lakes fig 2b fig 3b we also note that the range of bdoc found across these study sites is wider than common in pristine boreal systems berggren et al 2009 meanwhile ft icr ms results exhibited a depletion of aliphatic and peptide like compounds with low m z in lake gaoyou and lake dongping after 28 days of bio incubation fig 7i j indicating that microbes preferentially utilize aliphatic energy rich substances that have smaller molecular size and lower c n wickland et al 2012 spencer et al 2015 in addition ft icr ms results further verified that dom chemical composition of the northern and southern lakes are different we found higher aimod cho containing formulae and ra of polycyclic condensed aromatics and polyphenolic compounds and correspondingly lower ra of chos containing aliphatic peptide like and sugar like compounds from the southern three lakes and the yangtze river compared with the northern two lakes i e lake nansi and lake dongping fig 7 the impacts of hydrological connectivity on the chemical composition of dom in lakes connected to the snwdp er is further supported by the consistency of doc bdoc and dom optical composition between lake loma and lake hongze river huai is the largest inflowing tributary of lake hongze with high inflowing discharge and the dom composition and bdoc are significantly influenced by the inflow discharge of the river in comparison lake luoma receives water from river yi with much lower water discharge than river huai the annual precipitation in lake luoma catchment is furthermore markedly lower than that for lake hongze compared to lake hongze lake loma is therefore more susceptible to be influenced by domestic effluents from the surrounding residential areas due to comparatively lower local dilution effects therefore the dom composition of the two lakes is expected to be different however we found the mean levels of suva254 and humic protein in lake hongze were significantly and positively correlated with that in the snwdp er downstream linked lake luoma and suva254 and humic protein in the outflowing site of lake hongze was significantly positive related to the inflowing river mouth site of lake luoma that connects to the water diversion project fig 5 this indicates that the water diversion project of the snwdp er contributes dom with higher aromaticity to northern downstream lake luoma this is further supported by the clear consistency in the optical indices doc bdoc suva254 and huminc protein and the mean pc1 levels between lake hongze and lake luoma fig 5a d fig 6c protein like substances are usually associated with microbial activity and domestic sewage discharge and can be easily utilized by microorganisms zhou et al 2017 lake hongze and lake luoma samples in 2019 have higher mean bdoc of samples versus those collected in 2020 and 2021 fig 4b and we attribute this to the covid 19 pandemic and the isolation of people in their residences and a lower discharge of industrial effluents the higher bdoc in both lake hongze and lake luoma in spring compared to other seasons most likely reflects fertilizer use in lake catchments during spring as flushed dom from added organic manure can be highly biodegradable wickland et al 2012 lake water quality and dom composition have significant impacts on the drinking water treatment processes and overall safety of drinking water distributed to consumers water with excessive levels of dom can produce unpleasant odors and potentially harmful disinfection by products dbps during the drinking water treatment process such as trihalomethanes thm and haloacetic acids haa jacangelo et al 1995 matilainen et al 2011 a previous study has found that suva254 can be an indicator of dom removal potential during coagulation suva254 4 indicates hydrophobic and is easy to be removed dom with suva 254 2 is hydrophilic with low removal potential edzwald et al 1985 kothawala et al 2017 we found that the suva254 of all lakes and rivers along the snwdp er was 4 and often even 2 and domestic and industrial effluents carrying hydrophilic aliphatic substances may therefore strongly influence the water quality and dom composition in key lakes connected to the snwdp er our results therefore suggest that the substantial inputs of biologically labile doc from surrounding residential areas to the northern chains of lakes are likely to be hard to remove with standard coagulation during the drinking water treatment process the studied lakes are not only societally relevant water impoundments supplying drinking water to large and mega cities in the sub humid area prone to drought and semi arid northern china including tianjin and jinan but also important water sources for numerous surrounding cities and residential areas socio environmental impacts of the large scale and long distance diversion project snwdp er are important to consider as the re routing of waterways can be relevant for society in many ways including for drinking water quality the notably lower doc concentration and higher dom aromaticity in the southern upstream waters compared with the northern downstream linked lakes suggests that the water diversion project delivers water with higher quality in terms of organic matter removal efficiency to a sub humid areas prone to drought and semi arid northern parts of china the northern lakes are influenced by household sewage with limited local dilution effects and the aromatic dom derived from terrestrial environments is selectively lost kellerman et al 2014 due to the prolonged water residence time in these lakes dom with greater aromaticity as found in the southern lakes is typically more easy to remove by flocculation during the water treatment processes compared with local water found in the northern lakes the difference in organic matter concentration and quality is thus relevant to consider in addition to the significance of the water diversion project in alleviating urban water scarcity the resilience to climate extremes and how it may contribute to the recovery of groundwater storage in the arid regions of northern china long et al 2020 although with negative impact on the ecological health of the water bodies from which the water is delivered de guzman et al 2022 as the largest water diversion project globally unified management of the lakes connecting to the water diversion project is needed to ensure the water supply safety of the project periodical field sampling and in situ or online real time monitoring programs in the lakes connecting to the water diversion project as well as the very long beijing hangzhou great canal 1710 km long can be helpful in addition the fate of this aromatic dom i e sediments respiration or persistence should be traced the monitoring of dom chemical composition and bioavailability along with treatment with flocculants is required to ensure the modify water treatment strategies as needed to ensure optimal removal of dom and safety of water quality and the health of the residents in the northern downstream arid cities 5 conclusions our study demonstrates that hydrological connectivity drives the variability in doc chemical composition and bioavailability in lakes connecting to the snwdp er and there are significant differences between northern and southern lakes increased precipitation and discharge resulted in an increase in aromaticity and terrestrial humic like materials of dom in the southern lakes connecting to the snwdp er the water diversion project delivers higher quality water to northern china with low doc concentration and higher dom aromaticity and the aromatic dom were selectively lost during the diversion process the northern lakes connecting to the snwdp er are influenced strongly by domestic effluents and have limited dilution effect resulting in higher doc and bdoc in these lakes than in the southern lakes ft icr ms also confirmed higher aimod cho containing and aromatic compounds in the southern lakes compared with the northern lakes connecting to the snwdp er we

14990,the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp er is a large scale multi decade infrastructure project aiming to divert substantial amounts of water 45 billion m3 yr 1 to alleviate water shortage in comparatively arid regions of northern china the project has ramifications for hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic matter dom in regional lakes affected by the project we carried out an extensive field sampling campaign along the snwdp er in different hydrological seasons of 2018 and monthly observations in lake hongze and lake luoma from april 2018 to june 2021 we found the lakes connecting to the snwdp er had higher mean doc specific uv absorbance higher ratio of humic like to protein like fluorophores humic protein and shallower spectral slope s 275 295 in the wet season compared to the wet to dry transition and dry seasons the southern lakes and yangtze river had lower doc concentration bioavailable doc bdoc and higher dom aromaticity compared to the northern two downstream lakes ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms revealed higher relative abundance of cho containing and aromatic compounds in the yangtze river and the southern three upstream lakes compared to the northern two lakes the data from lake hongze and lake luoma studied in different hydrological seasons suggest that water delivery had high consistency in dom composition and bdoc over the season we conclude that positioning along the watercourse and seasonally variable hydrological conditions play an important role in influencing the dom composition and bioavailability of key lakes connecting to the snwdp er our results indicated that the water diversion project delivers water with low doc concentration and higher aromaticity and thus is of higher quality since it has higher dom removal potential during drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water diversion project dissolved organic matter bdoc doc ft icr ms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes and other inland waters receive process and transport up to 5 1 pgc yr 1 despite only covering 3 7 of the earth s non glaciated land area verpoorter et al 2014 large fluvial plains now support the livelihood of 75 of the human population globally and are increasingly being developed with urbanization and industrialization paerl and paul 2012 lakes serve as vital water supplies to large and mega cities in many countries worldwide and dissolved organic matter dom in particular affects lake ecosystem services including the quality of water used for drinking water high levels of dom contribute considerably to the cost of drinking water treatments as required for dom removal with flocculants the removal of dom prior to disinfection is particularly important for three reasons i low levels of dom reduce the possibilities of bacterial regrowth within the distribution system ii dom is a precursor of carcinogenic disinfection by products that are created during the chlorination step and iii dom may contribute unpleasant odors and taste to water baghoth et al 2011 kothawala et al 2017 however not all dom is the same in terms of functional characteristics whereby the chemical composition of dom is highly relevant for predicting how easily dom can be removed by flocculation or as an energy source for bacteria the chemical composition of dom in lakes is influenced by the combination of watershed landscape hydrology and anthropogenic disturbances he et al 2020 johnston et al 2020 huang et al 2021 kurek et al 2023 anthropogenic disturbances including damming water diversion urbanization agricultural activities and soil destabilization have all changed the biogeochemical cycling of dom in lake ecosystems yao et al 2011 hur et al 2014 xenopoulos et al 2021 household effluents discharged from residential areas contain high levels of aliphatic compounds that are highly bio labile hosen et al 2014 zhou et al 2022 lake eutrophication induced by excessive external nutrient loading can lead to the proliferation and degradation of algae cells and release of algal dom lowered dissolved oxygen with negative effects on other aquatic organisms zhang et al 2017 wen et al 2022 impoundment of reservoirs can result in selective loss of aromatic organic matter and enrichment of aliphatic dom in reservoir waters hur et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 he et al 2020 water diversion and inter basin water transfer projects have been launched to solve water crises that threaten many large cities globally for example the snowy mountains scheme of australia redistributes water from the snowy river to the murray darling basin to provide water for hydropower irrigated agriculture and cities in dryer regions of southern australia huang et al 2018 another example is the california state water project in california which supplies water to approximately 27 million people in southern california the san francisco bay area and the san joaquin valley jing and blum 2021 the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china draws water from the upstream middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and redistributes the water to sub humid areas prone to drought and semi arid regions in northern china yu et al 2020 despite the increasing demand of water and the application of large scale water diversion projects it remains unclear how the chemical composition and bioavailability of dom is impacted across large scale and long distance water diversion projects the snwdp was designed to transport 45 billion m3 of water annually from the yangtze river via three canal or pipeline systems and was launched in 2002 long et al 2020 the eastern route of the snwdp snwdp er is projected to divert 14 8 billion m3 of water to service more than 140 million people and approximately twenty large cities in northern china including tianjin and jinan fig 1 the chain of lakes connecting to the snwdp er serve as water regulation and storage that serve as drinking water supply to the residential areas in the downstream linked large cities the chemical composition and bioavailability of dom in these lakes is therefore of great interest due to concerns around the production of disinfection by products and microbial regrowth in water distribution networks stedmon et al 2011 we aimed to unravel the source and fate of dom in the lakes connecting to the snwdp er and how the water diversion project may influence the chemical composition and bioavailability of dom understanding these processes can help provide advanced lake water management schemes and help improve water security of the diversion project we carried out field sampling campaigns in these lakes in different seasons in 2018 in the mainstream of the yangtze river in april 2018 and monthly observations were further conducted in the middle reach connecting the snwdp er i e lake hongze and lake luoma for 3 years from april 2018 to june 2021 optical measurements and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms were used to trace the chemical composition of dom and laboratory bio incubations were further carried out for all the samples to examine the bioavailability of dom in these environments we hypothesize that dom in the northern regions of the snwdp er would have lower aromaticity and higher doc concentrations due to a lower annual precipitation and therefore lower terrestrial soil organic matter inputs and accompanied lower local dilution of residential dom we further hypothesized that dom bioavailability would change along the north south gradient of the snwdp er being in the northern lakes with higher population density 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling collection the snwdp er draws water from the lower reach of the mainstream of the yangtze river at jiangdu and delivers water through lake gaoyou lake hongze lake luoma lake nansi and lake dongping successively via the beijing to hangzhou great canal the longest canal worldwide fig 1 lake gaoyou has a surface area of 761 km2 and lake hongze ranks as the fourth largest freshwater lake in china and has a surface area of 1577 km2 and these two lakes receive water from the river huai fig 1 lake luoma has an area of 290 km2 and its upstream lake nansi has an area of 1266 km2 fig 1 lake dongping covers an area of 627 km2 and flows into the yellow huanghe river fig 1 this chain of lakes serves as important water sources supplying water to more than 10 million residents in the surrounding area and a further 140 million residents in the downstream linked large and mega cities in northern semi arid areas prone to drought including tianjin and jinan fig 1 due to the rapid economic development and intense urbanization in recent decades the key lakes connecting to the snwdp er have been affected by water diversion and anthropogenic disturbances from the surrounding residential landscapes which impacts their water quality and the chemical composition of dom a total of eighteen samples were collected from lake gaoyou n 8 and lake luoma n 10 in january 2018 fig 1 lake gaoyou n 14 lake hongze n 16 lake luoma n 20 lake nansi n 24 and lake dongping n 10 were sampled in april and july 2018 and the main stream of the yangtze river n 11 was sampled in april 2018 in addition 667 samples were collected from lake hongze n 339 and lake luoma n 328 monthly from april 2018 to june 2021 sampling sites were distributed evenly in the studied lakes surface 0 5 m water samples were collected on boat with 1 5 l acid washed pet bottles that were rinsed with site specific water prior to sampling and stored in a vehicle mounted refrigerator in the field before transportation to the laboratory water samples were filtered within 6 h and all laboratory measurements were finished within 3 d of field sampling 2 2 dissolved organic carbon doc and bioavailable doc bdoc water samples were passed through whatman gf f 0 7 μm glass fiber filters to remove particulate organic matter and concentrations of doc were determined after acidification with 10 μl 85 h3po4 on npoc mode using toc vcpn shimadzu tokyo japan analyzer with high temperature combustion at 680 c a 100 ml water sample was passed through millipore membrane cellulose filters 0 22 μm to remove microbes and then transferred to 120 ml acid cleaned brown glass vials following the protocol 2 ml site specific water filtered through gf d 2 7 μm filters to remove debris was added to each incubation vial to introduce a bacterial inoculum vonk et al 2015 additional inorganic nutrients were added to the samples to increase the ambient concentrations by 80 μm nh4 n and 10 μm po43 p to prevent nutrient limitation during the bio incubation period abbott et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 the vials were loosely capped and gently shaken several times a day to maintain oxygenation but were capped to limit evaporation all vials were incubated for 28 days in darkness at room temperature 20 2 c after 28 days of bio incubation the samples were re filtered through 0 7 μm filters to measure doc concentration again biodegradable doc bdoc was calculated from the ratio of doc consumed compared with the initial doc concentration after 28 days of laboratory bio incubation 2 3 dom optical measurements water samples filtered through millipore membrane filters 0 22 μm were used to measure dom absorbance and fluorescence the absorbance spectra were measured using a shimadzu uv 2550 pc uv vis spectrophotometer with matching 5 cm quartz cells the spectral range was set from 200 to 800 nm 1 nm interval and milli q water was used in the reference cell the absorbance spectra were baseline corrected by subtracting the absorbance at 700 nm and the absorption coefficients were calculated by multiplying 2 303 r where r is the cuvette path length in m in this study the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is used to trace the aromaticity of dom and suva254 has been shown to increase with increasing aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 dom spectral slope s 275 295 was estimated using a nonlinear regression method whereby the s 275 295 is an optical index that decreases with increasing terrestrial dom signals helms et al 2008 excitation emission matrices eems of dom were determined on an f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies tokyo japan with a 700 voltage xenon lamp at room temperature 20 2 the excitation and emission spectrum ranged from 230 to 450 nm 5 nm interval and 250 to 550 nm 1 nm interval respectively with a scanning speed of 2400 nm min 1 water raman scatter peaks were corrected by subtracting the eems of milli q water blank from measured water samples rayleigh scatter effects were eliminated by linear interpolation using the dreem toolbox murphy et al 2013 the inner filter effect was calibrated using the absorbance at corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths mcknight et al 2001 humification index hix is calculated with the ratio of fluorescence intensity integration at 435 480 nm to 300 345 nm which increases with increasing dom aromaticity zsolnay et al 1999 fluorescence index fi370 is defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength of 470 nm to that of 520 nm both excited at 370 nm and fi370 increased with decreasing dom aromaticity cory and mcknight 2005 the autochthonous biological contribution index bix is defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 380 nm to that at 430 nm both excited at 310 nm and bix increases with increasing contribution of autochthonous dom huguet et al 2009 2 4 parafac modeling parafac modeling was performed with dreem toolbox in matlab r2019b murphy et al 2013 the eem array consisted of 744 samples including 11 samples from the yangtze river 22 samples from lake gaoyou 339 samples from lake hongze 338 samples from lake luoma 24 samples from lake nansi and 10 samples from lake dongping the data array consisted of 251 emission wavelengths and 45 excitation wavelengths and was divided into 6 random dataset halves three calibration three validation halves with five to ten component models developed for each dataset murphy et al 2013 a seven component model was validated by split half validation random initialization and residual analysis fig s1 fig s2 the spectral characteristics of the seven components were compared with those identified in other ecosystems using an online spectral library called openfluor murphy et al 2014 fig s1 fig s2 c1 e x e m 245 412 nm and c2 e x e m 230 436 nm were similar to microbial or agricultural humic like substances stedmon et al

mainly associated with inputs of anthropogenic effluents and bio degradation fig s1 fig s2 in this study the ratio of summed fluorescence intensity of humic like to protein like components i e humic protein was used to trace the variability in the relative importance of humic like substances along the water bodies of snwdp er 2 5 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr

regressions were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 software with p 0 05 being reported as significant 3 results 3 1 dom characteristics in different lakes connecting to the snwdp er the river huai watershed had high monthly mean precipitation from may to october 45 4 212 mm fig s3a we found high monthly mean inflow discharge for bengbu linyi and daicunba starting from july and lasting until september fig s3b d july was therefore classified as the wet season april as the wet to dry transition season since precipitation increases in may and january was classified as the dry season according to the monthly mean rainfall and inflow discharge that was near baseflow conditions fig s3 we found higher mean doc concentration in the five lakes along the snwdp er in the wet season 4 7 0

fi370 in lake luoma compared with the remaining waters in the wet and wet to dry transition seasons fig 2 3 2 principal component analysis pca modeling results a pca was performed to investigate the optical compositional variability in dom samples collected from the yangtze river and the lakes connecting to the snwdp er the first two axes pc1 and pc2 explained 36 8 and 20 9 respectively of the variation in the dom related indices fig 3a the tryptophan like c3 and c7 tyrosine like c4 and c6 and s 275 295 showed positive pc1 loadings while humic like c1 c2 and c5 hix and humic protein exhibited negative loadings indicating that pc1 was positively associated with anthropogenic associated protein like dom inputs lower mean pc1 scores were recorded for samples collected from the waters in the south including yangtze river lake gaoyou and lake hongze compared with the northern three lakes i e lake luoma lake nansi and lake dongping k w test p 0 001 fig 3b indicating that a large amount of humic like dom was selectively lost during the water diversion to the northern lakes 3 3 variability in dom optical composition of intensively studied lake hongze and lake luoma we

that from lake luoma k w test p 0 005 fig 4a c d we found consistency of the optical indices between lake hongze and lake luoma fig 4 suva254 and humic protein of the two lakes from june to october 2020 were significantly higher than that in the remaining sampling seasons k w test p 0 05 fig 4c d 3 4 relationships of dom related parameters between lake hongze and lake luoma lake hongze receives water from the river huai while lake luoma receives water primarily from the river yi and these two lakes belong to different watersheds we linked the dom related parameters between these two lakes to unravel the potential impacts of the snwdp er we found the mean of doc bdoc suva254 and humic protein in lake hongze was significantly and positively correlated with that in the snwdp er downstream linked lake luoma p 0 005 fig 5b d we further elucidated the impact of the snwdp er on the chemical composition of dom we found that doc bdoc suva254 and humic protein in the outflowing site of lake hongze was significantly and positively related to the inflowing river mouth site for lake luoma that connects to the snwdp er fig 5 g h a pca was performed to investigate the quantitative and compositional difference of dom samples collected from lake hongze and downstream lake luoma the first two axes pc1 and pc2 explained 39 1 and 24 9 respectively of the variability of dom related indices fig 6a the humic like c1 c2 and c5 hix suva254 and humic protein showed positive pc1 loadings while tryptophan like peaks c3 c4 c7 clustered closely together tyrosine like c6 and s 275 295 represented negative loadings indicating that pc1 was significantly related to terrestrial humic like dom inputs we found higher mean pc1 scores were recorded for samples collected from the lake hongze compared with lake luoma k w test p 0 0001 fig 6b suggesting that humic like dom in lake hongze was higher than that in downstream lake loma we further found the mean pc1 scores of lake hongze increased significantly with increasing mean pc1 scores of lake luoma during each sampling occasion p 0 005 fig 6c 3 5 ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry ft icr ms results we found higher relative abundance weight contribution ra of polycyclic condensed aromatics and polyphenolic compounds corresponding to lower ra of aliphatic peptide like and sugar like compounds in the southern yangtze river and the three lakes i e lake gaoyou lake hongze and lake luoma compared with the northern two lakes connecting to snwdp er i e lake nansi and lake dongping fig 7a f we found higher relative abundance weighted aimod and ra of cho containing formulae and chon containing formulae and lower ra chos containing formulae in the south yangtze river lake gaoyou lake hongze and lake luoma compared with the northern lakes lake nansi and lake dongping fig 7 table s1 ft icr ms results showed that the ratio of mean mass to charge m z for lake gaoyou increased from 392 pre incubation to 417 post incubation and m z increased from 400 to 435 for lake dongping after 28 days of bio incubation fig 7 g h meanwhile the ra of aliphatic peptide like and sugar like compounds decreased corresponding to an increased ra of polycyclic condensed aromatics polyphenolic and highly unsaturated compounds in the two lakes after 28 days of bio incubation fig 7i j 4 discussion hydrological connectivity influenced variability in doc concentration the chemical composition of dom and doc bioavailability in lakes connecting to the snwdp er doc concentrations in the five lakes connecting to snwdp er were significantly higher in the wet season than in the wet to dry transition and dry seasons fig 2a this is consistent with previous studies showing doc concentrations to increase with increasing catchment rainfall and river discharge yoon and raymond 2012 fasching et al 2016 there were higher terrestrial aromatic dom signatures in the southern upstream lakes compared with the northern lakes and higher suva254 hix and humic protein and correspondingly shallower s 275 295 in the lakes connecting to the snwdp er in the wet season than in the wet to dry transition and dry seasons fig 2c f it has been suggested that suva254 hix and humic protein increase while s 275 295 fi370 and bix decreases with increasing aromatic nature of dom in various aquatic ecosystems cory and mcknight 2005 helms et al 2008 huguet et al 2009 previous studies have revealed that increasing precipitation and flushing during the wet season result in mobilization of fresh soil and litter layer leachates and urban residential effluents with elevated bdoc osburn et al 2012 yang et al 2013 household effluents from residential areas provide an important contribution to the increased protein like signals in the dom pool zhou et al 2016 however the optical signal of domestic wastewater is usually masked by the signal of soil organic matter from terrestrial sources as wastewater is usually treated before it is discharged which eliminates the most biodegradable organic matter agriculture is the dominate land use in the catchments of the lake studied and it is expected that these anthropogenic disturbances would mobilize substantial soil dom to the aquatic environment drake et al 2019 the southern upstream lakes connecting to the snwdp er lake gaoyou and lake hongze had higher aromaticity likely owing to higher catchment precipitation and thereby enhanced mobilization of soil organic matter compared with the northern lakes fig 2c f we found that doc concentrations in northern downstream lakes lake nansi and lake dongping were significantly higher than in southern lakes connecting to the snwdp er fig 2a which contrasts with previous studies showing that doc concentrations usually increase with increasing precipitation in the catchment yoon and raymond 2012 this difference may be attributed to a lower water level and thereby limited local dilution of residential dom inputs coupled with higher catchment population density in the northern than the southern lakes in our study previous studies have revealed that the water diversion project caused a gradual deterioration in water quality of the lakes along the snwdp er with a cumulative impact of anthropogenic pressures carrying over to the northern lakes li et al 2012 organic carbon discharged over impervious urban landscapes including household effluents draining into the northern lakes connecting to the snwdp er can be highly bioavailable and thus likely explains the higher bdoc 23 5 8 2 measured in the northern two lakes i e lake dongping and lake nansi than the upstream southern three lakes bdoc 13 8 7 5 fig 2b bdoc is closely and inversely linked to the aromaticity of dom in lakes reflecting that aliphatic doc with low molecular mass is more likely to directly pass across the cell membranes of microorganisms and be rapidly utilized battin et al 2008 accordingly bdoc is found to generally increase with decreasing suva254 for terrestrial dom fellman et al 2009 mu et al 2017 furthermore we found that bdoc increased with increasing protein rich dom as evidenced by the higher bdoc levels and pc1 scores in the northern two lakes compared with the southern three lakes fig 2b fig 3b we also note that the range of bdoc found across these study sites is wider than common in pristine boreal systems berggren et al 2009 meanwhile ft icr ms results exhibited a depletion of aliphatic and peptide like compounds with low m z in lake gaoyou and lake dongping after 28 days of bio incubation fig 7i j indicating that microbes preferentially utilize aliphatic energy rich substances that have smaller molecular size and lower c n wickland et al 2012 spencer et al 2015 in addition ft icr ms results further verified that dom chemical composition of the northern and southern lakes are different we found higher aimod cho containing formulae and ra of polycyclic condensed aromatics and polyphenolic compounds and correspondingly lower ra of chos containing aliphatic peptide like and sugar like compounds from the southern three lakes and the yangtze river compared with the northern two lakes i e lake nansi and lake dongping fig 7 the impacts of hydrological connectivity on the chemical composition of dom in lakes connected to the snwdp er is further supported by the consistency of doc bdoc and dom optical composition between lake loma and lake hongze river huai is the largest inflowing tributary of lake hongze with high inflowing discharge and the dom composition and bdoc are significantly influenced by the inflow discharge of the river in comparison lake luoma receives water from river yi with much lower water discharge than river huai the annual precipitation in lake luoma catchment is furthermore markedly lower than that for lake hongze compared to lake hongze lake loma is therefore more susceptible to be influenced by domestic effluents from the surrounding residential areas due to comparatively lower local dilution effects therefore the dom composition of the two lakes is expected to be different however we found the mean levels of suva254 and humic protein in lake hongze were significantly and positively correlated with that in the snwdp er downstream linked lake luoma and suva254 and humic protein in the outflowing site of lake hongze was significantly positive related to the inflowing river mouth site of lake luoma that connects to the water diversion project fig 5 this indicates that the water diversion project of the snwdp er contributes dom with higher aromaticity to northern downstream lake luoma this is further supported by the clear consistency in the optical indices doc bdoc suva254 and huminc protein and the mean pc1 levels between lake hongze and lake luoma fig 5a d fig 6c protein like substances are usually associated with microbial activity and domestic sewage discharge and can be easily utilized by microorganisms zhou et al 2017 lake hongze and lake luoma samples in 2019 have higher mean bdoc of samples versus those collected in 2020 and 2021 fig 4b and we attribute this to the covid 19 pandemic and the isolation of people in their residences and a lower discharge of industrial effluents the higher bdoc in both lake hongze and lake luoma in spring compared to other seasons most likely reflects fertilizer use in lake catchments during spring as flushed dom from added organic manure can be highly biodegradable wickland et al 2012 lake water quality and dom composition have significant impacts on the drinking water treatment processes and overall safety of drinking water distributed to consumers water with excessive levels of dom can produce unpleasant odors and potentially harmful disinfection by products dbps during the drinking water treatment process such as trihalomethanes thm and haloacetic acids haa jacangelo et al 1995 matilainen et al 2011 a previous study has found that suva254 can be an indicator of dom removal potential during coagulation suva254 4 indicates hydrophobic and is easy to be removed dom with suva 254 2 is hydrophilic with low removal potential edzwald et al 1985 kothawala et al 2017 we found that the suva254 of all lakes and rivers along the snwdp er was 4 and often even 2 and domestic and industrial effluents carrying hydrophilic aliphatic substances may therefore strongly influence the water quality and dom composition in key lakes connected to the snwdp er our results therefore suggest that the substantial inputs of biologically labile doc from surrounding residential areas to the northern chains of lakes are likely to be hard to remove with standard coagulation during the drinking water treatment process the studied lakes are not only societally relevant water impoundments supplying drinking water to large and mega cities in the sub humid area prone to drought and semi arid northern china including tianjin and jinan but also important water sources for numerous surrounding cities and residential areas socio environmental impacts of the large scale and long distance diversion project snwdp er are important to consider as the re routing of waterways can be relevant for society in many ways including for drinking water quality the notably lower doc concentration and higher dom aromaticity in the southern upstream waters compared with the northern downstream linked lakes suggests that the water diversion project delivers water with higher quality in terms of organic matter removal efficiency to a sub humid areas prone to drought and semi arid northern parts of china the northern lakes are influenced by household sewage with limited local dilution effects and the aromatic dom derived from terrestrial environments is selectively lost kellerman et al 2014 due to the prolonged water residence time in these lakes dom with greater aromaticity as found in the southern lakes is typically more easy to remove by flocculation during the water treatment processes compared with local water found in the northern lakes the difference in organic matter concentration and quality is thus relevant to consider in addition to the significance of the water diversion project in alleviating urban water scarcity the resilience to climate extremes and how it may contribute to the recovery of groundwater storage in the arid regions of northern china long et al 2020 although with negative impact on the ecological health of the water bodies from which the water is delivered de guzman et al 2022 as the largest water diversion project globally unified management of the lakes connecting to the water diversion project is needed to ensure the water supply safety of the project periodical field sampling and in situ or online real time monitoring programs in the lakes connecting to the water diversion project as well as the very long beijing hangzhou great canal 1710 km long can be helpful in addition the fate of this aromatic dom i e sediments respiration or persistence should be traced the monitoring of dom chemical composition and bioavailability along with treatment with flocculants is required to ensure the modify water treatment strategies as needed to ensure optimal removal of dom and safety of water quality and the health of the residents in the northern downstream arid cities 5 conclusions our study demonstrates that hydrological connectivity drives the variability in doc chemical composition and bioavailability in lakes connecting to the snwdp er and there are significant differences between northern and southern lakes increased precipitation and discharge resulted in an increase in aromaticity and terrestrial humic like materials of dom in the southern lakes connecting to the snwdp er the water diversion project delivers higher quality water to northern china with low doc concentration and higher dom aromaticity and the aromatic dom were selectively lost during the diversion process the northern lakes connecting to the snwdp er are influenced strongly by domestic effluents and have limited dilution effect resulting in higher doc and bdoc in these lakes than in the southern lakes ft icr ms also confirmed higher aimod cho containing and aromatic compounds in the southern lakes compared with the northern lakes connecting to the snwdp er we

14991,resource recovery from source separated urine can be used to produce fertilizers and provide a more sustainable alternative to mineral fertilizers reverse osmosis can be used to remove up to 70 of the water in urine that has been stabilized with ca oh 2 and pre treated with air bubbling however further water removal is limited because of membrane scaling and equipment operating pressure limitations a novel hybrid eutectic freeze crystallization efc and ro system was investigated as a method to concentrate human urine whilst simultaneously crystallizing salt and ice under efc conditions a thermodynamic model was used to predict the type of salts that would crystallize their associated eutectic temperatures and how much additional water removal was required using freeze crystallization to reach eutectic conditions this innovative work showed that at eutectic conditions na2so4 10h2o crystallizes simultaneously with ice in both real and synthetic urine thus providing a new method to concentrate human urine for liquid fertilizer production a theoretical mass balance of a hybrid ro efc process including ice washing and recycle streams showed that 77 of the urea and 96 of the potassium could be recovered with a 95 water removal the final liquid fertilizer would have a composition of 11 5 n and 3 5 k and 3 5 kg of na2so4 10h2o could be recovered from 1000 kg of urine over 98 of the phosphorus would be recovered as calcium phosphate during the urine stabilization step a hybrid ro efc process would require 60 kwh m 3 of energy which is substantially less than other concentration methods graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fertilizers nutrient recovery purification reverse osmosis water removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urine source separation and treatment have been widely researched for their potential to contribute to the sustainable development goals agenda larsen et al 2021a one important aspect of this research is urine concentration and nutrient recovery nitrogen phosphorus and potassium as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers larsen et al 2021b as urine is mostly water 97 concentration is required to reduce the costs associated with transporting the urine to the end user chipako and randall 2020 and to make the product more practical for farmers to apply as a fertilizer different treatment methods have been developed that are practical on varying scales and produce a variety of products patel et al 2020 the majority of nitrogen present in urine 85 is as urea and will hydrolyze and form ammonia due to the presence of the enzyme urease if left untreated randall et al 2016 the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea can be prevented by stabilization with an acid ray et al 2018 or base randall et al 2016 to prevent nitrogen loss to the atmosphere an additional advantage of base stabilization with calcium hydroxide is that virus inactivation occurs during the initial ca oh 2 addition senecal et al 2022 furthermore a quantitative risk analysis krause et al 2021 showed that fertilizers produced from source separated urine do not pose a major hygiene risk due to the low pathogen content of fresh urine who 2018 the risk increases if fecal cross contamination occurs krause et al 2021 however senecal et al 2022 showed that storage of base stabilized urine with fecal contamination for 15 days at 35 c decreased parasite viability by a 3log reduction reverse osmosis ro is a promising urine concentration technology as it is one of the most energy efficient urine concentration methods udert and wächter 2012 courtney and randall 2022a demonstrated that reverse osmosis using a seawater ro membrane operating at 55 bar can remove at least 60 of the water from ca oh 2 stabilized urine pre treated with air bubbling they recovered 85 5 of the urea and 98 5 of the potassium in the brine stream from the membrane process over 98 of the phosphorus can be recovered during the ca oh 2 stabilization flanagan and randall 2018 however concentration using ro alone has limitations if membrane fouling and scaling occur ro operation efficiency is reduced bergman 2007 microfiltration ray et al 2022 and air bubbling courtney et al 2021 pre treatment reduce the potential for fouling and scaling however there is a limit to their effectivity as the urine becomes more concentrated in addition high water removal is constrained by the feed pump and the membrane s designed operating pressure this could potentially be overcome with the development of new ultra high pressure ro membranes that can operate up to 120 bar dupont 2020 however there will still be a limit to the maximum furthermore salts present in urine will also be concentrated along with the urea and potassium fertilizer application would therefore require adjustment based on a crop s salt sensitivity mnkeni et al 2008 a technique for further concentrating the stream while also removing salt s would be beneficial and help tailor the composition of fertilizers recovered from human urine for targeted use various studies investigating different forms of freeze concentration fc have shown promise as a urine concentration method and their results are summarized in table 1 whilst evaporation could be used for further concentration freezing is advantageous as the latent heat of fusion is approximately six times less than the heat of vaporization lide 2004 evaporation at high temperatures can also lead to chemical urea hydrolysis and reduced nitrogen recovery randall et al 2022 this would not be a concern at sub zero operating temperatures during a freezing process for urine although the theoretical energy requirements for fc 11 kwh m 3 noe hays et al 2021 are similar to those reported for ro 12 kwh m 3 80 water removed ek et al 2006 these are not realistic of a full scale fc treatment process which requires 154 244 kwh m 3 water removed 196 250 kg hr 1 best and vasavada 1993 gulyas et al 2004 a hybrid ro fc process would therefore be more energy efficient than concentration by fc alone freezing processes only remove water and like ro freezing would also concentrate contaminants along with fertilizer nutrients in the brine stream eutectic freeze crystallization efc is an extension of fc and could potentially be used to further concentrate the ro brine by definition an efc process operates at the eutectic point ep where both ice and salt s crystallize simultaneously randall and nathoo 2015 further concentration of the urine brine using efc could potentially remove undesirable salts and additional water thus creating a purer fertilizer product the separation of the salts and ice is also aided by gravity whereby the ice floats to the surface and the salts sink to the bottom of the crystallizer genceli 2008 to our knowledge using efc to concentrate urine hydrolyzed has only been investigated thermodynamically randall and nathoo 2018 and no work has been done on using efc for concentrating stabilized urine however efc has been proven as a promising water treatment and salt recovery technology for a variety of waste streams including seawater desalination mazli et al 2020 hypersaline brines from mining randall et al 2011 spent lithium ion batteries ma et al 2021 and saline dairy effluent chen et al 2020 eutectic freeze crystallization is the most efficient when used on concentrated solutions already near their eutectic point randall and nathoo 2015 and is therefore theoretically well suited for urine that has been pre concentrated using ro as previous studies are only theoretical it has not yet been proven if different salts can be recovered from stabilized urine using efc at specific eutectic operating temperatures thermodynamic models are useful as they can be used to predict which salts will form and at what temperatures lewis et al 2010 however urine is complex and contains many organics such as creatine creatinine and uric acid which are not present in the database of the thermodynamic modeling software oli systems inc 2022 it is therefore unclear how accurate a thermodynamic model will be for simulating real urine concentration at efc conditions the overarching aim of this paper was therefore to investigate the feasibility of using efc to further concentrate stabilized urine that had been concentrated using ro the objectives of this paper were to 1 thermodynamically determine how much more water needs to be removed after pre concentration with ro before salts will form the temperatures at which they form as well as the identify the salt s that form 2 compare the modeling and experimental results in terms of the equilibrium ice crystallization temperature and the mass of ice formed after cooling to a fixed temperature 3 experimentally show that salt and ice crystallize in synthetic and real urine at eutectic conditions determine the operating temperature range and identity of the first salt to crystallize 4 determine by way of a theoretical mass balance representative of a full scale process that operates at the optimum temperature to maximize salt crystallization that includes ice washing and recycle streams the overall nutrient recovery and final fertilizer composition 5 compare the energy requirements of a hybrid ro efc process to other urine concentration technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 urine collection and preparation real urine was collected anonymously in waterless urinals pre dosed with 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 the stabilized urine was then filtered 1 2 µm and pre treated with air bubbling until a ph of less than 8 7 was reached courtney et al 2021 the pre treated urine was then concentrated using ro following the same method and equipment used by courtney and randall 2022b a sw30 filmtec membrane operating at 55 bar was used to remove 70 of the water the ro brine was then used in the real urine efc experiments the composition of the real urine and ro brine is available in fig s6 the synthetic urine recipe developed by courtney and randall 2021 was used as a basis for all synthetic urine experiments in this work the recipe was adjusted to mimic a 70 water removal using ro this was achieved by extrapolating the rejection rates as a function of the concentration factor achieved by courtney and randall 2022a a detailed method for the development of the synthetic urine recipe is available in the supplementary information table s1 2 2 thermodynamic modeling the thermodynamic software oli stream analyzer oli systems inc 2022 was used to model the ro urine brine after 70 water removal as this was the water removal achieved with real urine the mixed solvent electrolyte mse database was used as this is not limited by the ionic strength of the solution both the synthetic urine composition and real urine composition were modeled the model was used to determine the temperature at which the first ice crystal formed the mass of ice formed before any salts crystallized the type of salts that formed the temperature at which each salt formed and the total mass of salts formed at a given temperature the model was then used to inform the experimental method and operating temperature set point 2 3 experimental setup and methods experiments were conducted in jacketed glass crystallizers glasschem south africa of varying sizes 500 1000 and 2000 ml the crystallizers were insulated with bubble wrap and the temperature was controlled using a chiller proline rp855 lauda germany and circulating kry40 coolant to prevent ice formation on the inner walls of the crystallizers the liquid was mixed with an overhead stirrer at 200 rpm the solution temperature was continually monitored with a pt 100 temperature probe and data logger 176 t4 testo lenzkirch a cascading process shown in fig s1 was used to reach efc conditions randall et al 2011 this involved three stages of freezing fc1 fc2 and efc in the first two stages fc1 and fc2 only ice crystallization occurred and in the third stage efc simultaneous ice and salt crystallization occurred the ice product was filtered using a buchner funnel connected to a 1 l filtration flask the ice collected was then immediately weighed before it melted a portion of the ice 40 g was separated and washed with de ionized water 40 g that had been pre cooled to 4 c each stage involved cooling the liquid to a fixed temperature and holding the solution at this temperature for 30 min the liquid was then cooled at a constant cooling rate cr until the final desired liquid temperature was reached during the efc stage samples of the liquid were taken and filtered at different temperatures throughout the cooling process for the efc stage ice seeds were added at 10 25 c for synthetic urine and 9 4 c for real urine to initiate crystallization randall et al 2009 approximately 0 1 to 0 15 g of na2so4 97 purity merck germany was added as the salt seed at 10 5 c the anhydrous form of na2so4 was used for seeding as na2so4 10h2o is thermally unstable and the waters of hydration quickly evaporate reddy et al 2010 salt seeding was used in the efc experiment to ensure that crystallization occurred at a consistent temperature fig s3 all experiments were conducted in triplicate with synthetic urine and then validated once with real urine as the composition of real urine varies 2 4 analytical methods colorimetric methods were used to determine the concentration of urea total ammoniacal nitrogen tan po4 p mg 2 ca 2 so4 2 cl and k this process was automated with a gallery discrete analyzer thermofisher scientific massachusetts the concentration of sodium was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 5900 svdv agilent usa the precipitated salt was analyzed using powder x ray diffraction xrd performed on a d8 advance diffractometer bruker germany equipped with a position sensitive detector lynxeye in bragg brentano geometry 2 5 mass and energy balance a theoretical process flow diagram pfd for the hybrid ro efc process was developed to conduct a mass and energy balance assuming a basis of 1000 kg urine input a theoretical mass and energy balance was also conducted for an fc only process assuming 70 and 95 water removal a summary of the assumptions used for the mass balances and a pfd for the fc process are available in table s3 and fig s2 respectively the energy requirements of the lab scale equipment are not an accurate reflection of a full scale plant and therefore the energy requirements for ro nf and freezing were calculated using the energy requirements of full scale systems obtained from literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic model a thermodynamic model was used to determine the operating conditions required to achieve eutectic conditions by assessing if and how much more water needs to be removed before salts will form the temperatures at which they form as well as the type of the salt s that form fig 1 shows the mass percent of ice and the mass of salt formed as urine 70 pre concentration with ro is cooled from 0 to 50 c for the synthetic urine composition fig 1a and the real urine composition fig 1b the model showed that after 70 concentration with ro both urine compositions were not near eutectic conditions and further water removal was required before salts would crystallize for the synthetic urine composition an additional 68 water removal 90 overall water removal would be required and for the real urine composition an additional 65 water removal 89 overall water removal would be required before salt crystallization would occur for both urine compositions modeled the first salt predicted to crystallize was na2so4 10h2o removal of this salt would be beneficial if the end product is to be used as a fertilizer as not all plants have a high na tolerance mnkeni et al 2008 the synthetic and real urine compositions include the same group of ions but in varying concentrations both compositions have similar ice crystallization temperatures 2 93 c vs 2 96 c and will form the same types of salts however the crystallization temperatures and the amount of salt that crystallizes will differ based on composition by validating the model it can then be used to determine operating temperatures when designing a full scale efc system a multi stage efc system could be employed to recover kcl and then urea in each stage for the synthetic composition but the salts formed would not be pure the kcl would be contaminated with na2so4 10h2o and in stage two urea would be contaminated with both na2so4 10h2o and kcl however randall et al 2009 showed that selective salt seeding could be used to promote the crystallization of only one salt when operating within the meta stable zone width randall et al 2012 theoretically operating the system at eutectic conditions of 25 c would produce 8 73 g of na2so4 10h2o from 1 l of urine pre concentrated with ro based on the composition of the synthetic urine this would remove 15 7 of the na ions and 82 8 of the so4 2 ions the removal percentage would vary based on initial urine composition though 3 2 comparison of thermodynamic modeling results and experimental data fig 2 compares the modeled and experimental results for the ice equilibrium temperature iet and mass percentage of ice formed for synthetic and real urine during the different freezing stages fc1 fc2 and efc the model provides a good prediction of iet for both synthetic and real urine despite the model not accounting for many of the organics present in real urine however the accuracy of the iet prediction decreases as the solution becomes more concentrated for example for fc1 there is only a 0 02 c difference between the predicted and measured iet while this difference increases to 0 45 c for efc conditions the mass percentage of ice recovered experimentally was 3 to 9 greater than that predicted for synthetic urine and 1 to 5 greater for real urine this likely occurred for two reasons firstly when the ice slurry is filtered a small amount of liquid remains entrapped within the ice increasing the measured ice mass secondly the model predicts perfect ice separation whereas in practice small amounts of the solute are trapped in the ice as it freezes this means that at a fixed temperature the liquid is marginally less concentrated than predicted by the model which allows more ice to form at the respective temperature commercial freeze concentrators would remove impurities and entrapped liquid from the ice using sophisticated washing columns and recycle streams van der ham et al 2004 randall et al 2011 showed that solute concentrations in ice decreased by a factor of up to 10 after one washing cycle fig s6b in the supplementary information shows that after washing the concentration of impurities in the ice decreased by a factor of 6 to 12 in general the experimental data matched the results predicted by the thermodynamic model 3 3 salt crystallization at eutectic conditions for synthetic and real urine fig 3 shows the anion so4 2 and cl and cation ca 2 and na concentrations in the liquid as a function of temperature during ice and salt crystallization for synthetic and real urine ice seeds were added at 10 25 c synthetic and 9 4 c real salts seeds were added at 10 5 c for both synthetic and real urine the first salt predicted to form was na2so4 10h2o chloride cl and calcium ca 2 ions were measured as spectator ions for comparison for both the synthetic and real urine the cl and ca 2 concentrations remained constant before ice crystallization and then increased as ice formed and the solution became more concentrated the concentration continued to increase even after a na2so4 salt seed was added the sulfate ion concentration for both synthetic and real urine was constant before ice crystallization the concentration increased after ice crystallization but decreased after the salt seed was added this indicates that a salt containing so4 2 had begun to crystallize the na ion concentration remained constant before ice crystallization and then began to increase after ice crystallization and a salt seed was added however if the na and ca2 ion concentration at 10 5 c is compared to the concentration at 12 5 c the na ion concentration only increased by 2 7 while the ca2 ion concentration increased by 11 4 for real urine a similar trend was observed in the synthetic urine experiment this suggests that the salt crystallizing also contained na ions the model predicted that salt would first form at 9 82 c synthetic urine composition and 9 65 c real urine composition however salt formation was only observed after a salt seed was added at 10 5 c this experimental method confirms that eutectic conditions were reached and that a salt crystallized however it does not confirm the exact eutectic temperature of the system only a range after the liquid temperature reached 13 2 c the stirrer was turned off to allow the ice and salt to separate by gravity and the ice slurry was gently agitated to assist with separation reddy et al 2009 the ice and salt were then recovered separately for the real urine experiments more ice formed than anticipated and it filled the entire crystallizer this meant that gravity separation could not be used and the salt that crystallized remained trapped in the ice during filtration if too much ice forms there is no distinct region between the ice and the liquid to allow the salt to settle into fig s4 reddy et al 2009 advised that during efc conditions the total ice volume should only be 30 of the reactor volume if there is no distinct ice and liquid layer the settled salt may become re mixed into the ice as it is removed good separation also requires controlling crystal size as large particles fall more freely whilst fine powders tend to stick together myerson 2002 vaessen et al 2003 advised that the residence time should be controlled for optimal crystal growth in this current work the fast cooling rate of 2 c hr 1 may have promoted fine salt crystals rather than large crystals making gravitational separation difficult however the objective of this research was to confirm the crystallization of a salt at eutectic conditions rather than to optimize the salt ice separation analysis of the impurities present in the ice fig s5 further confirmed that salt was trapped in the ice slurry a portion of the salt recovered was dried re dissolved in de ionized water and analyzed measurement of the ion concentrations table s5 showed that the solid was 66 4 so4 2 and 31 2 na by mass the salt was 97 7 pure na2so4 further analysis of the salt using xrd fig s7 confirmed that the salt was na2so4 with no other detectable crystalline solids present although the model predicted that na2so4 10h2o would form analysis of the salt indicated no waters of hydration na2so4 10h2o is thermally unstable and donkers et al 2015 determined that na2so4 10h2o can transform to na2so4 within 2 5 h of drying previously both reddy et al 2010 and randall et al 2011 confirmed that na2so4 with 10 waters of hydration does crystallize under efc conditions they showed that the mass lost during drying accounted for 10 waters of hydration the small concentrations of other ions measured are likely due to liquid entrapment during the filtration of the salt 3 4 the integrated reverse osmosis and eutectic freeze crystallization process the experimental method was designed to confirm the simultaneous crystallization of ice and na2so4 10h2o rather than to optimize water removal and nutrient recovery for example in the freezing stages before eutectic conditions were reached as much as 24 of the ions were recovered in the ice fig s6a this ice was not further treated however industrial efc systems are designed to include wash columns and recycle streams to reduce the concentration of impurities in the ice qin et al 2009 van der ham et al 2004 in a full scale efc process a portion of the washed ice is melted and reused as wash water and the generated washing liquid is recycled fig 4 the assumptions used for the mass balanced are available in section 1 3 of the supplementary information without ice washing and recycling the overall urea recovery after ro fc and efc for real urine was only 49 in addition the efc experiments were conducted at a temperature of 13 2 c whereas full scale operation to maximize na2so4 10h2o recovery would be conducted at approximately 27 c the temperature at which the next salt begins to form fig 1b this would result in an overall water recovery of 95 based on the real urine composition fig 1b a theoretical mass balance based on a real urine composition was conducted to determine a more realistic recovery rate for urea and k ions and the associated final liquid fertilizer composition fig 4 shows the pfd used for the theoretical mass balance including recoveries and stream concentrations for the integrated ro efc process by including washing and a recycle stream the urea recovery would increase from 49 to 77 with a 96 k recovery the final liquid fertilizer would contain 309 g l 1 urea and 43 5 g l 1 k 11 5 n 3 5 k by weight approximately 3 5 kg of na2so4 10h2o salt would be recovered from 1 000 kg of urine representing a removal of the 24 9 na and 87 3 so4 2 ions the removal of na2so4 10h2o during efc would result in a product with 3 05 wt na which is lower than using an alkaline dehydration process where the final product would contain 4 6 wt na simha et al 2020a the permeate and ice streams combined contain approximately 4 g l 1 of urea which would not be suitable for potable water use however this stream could be used for non potable purposes such as watering plants cleaning and flushing toilets whilst it is possible to treat the stream further using ro it is unlikely that this would be cost effective since the main contaminant of the water is urea and this cannot be efficiently removed using ro courtney and randall 2022a 3 5 final liquid fertilizer comparison to commercial fertilizers the theoretical n and k composition 95 water removal of the fertilizer produced from the integrated ro efc process was compared to other urine concentration technologies with varying water removals and three commercially available liquid fertilizers with similar n content phosphorus content was excluded from this analysis as some treatment methods recover p separately as calcium phosphate ro and ro efc during the collection phase other methods partially recover p as struvite nd and with other methods the p is recovered in the liquid product fc and solid product ad it is therefore difficult to make an equivalent comparison the final fertilizer compositions were determined using the same input urine composition of 15 5 g urea l 1 and 1 7 g k l 1 for all treatment methods as the input urine composition for the nd fertilizer is unknown the final product composition could not be adjusted to an equivalent input the urine concentration technologies include ro only 70 water removal multi stage fc with recycles noe hays et al 2021 ro efc calculated theoretically in this study nitrification and distillation nd udert and wächter 2012 and alkaline dehydration ad alkaline dehydration has been investigated using a variety of substrates and operating temperatures and each variation in method results in a different n recovery and a product with a slightly different nutrient composition simha et al 2021 2020a 2020b vasiljev et al 2022 the nutrient content for ad reported in fig 5 is the average of these four studies an ro efc 11 5 n 3 5 k process and ad 10 5 n 1 5 p 4 2 k average composition produced the products with the highest nitrogen content the dry fertilizer product produced by ad has a slightly higher k content because the drying medium contained k simha et al 2020a freeze concentration 3 9 n 0 5 p 0 9 k noe hays et al 2021 and nd 4 2 n 0 2 p 1 5 k vuna gmbh 2020 had a product with a similar nutrients content it was expected that the nutrient content of the fertilizer made using ro 70 water removal would be too low and further concentration would be required to increase the nutrient content to such that it is comparable to commercially available fertilizers however a comparable commercial fertilizer could be found for each of the fertilizers produced from the different treatment methods the context of fertilizer use is also important the commercial fertilizers in this analysis are typically sold for domestic niche use where consumers are purchasing 0 5 5 l at a time for home use for use on an agricultural scale fertilizers with lower nutrient content would need to be applied in larger volumes to meet required nutrient application rates which may not be desirable for farmers a market and economic analysis should be conducted to determine the appropriate markets in which each urine based fertilizer would be most profitable 3 6 energy considerations and comparisons to other treatment methods a variety of urine treatment methods have been developed that produce fertilizer products with different compositions in depth life cycle assessments lca have previously been conducted martin et al 2023 to compare different urine treatment technologies to a business as usual case whilst this comparison did not include an ro efc process the study does indicate the impacts of ubfs compared to synthetic fertilizers a full lca was not within the scope of this paper however the energy chemical and operating cost requirements for an ro efc process were compared to three established urine treatment technologies 3 7 energy requirements fig 6 shows the energy requirements of different urine treatment methods with varying total water removals as a function of 1 m3 of fresh urine fig 6a and per kg n recovered fig 6b each treatment method has a different n recovery and by adjusting the energy requirements to a kg n basis they can be more fairly compared this analysis also included the energy requirements to produce synthetic fertilizers and to treat nitrogen at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp using biological nitrogen removal bnr whilst ro requires the least energy 16 kwh m 3 including air bubbling pre treatment the maximum water removal is likely to be in the range of 70 at a 95 water removal fc 163 kwh m 3 ad 198 kwh m 3 and nd 154 kwh m 3 required a similar amount of energy by using a hybrid ro efc process 60 kwh m 3 rather than fc alone for an equivalent water removal 95 the energy input required could be reduced by almost a third industrial seawater desalination using evaporative processes such as multi stage flash distillation or multi effect distillation typically has lower energy requirements 14 28 kwh m 3 abdelkareem et al 2018 compared to ad and nd however these processes are also designed to operate at temperatures of 70 to 110 c hore lacy 2007 at this temperature range chemical urea hydrolysis would occur randall et al 2022 and it is unclear what n recovery would be achievable when accounting for the energy required as a function of nitrogen recovered a different outcome is observed for freezing the energy requirements significantly decrease compared to evaporation for example at 70 water removal fc requires 7 times more energy than ro per m3 urine treated but the fc process has a higher nitrogen recovery of 92 noe hays et al 2021 compared to 79 5 for ro this study this means that per kg n recovered fc processes only use approximately twice as much energy as ro this difference is significantly less than previously estimated and indicates the importance of pilot scale trials to allow for a more direct comparison rather than only using energy values from literature conversely for nd 50 g n l 1 30 l product obtained from 1 m3 of urine etter et al 2015 the energy requirement per kg n 102 kwh kg n 1 is almost three times more than ad 35 kwh kg n 1 comparing the energy requirements of the reference scenario the combined energy requirements for synthetic fertilizer production nh4no3 or urea and wwtps are between 31 2 and 32 5 kwh kg n 1 the nd process was the only treatment method that required more energy than the combined reference scenario essentially for all treatment processes the energy required is offset by the energy that would have been used to create synthetic n fertilizers and treat the urine at conventional wwtps this analysis shows why it is important to compare energy requirements on a per n basis fig 6b and not only on a m3 feed basis fig 6a ultimately the preferred choice of urine treatment method will be determined by several factors in addition to energy requirements factors such as the scale of urine collection and treatment toilet building suburbs slums etc method of collection plumbed vs free standing and end product use and end user will affect capital and operating costs and therefore choice of treatment method a detailed economic analysis comparing multiple system boundaries is required to determine which method is best suited for each client s needs 3 8 chemical inputs urine treatment processes that use stabilization to prevent urea hydrolysis require additional chemicals unlike fc and nd in this study calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 was used for the stabilization step 10 g l 1 randall et al 2016 the production of ca oh 2 adds to the overall co2 emissions of the ro efc and ad treatment processes traditional ca oh 2 production processes produce between 0 74 0 86 kg co2 per kg ca oh 2 produced piringer 2017 during the air bubbling pre treatment step approximately 1 5 g of co2 are sequestered per l of urine treated and therefore offsets some of the co2 emissions produced during traditional ca oh 2 production 20 2 however more sustainable methods for ca oh 2 production are being researched such as electrochemical synthesis ellis et al 2020 and production at sub boiling temperatures which has a co2 emission of 0 27 kg co2 per kg ca oh 2 castano et al 2021 the emissions offset due to air bubbling pre treatment would increase to 55 if sustainably produced ca oh 2 is used furthermore the caco3 produced during the air bubbling pre treatment could be re processed back into ca oh 2 using the electrochemical methods developed by ellis et al 2020 to further reduce the overall carbon footprint of the process 3 9 economic feasibility as the ro efc process has only been tested at a laboratory scale it is not possible to compare the capex of these three technologies however a review by williams et al 2015 has compared the cost of industrial scale desalination processes the authors found that freezing processes were the most expensive 0 93 m 3 water removed followed by distillation 0 86 m 3 and ro was the cheapest method 0 66 m 3 by using a hybrid ro efc the size of the efc equipment required would be significantly smaller as the ro system removes the majority 70 of the water resulting in an estimated cost of 0 73 m 3 water removed for the hybrid process for an overall water removal of 95 chipako and randall 2020 investigated the economic feasibility and logistics of a decentralized urine treatment and resource recovery system using ro 80 water removal they found that the liquid fertilizer would need to be sold for a minimum of 1 57 l 1 for the process to break even in 5 years however niche fertilizer products can be sold for considerably more for example commercial fertilizer 3 fig 5 is currently sold at 27 l 1 bonsai tree 2022 although the investigation by chipako and randall 2020 did not include efc it indicates that if the product is sold as a niche liquid fertilizer the overall process will be economically feasible it is recommended that a detailed economic analysis of either a pilot or full scale ro efc process for the concentration of human urine be investigated further based on the feasibility work conducted in this study 4 conclusions we have developed an innovative method for liquid fertilizer production from human urine using a hybrid ro efc process we showed experimentally for the first time that salt and ice can be recovered from human urine simultaneously at efc conditions and that the process uses less energy than current urine concentration methods a preliminary energy balance determined that a hybrid ro efc process would require 60 kwh m 3 for 95 water removal significantly less than ad 198 kwh m 3 and nd 154 kwh m 3 a thermodynamic model was used to determine the ideal operating conditions for the process a comparison of the experimental and modeled results showed that the model was able to accurately predict the ice formation temperature 0 5 c difference however it was less accurate at predicting the mass of ice formed 10 difference we also showed that na2so4 10h2o crystallized under efc conditions from human urine this was confirmed using xrd analysis and the results further confirmed the validity of the model s predictions as a result the efc process could theoretically recover 3 5 kg of na2so4 10h2o from 1000 kg of urine this would improve the quality of the fertilizer product because 15 7 of the na ions and 82 8 of the so4 2 ions are removed the experimental results were used to inform a preliminary pfd and a mass balance of the integrated ro efc process was calculated it was determined that the theoretical overall urea and k recovery would be 77 and 96 respectively for a 95 water removal the final liquid fertilizer would have a urea concentration of 309 g l 1 and 43 5 g l 1 k 11 5 n 3 5 k which is comparable to the

14991,resource recovery from source separated urine can be used to produce fertilizers and provide a more sustainable alternative to mineral fertilizers reverse osmosis can be used to remove up to 70 of the water in urine that has been stabilized with ca oh 2 and pre treated with air bubbling however further water removal is limited because of membrane scaling and equipment operating pressure limitations a novel hybrid eutectic freeze crystallization efc and ro system was investigated as a method to concentrate human urine whilst simultaneously crystallizing salt and ice under efc conditions a thermodynamic model was used to predict the type of salts that would crystallize their associated eutectic temperatures and how much additional water removal was required using freeze crystallization to reach eutectic conditions this innovative work showed that at eutectic conditions na2so4 10h2o crystallizes simultaneously with ice in both real and synthetic urine thus providing a new method to concentrate human urine for liquid fertilizer production a theoretical mass balance of a hybrid ro efc process including ice washing and recycle streams showed that 77 of the urea and 96 of the potassium could be recovered with a 95 water removal the final liquid fertilizer would have a composition of 11 5 n and 3 5 k and 3 5 kg of na2so4 10h2o could be recovered from 1000 kg of urine over 98 of the phosphorus would be recovered as calcium phosphate during the urine stabilization step a hybrid ro efc process would require 60 kwh m 3 of energy which is substantially less than other concentration methods graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fertilizers nutrient recovery purification reverse osmosis water removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urine source separation and treatment have been widely researched for their potential to contribute to the sustainable development goals agenda larsen et al 2021a one important aspect of this research is urine concentration and nutrient recovery nitrogen phosphorus and potassium as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers larsen et al 2021b as urine is mostly water 97 concentration is required to reduce the costs associated with transporting the urine to the end user chipako and randall 2020 and to make the product more practical for farmers to apply as a fertilizer different treatment methods have been developed that are practical on varying scales and produce a variety of products patel et al 2020 the majority of nitrogen present in urine 85 is as urea and will hydrolyze and form ammonia due to the presence of the enzyme urease if left untreated randall et al 2016 the enzymatic hydrolysis of urea can be prevented by stabilization with an acid ray et al 2018 or base randall et al 2016 to prevent nitrogen loss to the atmosphere an additional advantage of base stabilization with calcium hydroxide is that virus inactivation occurs during the initial ca oh 2 addition senecal et al 2022 furthermore a quantitative risk analysis krause et al 2021 showed that fertilizers produced from source separated urine do not pose a major hygiene risk due to the low pathogen content of fresh urine who 2018 the risk increases if fecal cross contamination occurs krause et al 2021 however senecal et al 2022 showed that storage of base stabilized urine with fecal contamination for 15 days at 35 c decreased parasite viability by a 3log reduction reverse osmosis ro is a promising urine concentration technology as it is one of the most energy efficient urine concentration methods udert and wächter 2012 courtney and randall 2022a demonstrated that reverse osmosis using a seawater ro membrane operating at 55 bar can remove at least 60 of the water from ca oh 2 stabilized urine pre treated with air bubbling they recovered 85 5 of the urea and 98 5 of the potassium in the brine stream from the membrane process over 98 of the phosphorus can be recovered during the ca oh 2 stabilization flanagan and randall 2018 however concentration using ro alone has limitations if membrane fouling and scaling occur ro operation efficiency is reduced bergman 2007 microfiltration ray et al 2022 and air bubbling courtney et al 2021 pre treatment reduce the potential for fouling and scaling however there is a limit to their effectivity as the urine becomes more concentrated in addition high water removal is constrained by the feed pump and the membrane s designed operating pressure this could potentially be overcome with the development of new ultra high pressure ro membranes that can operate up to 120 bar dupont 2020 however there will still be a limit to the maximum furthermore salts present in urine will also be concentrated along with the urea and potassium fertilizer application would therefore require adjustment based on a crop s salt sensitivity mnkeni et al 2008 a technique for further concentrating the stream while also removing salt s would be beneficial and help tailor the composition of fertilizers recovered from human urine for targeted use various studies investigating different forms of freeze concentration fc have shown promise as a urine concentration method and their results are summarized in table 1 whilst evaporation could be used for further concentration freezing is advantageous as the latent heat of fusion is approximately six times less than the heat of vaporization lide 2004 evaporation at high temperatures can also lead to chemical urea hydrolysis and reduced nitrogen recovery randall et al 2022 this would not be a concern at sub zero operating temperatures during a freezing process for urine although the theoretical energy requirements for fc 11 kwh m 3 noe hays et al 2021 are similar to those reported for ro 12 kwh m 3 80 water removed ek et al 2006 these are not realistic of a full scale fc treatment process which requires 154 244 kwh m 3 water removed 196 250 kg hr 1 best and vasavada 1993 gulyas et al 2004 a hybrid ro fc process would therefore be more energy efficient than concentration by fc alone freezing processes only remove water and like ro freezing would also concentrate contaminants along with fertilizer nutrients in the brine stream eutectic freeze crystallization efc is an extension of fc and could potentially be used to further concentrate the ro brine by definition an efc process operates at the eutectic point ep where both ice and salt s crystallize simultaneously randall and nathoo 2015 further concentration of the urine brine using efc could potentially remove undesirable salts and additional water thus creating a purer fertilizer product the separation of the salts and ice is also aided by gravity whereby the ice floats to the surface and the salts sink to the bottom of the crystallizer genceli 2008 to our knowledge using efc to concentrate urine hydrolyzed has only been investigated thermodynamically randall and nathoo 2018 and no work has been done on using efc for concentrating stabilized urine however efc has been proven as a promising water treatment and salt recovery technology for a variety of waste streams including seawater desalination mazli et al 2020 hypersaline brines from mining randall et al 2011 spent lithium ion batteries ma et al 2021 and saline dairy effluent chen et al 2020 eutectic freeze crystallization is the most efficient when used on concentrated solutions already near their eutectic point randall and nathoo 2015 and is therefore theoretically well suited for urine that has been pre concentrated using ro as previous studies are only theoretical it has not yet been proven if different salts can be recovered from stabilized urine using efc at specific eutectic operating temperatures thermodynamic models are useful as they can be used to predict which salts will form and at what temperatures lewis et al 2010 however urine is complex and contains many organics such as creatine creatinine and uric acid which are not present in the database of the thermodynamic modeling software oli systems inc 2022 it is therefore unclear how accurate a thermodynamic model will be for simulating real urine concentration at efc conditions the overarching aim of this paper was therefore to investigate the feasibility of using efc to further concentrate stabilized urine that had been concentrated using ro the objectives of this paper were to 1 thermodynamically determine how much more water needs to be removed after pre concentration with ro before salts will form the temperatures at which they form as well as the identify the salt s that form 2 compare the modeling and experimental results in terms of the equilibrium ice crystallization temperature and the mass of ice formed after cooling to a fixed temperature 3 experimentally show that salt and ice crystallize in synthetic and real urine at eutectic conditions determine the operating temperature range and identity of the first salt to crystallize 4 determine by way of a theoretical mass balance representative of a full scale process that operates at the optimum temperature to maximize salt crystallization that includes ice washing and recycle streams the overall nutrient recovery and final fertilizer composition 5 compare the energy requirements of a hybrid ro efc process to other urine concentration technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 urine collection and preparation real urine was collected anonymously in waterless urinals pre dosed with 10 g l 1 ca oh 2 the stabilized urine was then filtered 1 2 µm and pre treated with air bubbling until a ph of less than 8 7 was reached courtney et al 2021 the pre treated urine was then concentrated using ro following the same method and equipment used by courtney and randall 2022b a sw30 filmtec membrane operating at 55 bar was used to remove 70 of the water the ro brine was then used in the real urine efc experiments the composition of the real urine and ro brine is available in fig s6 the synthetic urine recipe developed by courtney and randall 2021 was used as a basis for all synthetic urine experiments in this work the recipe was adjusted to mimic a 70 water removal using ro this was achieved by extrapolating the rejection rates as a function of the concentration factor achieved by courtney and randall 2022a a detailed method for the development of the synthetic urine recipe is available in the supplementary information table s1 2 2 thermodynamic modeling the thermodynamic software oli stream analyzer oli systems inc 2022 was used to model the ro urine brine after 70 water removal as this was the water removal achieved with real urine the mixed solvent electrolyte mse database was used as this is not limited by the ionic strength of the solution both the synthetic urine composition and real urine composition were modeled the model was used to determine the temperature at which the first ice crystal formed the mass of ice formed before any salts crystallized the type of salts that formed the temperature at which each salt formed and the total mass of salts formed at a given temperature the model was then used to inform the experimental method and operating temperature set point 2 3 experimental setup and methods experiments were conducted in jacketed glass crystallizers glasschem south africa of varying sizes 500 1000 and 2000 ml the crystallizers were insulated with bubble wrap and the temperature was controlled using a chiller proline rp855 lauda germany and circulating kry40 coolant to prevent ice formation on the inner walls of the crystallizers the liquid was mixed with an overhead stirrer at 200 rpm the solution temperature was continually monitored with a pt 100 temperature probe and data logger 176 t4 testo lenzkirch a cascading process shown in fig s1 was used to reach efc conditions randall et al 2011 this involved three stages of freezing fc1 fc2 and efc in the first two stages fc1 and fc2 only ice crystallization occurred and in the third stage efc simultaneous ice and salt crystallization occurred the ice product was filtered using a buchner funnel connected to a 1 l filtration flask the ice collected was then immediately weighed before it melted a portion of the ice 40 g was separated and washed with de ionized water 40 g that had been pre cooled to 4 c each stage involved cooling the liquid to a fixed temperature and holding the solution at this temperature for 30 min the liquid was then cooled at a constant cooling rate cr until the final desired liquid temperature was reached during the efc stage samples of the liquid were taken and filtered at different temperatures throughout the cooling process for the efc stage ice seeds were added at 10 25 c for synthetic urine and 9 4 c for real urine to initiate crystallization randall et al 2009 approximately 0 1 to 0 15 g of na2so4 97 purity merck germany was added as the salt seed at 10 5 c the anhydrous form of na2so4 was used for seeding as na2so4 10h2o is thermally unstable and the waters of hydration quickly evaporate reddy et al 2010 salt seeding was used in the efc experiment to ensure that crystallization occurred at a consistent temperature fig s3 all experiments were conducted in triplicate with synthetic urine and then validated once with real urine as the composition of real urine varies 2 4 analytical methods colorimetric methods were used to determine the concentration of urea total ammoniacal nitrogen tan po4 p mg 2 ca 2 so4 2 cl and k this process was automated with a gallery discrete analyzer thermofisher scientific massachusetts the concentration of sodium was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry 5900 svdv agilent usa the precipitated salt was analyzed using powder x ray diffraction xrd performed on a d8 advance diffractometer bruker germany equipped with a position sensitive detector lynxeye in bragg brentano geometry 2 5 mass and energy balance a theoretical process flow diagram pfd for the hybrid ro efc process was developed to conduct a mass and energy balance assuming a basis of 1000 kg urine input a theoretical mass and energy balance was also conducted for an fc only process assuming 70 and 95 water removal a summary of the assumptions used for the mass balances and a pfd for the fc process are available in table s3 and fig s2 respectively the energy requirements of the lab scale equipment are not an accurate reflection of a full scale plant and therefore the energy requirements for ro nf and freezing were calculated using the energy requirements of full scale systems obtained from literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic model a thermodynamic model was used to determine the operating conditions required to achieve eutectic conditions by assessing if and how much more water needs to be removed before salts will form the temperatures at which they form as well as the type of the salt s that form fig 1 shows the mass percent of ice and the mass of salt formed as urine 70 pre concentration with ro is cooled from 0 to 50 c for the synthetic urine composition fig 1a and the real urine composition fig 1b the model showed that after 70 concentration with ro both urine compositions were not near eutectic conditions and further water removal was required before salts would crystallize for the synthetic urine composition an additional 68 water removal 90 overall water removal would be required and for the real urine composition an additional 65 water removal 89 overall water removal would be required before salt crystallization would occur for both urine compositions modeled the first salt predicted to crystallize was na2so4 10h2o removal of this salt would be beneficial if the end product is to be used as a fertilizer as not all plants have a high na tolerance mnkeni et al 2008 the synthetic and real urine compositions include the same group of ions but in varying concentrations both compositions have similar ice crystallization temperatures 2 93 c vs 2 96 c and will form the same types of salts however the crystallization temperatures and the amount of salt that crystallizes will differ based on composition by validating the model it can then be used to determine operating temperatures when designing a full scale efc system a multi stage efc system could be employed to recover kcl and then urea in each stage for the synthetic composition but the salts formed would not be pure the kcl would be contaminated with na2so4 10h2o and in stage two urea would be contaminated with both na2so4 10h2o and kcl however randall et al 2009 showed that selective salt seeding could be used to promote the crystallization of only one salt when operating within the meta stable zone width randall et al 2012 theoretically operating the system at eutectic conditions of 25 c would produce 8 73 g of na2so4 10h2o from 1 l of urine pre concentrated with ro based on the composition of the synthetic urine this would remove 15 7 of the na ions and 82 8 of the so4 2 ions the removal percentage would vary based on initial urine composition though 3 2 comparison of thermodynamic modeling results and experimental data fig 2 compares the modeled and experimental results for the ice equilibrium temperature iet and mass percentage of ice formed for synthetic and real urine during the different freezing stages fc1 fc2 and efc the model provides a good prediction of iet for both synthetic and real urine despite the model not accounting for many of the organics present in real urine however the accuracy of the iet prediction decreases as the solution becomes more concentrated for example for fc1 there is only a 0 02 c difference between the predicted and measured iet while this difference increases to 0 45 c for efc conditions the mass percentage of ice recovered experimentally was 3 to 9 greater than that predicted for synthetic urine and 1 to 5 greater for real urine this likely occurred for two reasons firstly when the ice slurry is filtered a small amount of liquid remains entrapped within the ice increasing the measured ice mass secondly the model predicts perfect ice separation whereas in practice small amounts of the solute are trapped in the ice as it freezes this means that at a fixed temperature the liquid is marginally less concentrated than predicted by the model which allows more ice to form at the respective temperature commercial freeze concentrators would remove impurities and entrapped liquid from the ice using sophisticated washing columns and recycle streams van der ham et al 2004 randall et al 2011 showed that solute concentrations in ice decreased by a factor of up to 10 after one washing cycle fig s6b in the supplementary information shows that after washing the concentration of impurities in the ice decreased by a factor of 6 to 12 in general the experimental data matched the results predicted by the thermodynamic model 3 3 salt crystallization at eutectic conditions for synthetic and real urine fig 3 shows the anion so4 2 and cl and cation ca 2 and na concentrations in the liquid as a function of temperature during ice and salt crystallization for synthetic and real urine ice seeds were added at 10 25 c synthetic and 9 4 c real salts seeds were added at 10 5 c for both synthetic and real urine the first salt predicted to form was na2so4 10h2o chloride cl and calcium ca 2 ions were measured as spectator ions for comparison for both the synthetic and real urine the cl and ca 2 concentrations remained constant before ice crystallization and then increased as ice formed and the solution became more concentrated the concentration continued to increase even after a na2so4 salt seed was added the sulfate ion concentration for both synthetic and real urine was constant before ice crystallization the concentration increased after ice crystallization but decreased after the salt seed was added this indicates that a salt containing so4 2 had begun to crystallize the na ion concentration remained constant before ice crystallization and then began to increase after ice crystallization and a salt seed was added however if the na and ca2 ion concentration at 10 5 c is compared to the concentration at 12 5 c the na ion concentration only increased by 2 7 while the ca2 ion concentration increased by 11 4 for real urine a similar trend was observed in the synthetic urine experiment this suggests that the salt crystallizing also contained na ions the model predicted that salt would first form at 9 82 c synthetic urine composition and 9 65 c real urine composition however salt formation was only observed after a salt seed was added at 10 5 c this experimental method confirms that eutectic conditions were reached and that a salt crystallized however it does not confirm the exact eutectic temperature of the system only a range after the liquid temperature reached 13 2 c the stirrer was turned off to allow the ice and salt to separate by gravity and the ice slurry was gently agitated to assist with separation reddy et al 2009 the ice and salt were then recovered separately for the real urine experiments more ice formed than anticipated and it filled the entire crystallizer this meant that gravity separation could not be used and the salt that crystallized remained trapped in the ice during filtration if too much ice forms there is no distinct region between the ice and the liquid to allow the salt to settle into fig s4 reddy et al 2009 advised that during efc conditions the total ice volume should only be 30 of the reactor volume if there is no distinct ice and liquid layer the settled salt may become re mixed into the ice as it is removed good separation also requires controlling crystal size as large particles fall more freely whilst fine powders tend to stick together myerson 2002 vaessen et al 2003 advised that the residence time should be controlled for optimal crystal growth in this current work the fast cooling rate of 2 c hr 1 may have promoted fine salt crystals rather than large crystals making gravitational separation difficult however the objective of this research was to confirm the crystallization of a salt at eutectic conditions rather than to optimize the salt ice separation analysis of the impurities present in the ice fig s5 further confirmed that salt was trapped in the ice slurry a portion of the salt recovered was dried re dissolved in de ionized water and analyzed measurement of the ion concentrations table s5 showed that the solid was 66 4 so4 2 and 31 2 na by mass the salt was 97 7 pure na2so4 further analysis of the salt using xrd fig s7 confirmed that the salt was na2so4 with no other detectable crystalline solids present although the model predicted that na2so4 10h2o would form analysis of the salt indicated no waters of hydration na2so4 10h2o is thermally unstable and donkers et al 2015 determined that na2so4 10h2o can transform to na2so4 within 2 5 h of drying previously both reddy et al 2010 and randall et al 2011 confirmed that na2so4 with 10 waters of hydration does crystallize under efc conditions they showed that the mass lost during drying accounted for 10 waters of hydration the small concentrations of other ions measured are likely due to liquid entrapment during the filtration of the salt 3 4 the integrated reverse osmosis and eutectic freeze crystallization process the experimental method was designed to confirm the simultaneous crystallization of ice and na2so4 10h2o rather than to optimize water removal and nutrient recovery for example in the freezing stages before eutectic conditions were reached as much as 24 of the ions were recovered in the ice fig s6a this ice was not further treated however industrial efc systems are designed to include wash columns and recycle streams to reduce the concentration of impurities in the ice qin et al 2009 van der ham et al 2004 in a full scale efc process a portion of the washed ice is melted and reused as wash water and the generated washing liquid is recycled fig 4 the assumptions used for the mass balanced are available in section 1 3 of the supplementary information without ice washing and recycling the overall urea recovery after ro fc and efc for real urine was only 49 in addition the efc experiments were conducted at a temperature of 13 2 c whereas full scale operation to maximize na2so4 10h2o recovery would be conducted at approximately 27 c the temperature at which the next salt begins to form fig 1b this would result in an overall water recovery of 95 based on the real urine composition fig 1b a theoretical mass balance based on a real urine composition was conducted to determine a more realistic recovery rate for urea and k ions and the associated final liquid fertilizer composition fig 4 shows the pfd used for the theoretical mass balance including recoveries and stream concentrations for the integrated ro efc process by including washing and a recycle stream the urea recovery would increase from 49 to 77 with a 96 k recovery the final liquid fertilizer would contain 309 g l 1 urea and 43 5 g l 1 k 11 5 n 3 5 k by weight approximately 3 5 kg of na2so4 10h2o salt would be recovered from 1 000 kg of urine representing a removal of the 24 9 na and 87 3 so4 2 ions the removal of na2so4 10h2o during efc would result in a product with 3 05 wt na which is lower than using an alkaline dehydration process where the final product would contain 4 6 wt na simha et al 2020a the permeate and ice streams combined contain approximately 4 g l 1 of urea which would not be suitable for potable water use however this stream could be used for non potable purposes such as watering plants cleaning and flushing toilets whilst it is possible to treat the stream further using ro it is unlikely that this would be cost effective since the main contaminant of the water is urea and this cannot be efficiently removed using ro courtney and randall 2022a 3 5 final liquid fertilizer comparison to commercial fertilizers the theoretical n and k composition 95 water removal of the fertilizer produced from the integrated ro efc process was compared to other urine concentration technologies with varying water removals and three commercially available liquid fertilizers with similar n content phosphorus content was excluded from this analysis as some treatment methods recover p separately as calcium phosphate ro and ro efc during the collection phase other methods partially recover p as struvite nd and with other methods the p is recovered in the liquid product fc and solid product ad it is therefore difficult to make an equivalent comparison the final fertilizer compositions were determined using the same input urine composition of 15 5 g urea l 1 and 1 7 g k l 1 for all treatment methods as the input urine composition for the nd fertilizer is unknown the final product composition could not be adjusted to an equivalent input the urine concentration technologies include ro only 70 water removal multi stage fc with recycles noe hays et al 2021 ro efc calculated theoretically in this study nitrification and distillation nd udert and wächter 2012 and alkaline dehydration ad alkaline dehydration has been investigated using a variety of substrates and operating temperatures and each variation in method results in a different n recovery and a product with a slightly different nutrient composition simha et al 2021 2020a 2020b vasiljev et al 2022 the nutrient content for ad reported in fig 5 is the average of these four studies an ro efc 11 5 n 3 5 k process and ad 10 5 n 1 5 p 4 2 k average composition produced the products with the highest nitrogen content the dry fertilizer product produced by ad has a slightly higher k content because the drying medium contained k simha et al 2020a freeze concentration 3 9 n 0 5 p 0 9 k noe hays et al 2021 and nd 4 2 n 0 2 p 1 5 k vuna gmbh 2020 had a product with a similar nutrients content it was expected that the nutrient content of the fertilizer made using ro 70 water removal would be too low and further concentration would be required to increase the nutrient content to such that it is comparable to commercially available fertilizers however a comparable commercial fertilizer could be found for each of the fertilizers produced from the different treatment methods the context of fertilizer use is also important the commercial fertilizers in this analysis are typically sold for domestic niche use where consumers are purchasing 0 5 5 l at a time for home use for use on an agricultural scale fertilizers with lower nutrient content would need to be applied in larger volumes to meet required nutrient application rates which may not be desirable for farmers a market and economic analysis should be conducted to determine the appropriate markets in which each urine based fertilizer would be most profitable 3 6 energy considerations and comparisons to other treatment methods a variety of urine treatment methods have been developed that produce fertilizer products with different compositions in depth life cycle assessments lca have previously been conducted martin et al 2023 to compare different urine treatment technologies to a business as usual case whilst this comparison did not include an ro efc process the study does indicate the impacts of ubfs compared to synthetic fertilizers a full lca was not within the scope of this paper however the energy chemical and operating cost requirements for an ro efc process were compared to three established urine treatment technologies 3 7 energy requirements fig 6 shows the energy requirements of different urine treatment methods with varying total water removals as a function of 1 m3 of fresh urine fig 6a and per kg n recovered fig 6b each treatment method has a different n recovery and by adjusting the energy requirements to a kg n basis they can be more fairly compared this analysis also included the energy requirements to produce synthetic fertilizers and to treat nitrogen at a wastewater treatment plant wwtp using biological nitrogen removal bnr whilst ro requires the least energy 16 kwh m 3 including air bubbling pre treatment the maximum water removal is likely to be in the range of 70 at a 95 water removal fc 163 kwh m 3 ad 198 kwh m 3 and nd 154 kwh m 3 required a similar amount of energy by using a hybrid ro efc process 60 kwh m 3 rather than fc alone for an equivalent water removal 95 the energy input required could be reduced by almost a third industrial seawater desalination using evaporative processes such as multi stage flash distillation or multi effect distillation typically has lower energy requirements 14 28 kwh m 3 abdelkareem et al 2018 compared to ad and nd however these processes are also designed to operate at temperatures of 70 to 110 c hore lacy 2007 at this temperature range chemical urea hydrolysis would occur randall et al 2022 and it is unclear what n recovery would be achievable when accounting for the energy required as a function of nitrogen recovered a different outcome is observed for freezing the energy requirements significantly decrease compared to evaporation for example at 70 water removal fc requires 7 times more energy than ro per m3 urine treated but the fc process has a higher nitrogen recovery of 92 noe hays et al 2021 compared to 79 5 for ro this study this means that per kg n recovered fc processes only use approximately twice as much energy as ro this difference is significantly less than previously estimated and indicates the importance of pilot scale trials to allow for a more direct comparison rather than only using energy values from literature conversely for nd 50 g n l 1 30 l product obtained from 1 m3 of urine etter et al 2015 the energy requirement per kg n 102 kwh kg n 1 is almost three times more than ad 35 kwh kg n 1 comparing the energy requirements of the reference scenario the combined energy requirements for synthetic fertilizer production nh4no3 or urea and wwtps are between 31 2 and 32 5 kwh kg n 1 the nd process was the only treatment method that required more energy than the combined reference scenario essentially for all treatment processes the energy required is offset by the energy that would have been used to create synthetic n fertilizers and treat the urine at conventional wwtps this analysis shows why it is important to compare energy requirements on a per n basis fig 6b and not only on a m3 feed basis fig 6a ultimately the preferred choice of urine treatment method will be determined by several factors in addition to energy requirements factors such as the scale of urine collection and treatment toilet building suburbs slums etc method of collection plumbed vs free standing and end product use and end user will affect capital and operating costs and therefore choice of treatment method a detailed economic analysis comparing multiple system boundaries is required to determine which method is best suited for each client s needs 3 8 chemical inputs urine treatment processes that use stabilization to prevent urea hydrolysis require additional chemicals unlike fc and nd in this study calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 was used for the stabilization step 10 g l 1 randall et al 2016 the production of ca oh 2 adds to the overall co2 emissions of the ro efc and ad treatment processes traditional ca oh 2 production processes produce between 0 74 0 86 kg co2 per kg ca oh 2 produced piringer 2017 during the air bubbling pre treatment step approximately 1 5 g of co2 are sequestered per l of urine treated and therefore offsets some of the co2 emissions produced during traditional ca oh 2 production 20 2 however more sustainable methods for ca oh 2 production are being researched such as electrochemical synthesis ellis et al 2020 and production at sub boiling temperatures which has a co2 emission of 0 27 kg co2 per kg ca oh 2 castano et al 2021 the emissions offset due to air bubbling pre treatment would increase to 55 if sustainably produced ca oh 2 is used furthermore the caco3 produced during the air bubbling pre treatment could be re processed back into ca oh 2 using the electrochemical methods developed by ellis et al 2020 to further reduce the overall carbon footprint of the process 3 9 economic feasibility as the ro efc process has only been tested at a laboratory scale it is not possible to compare the capex of these three technologies however a review by williams et al 2015 has compared the cost of industrial scale desalination processes the authors found that freezing processes were the most expensive 0 93 m 3 water removed followed by distillation 0 86 m 3 and ro was the cheapest method 0 66 m 3 by using a hybrid ro efc the size of the efc equipment required would be significantly smaller as the ro system removes the majority 70 of the water resulting in an estimated cost of 0 73 m 3 water removed for the hybrid process for an overall water removal of 95 chipako and randall 2020 investigated the economic feasibility and logistics of a decentralized urine treatment and resource recovery system using ro 80 water removal they found that the liquid fertilizer would need to be sold for a minimum of 1 57 l 1 for the process to break even in 5 years however niche fertilizer products can be sold for considerably more for example commercial fertilizer 3 fig 5 is currently sold at 27 l 1 bonsai tree 2022 although the investigation by chipako and randall 2020 did not include efc it indicates that if the product is sold as a niche liquid fertilizer the overall process will be economically feasible it is recommended that a detailed economic analysis of either a pilot or full scale ro efc process for the concentration of human urine be investigated further based on the feasibility work conducted in this study 4 conclusions we have developed an innovative method for liquid fertilizer production from human urine using a hybrid ro efc process we showed experimentally for the first time that salt and ice can be recovered from human urine simultaneously at efc conditions and that the process uses less energy than current urine concentration methods a preliminary energy balance determined that a hybrid ro efc process would require 60 kwh m 3 for 95 water removal significantly less than ad 198 kwh m 3 and nd 154 kwh m 3 a thermodynamic model was used to determine the ideal operating conditions for the process a comparison of the experimental and modeled results showed that the model was able to accurately predict the ice formation temperature 0 5 c difference however it was less accurate at predicting the mass of ice formed 10 difference we also showed that na2so4 10h2o crystallized under efc conditions from human urine this was confirmed using xrd analysis and the results further confirmed the validity of the model s predictions as a result the efc process could theoretically recover 3 5 kg of na2so4 10h2o from 1000 kg of urine this would improve the quality of the fertilizer product because 15 7 of the na ions and 82 8 of the so4 2 ions are removed the experimental results were used to inform a preliminary pfd and a mass balance of the integrated ro efc process was calculated it was determined that the theoretical overall urea and k recovery would be 77 and 96 respectively for a 95 water removal the final liquid fertilizer would have a urea concentration of 309 g l 1 and 43 5 g l 1 k 11 5 n 3 5 k which is comparable to the

14992,despite numerous studies that have been devoted to investigating the aging behaviors of microplastics mps dissolved organic carbon doc and nano plastics nps released from mps under different aging conditions were limited herein the characterizations and underlying mechanisms of doc and nps leaching from mps pvc and ps in the aquatic environment for 130 days under different aging conditions were investigated the results showed that aging could reduce the abundance of mps and high temperature and uv aging generated small sized mps 100 μm especially uv aging doc releasing characteristics were related to mp type and aging condition meanwhile mps were prone to release protein like and hydrophilic substances except for 60 c aging of ps mps additionally 8 77 109 8 87 1010 and 4 06 109 3 94 1010 nps l were detected in leachates from pvc and ps mps aged treatments respectively high temperature and uv promoted the release of nps especially uv irradiation meanwhile smaller sizes and rougher nps were observed in uv aged treatments implying higher ecological risks of leachates from mps under uv aging this study highlights the leachate released from mps under different aging conditions comprehensively which could offset the knowledge gap between the mps aging and their potential threats graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging

introduction microplastics mps typically defined as plastics with a diameter smaller than 5 mm have drawn increasing concern due to their widespread presence in aquatic environments rivers lakes estuary water and ocean and their adverse effect on aquatic organisms liu et al 2019a 2019b chen et al 2022a 2022b wu et al 2021 it is well known that mps are distributed in the environments for a longer period during which the mps experience the aging induced by light temperature and other environmental media sridharan et al 2021 liu et al 2019a 2019b these processes alternate mps characteristics surface morphology hydrophobicity roughness and others and break mps into smaller debris which aggravates the destruction of the ecosystem ding et al 2022 an increasing number of publications have documented the mps aging behaviors mainly focusing on the change of surface properties and functional groups ding et al 2020 liu et al 2022a 2022b luo et al 2021 however little attempt has been made to explore the variation of the size distribution of mps under aging environments which is also a non negligible factor in evaluating their adverse effects on environments liu et al 2022a 2022b sun et al 2019 tong et al 2022 therefore this aspect requires more attention besides mps in aging environments could lead to the release of leachates including dissolved organic carbon doc and nano plastics nps which have attracted more attention recently hahladakis et al 2018 lee et al 2020 yang et al 2021 for example the mps sourced doc could be utilized by microbes in the sea thereby affecting the composition of the base of marine food webs romera castillo et al 2018 a different phenomenon was found by zhu et al 2020 who pointed out that some doc released from mps may inhibit microbial activities additionally doc as one of the essential environmental factors plays an interactive role with other environmental pollutants heavy metals antibiotics and others in the aquatics wu et al 2021 chen et al 2022a 2022b these findings demonstrated that different mp sourced doc could have varying levels of impacts on ecological systems sun et al 2022 qiu et al 2022 lithner et al 2011 lee et al 2020 huffer et l 2018 lu et al 2022 hence it is supposed to explore the characterizations of doc leached from mps to the best knowledge of the authors only a few reports discuss the characterizations of doc leached from mps up to date romera castillo et al 2018 abolghasemi fakhri et al 2019 liu et al 2022a 2022b these studies mainly focused on the final properties of doc leached from mps exposure to single or multiple aging conditions uv high temperature fenton and seawater within short periods 4 50 days while ignoring the dynamic changes of doc leached from mps under various aging environments over a prolonged period xu et al 2022 lee et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 2022b qiu et al 2022 considering the sensitivity of leached doc and the stability of mps in water synthetically it is reasonable to hypothesize that the characterizations of mp sourced doc over a prolonged period of aging are different from that obtained from a short aging time thereby leading to the distinct effects on environments lee et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 2022b herein further study is supposed to be explored the variations of doc leached from mps under a long period of aging another non ignoring problem is the release of nano plastics nps plastic particles with size 1000 nm with the fragment of mps during the aging process zhu et al 2019 soraman et al 2022 different from mps nps are more hazardous due to their high diffusion and ability to cross biological barriers which make it vital to explore the np s properties during the aging process of mps allan et al 2022 at present although a handful of studies confirm the existence of nps in aging samples including boiling of plastic tea bags washing of synthetic textiles and others by nanoparticle tracking analysis nta atomic force microscope afm and other means little information about the releasing characteristics of nps from mps under different aging conditions are reported hernandez et al 2019 yang et al 2021 therefore this study primarily investigated the dissolved organic carbon fingerprints and nps released by mps under different aging conditions commercial polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene ps were selected as the probe plastics for 130 days of aging experiments due to their prevalence in aquatic ecosystems and potential risks liu et al 2022a 2022b luo et al 2021 zhu et al 2019 moreover the seed generation test was also done to assess the toxicity of leachate released from mps with the assistance of afm nta py gcms and spectral analyses it was comprehensive to understand the secondary mps pollution and thus evaluate the potential risks of aging mps to environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 plastic materials commercial pvc and ps particles used in this study were purchased from feihong co ltd dongguan china and the primary components of pvc and ps are presented in table s1 before the aging experiment these spherical shaped pvc and ps were pretreated by washing with ultrapure water pulverizing and sieving to determine the particle size below 1000 μm 2 2 aging experiments to simulate the aging of mps in environments including uv irradiation and high temperature the pvc and ps samples were exposed to three artificial aging conditions 60 c dark ultrapure water 25 c uv light ultrapure water and 25 c dark ultrapure water tersely marking as 60 c uv and 25 c dark respectively xu et al 2022 chen et al 2022a 2022b qiu et al 2022 the irradiation energy was supplied by two 15 w uv lambs as for aging experiments the mixtures of 0 5 grams of mps and 100 ml ultrapure water were sonicated for 30 min to make them homogeneously luo et al 2021 meanwhile treatments in these three aging environments without mps were recorded as the control and each treatment was set in three parallels after that all samples were placed in the above three aging conditions for 130 days of the aging experiment during which the ultrapure water was termly replenished to ensure the constant concentration of samples the suspensions were filtrated with 0 45 μm glass fiber filter membrane a glassware vacuum filtration device at specific aging periods 0 20 40 60 80 100 and 130 days then the aged mps samples collected above the membrane were dried and stored for further analysis and the remaining filtrate leachate under the membrane stored in a metal flask was used for subsequent doc determination and nps analysis the reasonability for collecting nps was proven by lambert and wagner 2016 who pointed out that the nps released from mps aging were mainly concentrated from 1 450 nm 2 3 characteristic analysis of mps the surface morphologies of virgin and aged mps were detected by stereomicroscope olympus cx23 japan and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx s 4800 hitachi japan respectively which also determined the element abundance on mps surfaces size distribution and the average size of mps were analyzed by measuring particles in stereomicroscope images smz25 nikon japan using image j software meanwhile the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet 8700 america was applied to analyze the functional groups of mps with a resolution of 2 cm 1 and 64 scanning times over the range of 4000 400 cm 1 2 4 analytical measurements of doc leached from different aging conditions the collected filtrate was divided into several parts one was used to measure doc concentration by toc l toc l shimadzu japan one was for recording uv vis spectra and fluorescence spectra the other was for monitoring the ftir to eliminate the fluorescence rate doc was diluted to the same concentration before scanning the uv vis and fluorescence spectra the uv vis and fluorescent spectra including synchronous fluorescence spectrum sfs and excitation emission matrix 3d eem were recorded by uv 1452 uv 1452 shimazu japan and fluorospectrometric photometer f 4600 hitachi japan respectively the related details were described in text s2 besides the specific methods of cl concentration and redox potential eh determination were presented in text s1 2 5 determination of nano plastics and toxicity evaluation due to the smaller particle size and more complex components of nps different analytical techniques were applied to characterize them in this study for the physical information the nanoparticle tracking was analyzed by afm multimode 8 bruker america while the size and number concentration were analyzed by nta which could be capable of analyzing particles in size range of 1 2000 nm chemically the py gcms gcms qp2020 shimadzu japan was applied to determine the nanoparticle composition assisted by a cracker named py 3030d frontier the operation parameters were exhibited in text s3 furthermore to assess the toxicity of leachates released from aged mps the seed germination experiment was carried out according to li et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mps during different aging processes 3 1 1 the changes in the morphology and size distribution of mps sem images from fig 1 and fig s2 showed that the cracks wrinkles and pits on the surface of pvc and ps mps became significant as the aging continued especially uv irradiation and high temperature which was similar to the finding observed by tang et al 2018 while due to the various structure and tensile strengths of pvc and ps morphological changes in pvc and ps aged were different zhou et al 2018 compared with pvc mps relatively inconspicuous microcracks formed on the surface of ps mps while the lower final carbon loss fig 1a b and releasing doc concentration fig 2 in ps than pvc mps confirmed this result as shown in fig 1c d the total mps particles significantly p 0 05 decreased from 48000 to 33000 41667 particles g in pvc aged treatments and 41000 to 20000 35667 particles g in ps aged treatments respectively indicating that aging could reduce the abundance of mps in contrast one previous study showed that the number of secondary mps in different plastics pvc ps pla pbs and pbat increased undergoing 21 days of uv irradiation tong et al 2022 this difference may be ascribed to the prolonged aging period in this study which facilitated the exposure of the mps to further decomposition and sem images fig 1 a b supported this result as evidence in this study 37 50 and 56 91 of virgin pvc and ps were 200 μm respectively with the dominant size class of 200 500 μm after 130 days of aging most secondary mps in all aged treatments were dominantly concentrated on 2 100 μm indicating the fragmentation of mps which was similar to the finding stated by liu et al 2019 and liu et al 2022 meanwhile high temperature and uv irradiation enhanced the fragmentation of mps probably because the reactive oxygen species generation was promoted by these two conditions liu et al 2022a 2022b yan et al 2022 notably the maximum value in fraction with size 100 μm was observed in 60 c aged pvc 24778 particles g and uv aged ps 14778 particles g revealing that the responses of mps to a certain aging condition were different it may be ascribed to the more straightforward structure and lower tensile strength of pvc than ps which made it easier to decompose more mps into minor mps or nps in pvc aged samples especially through uv irradiation liu et al 2019a 2019b tang et al 2018 the nps data supported the above result as evidence fig 5 a b 3 1 2 ftir analysis of mps compared with virgin mps analogous ftir spectra without any new absorption peaks were recorded in all pvc and ps aged treatments fig s3 which was different from the results reported by ding et al 2022 and wang et al 2020 this difference may be due to the different characteristics of mps and the aging mechanisms of aging conditions ding et al 2020 as aging continued the peak intensities of characteristic bands varied in all treatments the intensities of c cl at 782 cm 1 specific bands of pvc decreased initially and then increased in all pvc samples which was confirmed by the cl concentration in the related filtrate fig s4 this decreasing profile was possibly attributed to the dehydrochlorination by h induced by aging environments while the concentrated effect possibly caused by the decomposition of the carbon chain led to the increase of c cl ren et al 2022 tang et al 2018 different from pvc the peak intensities of ch2 and ch at 1450 cm 1 and 1493 cm 1 of ps decreased while that of c o increased in ps aged treatments as aging proceeded indicating that the cleavage of c h bonds of ps mps and the oxidation reaction to form c o induced by different aging conditions took place mao et al 2020 the further analysis of 2d cos based on ftir indicated that sequential orders of other specific chemical reactions were different among all treatments except the prior destruction of the c o in uv aging of pvc and ps fig s6 table s2 and table s3 these results indicated aging behaviors of mps varied with the mps type and aging condition like the findings of ding et al 2020 3 2 the characteristics of doc mps under different aging conditions 3 2 1 the doc concentration variation as exhibited in fig 2 pvc and ps mps released doc into the surrounding water under aging conditions which consisted of truly dissolved substances and polymeric nps fragmented from the plastic surface romera castillo et al 2018 during the aging experiments the doc leached from pvc mps showed a gradual upward trend which increased rapidly in the first 20 days and then fluctuated with the extent of aging time in all ps aged treatments these results indicated that the trend of doc leached from pvc and ps mps differed except for the initial increase within 20 days in all treatments this temporary increase was like the results pointed out by lee et al 2020 in which mps structures became more vulnerable to being dissolved lee et al 2020 lambert and wagner 2016 meanwhile the doc leached from ps aged treatments on the 20th was higher than that of in pvc aged treatments possibly due to the 2 ethyl terephthalate ester dotp in pvc table s1 resulting in its aging resistant in the short period tang et al 2018 after 20 days the fluctuated leaching of doc in ps aged treatments was possibly ascribed to the adsorption of doc on the ps surface and conversion of doc in the surrounding water which was promoted by the extended contact of mps with aging environments chen et al 2022a 2022b meng et al 2021 the variation of carbon content on the ps surface fig 1a b and spectral signatures of doc fig s7 and fig s8 could also provide evidence for this result while the intense release of doc in all pvc aged treatments was possibly due to the rapid dissolution of dotp additive detected in pvc from confined matrices which was also facilitated by the more substantial fragmentation lee et al 2020 do et al 2022 in this study the final doc values in pvc aged treatments 3 38 7 60 mg l were higher than that of ps 1 19 4 69 mg l which may be ascribed to the existence of benzene ring structures in ps polymers made it insensitive to environments liu et al 2019a 2019b furthermore the highest doc concentration was observed in 25 c aged treatments regardless of the mp type a different profile was reported by chen et al 2022 who described that uv irradiation promoted the release of doc from ps and polyethylene pe mps aging within 7 days this difference was probably because of the fragmentation accelerated by high temperature and uv under a prolonged aging time during which adsorption of doc on mps surface and the decomposition of doc were promoted ding et al 2020 fan et al 2021 additionally the doc values detected in uv aged were higher than those in 60 c aged treatments it could be explained by two perspectives 1 high temperature accelerated the diffusion of doc thereby facilitating the adsorption of doc by mps while uv increased the crystallinity of the polymer and thereby restricting the adsorption relationship between doc and mps anjana et al 2023 the higher carbon contents on mps under 60 c aging confirmed the reasonability of this result fig 1a b 2 the decomposition was promoted by high temperature consistent with the relatively higher eh values observed in 60 c aged treatments fig s5 the doc released from mps could not only be integral to many processes of ecological like the carbon cycle and climate change but also be served as heterogenous sites for the binding of pollutants thus aggravating the environmental risks qiu et al 2022 to assess the risks of mps aging to the ecological environment it is important to investigate the characteristics of doc 3 2 2 spectroscopic characterization of doc leached from mps aged process 3 2 2 1 uv vis characterization analysis as presented in fig s7 regardless of the mps type the absorbance fluctuated with the prolongation of aging time in pvc and ps aged treatments and there were no pronounced characteristic peaks like the observation reported by xu et al 2022 these results indicated that the component and molecular weight of doc differed in all treatments and varied as aging proceeded cook et al 2017 to obtain more information suva254 representing the molecular weight was calculated according to the published formula and definition chen et al 2022a 2022b as exhibited in table s4 whatever the mp type the suva254 value fluctuated with the aging continued indicating the conversion between high molecular weight fractions and low molecular components during the aging process a different profile was observed by chen et al 2022 who pointed out that suva254 increased within 40 days of ps aging this difference was possible because of the prolonged aging period in this study during which the dynamic transformation of doc took place and the variation of fluorescent signatures provided evidence for this result fig s8 s9 additionally suva254 might reflect aromatic degree that is identify the doc properties from the perspectives of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity chen et al 2022a 2022b weishaar et al 2003 most suva254 values in pvc and ps mps aged treatments were 3 under all aging conditions except 60 c aging of ps in which suva254 values were 4 on the 20th 60th and 100th this result demonstrated that though most doc was composed of hydrophilic substances high temperature facilitated the formation of the hydrophobic substance of ps sourced doc meanwhile this generated hydrophobic substance was beneficial for strengthening the absorption of doc on ps mps zheng et al 2023 thereby possibly leading to the highest carbon content fig 1b in ps mps and the rapid decrease of doc between 20 40 days undergoing 60 c fig 2b additionally it was reported that the substances characterized with hydrophilia hydrophobicity played the distinctive roles on the fate of organic pollutants zheng et al 2023 seidensticker et al 2017 therefore it was reasonable to hypothesize that the effect of doc leached from mps on the fate of pollutants differed among different aging conditions resulting in potential damage to the ecological environment which was supposed to be further investigated 3 2 2 2 fluorescent signatures analysis fluorescent spectra are notable tools for detecting the location and intensity of fluorescence components in dissolved organic matter dom lee et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in this study fluorescent spectra sfs and 3d eem maps of doc under different aging conditions were compared for the different mps no fluorescence peak was detected for the control sample that is the distilled water without mps which was enough evidence that the fluorescence peaks observed in other samples originated from the mps fig s8 as aging continued sfs spectra differed between pvc and ps mps aged treatments three peaks representing the protein derived substances 280 nm soluble microbial byproduct like materials 320 nm and humic like fluorescence regions 380 nm occurred in pvc aged treatments except for 60 c aged while one strong peak 280 nm and two weaker peaks 330 nm and 380 nm were detected in all ps aged treatments the peak intensities of these fluorescent peaks varied with aging time revealing that the chromogenic components of doc changed zhang et al 2021 chen et al 2022a 2022b commonly the eem map can be split into several regions representing the protein like substance fulvic acid like substrate the soluble microbial byproduct like substrate as well as humic acid like substance respectively chen et al 2022a 2022b as presented in fig s9 the locations and intensities of three fluorescent components in pvc and ps mps aged treatments varied during the experiment indicating that the dynamic evolution of doc differed in all samples xu et al 2022 lee et al 2020 the variation of doc concentration fig 2 and sfs fig s8 supported this result as evidence in this study the protein like substances and soluble microbial byproduct like substrates were the main components of doc in all samples similar to the report by zhang et al 2021 the dominant presence of the bio labile substances was consistent with the previous findings that 60 of mps sourced doc could be utilized by microbes romera castillo et al 2018 besides a weaker peak representing the humic like substance was exhibited in eem maps which was also observed by lee et al 2020 in commercial plastics after uv irradiation furthermore the regions of humic like substances were relatively more pronounced in pvc than ps aged treatments likely because the dotp contained in pvc manufacture was released during the aging process which exhibited the fluorescent response in the region of humic like zhang et al 2021 to obtain more valuable information parafac modeling was applied in this study as illustrated in fig 3 two more robust components representing the protein like substances and two weaker fluorescent components representing soluble microbial byproduct like substrate were observed in all treatments and the location of these two more substantial peaks varied with mps type pvc c1 ex em 220 275 310 nm and c2 ex em 225 275 300 nm ps c1 ex em 220 275 310 nm and c2 ex em 275 330 nm these results illustrated that the aging of mps facilitated the release of degradable organic substances a similar finding was also reported by sun et al 2022 that more liable compounds including lipid like protein amino sugar like and carbohydrate like compounds were observed in doc leached from mps besides the elaboration of the parafac model confirmed a two component model regardless of mp type like the results described by xu et al 2022 furthermore to quantifiably evaluate the change of two more vital components the temporal variations were calculated as shown in fig s10 and table s5 fmax values varied with the prolonged aging time and fmax values exhibited apparent differences in different mps regardless of aging conditions higher fmax values were observed in c1 accounting for 82 38 99 60 of the doc derived from ps in all aging conditions which was also confirmed by the previous report that the higher correlations of c1 with the initial amounts of ps provided adequate evidence lee et al 2020 oppositely c2 was regarded as the dominant component in doc leached from pvc aged treatments except under 60 c conditions in which the main component changed between c1 and c2 with the increase of aging time 3 2 2 3 2d cos maps analysis to explore the aging mechanism deeply from the perspectives of doc characterizations 2d cos was used to expand the dynamic spectrum ding et al 2020 lin et al 2020 in this study ftir and sfs integrated with 2d cos were used to analyze the doc mps according to the reported rules noda 2006 dowrey et al 2001 lasch and noda 2019 after analyzing the 2d cos images fig 4 it was found that the transformation mechanisms of doc released from mps aging varied when exposed to different aging conditions the related details were that the ftir bands at 810 and 1660 cm 1 were positively correlated with the sfs bands at 280 nm in all doc pvc treatments and the color of these red points became darker in 60 c and uv aged treatments regardless of the aging conditions these results indicated that the degradation of protein like substances was attributed to the destruction of c o and c cl in pvc mps aged treatments and high temperature and uv irradiation promoted this process besides humic like substances were positively connected with c o in doc derived from 25 c aged while that in uv aging treatment presented negative correlations indicating that the change mechanisms of humic like substances were different under 25 c and uv aging due to the weak humic like peak that occurred in 60 c aging of pvc no apparent relationship between humic like substances and c o was observed as discussed in section 3 2 2 2 as for ps aged treatments the negative correlations between functional groups c o and c o and protein like substances were observed in ps aged samples except for 25 c aging and blue points became darker in 60 c aged samples concluded from these results demonstrated that the correlations between fluorescent substances and functional groups could be affected by mps type and aging conditions and thereby leading to the differences in doc transformation the concentration fig 2 and spectral characterizations fig s7 s10 and table s4 s5 of doc leached from all treatments confirmed this result 3 3 nanoparticles characterizations during the mps aged process the 3d afm height images in fig 5 showed that nano particles were generated in all pvc and ps aged treatments these nanoparticles were characterized by irregular shapes and rough surfaces and the roughness values were 1 35 2 33 nm and 1 08 4 09 nm in pvc and ps aged treatments respectively table s6 furthermore the maximum roughness values were observed in uv aging treatments followed by 60 c and 25 c dark similar studies were reported by ding et al 2020 and zhu et al 2020 who stated that high temperature and uv irradiation promoted the generation of cracks flakes and pits on mps surface and thereby enhancing its roughness though afm confirmed the release of nanoparticles during the aging of mps by visualized images the composition of these nanoparticles was unclear in this study the py gcms data showed that pvc nps and ps nps were released under the aging of pvc and ps mps table s7 considering the findings that additives and oligomers leached from mps are soluble in water yang et al 2021 hernandez et al 2019 lee et al 2020 herein coinciding with nta results it pointed out that uv irradiation and high temperature promoted the release of nps especially uv irradiation during which mps became more vulnerable and rougher to be fragmented liu et al 2022a 2022b the release of nps fitted with rougher surfaces affected the transport of environmental contamination based on the investigations of relationships between mps aged and environmental contamination ding et al 2020 wang et al 2020 meng et al 2021 however due to the different properties of mps and nps the specific effect of nps on environmental contamination should be further studied to assess its potential risks to ecology lee et al 2020 to further detect the size and distribution of released nps nta was applied in this study rocca et al 2014 yang et al 2021 as presented in fig 5a b there was a substantial release of nps in all treatments and the size mainly concentrated from 1 450 nm like the finding by lambert and wagner 2016 it was observed that the abundance of detectable nps in pvc and ps mps aged treatments were 8 77 109 8 87 1010 nps l and 4 06 109 3 94 1010 nps l respectively which was like the nps concentration 1 47 1010 particles reported in thermal aging of plastics teabags hernandez et al 2019 meanwhile higher abundances of nps were detected in pvc aged treatments which was because the open structure and lower tensile strength of pvc make it easier to be fragmented liu et al 2019a 2019b besides in both pvc and ps mps aged treatments the highest abundance of nps was observed in uv aged treatments followed by 60 c and 25 c dark indicating that photochemical oxidation and thermochemical oxidation aggravated the release of nps during the aging process especially the uv irradiation confirmed by the roughness obtained from afm analysis table s6 as presented in fig 5c d the average size of nps released from pvc and ps mps aged samples was 156 81 289 50 nm and 236 52 253 89 nm respectively which was larger than the results observed in the mechanical aging of polyester textiles 188 68 nm yang et al 2021 this difference could be due to the different aging conditions and mp properties ding et al 2020 bao et al 2022 besides it was noted that the generated nps mainly concentrated at 200 300 nm in ps 44 89 46 54 and pvc aged treatments 38 37 39 71 except uv aged of pvc in which smaller nps 1 100 nm were generated the simpler structure and lower tensile strength of pvc and the rougher mps surface promoted by uv irradiation were responsible for this phenomenon and the sem images and size distribution fig 1 confirmed this result obviously compared with ps mps aged treatments more nps characterized with sizes ranging from 50 100 nm were generated in all pvc mps aged treatments hence more attention should be paid to the uv aged of pvc to reduce its potentially hazardous effect on ecology from the perspective of nps generation 3 4 seed germination and seedling growth the data showed that the gi values in leachate pvc differed from those of leachate ps treatments and the specific information was that gi values were 86 18 95 00 and 100 51 114 67 in pvc mps aged treatments and ps mps aged treatments respectively fig s11 the gi values in pvc mps aged treatments were lower than 100 demonstrating the inhibition effect of leachates released from pvc mps on seed germination which was dominantly explained by followed two perspectives 1 more nps particles generated in pvc aged fig 5a which could accumulate in the stoma of the seed skin of the germinating plant and form a physical barrier thereby restricting the germination of seeds and root growth bosker et al 2019 and 2 as confirmed additive in pvc production table s1 the main organic additives in mps are plasticizers like dibutyl phthalate 2 ethylhexyl ester which might inhibit amylase activity and induce oxidative stress in plants thus leading to the negative effect on seed germination hahladakis et al 2018 fauser et al 2022 while the gi values in ps mps aged treatments were above 100 indicating that the leachates released from ps mps aged treatments benefited the plant growth like its positive role on corn zea mays l seedlings which due to the ps nps trigging root antioxidant enzyme system zhang et al 2022 furthermore regardless of the mps type the lowest gi values were observed in uv aged treatments which was consistent with the more nps released from uv aged fig 5 4 conclusions data obtained from artificial aging experiments showed that the total abundance of mps decreased after aging and the formation of smaller mps was facilitated especially by uv aging with the aging proceeding the doc releasing tendency of pvc differed from that of ps and high temperature and uv irradiation promoted the adsorption and decomposition of doc most mps sourced doc was composed of protein like and hydrophilic substances except for the 60 c aging of ps mps besides high temperature and uv irradiation promoted the release of mps nps under the aging of mps especially uv which promoted the formation of smaller and rougher nps and thus adversely affected ecological environments the finding first revealed the characteristics of leachates doc and nps released from mps under different aging conditions which was helpful for offsetting the knowledge gap between the mps aging and assessing their potential threats to ecology declaration of

14992,despite numerous studies that have been devoted to investigating the aging behaviors of microplastics mps dissolved organic carbon doc and nano plastics nps released from mps under different aging conditions were limited herein the characterizations and underlying mechanisms of doc and nps leaching from mps pvc and ps in the aquatic environment for 130 days under different aging conditions were investigated the results showed that aging could reduce the abundance of mps and high temperature and uv aging generated small sized mps 100 μm especially uv aging doc releasing characteristics were related to mp type and aging condition meanwhile mps were prone to release protein like and hydrophilic substances except for 60 c aging of ps mps additionally 8 77 109 8 87 1010 and 4 06 109 3 94 1010 nps l were detected in leachates from pvc and ps mps aged treatments respectively high temperature and uv promoted the release of nps especially uv irradiation meanwhile smaller sizes and rougher nps were observed in uv aged treatments implying higher ecological risks of leachates from mps under uv aging this study highlights the leachate released from mps under different aging conditions comprehensively which could offset the knowledge gap between the mps aging and their potential threats graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics aging

introduction microplastics mps typically defined as plastics with a diameter smaller than 5 mm have drawn increasing concern due to their widespread presence in aquatic environments rivers lakes estuary water and ocean and their adverse effect on aquatic organisms liu et al 2019a 2019b chen et al 2022a 2022b wu et al 2021 it is well known that mps are distributed in the environments for a longer period during which the mps experience the aging induced by light temperature and other environmental media sridharan et al 2021 liu et al 2019a 2019b these processes alternate mps characteristics surface morphology hydrophobicity roughness and others and break mps into smaller debris which aggravates the destruction of the ecosystem ding et al 2022 an increasing number of publications have documented the mps aging behaviors mainly focusing on the change of surface properties and functional groups ding et al 2020 liu et al 2022a 2022b luo et al 2021 however little attempt has been made to explore the variation of the size distribution of mps under aging environments which is also a non negligible factor in evaluating their adverse effects on environments liu et al 2022a 2022b sun et al 2019 tong et al 2022 therefore this aspect requires more attention besides mps in aging environments could lead to the release of leachates including dissolved organic carbon doc and nano plastics nps which have attracted more attention recently hahladakis et al 2018 lee et al 2020 yang et al 2021 for example the mps sourced doc could be utilized by microbes in the sea thereby affecting the composition of the base of marine food webs romera castillo et al 2018 a different phenomenon was found by zhu et al 2020 who pointed out that some doc released from mps may inhibit microbial activities additionally doc as one of the essential environmental factors plays an interactive role with other environmental pollutants heavy metals antibiotics and others in the aquatics wu et al 2021 chen et al 2022a 2022b these findings demonstrated that different mp sourced doc could have varying levels of impacts on ecological systems sun et al 2022 qiu et al 2022 lithner et al 2011 lee et al 2020 huffer et l 2018 lu et al 2022 hence it is supposed to explore the characterizations of doc leached from mps to the best knowledge of the authors only a few reports discuss the characterizations of doc leached from mps up to date romera castillo et al 2018 abolghasemi fakhri et al 2019 liu et al 2022a 2022b these studies mainly focused on the final properties of doc leached from mps exposure to single or multiple aging conditions uv high temperature fenton and seawater within short periods 4 50 days while ignoring the dynamic changes of doc leached from mps under various aging environments over a prolonged period xu et al 2022 lee et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 2022b qiu et al 2022 considering the sensitivity of leached doc and the stability of mps in water synthetically it is reasonable to hypothesize that the characterizations of mp sourced doc over a prolonged period of aging are different from that obtained from a short aging time thereby leading to the distinct effects on environments lee et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 2022b herein further study is supposed to be explored the variations of doc leached from mps under a long period of aging another non ignoring problem is the release of nano plastics nps plastic particles with size 1000 nm with the fragment of mps during the aging process zhu et al 2019 soraman et al 2022 different from mps nps are more hazardous due to their high diffusion and ability to cross biological barriers which make it vital to explore the np s properties during the aging process of mps allan et al 2022 at present although a handful of studies confirm the existence of nps in aging samples including boiling of plastic tea bags washing of synthetic textiles and others by nanoparticle tracking analysis nta atomic force microscope afm and other means little information about the releasing characteristics of nps from mps under different aging conditions are reported hernandez et al 2019 yang et al 2021 therefore this study primarily investigated the dissolved organic carbon fingerprints and nps released by mps under different aging conditions commercial polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene ps were selected as the probe plastics for 130 days of aging experiments due to their prevalence in aquatic ecosystems and potential risks liu et al 2022a 2022b luo et al 2021 zhu et al 2019 moreover the seed generation test was also done to assess the toxicity of leachate released from mps with the assistance of afm nta py gcms and spectral analyses it was comprehensive to understand the secondary mps pollution and thus evaluate the potential risks of aging mps to environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 plastic materials commercial pvc and ps particles used in this study were purchased from feihong co ltd dongguan china and the primary components of pvc and ps are presented in table s1 before the aging experiment these spherical shaped pvc and ps were pretreated by washing with ultrapure water pulverizing and sieving to determine the particle size below 1000 μm 2 2 aging experiments to simulate the aging of mps in environments including uv irradiation and high temperature the pvc and ps samples were exposed to three artificial aging conditions 60 c dark ultrapure water 25 c uv light ultrapure water and 25 c dark ultrapure water tersely marking as 60 c uv and 25 c dark respectively xu et al 2022 chen et al 2022a 2022b qiu et al 2022 the irradiation energy was supplied by two 15 w uv lambs as for aging experiments the mixtures of 0 5 grams of mps and 100 ml ultrapure water were sonicated for 30 min to make them homogeneously luo et al 2021 meanwhile treatments in these three aging environments without mps were recorded as the control and each treatment was set in three parallels after that all samples were placed in the above three aging conditions for 130 days of the aging experiment during which the ultrapure water was termly replenished to ensure the constant concentration of samples the suspensions were filtrated with 0 45 μm glass fiber filter membrane a glassware vacuum filtration device at specific aging periods 0 20 40 60 80 100 and 130 days then the aged mps samples collected above the membrane were dried and stored for further analysis and the remaining filtrate leachate under the membrane stored in a metal flask was used for subsequent doc determination and nps analysis the reasonability for collecting nps was proven by lambert and wagner 2016 who pointed out that the nps released from mps aging were mainly concentrated from 1 450 nm 2 3 characteristic analysis of mps the surface morphologies of virgin and aged mps were detected by stereomicroscope olympus cx23 japan and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx s 4800 hitachi japan respectively which also determined the element abundance on mps surfaces size distribution and the average size of mps were analyzed by measuring particles in stereomicroscope images smz25 nikon japan using image j software meanwhile the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy nicolet 8700 america was applied to analyze the functional groups of mps with a resolution of 2 cm 1 and 64 scanning times over the range of 4000 400 cm 1 2 4 analytical measurements of doc leached from different aging conditions the collected filtrate was divided into several parts one was used to measure doc concentration by toc l toc l shimadzu japan one was for recording uv vis spectra and fluorescence spectra the other was for monitoring the ftir to eliminate the fluorescence rate doc was diluted to the same concentration before scanning the uv vis and fluorescence spectra the uv vis and fluorescent spectra including synchronous fluorescence spectrum sfs and excitation emission matrix 3d eem were recorded by uv 1452 uv 1452 shimazu japan and fluorospectrometric photometer f 4600 hitachi japan respectively the related details were described in text s2 besides the specific methods of cl concentration and redox potential eh determination were presented in text s1 2 5 determination of nano plastics and toxicity evaluation due to the smaller particle size and more complex components of nps different analytical techniques were applied to characterize them in this study for the physical information the nanoparticle tracking was analyzed by afm multimode 8 bruker america while the size and number concentration were analyzed by nta which could be capable of analyzing particles in size range of 1 2000 nm chemically the py gcms gcms qp2020 shimadzu japan was applied to determine the nanoparticle composition assisted by a cracker named py 3030d frontier the operation parameters were exhibited in text s3 furthermore to assess the toxicity of leachates released from aged mps the seed germination experiment was carried out according to li et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mps during different aging processes 3 1 1 the changes in the morphology and size distribution of mps sem images from fig 1 and fig s2 showed that the cracks wrinkles and pits on the surface of pvc and ps mps became significant as the aging continued especially uv irradiation and high temperature which was similar to the finding observed by tang et al 2018 while due to the various structure and tensile strengths of pvc and ps morphological changes in pvc and ps aged were different zhou et al 2018 compared with pvc mps relatively inconspicuous microcracks formed on the surface of ps mps while the lower final carbon loss fig 1a b and releasing doc concentration fig 2 in ps than pvc mps confirmed this result as shown in fig 1c d the total mps particles significantly p 0 05 decreased from 48000 to 33000 41667 particles g in pvc aged treatments and 41000 to 20000 35667 particles g in ps aged treatments respectively indicating that aging could reduce the abundance of mps in contrast one previous study showed that the number of secondary mps in different plastics pvc ps pla pbs and pbat increased undergoing 21 days of uv irradiation tong et al 2022 this difference may be ascribed to the prolonged aging period in this study which facilitated the exposure of the mps to further decomposition and sem images fig 1 a b supported this result as evidence in this study 37 50 and 56 91 of virgin pvc and ps were 200 μm respectively with the dominant size class of 200 500 μm after 130 days of aging most secondary mps in all aged treatments were dominantly concentrated on 2 100 μm indicating the fragmentation of mps which was similar to the finding stated by liu et al 2019 and liu et al 2022 meanwhile high temperature and uv irradiation enhanced the fragmentation of mps probably because the reactive oxygen species generation was promoted by these two conditions liu et al 2022a 2022b yan et al 2022 notably the maximum value in fraction with size 100 μm was observed in 60 c aged pvc 24778 particles g and uv aged ps 14778 particles g revealing that the responses of mps to a certain aging condition were different it may be ascribed to the more straightforward structure and lower tensile strength of pvc than ps which made it easier to decompose more mps into minor mps or nps in pvc aged samples especially through uv irradiation liu et al 2019a 2019b tang et al 2018 the nps data supported the above result as evidence fig 5 a b 3 1 2 ftir analysis of mps compared with virgin mps analogous ftir spectra without any new absorption peaks were recorded in all pvc and ps aged treatments fig s3 which was different from the results reported by ding et al 2022 and wang et al 2020 this difference may be due to the different characteristics of mps and the aging mechanisms of aging conditions ding et al 2020 as aging continued the peak intensities of characteristic bands varied in all treatments the intensities of c cl at 782 cm 1 specific bands of pvc decreased initially and then increased in all pvc samples which was confirmed by the cl concentration in the related filtrate fig s4 this decreasing profile was possibly attributed to the dehydrochlorination by h induced by aging environments while the concentrated effect possibly caused by the decomposition of the carbon chain led to the increase of c cl ren et al 2022 tang et al 2018 different from pvc the peak intensities of ch2 and ch at 1450 cm 1 and 1493 cm 1 of ps decreased while that of c o increased in ps aged treatments as aging proceeded indicating that the cleavage of c h bonds of ps mps and the oxidation reaction to form c o induced by different aging conditions took place mao et al 2020 the further analysis of 2d cos based on ftir indicated that sequential orders of other specific chemical reactions were different among all treatments except the prior destruction of the c o in uv aging of pvc and ps fig s6 table s2 and table s3 these results indicated aging behaviors of mps varied with the mps type and aging condition like the findings of ding et al 2020 3 2 the characteristics of doc mps under different aging conditions 3 2 1 the doc concentration variation as exhibited in fig 2 pvc and ps mps released doc into the surrounding water under aging conditions which consisted of truly dissolved substances and polymeric nps fragmented from the plastic surface romera castillo et al 2018 during the aging experiments the doc leached from pvc mps showed a gradual upward trend which increased rapidly in the first 20 days and then fluctuated with the extent of aging time in all ps aged treatments these results indicated that the trend of doc leached from pvc and ps mps differed except for the initial increase within 20 days in all treatments this temporary increase was like the results pointed out by lee et al 2020 in which mps structures became more vulnerable to being dissolved lee et al 2020 lambert and wagner 2016 meanwhile the doc leached from ps aged treatments on the 20th was higher than that of in pvc aged treatments possibly due to the 2 ethyl terephthalate ester dotp in pvc table s1 resulting in its aging resistant in the short period tang et al 2018 after 20 days the fluctuated leaching of doc in ps aged treatments was possibly ascribed to the adsorption of doc on the ps surface and conversion of doc in the surrounding water which was promoted by the extended contact of mps with aging environments chen et al 2022a 2022b meng et al 2021 the variation of carbon content on the ps surface fig 1a b and spectral signatures of doc fig s7 and fig s8 could also provide evidence for this result while the intense release of doc in all pvc aged treatments was possibly due to the rapid dissolution of dotp additive detected in pvc from confined matrices which was also facilitated by the more substantial fragmentation lee et al 2020 do et al 2022 in this study the final doc values in pvc aged treatments 3 38 7 60 mg l were higher than that of ps 1 19 4 69 mg l which may be ascribed to the existence of benzene ring structures in ps polymers made it insensitive to environments liu et al 2019a 2019b furthermore the highest doc concentration was observed in 25 c aged treatments regardless of the mp type a different profile was reported by chen et al 2022 who described that uv irradiation promoted the release of doc from ps and polyethylene pe mps aging within 7 days this difference was probably because of the fragmentation accelerated by high temperature and uv under a prolonged aging time during which adsorption of doc on mps surface and the decomposition of doc were promoted ding et al 2020 fan et al 2021 additionally the doc values detected in uv aged were higher than those in 60 c aged treatments it could be explained by two perspectives 1 high temperature accelerated the diffusion of doc thereby facilitating the adsorption of doc by mps while uv increased the crystallinity of the polymer and thereby restricting the adsorption relationship between doc and mps anjana et al 2023 the higher carbon contents on mps under 60 c aging confirmed the reasonability of this result fig 1a b 2 the decomposition was promoted by high temperature consistent with the relatively higher eh values observed in 60 c aged treatments fig s5 the doc released from mps could not only be integral to many processes of ecological like the carbon cycle and climate change but also be served as heterogenous sites for the binding of pollutants thus aggravating the environmental risks qiu et al 2022 to assess the risks of mps aging to the ecological environment it is important to investigate the characteristics of doc 3 2 2 spectroscopic characterization of doc leached from mps aged process 3 2 2 1 uv vis characterization analysis as presented in fig s7 regardless of the mps type the absorbance fluctuated with the prolongation of aging time in pvc and ps aged treatments and there were no pronounced characteristic peaks like the observation reported by xu et al 2022 these results indicated that the component and molecular weight of doc differed in all treatments and varied as aging proceeded cook et al 2017 to obtain more information suva254 representing the molecular weight was calculated according to the published formula and definition chen et al 2022a 2022b as exhibited in table s4 whatever the mp type the suva254 value fluctuated with the aging continued indicating the conversion between high molecular weight fractions and low molecular components during the aging process a different profile was observed by chen et al 2022 who pointed out that suva254 increased within 40 days of ps aging this difference was possible because of the prolonged aging period in this study during which the dynamic transformation of doc took place and the variation of fluorescent signatures provided evidence for this result fig s8 s9 additionally suva254 might reflect aromatic degree that is identify the doc properties from the perspectives of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity chen et al 2022a 2022b weishaar et al 2003 most suva254 values in pvc and ps mps aged treatments were 3 under all aging conditions except 60 c aging of ps in which suva254 values were 4 on the 20th 60th and 100th this result demonstrated that though most doc was composed of hydrophilic substances high temperature facilitated the formation of the hydrophobic substance of ps sourced doc meanwhile this generated hydrophobic substance was beneficial for strengthening the absorption of doc on ps mps zheng et al 2023 thereby possibly leading to the highest carbon content fig 1b in ps mps and the rapid decrease of doc between 20 40 days undergoing 60 c fig 2b additionally it was reported that the substances characterized with hydrophilia hydrophobicity played the distinctive roles on the fate of organic pollutants zheng et al 2023 seidensticker et al 2017 therefore it was reasonable to hypothesize that the effect of doc leached from mps on the fate of pollutants differed among different aging conditions resulting in potential damage to the ecological environment which was supposed to be further investigated 3 2 2 2 fluorescent signatures analysis fluorescent spectra are notable tools for detecting the location and intensity of fluorescence components in dissolved organic matter dom lee et al 2020 xu et al 2022 in this study fluorescent spectra sfs and 3d eem maps of doc under different aging conditions were compared for the different mps no fluorescence peak was detected for the control sample that is the distilled water without mps which was enough evidence that the fluorescence peaks observed in other samples originated from the mps fig s8 as aging continued sfs spectra differed between pvc and ps mps aged treatments three peaks representing the protein derived substances 280 nm soluble microbial byproduct like materials 320 nm and humic like fluorescence regions 380 nm occurred in pvc aged treatments except for 60 c aged while one strong peak 280 nm and two weaker peaks 330 nm and 380 nm were detected in all ps aged treatments the peak intensities of these fluorescent peaks varied with aging time revealing that the chromogenic components of doc changed zhang et al 2021 chen et al 2022a 2022b commonly the eem map can be split into several regions representing the protein like substance fulvic acid like substrate the soluble microbial byproduct like substrate as well as humic acid like substance respectively chen et al 2022a 2022b as presented in fig s9 the locations and intensities of three fluorescent components in pvc and ps mps aged treatments varied during the experiment indicating that the dynamic evolution of doc differed in all samples xu et al 2022 lee et al 2020 the variation of doc concentration fig 2 and sfs fig s8 supported this result as evidence in this study the protein like substances and soluble microbial byproduct like substrates were the main components of doc in all samples similar to the report by zhang et al 2021 the dominant presence of the bio labile substances was consistent with the previous findings that 60 of mps sourced doc could be utilized by microbes romera castillo et al 2018 besides a weaker peak representing the humic like substance was exhibited in eem maps which was also observed by lee et al 2020 in commercial plastics after uv irradiation furthermore the regions of humic like substances were relatively more pronounced in pvc than ps aged treatments likely because the dotp contained in pvc manufacture was released during the aging process which exhibited the fluorescent response in the region of humic like zhang et al 2021 to obtain more valuable information parafac modeling was applied in this study as illustrated in fig 3 two more robust components representing the protein like substances and two weaker fluorescent components representing soluble microbial byproduct like substrate were observed in all treatments and the location of these two more substantial peaks varied with mps type pvc c1 ex em 220 275 310 nm and c2 ex em 225 275 300 nm ps c1 ex em 220 275 310 nm and c2 ex em 275 330 nm these results illustrated that the aging of mps facilitated the release of degradable organic substances a similar finding was also reported by sun et al 2022 that more liable compounds including lipid like protein amino sugar like and carbohydrate like compounds were observed in doc leached from mps besides the elaboration of the parafac model confirmed a two component model regardless of mp type like the results described by xu et al 2022 furthermore to quantifiably evaluate the change of two more vital components the temporal variations were calculated as shown in fig s10 and table s5 fmax values varied with the prolonged aging time and fmax values exhibited apparent differences in different mps regardless of aging conditions higher fmax values were observed in c1 accounting for 82 38 99 60 of the doc derived from ps in all aging conditions which was also confirmed by the previous report that the higher correlations of c1 with the initial amounts of ps provided adequate evidence lee et al 2020 oppositely c2 was regarded as the dominant component in doc leached from pvc aged treatments except under 60 c conditions in which the main component changed between c1 and c2 with the increase of aging time 3 2 2 3 2d cos maps analysis to explore the aging mechanism deeply from the perspectives of doc characterizations 2d cos was used to expand the dynamic spectrum ding et al 2020 lin et al 2020 in this study ftir and sfs integrated with 2d cos were used to analyze the doc mps according to the reported rules noda 2006 dowrey et al 2001 lasch and noda 2019 after analyzing the 2d cos images fig 4 it was found that the transformation mechanisms of doc released from mps aging varied when exposed to different aging conditions the related details were that the ftir bands at 810 and 1660 cm 1 were positively correlated with the sfs bands at 280 nm in all doc pvc treatments and the color of these red points became darker in 60 c and uv aged treatments regardless of the aging conditions these results indicated that the degradation of protein like substances was attributed to the destruction of c o and c cl in pvc mps aged treatments and high temperature and uv irradiation promoted this process besides humic like substances were positively connected with c o in doc derived from 25 c aged while that in uv aging treatment presented negative correlations indicating that the change mechanisms of humic like substances were different under 25 c and uv aging due to the weak humic like peak that occurred in 60 c aging of pvc no apparent relationship between humic like substances and c o was observed as discussed in section 3 2 2 2 as for ps aged treatments the negative correlations between functional groups c o and c o and protein like substances were observed in ps aged samples except for 25 c aging and blue points became darker in 60 c aged samples concluded from these results demonstrated that the correlations between fluorescent substances and functional groups could be affected by mps type and aging conditions and thereby leading to the differences in doc transformation the concentration fig 2 and spectral characterizations fig s7 s10 and table s4 s5 of doc leached from all treatments confirmed this result 3 3 nanoparticles characterizations during the mps aged process the 3d afm height images in fig 5 showed that nano particles were generated in all pvc and ps aged treatments these nanoparticles were characterized by irregular shapes and rough surfaces and the roughness values were 1 35 2 33 nm and 1 08 4 09 nm in pvc and ps aged treatments respectively table s6 furthermore the maximum roughness values were observed in uv aging treatments followed by 60 c and 25 c dark similar studies were reported by ding et al 2020 and zhu et al 2020 who stated that high temperature and uv irradiation promoted the generation of cracks flakes and pits on mps surface and thereby enhancing its roughness though afm confirmed the release of nanoparticles during the aging of mps by visualized images the composition of these nanoparticles was unclear in this study the py gcms data showed that pvc nps and ps nps were released under the aging of pvc and ps mps table s7 considering the findings that additives and oligomers leached from mps are soluble in water yang et al 2021 hernandez et al 2019 lee et al 2020 herein coinciding with nta results it pointed out that uv irradiation and high temperature promoted the release of nps especially uv irradiation during which mps became more vulnerable and rougher to be fragmented liu et al 2022a 2022b the release of nps fitted with rougher surfaces affected the transport of environmental contamination based on the investigations of relationships between mps aged and environmental contamination ding et al 2020 wang et al 2020 meng et al 2021 however due to the different properties of mps and nps the specific effect of nps on environmental contamination should be further studied to assess its potential risks to ecology lee et al 2020 to further detect the size and distribution of released nps nta was applied in this study rocca et al 2014 yang et al 2021 as presented in fig 5a b there was a substantial release of nps in all treatments and the size mainly concentrated from 1 450 nm like the finding by lambert and wagner 2016 it was observed that the abundance of detectable nps in pvc and ps mps aged treatments were 8 77 109 8 87 1010 nps l and 4 06 109 3 94 1010 nps l respectively which was like the nps concentration 1 47 1010 particles reported in thermal aging of plastics teabags hernandez et al 2019 meanwhile higher abundances of nps were detected in pvc aged treatments which was because the open structure and lower tensile strength of pvc make it easier to be fragmented liu et al 2019a 2019b besides in both pvc and ps mps aged treatments the highest abundance of nps was observed in uv aged treatments followed by 60 c and 25 c dark indicating that photochemical oxidation and thermochemical oxidation aggravated the release of nps during the aging process especially the uv irradiation confirmed by the roughness obtained from afm analysis table s6 as presented in fig 5c d the average size of nps released from pvc and ps mps aged samples was 156 81 289 50 nm and 236 52 253 89 nm respectively which was larger than the results observed in the mechanical aging of polyester textiles 188 68 nm yang et al 2021 this difference could be due to the different aging conditions and mp properties ding et al 2020 bao et al 2022 besides it was noted that the generated nps mainly concentrated at 200 300 nm in ps 44 89 46 54 and pvc aged treatments 38 37 39 71 except uv aged of pvc in which smaller nps 1 100 nm were generated the simpler structure and lower tensile strength of pvc and the rougher mps surface promoted by uv irradiation were responsible for this phenomenon and the sem images and size distribution fig 1 confirmed this result obviously compared with ps mps aged treatments more nps characterized with sizes ranging from 50 100 nm were generated in all pvc mps aged treatments hence more attention should be paid to the uv aged of pvc to reduce its potentially hazardous effect on ecology from the perspective of nps generation 3 4 seed germination and seedling growth the data showed that the gi values in leachate pvc differed from those of leachate ps treatments and the specific information was that gi values were 86 18 95 00 and 100 51 114 67 in pvc mps aged treatments and ps mps aged treatments respectively fig s11 the gi values in pvc mps aged treatments were lower than 100 demonstrating the inhibition effect of leachates released from pvc mps on seed germination which was dominantly explained by followed two perspectives 1 more nps particles generated in pvc aged fig 5a which could accumulate in the stoma of the seed skin of the germinating plant and form a physical barrier thereby restricting the germination of seeds and root growth bosker et al 2019 and 2 as confirmed additive in pvc production table s1 the main organic additives in mps are plasticizers like dibutyl phthalate 2 ethylhexyl ester which might inhibit amylase activity and induce oxidative stress in plants thus leading to the negative effect on seed germination hahladakis et al 2018 fauser et al 2022 while the gi values in ps mps aged treatments were above 100 indicating that the leachates released from ps mps aged treatments benefited the plant growth like its positive role on corn zea mays l seedlings which due to the ps nps trigging root antioxidant enzyme system zhang et al 2022 furthermore regardless of the mps type the lowest gi values were observed in uv aged treatments which was consistent with the more nps released from uv aged fig 5 4 conclusions data obtained from artificial aging experiments showed that the total abundance of mps decreased after aging and the formation of smaller mps was facilitated especially by uv aging with the aging proceeding the doc releasing tendency of pvc differed from that of ps and high temperature and uv irradiation promoted the adsorption and decomposition of doc most mps sourced doc was composed of protein like and hydrophilic substances except for the 60 c aging of ps mps besides high temperature and uv irradiation promoted the release of mps nps under the aging of mps especially uv which promoted the formation of smaller and rougher nps and thus adversely affected ecological environments the finding first revealed the characteristics of leachates doc and nps released from mps under different aging conditions which was helpful for offsetting the knowledge gap between the mps aging and assessing their potential threats to ecology declaration of

14993,sediment organic carbon seoc sources with rich information can be used as a historical archive reflecting anthropogenic activities in the catchment which is crucial to carbon management in the watershed anthropogenic activities and hydrodynamic conditions significantly influence the river environment and are reflected by the seoc sources however the key drivers of the seoc source dynamics are ambiguous which restricts the behavior of regulating the carbon output of the basin in this study sediment cores from the lower reach of an inland river were selected to quantify the seoc sources based on a centennial scale a partial least squares path model was used to establish the relationship between anthropogenic activities and hydrological conditions with the seoc sources findings showed that the exogenous advantage of seoc composition was gradually significant early period 54 3 middle period 81 later period 82 from the bottom layer to the surface layer of the sediments in the lower

different effects land use change aggravated soil erosion and brought more terrestrial organic carbon to the downstream the variation of grassland carbon input was the most obvious from 33 6 to 18 4 in contrast the reservoir construction intercepted upstream sediments which might have been the main reason for the slow growth of terrestrial organic carbon input in the downstream in the later period this study provides a specific grafting for the seoc records source changes anthropogenic activities in the lower reach of the river which provides scientific basis for watershed carbon management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river sediment organic carbon sources centennial scale bayesian mixing model anthropogenic activities data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction rivers are the main pathways to export seoc from the land to the oceans playing a key role in the global carbon cycle johannessen et al 2003 zhao et al 2017 in recent decades anthropogenic activities such as land use change and reservoir construction and hydrologic conditions are changing the river environment at an unprecedented speed which has a far reaching impact on the seoc sources the seoc sources of rivers are mainly divided into exogenous inputs different land use vegetation litter sewage etc and endogenous sources aquatic plants phytoplankton algae etc of river autogenesis the downstream of the river is the location connecting the upstream and the outlet and its seoc source dynamics have attracted more attention the seoc sources in the lower reach of rivers are not only affected by the surrounding anthropogenic activities and hydrological conditions but also may be disturbed by the reservoirs in the upper reach making the sources more uncertain therefore it is necessary to analyze the seoc sources in the lower reach of rivers in detail and determine the key drivers of seoc source dynamics the transport of organic carbon oc from source to sink is affected by many factors including long term variations in terrestrial oc delivery to river ecosystems affected by land use changes yang et al 2021 additionally the completed reservoirs upstream of the river will affect the seoc sources in the lower reach of the river by intercepting sediment creating a stagnant environment and changing the hydrological conditions early studies found that in typical overflow lakes the contribution of soil oc brought by anthropogenic activities such as industrial sewage discharge and fish pond feed input was the largest liu et al 2021 moreover studies have clarified that distributions and sources of seoc were different in season and space with affecting by anthropogenic activities such as the input of man made pollutants and land use change lee et al 2019 although previous studies have analyzed the impact of certain specific factors on seoc sources the identification of key drivers of seoc source dynamics is indistinct mayer and johnson 1994 qu et al 2018 lee et al 2019 especially the comparative study of multiple factors such as anthropogenic activities and hydrological conditions in addition most studies only focus on the exploration of seoc on the surface while the study of deep seoc especially the deep seoc source in the lower reach of the river is insufficient du and walling 2017 yu et al 2018 lin et al 2022 consequently in further tracing the seoc sources attention should be paid to the interannual variation and the key drivers identifying apportioning and tracking the seoc sources in aquatic systems require robust reliable and effective source tracking tools stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n have source specificity and good conservation so they are used as effective tools for carbon source apportionment derrien et al 2018 li et al 2022 studies have proved that δ13c was identified to be the most reliable tracer for tracking oc sources under early diagenetic processes derrien et al 2020 additionally other studies have shown that stable isotopes have great potential for tracing oc sources through indoor end member mixing experiments and outdoor validation experiments li et al 2022 in the calculation method although the traditional iso source model is an momentous means to quantify the seoc sources the model does not consider the uncertainty of the source therefore a new generation of the bayesian mixing model has emerged which has improved the ability to quantify the source of substances in aquatic systems and has been widely used in different isotope systems stock and semmens 2016 stock et al 2018 torres martinez et al 2020 liu and han 2021 bayesian mixing models are divided into three types mixsir siar and mixsiar respectively the mixsiar model combines the advantages of mixsir and siar adds fixed and random effects and integrates source uncertainty stock et al 2018 these functions enable the mixsiar model to have higher accuracy in source apportionment combined with current research progress we aimed to solve the problem of what were the key drivers of the seoc source dynamics in the lower reach of an inland river we assumed that anthropogenic activities were the key factors driving the seoc source dynamics in the lower reach of the inland river to solve the problem we used the mixsiar model and partial least squares path model pls pm method to quantify the seoc sources and identify key drivers the objectives were to 1 depict the temporal variation characteristics of sediment proxies and seoc sources on the vertical profile of the lower reach of the xiangjiang river lxr 2 determine the impact of anthropogenic activities on the seoc sources 3 explore the relationship between land use change and reservoir construction with the seoc sources current research findings help clarify the profound impact of anthropogenic activities on the seoc dynamics in inland rivers and provide reference for the carbon management in the watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area xiangjiang river xr the largest river in hunan province and an inland river in china originates from guangxi and flows into dongting lake its main stream is 856 km in hunan province with a drainage area of 85 383 km2 accounting for 40 of the total area of hunan province fig 1 xr is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the landform is dominated by low mountains and hills accounting for 65 of the total drainage area the climate of the basin belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate the hydrologic condition can be divided into the distinct wet season and the dry season the average annual temperature is between 17 and 18 and the annual precipitation ranges from 1300 to 1500 mm dong et al 1992 as shown in fig s1 the main land use types in this region are forest land and cropland the main crop on the cropland is rice and the garden plot is mainly planted with fruit trees citrus chestnut pear and tea trees high intensity land use and reservoir construction as well as dense population and high urbanization make the impact of surrounding anthropogenic activities on the river increasingly significant 2 2 sampling and laboratory analyses we selected a site 112 48 56 13 e 28 37 18 45 n with good sedimentation on the floodplain of the mainstream of lxr in 2020 december subsequently we used a gravity corer rhinoceros s1 usa to collect four cores 0 200 cm at this site the cores were divided into 5 cm depth intervals for each depth interval the sediment from each of the four cores was combined to produce a composite sample for each depth interval the classification of land use types was based on the land use cover classification system of the chinese academy of sciences according to the distribution of typical land types in the catchment fig s1 we collected typical forest land 8 cinnamomum camphora castanopsis sclerophylla cyclobalanopsis glauca pinus massoniana etc cropland 8 rice garden plot 5 orchards and tea gardens grassland 4 and construction land 2 residential land industrial and mining land etc fig 1 each soil sample 0 20 cm is composed of three duplicate samples near the sampling site sampling details refer to supporting information additionally we found the reed gramineae phragmites genus and phragmites species all over the river bank and its scale made it the main endogenous source therefore we collected fresh reed leaves as endogenous representatives of the river the collected samples were stored in clean sealed bags and brought back to the laboratory quickly all samples were completely dried under ventilation for subsequent analysis all dry samples were sieved on a 0 15 mm metal sieve and then used to determine particle size total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio c n δ13c and δ15n particle size analysis was determined using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk according to the particle size the samples were screened at 5 mm and divided into clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm and sand 0 02 mm the milled and sieved sediment samples were acidified with 5 hcl for 3 h to remove inorganic carbon and then washed with ultra pure water until the filtrate was neutral finally the samples were freeze dried until analysis sediment samples for toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n were measured using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar hanau germany and stable isotope mass spectrometer ea irms flash2000ht thermo fisher scientific ma usa all isotopic compositions were expressed in delta notation as follows δ 13 c o r 1 sample r 1 standard r 1 standard 1000 r 1 13 c 12 c δ 15 n o r 2 sample r 2 standard r 2 standard 1000 r 2 15 n 14 n where rsample and rstandard are the composition 13c 12c or 15n 14n of the sample and reference 13c 12c and 15n 14n correspond to the international standard vienna peedee belemnite vpdb and the atmospheric n2 respectively the analytical precision was approximately 0 05 and 0 1 for δ13c and δ15n respectively 2 3 210pb dating the radionuclide 210pb with a half life of 22 3 years in the sediment is a good nuclide for measuring the sedimentation rate on a century scale ran et al 2021 in recent years it has been widely used in the dating of long timescale continuous sediments in water zhang et al 2020 the deposition rate was calculated by the constant rate of supply crs model as follows t in a n a j λ where t is the deposition time a of each deposition layer an is the accumulation amount of 210pbex below the surface layer bq kg 1 aj is the accumulation amount below the j layer and λ is the decay constant of 210pbex namely 0 03118a 1 2 4 mixsiar model the δ13c and δ15n were used as tracers in the mixsiar model for seoc source apportionment based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling algorithm the output of the mixsiar model is a probability distribution rather than a specific value expressed as mean standard deviation sd meng et al 2021 the model parameters were set as follows the source data entered was raw mcmc running time was set to long the error structure was set as residual only and specify prior was set as uninformative gelman rubin and geweke diagnostics were used to determine whether the model converged if the model does not converge the mcmc operation time long very long is increased and the model output result is expressed by the average value zhou et al 2021 2 5 pls pm pls pm was used to analyze the influencing factors of seoc sources which was realized in the package plspm in r 3 6 2 r core team 2019 it consists of a measurement model and a structural model the measurement model is used to describe the relationship between manifest variables and implicit variables while the structural model is used to describe the relationship between implicit variables one of the advantages of pls pm is that for each implicit variable an iterative algorithm is used to estimate the loading value of the implicit and manifest variables which can maximize the explanatory variance of implicit variables li et al 2020 to explore the influencing factors of the seoc sources we selected seven indicators as implicit variables anthropogenic activities hydrological conditions toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n we selected four indicators population gross domestic product gdp land area and some large reservoirs in the xr as the manifest variables of anthropogenic activities at the same time we selected annual runoff and sediment discharge as the manifest variables of hydrological conditions it was worth noting that we eliminated the indicator gdp with a loading value lower than 0 4 because this would improve the fitting effect of the manifest variable to the implicit variable 2 6 data sources anthropogenic activities data for 1951 2020 were obtained from the statistical yearbook of hunan province http tjj hunan gov cn mean annual runoff and sediment discharge for 1951 2020 were derived from the china river sediment bulletin http www mwr gov cn we have normalized the data obtained above more details about data sources and processing were shown in the supporting information 2 7 statistical analysis and graphing all data in this study were evaluated by the kolmogorov smirnov test for normality and no data conversion was required to satisfy the normal distribution we used excel 2016 and ibm spss26 statistical software to process and analyze the data pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationships between multiple sediment proxies in the lxr core the sampling points and land use maps were drawn by arcgis 10 5 esri los angeles usa redundancy analysis rda was conducted to determine the relationship between reservoir construction and seoc sources using canoco 5 the origin 2021 software was used for drawing 3 results 3 1 historical sedimentary records the average specific activity of 210pb was 15 85 it was measured that the average sedimentation rate of the lxr sediment was 2 01 cm yr and the sediment column of the lxr 0 200 cm represented the sediment from 1894 to 2020 the specific results of the dating have been shown in table s1 3 2 distribution characteristics of multiple sediment proxies 3 2 1 particle composition in the lxr core the particle composition was mainly composed of silt and sand containing a small amount of clay and no gravel fig s2 the clay content ranged from 9 73 to 13 90 with an average of 12 04 the variation range of silt component content was 39 96 62 82 and the average value was 56 41 the sand content ranged from 23 32 to 50 30 with an average of 31 55 table s2 since 1894 the content of clay and silt has decreased fig s2a and b while the content of sand has increased fig s2c in particular after 2013 the content of clay and silt decreased sharply and the sand increased rapidly 3 2 2 toc tn and c n as shown in fig 2a toc content varied from 0 3 to 1 36 toc as a whole showed a steady increasing trend which increased sharply in 1988 and then decreased it increased year by year before 1988 but there was no significant change form 1988 to 2013 after 2013 it showed a sharp increase trend tn content ranged from 0 06 to 0 13 fig 2b compared with toc the overall change of tn was stable but the changing trend was generally the same and both of them fluctuated greatly in 1988 the c n was between 4 5 and 10 96 fig 2c and the changing trend was also obvious to sum up the changes in toc tn and c n were relatively consistent according to such characteristics we can roughly divide the sediment into three periods the early period 1894 1987 the middle period 1988 2012 and the late period 2013 2020 3 2 3 δ13c and δ15n the time series of δ13c and δ15n were shown in fig 2c and d ranging from 24 28 to 19 99 and 4 16 9 29 respectively additionally they had a wide range and their change trend was different from toc tn and c n δ13c showed an upward trend before 1985 and then had a stable downward trend in 1999 2002 although δ13c increased slightly the range was very small by comparison the δ15n value altered in a more complex way before 1999 it remained stable with a small range of change and rose sharply from 1999 to 2006 then from 2006 to 2008 it remained stable 3 3 physical and chemical properties of sediments in different land uses as shown in fig s3 with different land uses the δ13c and δ15n of soils were different but there were also overlapping ranges toc tn δ13c and δ15n of grassland were significantly higher than that of other soils additionally toc tn and c n contents in the garden plot and cropland were also high in contrast the contents of toc tn and c n in forest land were low and δ13c and δ15n ranged from 27 58 to 19 82 0 80 9 29 respectively table s3 similarly for construction land δ13c and δ15n were also relatively low fig 3 showed that the source samples can well constrain the seoc sources because the isotope ratios of all sediment samples remain within the limits of each source 3 4 correlation analysis between multiple sediment proxies as shown in fig 4 toc and tn were an extremely significant positive correlation r 0 717 p 0 01 δ15n exhibited highly significant negative correlations with tn and c n p 0 01 nevertheless toc appeared insignificant correlations with c n and δ13c 3 5 quantification of seoc sources under different land use types the contribution of grassland to carbon sources first increased and then decreased and that of other types increased over time fig 5 table s4 although the proportion of grassland was decreasing it accounted for a large proportion of the early and medium period carbon source which were 33 6 and 37 2 construction land accounted for the smallest proportion of carbon source contribution in different periods additionally the endogenous contribution reed has been decreasing and the fastest decline from the early to the medium period overall from the early to late period the proportion of exogenous input of seoc has been increasing while the endogenous contribution has been decreasing in the lxr 3 6 analysis of influencing factors of seoc source the overall fitting effect gof of pls pm reached 0 7 anthropogenic activities and seoc source indicators toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n had a strong correlation e g δ13c r 0 94 p 0 001 δ15n r 0 66 p 0 001 fig 6 in contrast hydrological conditions were only significantly correlated with c n r 0 22 p 0 05 but not with other seoc source indicators p 0 05 3 7 relationship between large reservoirs and seoc source indicators as shown in fig s4 the first two axes of the rda explained a high proportion of variance i e 55 3 and 4 77 for axes 1 and 2 respectively this showed that 60 07 of the variation of seoc source indicators could be explained by the selected large reservoir related variables 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrological conditions on seoc source the grain size is the most commonly used method to study the physical properties of river sediments grain size is affected by many factors such as watershed hydrologic conditions sediment sources and environmental characteristics martinez garcia et al 2015 caballero et al 2019 generally the sand content of sediment is an indicator of hydrological changes with higher contents reflecting more pronounced changes li et al 2009 ran et al 2021 in the lxr the sand increased with the decrease in depth while clay and silt were opposite fig s2 this is a clear indication that the hydrodynamic force was strengthened compared with that before the transport of sand induced by soil erosion and hydrodynamics brings more terrestrial oc to the river which promoted seoc input this was proved by the increase in the contribution of terrestrial oc to the seoc sources of the river in the later period fig 5 studies have shown that hydrologic conditions affected the particle size of sediments drove the gradient distribution of seoc sources and made a certain contribution to the seoc sources xu et al 2021 runoff and sediment discharge were effective indicators of the river s hydrological environment runoff and sediment discharge significantly control oc migration transformation and distribution tesi et al 2013 ye et al 2017 wang et al 2021b based on the annual runoff and sediment discharge data of hydrometric stations in the lxr from 1951 to 2020 we explored the effects of hydrologic conditions on seoc source indicators i e toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n the pls pm results showed that the hydrologic conditions only had a significant impact on the c n r 0 22 p 0 05 fig 6 and did not show the significance for other seoc indicators the c n is an effective tracer for tracking the seoc sources this effect was likely to be caused by hydrodynamic processes by changing the migration deposition and resuspension of sediments xu et al 2021 these results confirmed that hydrological conditions have very limited influence on seoc sources in the lxr other factors such as anthropogenic activities in the catchment land use change reservoir construction etc could have altered the seoc input 4 2 impact of anthropogenic activities on the seoc sources 4 2 1 land use previous studies suggested that the variability in seoc sources in the river was affected by a combination of terrestrial input and river productivity both of which could be strongly controlled by anthropogenic activities such as land transformation wastewater discharge and agricultural production kastowski et al 2011 anderson et al 2013 chmiel et al 2015 mendonca et al 2017 haas et al 2019 yang et al 2021 toc and tn were markedly positively correlated fig 4 indicating that they had good homology or were regulated by the same biogeochemical process qu et al 2018 the results showed fig 5 that the contribution of exogenous source was greater than that of endogenous source in different periods and the contribution of exogenous source continued to increase which was probably related to land use conversion in the catchment the land use conversion has aggravated surface soil erosion the surface soil erosion promoted the transportation of well weathered and unconsolidated material into the river descroix et al 2008 lin et al 2021 which was consistent with the reduction of forest area in the catchment table 1 in the early period the endogenous and exogenous contributions were roughly balanced which could have indicated the high productivity of the river this can be supported by the low c n fig 2c because terrestrial plants have a higher c n than aquatic plants paul et al 2012 the contribution of grassland oc reached 33 6 fig 5 it could be seen from table 1 that grassland occupied a large area second only to forest land and cropland additionally we found that the toc content of grassland was quite high fig s3d which is correlated with its difficulty in mineralization liu et al 2020 therefore grassland can transport more oc for the river although the forest land covered a large area table 1 its contribution was only 5 9 this could be related to a layer of soil cover formed by forest vegetation which protected the soil from direct rainfall erosion li et al 2014 bravo linares et al 2018 the weakening of forest to surface runoff reduced oc transported to the river smith et al 2013 also in the early period the relatively small contribution of the construction land can be ascribed to the hardening treatment of the surface in 1894 1958 we observed that δ13c elevated markedly fig 2 this was probably caused by the expansion of agricultural activities because the strong interference of agricultural activities can bring higher δ13c value to river sediments arbuckle and downing 2001 das et al 2008 with the founding of the people s republic of china 1949 the state attached importance to agricultural development which promoted the expansion of agriculture in the catchment the high proportion of cropland area also supported this table 1 additionally this might also be due to the application of 13c enriched compost to the cropland or both before 1987 toc showed a downward trend fig 2a previous studies have shown that the longer the underlying oc was buried the easier it was to mineralize henrichs 1992 milliken 2003 kuznetsova et al 2019 therefore seoc was likely to be decomposed in the early period in the middle period the sharp increase of exogenous contribution might reflect the further intensification of anthropogenic activities on soil erosion fig 5 according to statistics in the 21st century water and soil loss was serious which had reached 22 of the total watershed area wang 2006 the aggravation of water and soil loss in the catchment had input more land oc into the river moreover compared with 1980 the area of construction land and garden plot expanded in 2010 table 1 which was probably the important reason for their increased contribution to seoc we observed that the δ15n value increased significantly from 1999 to 2006 fig 2e the previous study has shown that isotopes of heavy nitrate in human sewage δ15n 7 25 lead to higher δ15n value in sediment teranes and bernasconi 2000 during this period a large number of new factories were built in the catchment including heavy chemical enterprises studies have shown that the pollution index of the catchment has increased significantly since 1996 especially in the laodao estuary section located in the lxr liu et al 2018 meanwhile other rivers in northern china such as the yangtze river sediment unpolluted the δ15n value was only between 1 8 and 7 3 slightly lower than that of the lxr zhang et al 2007 however the δ15n of the lxr was similar to that of haicheng river a seriously polluted river in northern china δ15n 5 11 bu et al 2016 this indicated that the sediments of the lxr might also be contaminated therefore the increase of δ15n was likely to be caused by industrial sewage discharge in addition to differences in nitrogen sources metabolic processes such as microbial mineralization can cause significant nitrogen isotope fractionation the absorption assimilation and nitrification of microorganisms will preferentially use 14n which also increases the δ15n value in the sediment therefore the influence mechanism of the δ15n value was more complex and needs to be further explored also since the δ13c fractionation of sediments during transportation and deposition was usually small zhang et al 2007 it cannot be able to cover up the differences of δ13c between different land types in the later period the exogenous contribution of river seoc continued to increase fig 5 which probably reflected the further intensification of soil erosion or the reduction of the primary productivity of the river the sharply rising c n supported it fig 2c note that the contribution of grassland oc decreased significantly which could have been related to the decrease of grassland quantity this was supported by the substantial reduction of grassland area between 2010 and 2020 table 1 additionally studies have shown that a large number of grasslands were damaged due to improper grassland management in the catchment during this period which could have also reduced the grassland carbon input into the river wang 2006 meantime the contribution of forest land increased however compared with 2010 the area of forest land decreased by 3 in 2020 which might indicate that the forest has been damaged it has been shown that the increase in deforestation would lead to soil instability in the catchment and erosion of both the organic rich surface soils and the subsurface mineral horizon farella et al 2001 therefore the forest land soil erosion intensified which increased the transportation of oc from the forest land to the river moreover because cropland was more vulnerable to erosion kastowski et al 2011 mendonca et al 2017 yang et al 2021 the contribution of cropland oc was also increasing additionally the contribution of construction land and garden plot to carbon sources continued to increase on the one hand it might be due to the significant expansion of both areas in the catchment the construction land and garden area increased by 81 and 162 respectively on the other hand it could also be the result of a sharp decline in grassland carbon contribution middle period 37 2 later period 15 5 in general from 1894 to 2020 the contribution of exogenous oc continued to increase this was probably the result of further aggravating soil erosion caused by land use transformation in the catchment the change of land use area from the catchment also supported it and the forest coverage was decreasing table 1 4 2 2 other anthropogenic activities in addition to land use other anthropogenic activities also had a profound impact on the seoc input of the lxr the population is closely related to the land use of the catchment population expansion will increase the intensity of land use management and cause changes in the composition of land use such as the increase of construction land and the decrease of other land use which could have had an indirect impact on the input of seoc sources of the river also compared with natural aquatic ecosystems reservoirs are one of the most far reaching transformations of human beings on river hydrological conditions maavara et al 2020 wang et al 2021a to further explore the comprehensive impact of anthropogenic activities land area population and large reservoir construction on the seoc sources we used the pls pm for analysis the results showed that anthropogenic activities had a more significant impact on the seoc sources fig 6 in contrast hydrological conditions only had a weak impact on the seoc sources therefore anthropogenic activities were the key factor controlling the historical changes of the seoc sources in the lxr the impact of anthropogenic activities was more significant which was inseparable from the intensification of anthropogenic activities in the catchment many existing studies showed that anthropogenic activities had become the drivers of seoc sources qu et al 2018 lee et al 2019 yang et al 2021 which was consistent with our research results as one of the anthropogenic activities the impact of reservoir dam construction on river seoc has been widely concerned in the past decades global reservoir construction has increased significantly and will continue in the future grill et al 2015 mulligan et al 2020 wang et al 2022 the construction of the reservoir dam has greatly changed the hydrological environment of the river including runoff and sediment discharge affected erosion and sedimentation and altered the circulation mode of seoc in the river luo et al 2015 repasch 2021 the reservoir dam reduces the sediment and oc transported downstream by trapping the sediment in the reservoir yang et al 2022a the reservoir construction has increasingly become an important indicator reflecting the impact of anthropogenic activities on river seoc by 2022 more than 20 large reservoirs have been built in the mainstream and tributaries of xr the construction of these reservoirs was concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s and from the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century the rda results showed that the reservoirs had a significant impact on the grain composition of the sediment p 0 05 fig s4 studies have shown that without the upstream sediment supply the surface sediment in the lower reach of the river was significantly coarsened by river bed scouring yang et al 2022b this was similar to our results fig s2 furthermore the dam blocks the hydrological connectivity of the river with the increase of dam construction the effective catchment of lxr sediment was further reduced especially in the later period the variation of seoc sources in the lxr was more affected by soil erosion in the local catchment rather than the entire catchment as it was in the early period this might be a momentous reason for the small increase in the external contribution of seoc in the later period generally the seoc sources in the lxr could have been affected by multiple anthropogenic activities making its changes more complex additionally the specific mechanism of the impact of the catchment reservoir dam on the seoc downstream of the river needs to be further explored 5 conclusion we investigated the dynamics of the seoc sources and their key drivers in the lxr on a centennial scale the results indicated that the dynamic change of the seoc sources could be divided into three periods early middle and late over time the external contribution of seoc continued to rise which was mainly the result of the comprehensive effect of different anthropogenic activities the transformation of land use intensified soil erosion and led to a sharp increase in external oc contribution especially in the middle period at the same time the transformation of land use by humans has caused relatively less grassland carbon to flow into the river bringing more garden and construction land carbon it was mainly bound up with the destruction and reduction of grassland and the increase of other land types by comparison reservoir construction intercepted the upstream sediments and reduced the effective catchment of lxr sediments which might be the reason for the small increase of external input of seoc in the later period in short anthropogenic activities especially land use and reservoir construction were the key factors driving the dynamic evolution of the seoc sources in the lower reach of the inland river this study provided a reference for the seoc sources dynamics of large inland rivers in the world and the management of basin carbon however the specific impact mechanism of reservoir construction on river seoc

14993,sediment organic carbon seoc sources with rich information can be used as a historical archive reflecting anthropogenic activities in the catchment which is crucial to carbon management in the watershed anthropogenic activities and hydrodynamic conditions significantly influence the river environment and are reflected by the seoc sources however the key drivers of the seoc source dynamics are ambiguous which restricts the behavior of regulating the carbon output of the basin in this study sediment cores from the lower reach of an inland river were selected to quantify the seoc sources based on a centennial scale a partial least squares path model was used to establish the relationship between anthropogenic activities and hydrological conditions with the seoc sources findings showed that the exogenous advantage of seoc composition was gradually significant early period 54 3 middle period 81 later period 82 from the bottom layer to the surface layer of the sediments in the lower reach of the xiangjiang river factors related to anthropogenic activities controlled the external input of seoc δ13c r 0 94 p 0 001 δ15n r 0 66 p 0 001 different anthropogenic activities performed different effects land use change aggravated soil erosion and brought more terrestrial organic carbon to the downstream the variation of grassland carbon input was the most obvious from 33 6 to 18 4 in contrast the reservoir construction intercepted upstream sediments which might have been the main reason for the slow growth of terrestrial organic carbon input in the downstream in the later period this study provides a specific grafting for the seoc records source changes anthropogenic activities in the lower reach of the river which provides scientific basis for watershed carbon management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords river sediment organic carbon sources centennial scale bayesian mixing model anthropogenic activities data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction rivers are the main pathways to export seoc from the land to the oceans playing a key role in the global carbon cycle johannessen et al 2003 zhao et al 2017 in recent decades anthropogenic activities such as land use change and reservoir construction and hydrologic conditions are changing the river environment at an unprecedented speed which has a far reaching impact on the seoc sources the seoc sources of rivers are mainly divided into exogenous inputs different land use vegetation litter sewage etc and endogenous sources aquatic plants phytoplankton algae etc of river autogenesis the downstream of the river is the location connecting the upstream and the outlet and its seoc source dynamics have attracted more attention the seoc sources in the lower reach of rivers are not only affected by the surrounding anthropogenic activities and hydrological conditions but also may be disturbed by the reservoirs in the upper reach making the sources more uncertain therefore it is necessary to analyze the seoc sources in the lower reach of rivers in detail and determine the key drivers of seoc source dynamics the transport of organic carbon oc from source to sink is affected by many factors including long term variations in terrestrial oc delivery to river ecosystems affected by land use changes yang et al 2021 additionally the completed reservoirs upstream of the river will affect the seoc sources in the lower reach of the river by intercepting sediment creating a stagnant environment and changing the hydrological conditions early studies found that in typical overflow lakes the contribution of soil oc brought by anthropogenic activities such as industrial sewage discharge and fish pond feed input was the largest liu et al 2021 moreover studies have clarified that distributions and sources of seoc were different in season and space with affecting by anthropogenic activities such as the input of man made pollutants and land use change lee et al 2019 although previous studies have analyzed the impact of certain specific factors on seoc sources the identification of key drivers of seoc source dynamics is indistinct mayer and johnson 1994 qu et al 2018 lee et al 2019 especially the comparative study of multiple factors such as anthropogenic activities and hydrological conditions in addition most studies only focus on the exploration of seoc on the surface while the study of deep seoc especially the deep seoc source in the lower reach of the river is insufficient du and walling 2017 yu et al 2018 lin et al 2022 consequently in further tracing the seoc sources attention should be paid to the interannual variation and the key drivers identifying apportioning and tracking the seoc sources in aquatic systems require robust reliable and effective source tracking tools stable isotopes δ13c and δ15n have source specificity and good conservation so they are used as effective tools for carbon source apportionment derrien et al 2018 li et al 2022 studies have proved that δ13c was identified to be the most reliable tracer for tracking oc sources under early diagenetic processes derrien et al 2020 additionally other studies have shown that stable isotopes have great potential for tracing oc sources through indoor end member mixing experiments and outdoor validation experiments li et al 2022 in the calculation method although the traditional iso source model is an momentous means to quantify the seoc sources the model does not consider the uncertainty of the source therefore a new generation of the bayesian mixing model has emerged which has improved the ability to quantify the source of substances in aquatic systems and has been widely used in different isotope systems stock and semmens 2016 stock et al 2018 torres martinez et al 2020 liu and han 2021 bayesian mixing models are divided into three types mixsir siar and mixsiar respectively the mixsiar model combines the advantages of mixsir and siar adds fixed and random effects and integrates source uncertainty stock et al 2018 these functions enable the mixsiar model to have higher accuracy in source apportionment combined with current research progress we aimed to solve the problem of what were the key drivers of the seoc source dynamics in the lower reach of an inland river we assumed that anthropogenic activities were the key factors driving the seoc source dynamics in the lower reach of the inland river to solve the problem we used the mixsiar model and partial least squares path model pls pm method to quantify the seoc sources and identify key drivers the objectives were to 1 depict the temporal variation characteristics of sediment proxies and seoc sources on the vertical profile of the lower reach of the xiangjiang river lxr 2 determine the impact of anthropogenic activities on the seoc sources 3 explore the relationship between land use change and reservoir construction with the seoc sources current research findings help clarify the profound impact of anthropogenic activities on the seoc dynamics in inland rivers and provide reference for the carbon management in the watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area xiangjiang river xr the largest river in hunan province and an inland river in china originates from guangxi and flows into dongting lake its main stream is 856 km in hunan province with a drainage area of 85 383 km2 accounting for 40 of the total area of hunan province fig 1 xr is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the landform is dominated by low mountains and hills accounting for 65 of the total drainage area the climate of the basin belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate the hydrologic condition can be divided into the distinct wet season and the dry season the average annual temperature is between 17 and 18 and the annual precipitation ranges from 1300 to 1500 mm dong et al 1992 as shown in fig s1 the main land use types in this region are forest land and cropland the main crop on the cropland is rice and the garden plot is mainly planted with fruit trees citrus chestnut pear and tea trees high intensity land use and reservoir construction as well as dense population and high urbanization make the impact of surrounding anthropogenic activities on the river increasingly significant 2 2 sampling and laboratory analyses we selected a site 112 48 56 13 e 28 37 18 45 n with good sedimentation on the floodplain of the mainstream of lxr in 2020 december subsequently we used a gravity corer rhinoceros s1 usa to collect four cores 0 200 cm at this site the cores were divided into 5 cm depth intervals for each depth interval the sediment from each of the four cores was combined to produce a composite sample for each depth interval the classification of land use types was based on the land use cover classification system of the chinese academy of sciences according to the distribution of typical land types in the catchment fig s1 we collected typical forest land 8 cinnamomum camphora castanopsis sclerophylla cyclobalanopsis glauca pinus massoniana etc cropland 8 rice garden plot 5 orchards and tea gardens grassland 4 and construction land 2 residential land industrial and mining land etc fig 1 each soil sample 0 20 cm is composed of three duplicate samples near the sampling site sampling details refer to supporting information additionally we found the reed gramineae phragmites genus and phragmites species all over the river bank and its scale made it the main endogenous source therefore we collected fresh reed leaves as endogenous representatives of the river the collected samples were stored in clean sealed bags and brought back to the laboratory quickly all samples were completely dried under ventilation for subsequent analysis all dry samples were sieved on a 0 15 mm metal sieve and then used to determine particle size total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio c n δ13c and δ15n particle size analysis was determined using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device malvern instruments ltd uk according to the particle size the samples were screened at 5 mm and divided into clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm and sand 0 02 mm the milled and sieved sediment samples were acidified with 5 hcl for 3 h to remove inorganic carbon and then washed with ultra pure water until the filtrate was neutral finally the samples were freeze dried until analysis sediment samples for toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n were measured using an elemental analyzer vario macro cube elementar hanau germany and stable isotope mass spectrometer ea irms flash2000ht thermo fisher scientific ma usa all isotopic compositions were expressed in delta notation as follows δ 13 c o r 1 sample r 1 standard r 1 standard 1000 r 1 13 c 12 c δ 15 n o r 2 sample r 2 standard r 2 standard 1000 r 2 15 n 14 n where rsample and rstandard are the composition 13c 12c or 15n 14n of the sample and reference 13c 12c and 15n 14n correspond to the international standard vienna peedee belemnite vpdb and the atmospheric n2 respectively the analytical precision was approximately 0 05 and 0 1 for δ13c and δ15n respectively 2 3 210pb dating the radionuclide 210pb with a half life of 22 3 years in the sediment is a good nuclide for measuring the sedimentation rate on a century scale ran et al 2021 in recent years it has been widely used in the dating of long timescale continuous sediments in water zhang et al 2020 the deposition rate was calculated by the constant rate of supply crs model as follows t in a n a j λ where t is the deposition time a of each deposition layer an is the accumulation amount of 210pbex below the surface layer bq kg 1 aj is the accumulation amount below the j layer and λ is the decay constant of 210pbex namely 0 03118a 1 2 4 mixsiar model the δ13c and δ15n were used as tracers in the mixsiar model for seoc source apportionment based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling algorithm the output of the mixsiar model is a probability distribution rather than a specific value expressed as mean standard deviation sd meng et al 2021 the model parameters were set as follows the source data entered was raw mcmc running time was set to long the error structure was set as residual only and specify prior was set as uninformative gelman rubin and geweke diagnostics were used to determine whether the model converged if the model does not converge the mcmc operation time long very long is increased and the model output result is expressed by the average value zhou et al 2021 2 5 pls pm pls pm was used to analyze the influencing factors of seoc sources which was realized in the package plspm in r 3 6 2 r core team 2019 it consists of a measurement model and a structural model the measurement model is used to describe the relationship between manifest variables and implicit variables while the structural model is used to describe the relationship between implicit variables one of the advantages of pls pm is that for each implicit variable an iterative algorithm is used to estimate the loading value of the implicit and manifest variables which can maximize the explanatory variance of implicit variables li et al 2020 to explore the influencing factors of the seoc sources we selected seven indicators as implicit variables anthropogenic activities hydrological conditions toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n we selected four indicators population gross domestic product gdp land area and some large reservoirs in the xr as the manifest variables of anthropogenic activities at the same time we selected annual runoff and sediment discharge as the manifest variables of hydrological conditions it was worth noting that we eliminated the indicator gdp with a loading value lower than 0 4 because this would improve the fitting effect of the manifest variable to the implicit variable 2 6 data sources anthropogenic activities data for 1951 2020 were obtained from the statistical yearbook of hunan province http tjj hunan gov cn mean annual runoff and sediment discharge for 1951 2020 were derived from the china river sediment bulletin http www mwr gov cn we have normalized the data obtained above more details about data sources and processing were shown in the supporting information 2 7 statistical analysis and graphing all data in this study were evaluated by the kolmogorov smirnov test for normality and no data conversion was required to satisfy the normal distribution we used excel 2016 and ibm spss26 statistical software to process and analyze the data pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationships between multiple sediment proxies in the lxr core the sampling points and land use maps were drawn by arcgis 10 5 esri los angeles usa redundancy analysis rda was conducted to determine the relationship between reservoir construction and seoc sources using canoco 5 the origin 2021 software was used for drawing 3 results 3 1 historical sedimentary records the average specific activity of 210pb was 15 85 it was measured that the average sedimentation rate of the lxr sediment was 2 01 cm yr and the sediment column of the lxr 0 200 cm represented the sediment from 1894 to 2020 the specific results of the dating have been shown in table s1 3 2 distribution characteristics of multiple sediment proxies 3 2 1 particle composition in the lxr core the particle composition was mainly composed of silt and sand containing a small amount of clay and no gravel fig s2 the clay content ranged from 9 73 to 13 90 with an average of 12 04 the variation range of silt component content was 39 96 62 82 and the average value was 56 41 the sand content ranged from 23 32 to 50 30 with an average of 31 55 table s2 since 1894 the content of clay and silt has decreased fig s2a and b while the content of sand has increased fig s2c in particular after 2013 the content of clay and silt decreased sharply and the sand increased rapidly 3 2 2 toc tn and c n as shown in fig 2a toc content varied from 0 3 to 1 36 toc as a whole showed a steady increasing trend which increased sharply in 1988 and then decreased it increased year by year before 1988 but there was no significant change form 1988 to 2013 after 2013 it showed a sharp increase trend tn content ranged from 0 06 to 0 13 fig 2b compared with toc the overall change of tn was stable but the changing trend was generally the same and both of them fluctuated greatly in 1988 the c n was between 4 5 and 10 96 fig 2c and the changing trend was also obvious to sum up the changes in toc tn and c n were relatively consistent according to such characteristics we can roughly divide the sediment into three periods the early period 1894 1987 the middle period 1988 2012 and the late period 2013 2020 3 2 3 δ13c and δ15n the time series of δ13c and δ15n were shown in fig 2c and d ranging from 24 28 to 19 99 and 4 16 9 29 respectively additionally they had a wide range and their change trend was different from toc tn and c n δ13c showed an upward trend before 1985 and then had a stable downward trend in 1999 2002 although δ13c increased slightly the range was very small by comparison the δ15n value altered in a more complex way before 1999 it remained stable with a small range of change and rose sharply from 1999 to 2006 then from 2006 to 2008 it remained stable 3 3 physical and chemical properties of sediments in different land uses as shown in fig s3 with different land uses the δ13c and δ15n of soils were different but there were also overlapping ranges toc tn δ13c and δ15n of grassland were significantly higher than that of other soils additionally toc tn and c n contents in the garden plot and cropland were also high in contrast the contents of toc tn and c n in forest land were low and δ13c and δ15n ranged from 27 58 to 19 82 0 80 9 29 respectively table s3 similarly for construction land δ13c and δ15n were also relatively low fig 3 showed that the source samples can well constrain the seoc sources because the isotope ratios of all sediment samples remain within the limits of each source 3 4 correlation analysis between multiple sediment proxies as shown in fig 4 toc and tn were an extremely significant positive correlation r 0 717 p 0 01 δ15n exhibited highly significant negative correlations with tn and c n p 0 01 nevertheless toc appeared insignificant correlations with c n and δ13c 3 5 quantification of seoc sources under different land use types the contribution of grassland to carbon sources first increased and then decreased and that of other types increased over time fig 5 table s4 although the proportion of grassland was decreasing it accounted for a large proportion of the early and medium period carbon source which were 33 6 and 37 2 construction land accounted for the smallest proportion of carbon source contribution in different periods additionally the endogenous contribution reed has been decreasing and the fastest decline from the early to the medium period overall from the early to late period the proportion of exogenous input of seoc has been increasing while the endogenous contribution has been decreasing in the lxr 3 6 analysis of influencing factors of seoc source the overall fitting effect gof of pls pm reached 0 7 anthropogenic activities and seoc source indicators toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n had a strong correlation e g δ13c r 0 94 p 0 001 δ15n r 0 66 p 0 001 fig 6 in contrast hydrological conditions were only significantly correlated with c n r 0 22 p 0 05 but not with other seoc source indicators p 0 05 3 7 relationship between large reservoirs and seoc source indicators as shown in fig s4 the first two axes of the rda explained a high proportion of variance i e 55 3 and 4 77 for axes 1 and 2 respectively this showed that 60 07 of the variation of seoc source indicators could be explained by the selected large reservoir related variables 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrological conditions on seoc source the grain size is the most commonly used method to study the physical properties of river sediments grain size is affected by many factors such as watershed hydrologic conditions sediment sources and environmental characteristics martinez garcia et al 2015 caballero et al 2019 generally the sand content of sediment is an indicator of hydrological changes with higher contents reflecting more pronounced changes li et al 2009 ran et al 2021 in the lxr the sand increased with the decrease in depth while clay and silt were opposite fig s2 this is a clear indication that the hydrodynamic force was strengthened compared with that before the transport of sand induced by soil erosion and hydrodynamics brings more terrestrial oc to the river which promoted seoc input this was proved by the increase in the contribution of terrestrial oc to the seoc sources of the river in the later period fig 5 studies have shown that hydrologic conditions affected the particle size of sediments drove the gradient distribution of seoc sources and made a certain contribution to the seoc sources xu et al 2021 runoff and sediment discharge were effective indicators of the river s hydrological environment runoff and sediment discharge significantly control oc migration transformation and distribution tesi et al 2013 ye et al 2017 wang et al 2021b based on the annual runoff and sediment discharge data of hydrometric stations in the lxr from 1951 to 2020 we explored the effects of hydrologic conditions on seoc source indicators i e toc tn c n δ13c and δ15n the pls pm results showed that the hydrologic conditions only had a significant impact on the c n r 0 22 p 0 05 fig 6 and did not show the significance for other seoc indicators the c n is an effective tracer for tracking the seoc sources this effect was likely to be caused by hydrodynamic processes by changing the migration deposition and resuspension of sediments xu et al 2021 these results confirmed that hydrological conditions have very limited influence on seoc sources in the lxr other factors such as anthropogenic activities in the catchment land use change reservoir construction etc could have altered the seoc input 4 2 impact of anthropogenic activities on the seoc sources 4 2 1 land use previous studies suggested that the variability in seoc sources in the river was affected by a combination of terrestrial input and river productivity both of which could be strongly controlled by anthropogenic activities such as land transformation wastewater discharge and agricultural production kastowski et al 2011 anderson et al 2013 chmiel et al 2015 mendonca et al 2017 haas et al 2019 yang et al 2021 toc and tn were markedly positively correlated fig 4 indicating that they had good homology or were regulated by the same biogeochemical process qu et al 2018 the results showed fig 5 that the contribution of exogenous source was greater than that of endogenous source in different periods and the contribution of exogenous source continued to increase which was probably related to land use conversion in the catchment the land use conversion has aggravated surface soil erosion the surface soil erosion promoted the transportation of well weathered and unconsolidated material into the river descroix et al 2008 lin et al 2021 which was consistent with the reduction of forest area in the catchment table 1 in the early period the endogenous and exogenous contributions were roughly balanced which could have indicated the high productivity of the river this can be supported by the low c n fig 2c because terrestrial plants have a higher c n than aquatic plants paul et al 2012 the contribution of grassland oc reached 33 6 fig 5 it could be seen from table 1 that grassland occupied a large area second only to forest land and cropland additionally we found that the toc content of grassland was quite high fig s3d which is correlated with its difficulty in mineralization liu et al 2020 therefore grassland can transport more oc for the river although the forest land covered a large area table 1 its contribution was only 5 9 this could be related to a layer of soil cover formed by forest vegetation which protected the soil from direct rainfall erosion li et al 2014 bravo linares et al 2018 the weakening of forest to surface runoff reduced oc transported to the river smith et al 2013 also in the early period the relatively small contribution of the construction land can be ascribed to the hardening treatment of the surface in 1894 1958 we observed that δ13c elevated markedly fig 2 this was probably caused by the expansion of agricultural activities because the strong interference of agricultural activities can bring higher δ13c value to river sediments arbuckle and downing 2001 das et al 2008 with the founding of the people s republic of china 1949 the state attached importance to agricultural development which promoted the expansion of agriculture in the catchment the high proportion of cropland area also supported this table 1 additionally this might also be due to the application of 13c enriched compost to the cropland or both before 1987 toc showed a downward trend fig 2a previous studies have shown that the longer the underlying oc was buried the easier it was to mineralize henrichs 1992 milliken 2003 kuznetsova et al 2019 therefore seoc was likely to be decomposed in the early period in the middle period the sharp increase of exogenous contribution might reflect the further intensification of anthropogenic activities on soil erosion fig 5 according to statistics in the 21st century water and soil loss was serious which had reached 22 of the total watershed area wang 2006 the aggravation of water and soil loss in the catchment had input more land oc into the river moreover compared with 1980 the area of construction land and garden plot expanded in 2010 table 1 which was probably the important reason for their increased contribution to seoc we observed that the δ15n value increased significantly from 1999 to 2006 fig 2e the previous study has shown that isotopes of heavy nitrate in human sewage δ15n 7 25 lead to higher δ15n value in sediment teranes and bernasconi 2000 during this period a large number of new factories were built in the catchment including heavy chemical enterprises studies have shown that the pollution index of the catchment has increased significantly since 1996 especially in the laodao estuary section located in the lxr liu et al 2018 meanwhile other rivers in northern china such as the yangtze river sediment unpolluted the δ15n value was only between 1 8 and 7 3 slightly lower than that of the lxr zhang et al 2007 however the δ15n of the lxr was similar to that of haicheng river a seriously polluted river in northern china δ15n 5 11 bu et al 2016 this indicated that the sediments of the lxr might also be contaminated therefore the increase of δ15n was likely to be caused by industrial sewage discharge in addition to differences in nitrogen sources metabolic processes such as microbial mineralization can cause significant nitrogen isotope fractionation the absorption assimilation and nitrification of microorganisms will preferentially use 14n which also increases the δ15n value in the sediment therefore the influence mechanism of the δ15n value was more complex and needs to be further explored also since the δ13c fractionation of sediments during transportation and deposition was usually small zhang et al 2007 it cannot be able to cover up the differences of δ13c between different land types in the later period the exogenous contribution of river seoc continued to increase fig 5 which probably reflected the further intensification of soil erosion or the reduction of the primary productivity of the river the sharply rising c n supported it fig 2c note that the contribution of grassland oc decreased significantly which could have been related to the decrease of grassland quantity this was supported by the substantial reduction of grassland area between 2010 and 2020 table 1 additionally studies have shown that a large number of grasslands were damaged due to improper grassland management in the catchment during this period which could have also reduced the grassland carbon input into the river wang 2006 meantime the contribution of forest land increased however compared with 2010 the area of forest land decreased by 3 in 2020 which might indicate that the forest has been damaged it has been shown that the increase in deforestation would lead to soil instability in the catchment and erosion of both the organic rich surface soils and the subsurface mineral horizon farella et al 2001 therefore the forest land soil erosion intensified which increased the transportation of oc from the forest land to the river moreover because cropland was more vulnerable to erosion kastowski et al 2011 mendonca et al 2017 yang et al 2021 the contribution of cropland oc was also increasing additionally the contribution of construction land and garden plot to carbon sources continued to increase on the one hand it might be due to the significant expansion of both areas in the catchment the construction land and garden area increased by 81 and 162 respectively on the other hand it could also be the result of a sharp decline in grassland carbon contribution middle period 37 2 later period 15 5 in general from 1894 to 2020 the contribution of exogenous oc continued to increase this was probably the result of further aggravating soil erosion caused by land use transformation in the catchment the change of land use area from the catchment also supported it and the forest coverage was decreasing table 1 4 2 2 other anthropogenic activities in addition to land use other anthropogenic activities also had a profound impact on the seoc input of the lxr the population is closely related to the land use of the catchment population expansion will increase the intensity of land use management and cause changes in the composition of land use such as the increase of construction land and the decrease of other land use which could have had an indirect impact on the input of seoc sources of the river also compared with natural aquatic ecosystems reservoirs are one of the most far reaching transformations of human beings on river hydrological conditions maavara et al 2020 wang et al 2021a to further explore the comprehensive impact of anthropogenic activities land area population and large reservoir construction on the seoc sources we used the pls pm for analysis the results showed that anthropogenic activities had a more significant impact on the seoc sources fig 6 in contrast hydrological conditions only had a weak impact on the seoc sources therefore anthropogenic activities were the key factor controlling the historical changes of the seoc sources in the lxr the impact of anthropogenic activities was more significant which was inseparable from the intensification of anthropogenic activities in the catchment many existing studies showed that anthropogenic activities had become the drivers of seoc sources qu et al 2018 lee et al 2019 yang et al 2021 which was consistent with our research results as one of the anthropogenic activities the impact of reservoir dam construction on river seoc has been widely concerned in the past decades global reservoir construction has increased significantly and will continue in the future grill et al 2015 mulligan et al 2020 wang et al 2022 the construction of the reservoir dam has greatly changed the hydrological environment of the river including runoff and sediment discharge affected erosion and sedimentation and altered the circulation mode of seoc in the river luo et al 2015 repasch 2021 the reservoir dam reduces the sediment and oc transported downstream by trapping the sediment in the reservoir yang et al 2022a the reservoir construction has increasingly become an important indicator reflecting the impact of anthropogenic activities on river seoc by 2022 more than 20 large reservoirs have been built in the mainstream and tributaries of xr the construction of these reservoirs was concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s and from the end of the 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century the rda results showed that the reservoirs had a significant impact on the grain composition of the sediment p 0 05 fig s4 studies have shown that without the upstream sediment supply the surface sediment in the lower reach of the river was significantly coarsened by river bed scouring yang et al 2022b this was similar to our results fig s2 furthermore the dam blocks the hydrological connectivity of the river with the increase of dam construction the effective catchment of lxr sediment was further reduced especially in the later period the variation of seoc sources in the lxr was more affected by soil erosion in the local catchment rather than the entire catchment as it was in the early period this might be a momentous reason for the small increase in the external contribution of seoc in the later period generally the seoc sources in the lxr could have been affected by multiple anthropogenic activities making its changes more complex additionally the specific mechanism of the impact of the catchment reservoir dam on the seoc downstream of the river needs to be further explored 5 conclusion we investigated the dynamics of the seoc sources and their key drivers in the lxr on a centennial scale the results indicated that the dynamic change of the seoc sources could be divided into three periods early middle and late over time the external contribution of seoc continued to rise which was mainly the result of the comprehensive effect of different anthropogenic activities the transformation of land use intensified soil erosion and led to a sharp increase in external oc contribution especially in the middle period at the same time the transformation of land use by humans has caused relatively less grassland carbon to flow into the river bringing more garden and construction land carbon it was mainly bound up with the destruction and reduction of grassland and the increase of other land types by comparison reservoir construction intercepted the upstream sediments and reduced the effective catchment of lxr sediments which might be the reason for the small increase of external input of seoc in the later period in short anthropogenic activities especially land use and reservoir construction were the key factors driving the dynamic evolution of the seoc sources in the lower reach of the inland river this study provided a reference for the seoc sources dynamics of large inland rivers in the world and the management of basin carbon however the specific impact mechanism of reservoir construction on river seoc

14994,organic matter om recovery from sewage sludge is critical for sustainable development extracellular organic substances eos are the main organic components of sludge and the release of eos from sludge is usually the rate limiting step for om recovery however a poor understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of binding strength bs of eos usually restricts the release of om from sludge to reveal the underlying mechanism that how the intrinsic characteristics of eos limit its release in this study the bs of eos in sludge was quantitatively characterised by 10 rounds of energy input ein with the same magnitude per round the corresponding changes in the main components floc structures and rheological properties of sludge after different numbers of ein were also explored results showed that relationships between the release of eos and the main multivalent metals median diameters fractal dimensions elastic modulus and viscous modulus in the linear viscoelastic region of sludge versus the number of ein highlighted that the power law distribution of bs in eos was responsible for the occurrence state of organic molecules stability of floc structures and maintenance of rheological properties the result of hierarchical cluster analysis hca further revealed three bs levels of the eos in sludge indicating that the release or recovery of om from sludge occurred in three stages to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that explores the release profiles of eos in sludge by repeated ein for assessing the bs our findings may provide an important theoretical basis for the development target methods about the release and recovery of om from sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resource recovery cation exchange resin waste activated sludge extracellular polymeric substances binding strength data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage sludge is a by product of biological wastewater treatment and is generated in large quantities annually it is an inorganic organic mixture comprising both solid and liquid phases and contains microorganisms biopolymers inorganic particles multivalent metals and a high content of water agglomerated in a three dimensional network xu et al 2020a sludge contains economically useful organic matter om the recovery of which is conducive to carbon neutralisation in wastewater treatment plants raheem et al 2018 xu et al 2021 release is a prerequisite for om recovery however the relative high cost benefit ratio of om release from sludge through physical chemical and biological approaches and a poor understanding of the corresponding characteristics of om in nature usually limits the recovery of om from sludge extracellular organic substances eos are the largest contributors to the organic fraction of sludge and account for 69 of the volatile solids vs in sludge gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2018b hence eos could be the main target for om recovery from sludge the main organic molecules e g proteins and polysaccharides present in eos have ample functional groups which can bind other organic molecules and some inorganic substances from wastewater through complicated binding interactions including covalent and noncovalent interactions flemming and wingender 2010 for example the negatively charged functional groups of organic molecules can bind multivalent metals ca and mg by bridging effects and electrostatic interactions and restricted organic molecular depolymerisation xu et al 2017 moreover micron sized silica particles bind organic molecules especially proteins in sludge by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds to form bioinorganic flocs and weaken the solubilisation ability of om dai et al 2017 besides the complex binding interactions existing in various components of sludge the binding strength bs of the interactions in eos seemed to be non uniform generally the extracellular polymeric substances eps are the main constituents of eos and play a key role in linking cells to form different structures hierarchies from microcolonies to flocs although eps from sludge in water and wastewater management systems have been intensively studied for decades the existing knowledge focusing on their bs diversity was mostly based on method defined eps fractions usually the outer to inner stratification structures of eps are categorised as soluble eps sb eps and bound eps wingender et al 1999 based on the extraction methodology some researchers further differentiate bound eps into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps li and yang 2007 yu et al 2008 specifically lb eps is the eps layer that can be eliminated using a mild method e g heating at a low temperature or low speed centrifugation whereas tb eps can be extracted using a harsh method e g heating at a higher temperature or high intensity centrifugation with pre ultrasonication with the cognition of stratification structure based on the operational definition the effects of different eps fractions on om release were extensively explored in physical chemical and biological treatments lu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the stratification fractionised method also indicates that eps have different bss however limited information is available on the intrinsic characteristics of the bs of eps or eos therefore to further identify the intrinsic characteristics it was hypothesised that there could be different energy levels of bs in eos which determines the release profile of eos a better understanding of the bs of eos from sludge will help devise improved strategies for resource recovery this study aimed to reveal the underlying mechanism how the intrinsic characteristics of eos limit its release by determining the bs of eos from sludge in this paper the bs of eos was used to quantitatively characterise the intensity of binding interactions of eos and investigate the release profile of eos with numbers of energy input ein the ein was defined by the cation exchange resin cer method for calculating the bs values and the corresponding effects on cell lysis were also explored the ein induced release profile of eos in terms of changes on concentrations spatial distribution and morphology of the main composition were studied and the corresponding changes in floc structures i e median diameter fractal dimension and granulometric distribution and rheological properties i e flow behaviour and viscoelasticity were also analysed finally the correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis hca of the featural indexes related to eos release were conducted for pattern recognition of bs in eos during 10 rounds of ein to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that explores the occurrence states and release profiles of eos by assessing the interplay of organics in sludge the findings in this study will provide more information on the bs of eos which is expected to provide reference for regulating the release and recovery of om from sludge for example niche targeted methods for destructing bs of eos can be developed with different levels of energy inputs based on the energy levels of bs in eos which is beneficial for improving om release efficiency and making full use of energy inputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the sludge the sludge used in this study was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china that operates an anaerobic anoxic aerobic process the collected sludge was sieved through an 80 mesh sieve to eliminate large impurities and its supernatant was removed after a 24 h gravity sedimentation process the main characteristics of the sludge can be found in table s1 supplementary materials sm 2 2 basic assumptions and definitions of the bs value of eos based on previous studies liao et al 2002 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018b the following basic assumptions were proposed 1 eos are the main targets of om in sludge for organic resource recovery and the bs of which determines release profiles of eos 2 one round of cer extraction equals one unit of ein for eos release owing to the high efficiency of om release and low rate of cell lysis the cer extraction method has been adopted as the most widely accepted eps extraction method sheng et al 2010 another advantage of the cer method is that resins can be removed by sieving which means that contamination by residual chemical reagents can be avoided compared with heat alkaline and ultrasonication methods the cer method can avoid disadvantages such as cell lysis chemical reagent residue and the oxidation of om however no method can extract all of the eos from sludge and repeated extractions help obtain a higher extraction yield ras et al 2008 therefore the cer method was used to provide a fixed energy input to induce the release of eos from sludge repeatedly 1 b s 1 c i s t o c r e l e a s e d c s t o c e q u i l i b r i u m 100 where c i s t o c r e l e a s e d is the concentration of soluble toc released after i i 0 1 10 rounds of ein and c s t o c e q u i l i b r i u m is the soluble toc concentration released when equilibrium was reached in the first round of ein in this paper the bs value of eos was defined as the difference between one and the proportion of soluble total organic carbon toc released relative to the equilibrium soluble toc concentration that was released under one unit of ein and bs was calculated using eq 1 theoretically under multiple rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round repeatedly 1 if the binding interactions between eos are homogeneous the content of eos released and the bs value of eos should be a constant however 2 if the interactions are heterogeneous the content of eos released and the bs value of eos should be variable with numbers of ein additionally a lower eos content released under per ein means a higher value of bs indicating a higher energy level of eos binding interactions 2 3 protocol for eos release with numbers of ein based on the cer extraction method compared with the well established and frequently used cer method for eps extraction frølund et al 1996 low dose and short time parameters 15 g cer g vs 2 h were adopted in this study to reduce the release rates of eos aimed for depicting the evolution of components and structures of sludge at a high resolution a hydrogen type strong acid cer 001 7 zhengguang industrial co ltd was used to extract eos from sludge and the main characteristics of the cer were listed in table s2 sm the cer was prepared through washing activating and type transformation according to the protocol described by geng et al 2022 the prepared cer 15 g cer g vs was mixed and stirred at 300 rpm with sludge for 2 h and one round of cer extraction above was defined as one unit of energy input ein next the cer was separated from the sludge by vacuum filtration with a stainless steel screen φ 20 cm 4 5 cm 50 mesh deionised water was added to wash the sludge that adhered to the surface of the cer and then adjusted the mass of the sludge to the initial value for quantitative analysis after the separation of the cer the sludge was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane for soluble indexes analysis next the residue was resuspended in deionised water to its original mass and subjected to the next round of extraction the release of eos by cer has been conducted for 10 times which meant that ein has been input for 10 times the sample id of each sludge sample was denoted by the number of ein rounds it underwent the equilibrium soluble toc concentration was measured by adding 15 g cer g vs to sludge and stirring at 300 rpm until the concentration of soluble toc fluctuated within 10 2 4 dead live ratios the dead live ratio of the sludge samples was measured using flow cytometry bd facscalibur usa with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits invitrogen molecular probes l 7012 usa containing syto 9 green fluorescent and propidium iodide pi red fluorescent for nucleic acid the syto 9 stain generally labels bacteria with intact and damaged membranes whereas pi penetrates only bacteria with damaged membranes and reduces the syto 9 stain fluorescence when both dyes are used after the sludge samples 1 ml were diluted to 10 ml with sterile normal saline the diluted samples were dispersed by ultrasonication 100 w 30 s after dispersion the samples were gradient diluted 10 thrice with sterile normal saline the diluted samples were filtered through the 40 μm cell strainer to remove large particles to prevent clogging the flow cytometry the staining was performed as per the manufacturer s instructions and the emission excitation wavelengths for syto 9 and pi were set at 525 nm 617 nm and 617 nm 536 nm respectively 2 5 visualisation of key components in eos by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm the occurrence of proteins in sludge was visualised using clsm leica sp8 germany the sypro orange protein gel stain sigma st louis usa reagent was diluted 1 5000 in 7 5 v v acetic acid then 1 ml of the diluted staining solution was mixed with 1 ml sludge to label the protein the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h away from light before observation then 0 1 ml of the stained mixtures were transferred onto 35 mm glass bottom confocal dishes bottom diameter 20 mm thickness 0 17 mm nest biotechnology for observation the excitation wavelength was set at 488 nm and the range of emission wavelength was set at 505 580 nm to enhance image contrast the mode of differential interferential contrast dic observation was used rather than the conventional bright field mode z stack was performed at a constant step size of 1 μm vertically to capture sectioned images and rebuild 3d structures of samples using the las x viewer software leica germany in order to elucidate the spatial distribution of proteins and polysaccharides multiple staining scheme with fitc beijing solarbio science technology co ltd con a af555 and calcofluor white sigma st louis usa was used and details can be seen in the text s1 sm 2 6 characterisation and analysis of the floc structures the granulometric distributions of the sludge extracted through different rounds were measured using dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern uk light intensity i and wave vector q were used to calculate the fractal dimensions which is the slope of log i versus log q as obtained by linear fitting zhang et al 2018 the volume frequency and logarithm of the sample particle size were deconvoluted by the gaussian model with second derivative to decipher hidden peaks and identify dominant particle size clusters using origin pro 2021 origin lab usa according to the results of peak identification the sample particle sizes were divided into four ranges 5 μm 5 50 μm 50 150 μm and 150 μm then the integration of volume weighted particle size distribution curves within these four ranges were normalised to present changes in granulometric distributions by percentages 2 7 rheological characterisation a rotational rheometer kinexus lab malvern uk was used for the rheological measurements of sludge at 25 the measuring system was equipped with a concentric cylinder geometry and the diameters of the cup the outer cylinder and bob the inner cylinder were 27 5 mm and 25 mm respectively with a gap of 1 25 mm flow curves were measured in the logarithmic growth phase at a decreasing shear rate γ from 1000 s 1 to 0 01 s 1 and the corresponding shear stress τ was recorded the criterion for the steady state at each shear rate was that the measured shear stress τ fluctuated within 1 for 10 s zhang et al 2017 amplitude sweep oscillation tests which were performed at variable amplitudes 0 01 γ 100 and a constant frequency of 1 hz were conducted to evaluate the viscoelasticity of the sludge 2 8 hierarchical clustering analysis hca analysis hca is a robust data mining method based on pattern recognition for partitioning samples into clusters using the similarity criterion and a clustering rule hca achieves strong intra cluster homogeneity and strong inter cluster heterogeneity by forming a binary data tree masood et al 2022 the similarity criterion was quantified by the euclidean distance between samples in this study after comparing different clustering rules the average linkage method was selected to describe the relationship between indexes in the dendrogram mcgregor et al 2012 the values of different indexes after varying numbers of rounds of ein were on different scales so hca was performed on the min max normalised data of different indexes via eq 2 2 x x m i n x max x m i n x where x represents the normalised values of different indexes x represents the values measured in different numbers of ein and m i n x and m a x x represent the minimum and maximum values of the indexes after different rounds of ein respectively 2 9 other analysis methods the ts and vs of the sludge were determined according to the gravimetric method apha 2012 the soluble toc content was measured using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l japan the concentrations of soluble proteins and soluble polysaccharides were analysed using the lowry method lowry et al 1951 and anthrone method dreywood 1946 respectively ca and mg concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy agilent 5100 usa 3 results 3 1 effects of ein on cell lysis in sludge to investigate whether 10 rounds of ein caused cell lysis in sludge or the release of intracellular om flow cytometry was used to measure the ratios of dead to live bacterial cells in sludge based on the cell membrane integrity xiao et al 2015 figure s1 sm showed that the dead to live ratios of bacterial cells in the sludge ranged from 8 76 to 11 76 with an increasing number of rounds of ein however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the ratios of the dead to live bacterial cells amongst the 10 rounds of ein indicating that 10 rounds of ein did not cause severe bacterial destruction in sludge therefore most of the om released in this study was confirmed to originate from eos by measuring the ts and vs of sludge after each round of ein the result showed 31 7 of vs has been released from the solid phase of sludge to the liquid phase after ten rounds of ein 3 2 effects of ein on the release of main organic components in eos soluble toc was used to reflect the total amount of eos released from sludge proteins and polysaccharides are the main organic components of eos in sludge sheng et al 2010 and can be taken as sub indexes to characterise the changes of main organic components with different numbers of ein changes in concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides released during 10 rounds of ein and the corresponding fitting curves were shown in fig 1 a concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides gradually decreased with the increase of the ein rounds for example concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides at the first ein were 328 9 mg l 231 6 mg l and 104 4 mg l respectively whereas concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides declined to 85 2 mg l 38 6 mg l and 51 6 mg l at the 5th ein and declined to 47 5 mg l 24 9 mg l and 39 6 mg l at the 10th ein respectively the decreasing concentration of eos released with increasing rounds of ein indicated that successively less eos was extracted per round in the same magnitude indicating that the bs of eos in sludge was heterogeneous and the eos remaining in the sludge had a higher energy level of bs additionally concentrations of soluble toc r2 0 9312 p 0 05 proteins r2 0 9376 p 0 05 and polysaccharides r2 0 9528 p 0 05 decreasing with increased ein rounds were well fitted by the power law as shown in fig 1 a specifically concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides released in the first several rounds of ein were maintained at high levels fig 1 a region ⅰ moreover the accumulated concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides exceeded half of the total amount released in 10 rounds before the 3rd 2nd and 4th round of ein fig 1 b then the released concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides per round of ein all decreased and finally approached their plateau values as shown in fig 1 a region ⅱ the occurrence of these plateau values indicated that the total released concentration of eos were not significantly improved when the number of rounds of ein continued to increase and eos remaining in sludge had similar or slightly increasing levels of bs in the last several rounds of ein moreover the higher bs in the remaining eos made it difficult for the eos to be released by cer based ein as shown in fig 1 c concentrations of both soluble proteins r2 0 9753 and soluble polysaccharides r2 0 9515 had a linear relationship with the soluble toc concentrations released during 10 rounds of ein the slope of the regression line for soluble proteins was 0 7879 which exceeded that for soluble polysaccharides 0 2313 this finding indicated that compared with the polysaccharides the released proteins contributed more to the increase of soluble toc concentration during 10 rounds of ein which could be speculated that the intrinsic content of the proteins in sludge was higher than that of the polysaccharides and that the concentrations of proteins released were higher gonzalez et al 2018 proteins may also be more readily released than polysaccharides under the cer based ein proteins contain more charged groups such as carboxyl than polysaccharides and this property helps them form interactions with multivalent metals xu et al 2017 this interaction was reported to play an important role in maintaining floc structures dignac et al 1998 but can be destroyed by the cer method geng et al 2022 another interesting phenomenon clear from fig 1 a was that the released concentrations of soluble proteins from sludge were higher than those of the soluble polysaccharides in the 1st 3rd rounds of ein for example the concentration of soluble proteins released was 231 6 mg l at the first round of ein whereas that of soluble polysaccharides was only 104 4 mg l there was no significant difference between the release of proteins and polysaccharides at the 4th round of ein however the released concentrations of the soluble polysaccharides from sludge were higher than those of the soluble proteins in the 5th 10th rounds of ein it was speculated that proteins were distributed in the outer layer of the spatial structure of the sludge flocs whereas the polysaccharides were distributed in the inner layer this speculation has been confirmed by multiple staining and clsm observation in figure s2 sm moreover the encapsulation of proteins limited the release of polysaccharides in eos and the cer induced ein was more beneficial to proteins release by contrast polysaccharides was released only after a certain number of rounds of ein 3 3 effects of ein on the spatial distribution and morphology of unreleased proteins in eos as shown in fig 2 a based on the 3d reconstructed clsm image of sludge the labelled proteins in the sludge were irregular micron level aggregates fig 2 b d presents 2d overlay sectioned clsm images of fluorescent and dic observation at three depths from surfaces to the centre 20 μm 30 μm and 40 μm of sludge without ein the fluorescence signals of proteins in green in fig 2 b d closely overlap with the sludge flocs in black and grey in the dic images but were sparsely distributed in transparent areas representing the liquid phase of sludge this demonstrated that proteins were mainly distributed in the sludge flocs rather than in the liquid phase so the release of proteins from the solid phase was vital for resource recovery lü et al 2017 fig 2 b was captured near the surface of sludge without ein where the fluorescent areas of proteins were small and the fluorescence intensity was weak approaching the sample centre from the sectioned images of fig 2 b 2 c to 2 d the fluorescent areas and intensity of proteins gradually increase which indicated that the spatial distribution of the proteins was of low density in the exterior and high density in the interior this result was consistent with the findings of guo et al 2016 who found that the concentration of proteins in tb eps was 86 7 mg g of mlvss whereas the protein concentrations in sb eps and lb eps were as low as 4 4 mg g of mlvss and 7 4 mg g of mlvss respectively in fig 2 e sludge without ein was observed with agglomerate like proteins and chain like proteins and the fluorescence area of agglomerate like proteins is visibly larger fig 2 f and g depicting sludge after one and three rounds of ein showed that the fluorescent area and intensity of proteins gradually decreased with increasing rounds of ein which indicated that proteins were released from the solid phase of sludge flocs into the liquid phase and the content of proteins remaining in the sludge flocs decreased this was consistent with the finding of high soluble protein concentrations after one and three rounds of ein in fig 1 a additionally it can be observed that the percentage of agglomerate like proteins was reduced while chain like proteins appeared obviously and increased in quantity which indicated that proteins in sludge with increased rounds of ein were in a more extended and loosely connected morphology previously chain like proteins were also observed in model sludge cultured from synthetic wastewater with low metal contents compared with the sludge collected from wastewater treatment plants that study found that the model sludge formed a looser eos matrix structure xu et al 2020b this can be explained by the fact that om especially proteins have large numbers of functional groups and can interact with multivalent metals to form a densely structured eos matrix which restrains eos release into the liquid phase however a few fluorescent fragments with regular edges are observed in fig 2 h i of sludge after six and nine rounds of ein which may be the fragments of unseparated cer with proteins adsorbed on the surface 3 4 effects of ein on the floc structures of sludge the changes in d50 median diameter df fractal dimension and granulometric distributions of sludge with and without different numbers of rounds of ein were shown in fig 3 d50 is commonly used to reflect changes in the average particle size of sludge flocs as shown in fig 3 a both the d50 and df values of sludge decreased with increasing rounds of ein for example the d50 value of sludge without ein was 40 3 μm and it declined to 24 9 μm after 10 rounds of ein the reduction in particle sizes indicated that the integrity of the sludge flocs was damaged by the effect of ein df which is derived from fractal theory reflects not only the geometric forms but also the aggregate density of sludge flocs jullien 1987 a high df value usually means that the pores in the interior of sludge flocs are small suggesting a close connectivity of the sludge particles and a compact structure li and ganczarczyk 1989 conversely a lower df value indicates a looser structure of sludge the df value of sludge without ein was 2 24 and it declined to 1 91 after 10 rounds of ein which indicated that the effect of ein was to increase the pore size in the interior of the sludge and destructed the 3d structure this was supported by the results of clsm imaging fig 3 showing that proteins in sludge subjected to ein had a looser connectivity and more extended morphology additionally the decreases in d50 r2 0 9785 p 0 05 and df r2 0 9655 p 0 05 with increasing rounds of ein were well fitted by the power law to further identify the granulometric distributions of sludge the volume weighted particle size distribution curves were deconvoluted by a gaussian model with second derivative and the hidden peaks were identified as displayed in fig 3 b and 4 c fig 3 b showed that the particle size distribution curve of sludge without ein exhibited three peaks suggesting that there existed three structural levels of granulometric distribution the particle sizes at peak position of these structural levels in sludge were 16 22 μm 42 66 μm and 275 42 μm respectively the number of the peaks were consistent with the results of jorand et al 1995 who also found that sludge flocs had three structural levels fig 3 c showed that the particle size distribution curve of sludge after nine rounds of ein exhibits four peaks compared with the curve of the sludge without ein this curve included two smaller peaks at 0 85 μm and 3 02 μm whose particle sizes at peak positions were 2 and 1 orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest peak in the curve of sludge without ein respectively as shown in fig 3 c the other two peaks at 25 70 μm and 173 78 μm were also smaller than those in the sludge without ein these results indicated that sludge flocs disintegrated into smaller pieces due to the effect of repeated ein additionally the results of peak analysis of sludge after 0 1 3 6 and 9 rounds of ein were shown in table s3 sm it was found that all these treated sludges shared a similar pattern of four peaks in the particle size distribution curves but with different peak positions and relative intensities based on the results in fig 3 b 4 c and table s3 sm the granulometric distribution of sludge can be divided into four ranges to characterise the changes in structural levels 5 μm 5 50 μm 50 150 μm and 150 μm by synthesising information from these previous literatures and the quantitative results of this study the particle sizes 150 μm and 50 150 μm were taken as the ranges of macro flocs and micro flocs respectively those sized 5 50 μm were denoted as microcolonies and those sized 5 μm were considered as bacteria the results of normalised integration of the particle size distribution curves within these four ranges of sludge after different numbers of ein rounds were presented in fig 3 d in the 1st 3rd rounds of ein the main change was a decrease in the proportion of particles 150 μm and an increase in the size range 5 50 μm which indicated that macro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies in the 4th 6th rounds of ein the main change was a decrease in the proportion of particles sized 50 150 μm and an increase in those sized 5 50 μm which indicated that micro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies from the 7th to 10th rounds of ein the proportions of different size ranges fluctuated slightly but largely remained constant overall the proportion of the size 150 μm and 50 150 μm decreased and the proportions of the 5 50 μm and 5 μm ranges increased with increasing rounds of ein for example after 10 rounds of ein the proportion of sludge particle sizes in the range of 50 150 μm declined from 51 89 to 43 66 whereas that ranging between 5 and 50 μm increased from 35 47 to 45 37 and those smaller than 5 μm increased from 0 15 to 0 72 it can be summarised that during 10 rounds of ein macro flocs 150 μm first disintegrated into microcolonies 5 50 μm and bacteria 5 μm and then micro flocs 50 150 μm disintegrated however the disintegration of microcolonies was hardly observed this suggested that rounds of ein mainly led to the release of eos in the levels of flocs rather than microcolonies a similar phenomenon was reported by wang et al 2014 who found that cer treatment was efficient at disaggregating flocs but inefficient at disaggregating microcolonies for eps extraction and they speculated that the interparticle forces at the microcolony level were stronger than those at the floc level it can also be speculated that cer based ein specifically targeted the interactions at the floc level and it might exist other kinds of interactions amongst the eos at the microcolony level which needs to be further explored 3 5 effects of ein on the rheological properties of sludge rheological measurements were conducted to obtain detailed information about the flow behaviour and viscoelasticity of sludge after different numbers of rounds of ein which revealed the corresponding changes in network strength yen et al 2002 and provided information on the bs of eos as shown in fig 4 the viscosities of sludge with and without ein decreased with increases in the shear rates which illustrated that the sludge in this study behaved as a non newtonian fluid i e it exhibited shear thinning flow behaviour additionally the values of η 100 the viscosity at the shear rate of 100 s 1 values were listed in table s4 sm without ein and after 1 5 and 10 rounds of ein were 0 0362 pa s 0 0309 pa s 0 0194 pa s and 0 0113 pa s respectively which showed that the viscosity decreased with increasing rounds of ein viscosity which is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to gradual deformation or flow induced by shear stresses depends on the fluid s chemical structure its morphology and the interactive forces between its components mezger 2019 therefore the decreased values of η 100 with increased rounds of ein indicated that flow resistance was reduced implying that the chemical structure morphology and internal interactive forces of sludge were modified by repeated rounds of ein additionally the flow curves of sludge indicated the existence of yield stress at low shear rates fig 4 red circle area values were listed in table s4 sm theoretically the existence of yield stress is attributed to the formation of cross linked network structures held together by intermolecular forces these network structures are stable under low shear forces but can be destroyed by sufficiently large external shear forces mezger 2019 the values of yield stress without ein and after 1 5 and 10 rounds of ein were 0 3634 pa 0 2333 pa 0 1026 pa and 0 0514 pa respectively which indicated that the yield stress of sludge decreased with increasing rounds of ein the decreased values of the yield stress indicated that the cross linked network structures formed by intermolecular forces were destroyed by the repeated rounds of ein sewage sludge consists both solid and liquid phases which is a viscoelastic material and shows both the viscous flow of liquids and the elastic deformation of a solid eshtiaghi et al 2013 amplitude sweep oscillation tests were performed to describe the evolution of viscoelasticity under different numbers of rounds of ein the elastic modulus g represents the elastic behaviour of a material and is a measure of the deformation energy stored in the sample while the viscous modulus g represents the viscous property of a sample and the viscous dissipation of energy due to inner friction processes mezger 2019 g and g were plotted as functions of the applied strain γ0 on logarithmic coordinates in fig 4 b in the linear viscoelastic lve region γ0 10 of fig 4 b g and g of sludge were constant with different numbers of rounds of ein the constant values of g and g in the lve region are denoted as g0 and g0 respectively values of g0 and g0 were listed in table s4 sm the constant values indicate that the structures of these sludge samples had no significant changes within low deformations additionally fig 4 b revealed that g0 was larger than g0 at the same number of rounds of ein which illustrated that the elastic behaviour of sludge dominated the viscous behaviour additionally g0 r2 0 9026 p 0 05 and g0 r2 0 9330 p 0 05 decreased according to a power law with increasing rounds of ein in the lve region figure s4 sm specifically fitting formulas showed that g0 had larger absolute values of its coefficients and powers 4 17 and 0 76 than g0 0 71 and 0 51 respectively which indicated that the values of g0 decreased more quickly than those of g0 with increased rounds of ein this suggested that ein had a stronger influence on the elasticity of sludge than on its viscosity as shown in fig 4 b when the strain exceeded that in the lve region g decreased as the strain increased while g value slightly increased to reach a peak and then decreased eventually g became larger than g this phenomenon is a typical feature of soft glassy materials and is called the payne effect baudez et al 2013 farno et al 2016 the existence of a g peak indicated that before the exerting of ein there was an initial network structure of sludge when the strain applied was lower than the intermolecular or interparticle forces sludge had the capacity to store energy and maintain both its initial configuration and solid like structure however when the applied strain was sufficiently high the mechanical energy imparted to the material was dissipated and the microstructure collapsed subsequently starting to flow as a whole mezger 2019 in fig 4 b peaks remained after 1 6 rounds of ein but almost disappeared after sludge has undergone 7 or more rounds of ein this suggested that the sludge eventually lost the capacity to store energy inputs and maintain its solid like structure with increased rounds of ein and the network structure of the sludge was gradually destroyed 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between the release of eos and multivalent metals ca and mg it has been reported that multivalent metals can interact with organic moleculars of sludge flocs and restrain the release of om xu et al 2017 2018a the release of the two most abundant multivalent metals ca and mg in sludge was analysed in this study as shown in table 1 significant positive correlations were found between the concentrations of soluble toc and ca r2 0 9451 p 0 01 or mg r2 0 9464 p 0 01 released from sludge with rounds of ein this indicated that the release of eos was positively related to the release of multivalent metals from the sludge for example after the first round of ein the concentration of soluble toc was 328 9 mg l and the concentrations of ca and mg released were 268 4 mg l and 162 1 mg l after 5 rounds of ein the concentration of soluble toc was 85 2 mg l and the concentrations of ca and mg released were 156 2 mg l and 105 4 mg l interestingly during 10 rounds of ein the concentrations of soluble toc were relatively high initially and then decreased finally approaching plateau values shown in fig 1 a as shown in figure s4 sm the changes in concentration of ca and mg decreased with the number of rounds of ein in a similar fashion to that of eos release and both relationships can be fitted by the power law in addition to the similar variation tendency between the concentration changes of ca and mg and that of eos release there were also linear correlations between the concentration of soluble toc and ca r2 0 9386 p 0 05 or mg r2 0 9413 p 0 05 fig 5 a these significant linear correlations suggested a crucial role for the multivalent metals ca and mg in restricting the release of eos from the sludge this was consistent with a previous report that the removal of organic binding metals can decrease the energy barrier of organic solubilisation of sludge xu et al 2017 4 2 relationship between the eos release and floc structures d50 and df eos are vital for the stability of floc structures based on the results of peak analysis in this study section 3 4 the effect of ein on the floc structures of sludge fig 3 it was proposed that sludge primarily aggerated with microcolonies by extra bacterial eos and then formed micro flocs and macro flocs by inter floc eos the relationships between the concentration of soluble toc and d50 or df two typical indexes of sludge floc structures with different numbers of rounds of ein were explored as shown in table 1 there were significant positive relationships between soluble toc concentration and d50 r2 0 8877 p 0 01 or df r2 0 8707 p 0 01 indicating that soluble toc release was related to the destruction of floc structures with increasing numbers of rounds of ein with the repeated input of ein both d50 r2 0 9785 p 0 05 and df r2 0 9655 p 0 05 decreased following a power law as shown in fig 3 a similar to the decrease of soluble toc concentration shown in fig 1 a this similarity between the changes in soluble toc and d50 or df indicated significant positive relationships between them furthermore linear correlations between the released concentrations of soluble toc and the values of d50 r2 0 8807 p 0 05 or df r2 0 8608 p 0 05 of sludge were observed in fig 5 b which indicated that decreased in the eos release and d50 or df were synchronised as bacteria microcolonies and flocs are known to be embedded in the eos matrix of sludge sheng et al 2010 it was inferred that eos were released simultaneously with the release of microcolonies or bacteria from macro flocs or micro flocs 4 3 relationships between the eos release and rheological properties g 0 and g 0 rheological indexes i e g0 and g0 of sludge can serve as indicators to estimate the network strength of sludge yen et al 2002 zhang et al 2017 therefore the relationships between the soluble toc concentrations and g0 or g0 of sludge were investigated and results were shown in table 1 sm and fig 5 c as shown in table 1 the values of g0 r2 0 9473 p 0 01 and g0 r2 0 9373 p 0 05 had significant positive correlations with the soluble toc concentration which indicated that eos release was related to changes of the viscoelasticity of sludge one plausible explanation was that parts of the entanglement of organic molecular chains in the sludge were opened up by the removal of multivalent metals under successive rounds of ein it resulted in loss of interactions between multivalent metals and organic molecules so eos was released mezger 2019 linear correlations between the released concentration of soluble toc and values of g0 r2 0 8858 p 0 05 or g0 r2 0 8646 p 0 05 of sludge were shown in fig 5 c the slope of the linear relationship between soluble toc concentration and g0 was 0 0121 which was higher than that of g0 0 0017 as g0 reflects the elasticity of sludge enabling it to resist deformation like a solid this finding suggested that the interactions between eos and multivalent metals in sludge were responsible for maintaining the elasticity and deformation resistance of sludge 4 4 energy level analyses of eos in sludge via bs the indexes of eos released multivalent metals floc structures and rheological properties acquired after different rounds of ein all had power law distributions fig 1 a figures s4 fig 3 a and figures s3 indicating that changes in these indexes were non linear in response to multiple rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round as discussed above these indexes were significantly linearly and positively related to eos release therefore the non linear distribution of these indexes with different rounds of ein indicated that the energy levels of the interactions of eos were heterogeneous to quantitatively characterise the binding interactions of eos the bs values of eos were calculated according to eq 1 and the results were shown intable 2 in the first round of ein the value of bs was as low as 3 45 which indicated that the content of eos released was high and the binding energy level of eos was low next the values of bs rapidly increased to 27 06 and 52 19 after two and three rounds of ein which were an order of magnitude higher than the bs of eos released in the first round of ein this indicated that the eos remaining in the sludge had a higher binding energy level then the values of bs increased at a lower rate to 67 18 and 74 98 with four and five rounds of ein and fluctuated between 70 and 80 after six to nine rounds of ein finally the bs value increased to 86 05 after 10 rounds of ein at this time the energy level of eos reached its highest value and ein was insufficient to overcome the binding interactions of eos it was evident that the changes in the values of bs with increased rounds of ein in distinct stages so hca was adopted to investigate the profile of eos release during 10 rounds of ein specifically hca was performed on the matrix of independent variable different numbers of rounds of ein and dependant variables indexes of main release components physical structures and rheological properties and the results were represented by a heat map with a dendrogram in fig 6 in the result of hierarchical trees in fig 6 the indexes acquired after 1 10 rounds of ein were grouped into three clusters namely 1 2 cluster 1 3 6 cluster 2 and 7 10 cluster 3 rounds of ein these results indicated that these indexes in different clusters had distinct profiles which may be due to the different energy levels of the bs of eos and the average values of the indexes decreased in the order cluster 1 2 3 which indicated that eos had three energy levels of bs depending on the characteristics of components and structure of sludge from these three distinct clusters of indexes with internally similar profiles the characteristics of clusters revealed by hca can be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively together with the calculated values of bs in table 2 in cluster 1 the bs values of eos ranged from 3 45 to 27 06 showing the lowest energy level of bs in eos the released concentrations of eos and multivalent metals were highest in cluster 1 meanwhile rheological indexes g0 and g0 at high values decreased by a large margin and the macro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies and bacteria in this period the input of ein was highly efficient in releasing organics consistent with the clsm images in fig 2 the eos released in this period were mainly distributed outside the flocs and were loosely bound in cluster 2 the bs values of eos ranged from 52 19 to 74 98 showing an increased energy level of eos remaining in the sludge the values of these indexes namely the released concentrations of soluble toc released concentrations of multivalent metals floc structures and rheological properties were smaller and decreased in slower rates than those in cluster 1 the micro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies and bacteria moreover the g0 and g0 values in cluster 2 were quite close evidently the input of ein in cluster 2 had a lower efficiency of organics release than in cluster 1 which indicated that eos were strongly bound with micro flocs and this restrained the release of eos in cluster 3 the bs values of eos were 73 44 86 05 showing the highest energy level of eos remaining in the sludge the released concentrations of eos and multivalent metals and rheological indexes g0 and g0 had low values and remained almost constant which indicated that it was difficult to release the residual eos in sludge by performing further rounds of ein 4 5 significance of this work and implications for future resource recovery of sludge om the poor understanding of the binding interactions of eos limits the om release efficiency from sludge which hinders resource recovery from sludge in this study the bs of eos in sludge was quantitatively characterised by repeated rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round and the corresponding changes in the main release components floc structures and rheological properties of sludge with different rounds of ein were explored it was concluded that the non uniform bs of eos with three energy levels was responsible for the occurrence states of organic molecules the stability of physical structure and the maintain of rheological property correlation analyses of the organic release the main multivalent metals median diameter fractal dimension elastic modulus viscous modulus and the number of repeated ein revealed the underlying mechanism limiting the release of om from sludge from the perspective of binding interactions and suggested that the release or recovery of sludge om can be divided into three stages this finding can provide a reference for further quantitative analysis of the organic binding interactions in sludge and provide a theoretical basis for multi stage release or recovery of organic matter from sludge for practical applications in improving om release efficiency it is suggested that the intensity of energy inputs of methods adopted needs to take into account the energy levels of bs in eos taking the profiles of bs in eos multi stage methods with different energy levels are beneficial to dismantle the complex interactions of sludge and make full use of energy inputs that is to say the eos with a low energy level of bs can be firstly released and separated by a milder method and a following harsher method can be applied to release eos with a high energy level of bs in the case of thermal hydrolysis th of sludge a uniform intensity of th was conventionally applied to all organics irrespective of the bs of eos however low temperature th was insufficient to release eos with high bs values while high temperature th had a higher efficiency of eos release but results in the over hydrolysis of om with low bs leading to mineralisation or formation of refractory organics which resulted in wasted energy and loss of organic matter therefore combining multi stage of th by adjusting temperature or other operational conditions for stepwise releasing om in sequence could not only overcome the drawbacks of a single stage method but also save energy benefitting organic resource recovery for the carbon neutralisation of wastewater treatment plants moreover the findings of this study can provide an important theoretical basis for developing new methods on enhancing the bioconversion of om in sludge the biodegradability of om usually governs the bioconversion efficiency of sludge and om with different energy levels of bs may have different biodegradability accordingly niche targeted methods or materials are expected to be developed to induce the destruction of bs with different energy levels which is conducive to enhancing the biodegradability of om in addition it also can provide some references for in depth studying the pollution migration and transformation i e resistance gene microplastics and the sludge dewatering because eos are the main organic components of sludge and widely regarded as an important shield of microbial cells the physiochemical properties of eos such as bs of eos will inevitably affect the migration and transformation of pollutants and the occurrence of water in sludge however in future studies from a microscopic perspective of sludge need to be further conducted the research on binding interactions covalent and non covalent interactions affecting the organic release from different structural levels of sludge by different sources and times of energy inputs could be an emphasis comprehensively understanding the complex physicochemical properties of sludge is conductive to its resource recovery the sources and times of energy inputs can be proposed as a basic tool to dismantle and analyse the complex nature of sludge which could be another emphasis in the future research conclusion in this study the release profiles of eos from sludge were revealed by the bs of eos which was quantitatively characterised by 10 rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round the corresponding changes in the main release components floc structures and rheological properties of sludge with different rounds of ein were explored the main conclusions are as follows 1 the bs of eos in sludge was in the power law distribution which was concluded by the changes in the main components eos and multivalent metals release floc structures d50 and df and rheological properties g0 and g0 in response to 10 rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round 2 the non uniform bs of eos was responsible for the occurrence state of organic molecules stability of floc structures and maintenance of rheological properties which was proved by the correlation analyses between eos release stoc multivalent metals ca and mg floc structures d50 and df and rheological properties g0 and g0 3 three bs levels of eos have been confirmed by the hca of the featural indexes related to eos release were conducted for pattern recognition during 10 rounds of ein in the future further research needs to be conducted in depth for investigating the components such as binding interactions of the bs of eos and design the targeted methods of weakening bs to maximize the om release from sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest

14994,organic matter om recovery from sewage sludge is critical for sustainable development extracellular organic substances eos are the main organic components of sludge and the release of eos from sludge is usually the rate limiting step for om recovery however a poor understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of binding strength bs of eos usually restricts the release of om from sludge to reveal the underlying mechanism that how the intrinsic characteristics of eos limit its release in this study the bs of eos in sludge was quantitatively characterised by 10 rounds of energy input ein with the same magnitude per round the corresponding changes in the main components floc structures and rheological properties of sludge after different numbers of ein were also explored results showed that relationships between the release of eos and the main multivalent metals median diameters fractal dimensions elastic modulus and viscous modulus in the linear viscoelastic region of sludge versus the number of ein highlighted that the power law distribution of bs in eos was responsible for the occurrence state of organic molecules stability of floc structures and maintenance of rheological properties the result of hierarchical cluster analysis hca further revealed three bs levels of the eos in sludge indicating that the release or recovery of om from sludge occurred in three stages to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that explores the release profiles of eos in sludge by repeated ein for assessing the bs our findings may provide an important theoretical basis for the development target methods about the release and recovery of om from sludge graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resource recovery cation exchange resin waste activated sludge extracellular polymeric substances binding strength data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage sludge is a by product of biological wastewater treatment and is generated in large quantities annually it is an inorganic organic mixture comprising both solid and liquid phases and contains microorganisms biopolymers inorganic particles multivalent metals and a high content of water agglomerated in a three dimensional network xu et al 2020a sludge contains economically useful organic matter om the recovery of which is conducive to carbon neutralisation in wastewater treatment plants raheem et al 2018 xu et al 2021 release is a prerequisite for om recovery however the relative high cost benefit ratio of om release from sludge through physical chemical and biological approaches and a poor understanding of the corresponding characteristics of om in nature usually limits the recovery of om from sludge extracellular organic substances eos are the largest contributors to the organic fraction of sludge and account for 69 of the volatile solids vs in sludge gonzalez et al 2018 xu et al 2018b hence eos could be the main target for om recovery from sludge the main organic molecules e g proteins and polysaccharides present in eos have ample functional groups which can bind other organic molecules and some inorganic substances from wastewater through complicated binding interactions including covalent and noncovalent interactions flemming and wingender 2010 for example the negatively charged functional groups of organic molecules can bind multivalent metals ca and mg by bridging effects and electrostatic interactions and restricted organic molecular depolymerisation xu et al 2017 moreover micron sized silica particles bind organic molecules especially proteins in sludge by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds to form bioinorganic flocs and weaken the solubilisation ability of om dai et al 2017 besides the complex binding interactions existing in various components of sludge the binding strength bs of the interactions in eos seemed to be non uniform generally the extracellular polymeric substances eps are the main constituents of eos and play a key role in linking cells to form different structures hierarchies from microcolonies to flocs although eps from sludge in water and wastewater management systems have been intensively studied for decades the existing knowledge focusing on their bs diversity was mostly based on method defined eps fractions usually the outer to inner stratification structures of eps are categorised as soluble eps sb eps and bound eps wingender et al 1999 based on the extraction methodology some researchers further differentiate bound eps into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps li and yang 2007 yu et al 2008 specifically lb eps is the eps layer that can be eliminated using a mild method e g heating at a low temperature or low speed centrifugation whereas tb eps can be extracted using a harsh method e g heating at a higher temperature or high intensity centrifugation with pre ultrasonication with the cognition of stratification structure based on the operational definition the effects of different eps fractions on om release were extensively explored in physical chemical and biological treatments lu et al 2018 wu et al 2020 the stratification fractionised method also indicates that eps have different bss however limited information is available on the intrinsic characteristics of the bs of eps or eos therefore to further identify the intrinsic characteristics it was hypothesised that there could be different energy levels of bs in eos which determines the release profile of eos a better understanding of the bs of eos from sludge will help devise improved strategies for resource recovery this study aimed to reveal the underlying mechanism how the intrinsic characteristics of eos limit its release by determining the bs of eos from sludge in this paper the bs of eos was used to quantitatively characterise the intensity of binding interactions of eos and investigate the release profile of eos with numbers of energy input ein the ein was defined by the cation exchange resin cer method for calculating the bs values and the corresponding effects on cell lysis were also explored the ein induced release profile of eos in terms of changes on concentrations spatial distribution and morphology of the main composition were studied and the corresponding changes in floc structures i e median diameter fractal dimension and granulometric distribution and rheological properties i e flow behaviour and viscoelasticity were also analysed finally the correlation analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis hca of the featural indexes related to eos release were conducted for pattern recognition of bs in eos during 10 rounds of ein to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that explores the occurrence states and release profiles of eos by assessing the interplay of organics in sludge the findings in this study will provide more information on the bs of eos which is expected to provide reference for regulating the release and recovery of om from sludge for example niche targeted methods for destructing bs of eos can be developed with different levels of energy inputs based on the energy levels of bs in eos which is beneficial for improving om release efficiency and making full use of energy inputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the sludge the sludge used in this study was collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china that operates an anaerobic anoxic aerobic process the collected sludge was sieved through an 80 mesh sieve to eliminate large impurities and its supernatant was removed after a 24 h gravity sedimentation process the main characteristics of the sludge can be found in table s1 supplementary materials sm 2 2 basic assumptions and definitions of the bs value of eos based on previous studies liao et al 2002 wang et al 2012 xu et al 2018b the following basic assumptions were proposed 1 eos are the main targets of om in sludge for organic resource recovery and the bs of which determines release profiles of eos 2 one round of cer extraction equals one unit of ein for eos release owing to the high efficiency of om release and low rate of cell lysis the cer extraction method has been adopted as the most widely accepted eps extraction method sheng et al 2010 another advantage of the cer method is that resins can be removed by sieving which means that contamination by residual chemical reagents can be avoided compared with heat alkaline and ultrasonication methods the cer method can avoid disadvantages such as cell lysis chemical reagent residue and the oxidation of om however no method can extract all of the eos from sludge and repeated extractions help obtain a higher extraction yield ras et al 2008 therefore the cer method was used to provide a fixed energy input to induce the release of eos from sludge repeatedly 1 b s 1 c i s t o c r e l e a s e d c s t o c e q u i l i b r i u m 100 where c i s t o c r e l e a s e d is the concentration of soluble toc released after i i 0 1 10 rounds of ein and c s t o c e q u i l i b r i u m is the soluble toc concentration released when equilibrium was reached in the first round of ein in this paper the bs value of eos was defined as the difference between one and the proportion of soluble total organic carbon toc released relative to the equilibrium soluble toc concentration that was released under one unit of ein and bs was calculated using eq 1 theoretically under multiple rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round repeatedly 1 if the binding interactions between eos are homogeneous the content of eos released and the bs value of eos should be a constant however 2 if the interactions are heterogeneous the content of eos released and the bs value of eos should be variable with numbers of ein additionally a lower eos content released under per ein means a higher value of bs indicating a higher energy level of eos binding interactions 2 3 protocol for eos release with numbers of ein based on the cer extraction method compared with the well established and frequently used cer method for eps extraction frølund et al 1996 low dose and short time parameters 15 g cer g vs 2 h were adopted in this study to reduce the release rates of eos aimed for depicting the evolution of components and structures of sludge at a high resolution a hydrogen type strong acid cer 001 7 zhengguang industrial co ltd was used to extract eos from sludge and the main characteristics of the cer were listed in table s2 sm the cer was prepared through washing activating and type transformation according to the protocol described by geng et al 2022 the prepared cer 15 g cer g vs was mixed and stirred at 300 rpm with sludge for 2 h and one round of cer extraction above was defined as one unit of energy input ein next the cer was separated from the sludge by vacuum filtration with a stainless steel screen φ 20 cm 4 5 cm 50 mesh deionised water was added to wash the sludge that adhered to the surface of the cer and then adjusted the mass of the sludge to the initial value for quantitative analysis after the separation of the cer the sludge was centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone membrane for soluble indexes analysis next the residue was resuspended in deionised water to its original mass and subjected to the next round of extraction the release of eos by cer has been conducted for 10 times which meant that ein has been input for 10 times the sample id of each sludge sample was denoted by the number of ein rounds it underwent the equilibrium soluble toc concentration was measured by adding 15 g cer g vs to sludge and stirring at 300 rpm until the concentration of soluble toc fluctuated within 10 2 4 dead live ratios the dead live ratio of the sludge samples was measured using flow cytometry bd facscalibur usa with live dead baclight bacterial viability kits invitrogen molecular probes l 7012 usa containing syto 9 green fluorescent and propidium iodide pi red fluorescent for nucleic acid the syto 9 stain generally labels bacteria with intact and damaged membranes whereas pi penetrates only bacteria with damaged membranes and reduces the syto 9 stain fluorescence when both dyes are used after the sludge samples 1 ml were diluted to 10 ml with sterile normal saline the diluted samples were dispersed by ultrasonication 100 w 30 s after dispersion the samples were gradient diluted 10 thrice with sterile normal saline the diluted samples were filtered through the 40 μm cell strainer to remove large particles to prevent clogging the flow cytometry the staining was performed as per the manufacturer s instructions and the emission excitation wavelengths for syto 9 and pi were set at 525 nm 617 nm and 617 nm 536 nm respectively 2 5 visualisation of key components in eos by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm the occurrence of proteins in sludge was visualised using clsm leica sp8 germany the sypro orange protein gel stain sigma st louis usa reagent was diluted 1 5000 in 7 5 v v acetic acid

spatial distribution of proteins and polysaccharides multiple staining scheme with fitc beijing solarbio science technology co ltd con a af555 and calcofluor white sigma st louis usa was used and details can be seen in the text s1 sm 2 6 characterisation and analysis of the floc structures the granulometric distributions of the sludge extracted through different rounds were measured using dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern uk light intensity i and wave vector q were used to calculate the fractal dimensions which is the slope of log i versus log q as obtained by linear fitting zhang et al 2018 the volume frequency and logarithm of the sample particle size were deconvoluted by the gaussian model with second derivative to decipher hidden peaks and identify dominant particle size clusters using origin pro 2021 origin lab usa according to the results of peak identification the sample particle sizes were divided into four ranges 5 μm 5 50 μm 50 150 μm and 150 μm then the integration of volume weighted particle size distribution curves within these four ranges were normalised to present changes in granulometric distributions by percentages 2 7 rheological characterisation a rotational rheometer kinexus lab malvern uk was used for the rheological measurements of sludge at 25 the measuring system was equipped with a concentric cylinder geometry and the diameters of the cup the outer cylinder and bob the inner cylinder were 27 5 mm and 25 mm respectively with a gap of 1 25 mm flow curves were measured in the logarithmic growth phase at a decreasing shear rate γ from 1000 s 1 to 0 01 s 1 and the corresponding shear stress τ was recorded the criterion for the steady state at each shear rate was that the measured shear stress τ fluctuated within 1 for 10 s zhang et al 2017 amplitude sweep oscillation tests which were performed at variable amplitudes 0 01 γ 100 and a constant frequency of 1 hz were conducted to evaluate the viscoelasticity of the sludge 2 8 hierarchical clustering analysis hca analysis hca is a robust data mining method based on pattern recognition for partitioning samples into clusters using the similarity criterion and a clustering rule hca achieves strong intra cluster homogeneity and strong inter cluster heterogeneity by forming a binary data tree masood et al 2022 the similarity criterion was quantified by the euclidean distance between samples in this study after comparing different clustering rules the average linkage method was selected to describe the relationship between indexes in the dendrogram mcgregor et al 2012 the values of different indexes after varying numbers of rounds of ein were on different scales so hca was performed on the min max normalised data of different indexes via eq 2 2 x x m i n x max x m i n x where x represents the normalised values of different indexes x represents the values measured in different numbers of ein and m i n x and m a x x represent the minimum and maximum values of the indexes after different rounds of ein respectively 2 9 other analysis methods the ts and vs of the sludge were determined according to the gravimetric method apha 2012 the soluble toc content was measured using a toc analyser shimadzu toc l japan the concentrations of soluble proteins and soluble polysaccharides were analysed using the lowry method lowry et al 1951 and anthrone method dreywood 1946 respectively ca and mg concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy agilent 5100 usa 3 results 3 1 effects of ein on cell lysis in sludge to investigate whether 10 rounds of ein caused cell lysis in sludge or the release of intracellular om flow cytometry was used to measure the ratios of dead to live bacterial cells in sludge based on the cell membrane integrity xiao et al 2015 figure s1 sm showed that the dead to live ratios of bacterial cells in the sludge ranged from 8 76 to 11 76 with an increasing number of rounds of ein however there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the ratios of the dead to live bacterial cells amongst the 10 rounds of ein indicating that 10 rounds of ein did not cause severe bacterial destruction in sludge therefore most of the om released in this study was confirmed to originate from eos by measuring the ts and vs of sludge after each round of ein the result showed 31 7 of vs has been released from the solid phase of sludge to the liquid phase after ten rounds of ein 3 2 effects of ein on the release of main organic components in eos soluble toc was used to reflect the total amount of eos released from sludge proteins and polysaccharides are the main organic components of eos in sludge sheng et al 2010 and can be taken as sub indexes to characterise the changes of main organic components with different numbers of ein changes in concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides released during 10 rounds of ein and the corresponding fitting curves were shown in fig 1 a concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides gradually decreased with the increase of the ein rounds for example concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides at the first ein were 328 9 mg l 231 6 mg l and 104 4 mg l respectively whereas concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides declined to 85 2 mg l 38 6 mg l and 51 6 mg l at the 5th ein and declined to 47 5 mg l 24 9 mg l and 39 6 mg l at the 10th ein respectively the decreasing concentration of eos released with increasing rounds of ein indicated that successively less eos was extracted per round in the same magnitude indicating that the bs of eos in sludge was heterogeneous and the eos remaining in the sludge had a higher energy level of bs additionally concentrations of soluble toc r2 0 9312 p 0 05 proteins r2 0 9376 p 0 05 and polysaccharides r2 0 9528 p 0 05 decreasing with increased ein rounds were well fitted by the power law as shown in fig 1 a specifically concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides released in the first several rounds of ein were maintained at high levels fig 1 a region ⅰ moreover the accumulated concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides exceeded half of the total amount released in 10 rounds before the 3rd 2nd and 4th round of ein fig 1 b then the released concentrations of soluble toc proteins and polysaccharides per round of ein all decreased and finally approached their plateau values as shown in fig 1 a region ⅱ the occurrence of these plateau values indicated that the total released concentration of eos were not significantly improved when the number of rounds of ein continued to increase and eos remaining in sludge had similar or slightly increasing levels of bs in the last several rounds of ein moreover the higher bs in the remaining eos made it difficult for the eos to be released by cer based ein as shown in fig 1 c concentrations of both soluble proteins r2 0 9753 and soluble polysaccharides r2 0 9515 had a linear relationship with the soluble toc concentrations released during 10 rounds of ein the slope of the regression line for soluble proteins was 0 7879 which exceeded that for soluble polysaccharides 0 2313 this finding indicated that compared with the polysaccharides the released proteins contributed more to the increase of soluble toc concentration during 10 rounds of ein which could be speculated that the intrinsic content of the proteins in sludge was higher than that of the polysaccharides and that the concentrations of proteins released were higher gonzalez et al 2018 proteins may also be more readily released than polysaccharides under the cer based ein proteins contain more charged groups such as carboxyl than polysaccharides and this property helps them form interactions with multivalent metals xu et al 2017 this interaction was reported to play an important role in maintaining floc structures dignac et al 1998 but can be destroyed by the cer method geng et al 2022 another interesting phenomenon clear from fig 1 a was that the released concentrations of soluble proteins from sludge were higher than those of the soluble polysaccharides in the 1st 3rd rounds of ein for example the concentration of soluble proteins released was 231 6 mg l at the first round of ein whereas that of soluble polysaccharides was only 104 4 mg l there was no significant difference between the release of proteins and polysaccharides at the 4th round of ein however the released concentrations of the soluble polysaccharides from sludge were higher than those of the soluble proteins in the 5th 10th rounds of ein it was speculated that proteins were distributed in the outer layer of the spatial structure of the sludge flocs whereas the polysaccharides were distributed in the inner layer this speculation has been confirmed by multiple staining and clsm observation in figure s2 sm moreover the encapsulation of proteins limited the release of polysaccharides in eos and the cer induced ein was more beneficial to proteins release by contrast polysaccharides was released only after a certain number of rounds of ein 3 3 effects of ein on the spatial distribution and morphology of unreleased proteins in eos as shown in fig 2 a based on the 3d reconstructed clsm image of sludge the labelled proteins in the sludge were irregular micron level aggregates fig 2 b d presents 2d overlay sectioned clsm images of fluorescent and dic observation at three depths from surfaces to the centre 20 μm 30 μm and 40 μm of sludge without ein the fluorescence signals of proteins in green in fig 2 b d closely overlap with the sludge flocs in black and grey in the dic images but were sparsely distributed in transparent areas representing the liquid phase of sludge this demonstrated that proteins were mainly distributed in the sludge flocs rather than in the liquid phase so the release of proteins from the solid phase was vital for resource recovery lü et al 2017 fig 2 b was captured near the surface of sludge without ein where the fluorescent areas of proteins were small and the fluorescence intensity was weak approaching the sample centre from the sectioned images of fig 2 b 2 c to 2 d the fluorescent areas and intensity of proteins gradually increase which indicated that the spatial distribution of the proteins was of low density in the exterior and high density in the interior this result was consistent with the findings of guo et al 2016 who found that the concentration of proteins in tb eps was 86 7 mg g of mlvss whereas the protein concentrations in sb eps and lb eps were as low as 4 4 mg g of mlvss and 7 4 mg g of mlvss respectively in fig 2 e sludge without ein was observed with agglomerate like proteins and chain like proteins and the fluorescence area of agglomerate like proteins is visibly larger fig 2 f and g depicting sludge after one and three rounds of ein showed that the fluorescent area and intensity of proteins gradually decreased with increasing rounds of ein which indicated that proteins were released from the solid phase of sludge flocs into the liquid phase and the content of proteins remaining in the sludge flocs decreased this was consistent with the finding of high soluble protein concentrations after one and three rounds of ein in fig 1 a additionally it can be observed that the percentage of agglomerate like proteins was reduced while chain like proteins appeared obviously and increased in quantity which indicated that proteins in sludge with increased rounds of ein were in a more extended and loosely connected morphology previously chain like proteins were also observed in model sludge cultured from synthetic wastewater with low metal contents compared with the sludge collected from wastewater treatment plants that study found that the model sludge formed a looser eos matrix structure xu et al 2020b this can be explained by the fact that om especially proteins have large numbers of functional groups and can interact with multivalent metals to form a densely structured eos matrix which restrains eos release into the liquid phase however a few fluorescent fragments with regular edges are observed in fig 2 h i of sludge after six and nine rounds of ein which may be the fragments of unseparated cer with proteins adsorbed on the surface 3 4 effects of ein on the floc structures of sludge the changes in d50 median diameter df fractal dimension and granulometric distributions of sludge with and without different numbers of rounds of ein were shown in fig 3 d50 is commonly used to reflect changes in the average particle size of sludge flocs as shown in fig 3 a both the d50 and df values of sludge decreased with increasing rounds of ein for example the d50 value of sludge without ein was 40 3 μm and it declined to 24 9 μm after 10 rounds of ein the reduction in particle sizes indicated that the integrity of the sludge flocs was damaged by the effect of ein df which is derived from fractal theory reflects not only the geometric forms but also the aggregate density of sludge flocs jullien 1987 a high df value usually means that the pores in the interior of sludge flocs are small suggesting a close connectivity of the sludge particles and a compact structure li and ganczarczyk 1989 conversely a lower df value indicates a looser structure of sludge the df value of sludge without ein was 2 24 and it declined to 1 91 after 10 rounds of ein which indicated that the effect of ein was to increase the pore size in the interior of the sludge and destructed the 3d structure this was supported by the results of clsm imaging fig 3 showing that proteins in sludge subjected to ein had a looser connectivity and more extended morphology additionally the decreases in d50 r2 0 9785 p 0 05 and df r2 0 9655 p 0 05 with increasing rounds of ein were well fitted by the power law to further identify the granulometric distributions of sludge the volume weighted particle size distribution curves were deconvoluted by a gaussian model with second derivative and the hidden peaks were identified as displayed in fig 3 b and 4 c fig 3 b showed that the particle size distribution curve of sludge without ein exhibited three peaks suggesting that there existed three structural levels of granulometric distribution the particle sizes at peak position of these structural levels in sludge were 16 22 μm 42 66 μm and 275 42 μm respectively the number of the peaks were consistent with the results of jorand et al 1995 who also found that sludge flocs had three structural levels fig 3 c showed that the particle size distribution curve of sludge after nine rounds of ein exhibits four peaks compared with the curve of the sludge without ein this curve included two smaller peaks at 0 85 μm and 3 02 μm whose particle sizes at peak positions were 2 and 1 orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest peak in the curve of sludge without ein respectively as shown in fig 3 c the other two peaks at 25 70 μm and 173 78 μm were also smaller than those in the sludge without ein these results indicated that sludge flocs disintegrated into smaller pieces due to the effect of repeated ein additionally the results of peak analysis of sludge after 0 1 3 6 and 9 rounds of ein were shown in table s3 sm it was found that all these treated sludges shared a similar pattern of four peaks in the particle size distribution curves but with different peak positions and relative intensities based on the results in fig 3 b 4 c and table s3 sm the granulometric distribution of sludge can be divided into four ranges to characterise the changes in structural levels 5 μm 5 50 μm 50 150 μm and 150 μm by synthesising information from these previous literatures and the quantitative results of this study the particle sizes 150 μm and 50 150 μm were taken as the ranges of macro flocs and micro flocs respectively those sized 5 50 μm were denoted as microcolonies and those sized 5 μm were considered as bacteria the results of normalised integration of the particle size distribution curves within these four ranges of sludge after different numbers of ein rounds were presented in fig 3 d in the 1st 3rd rounds of ein the main change was a decrease in the proportion of particles 150 μm and an increase in the size range 5 50 μm which indicated that macro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies in the 4th 6th rounds of ein the main change was a decrease in the proportion of particles sized 50 150 μm and an increase in those sized 5 50 μm which indicated that micro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies from the 7th to 10th rounds of ein the proportions of different size ranges fluctuated slightly but largely remained constant overall the proportion of the size 150 μm and 50 150 μm decreased and the proportions of the 5 50 μm and 5 μm ranges increased with increasing rounds of ein for example after 10 rounds of ein the proportion of sludge particle sizes in the range of 50 150 μm declined from 51 89 to 43 66 whereas that ranging between 5 and 50 μm increased from 35 47 to 45 37 and those smaller than 5 μm increased from 0 15 to 0 72 it can be summarised that during 10 rounds of ein macro flocs 150 μm first disintegrated into microcolonies 5 50 μm and bacteria 5 μm and then micro flocs 50 150 μm disintegrated however the disintegration of microcolonies was hardly observed this suggested that rounds of ein mainly led to the release of eos in the levels of flocs rather than microcolonies a similar phenomenon was reported by wang et al 2014 who found that cer treatment was efficient at disaggregating flocs but inefficient at disaggregating microcolonies for eps extraction and they speculated that the interparticle forces at the microcolony level were stronger than those at the floc level it can also be speculated that cer based ein specifically targeted the interactions at the floc level and it might exist other kinds of interactions amongst the eos at the microcolony level which needs to be further explored 3 5 effects of ein on the rheological properties of sludge rheological measurements were conducted to obtain detailed information about the flow behaviour and viscoelasticity of sludge after different numbers of rounds of ein which revealed the corresponding changes in network strength yen et al 2002 and provided information on the bs of eos as shown in fig 4 the viscosities of sludge with and without ein decreased with increases in the shear rates which illustrated that the sludge in this study behaved as a non newtonian fluid i e it exhibited shear thinning flow behaviour additionally the values of η 100 the viscosity at the shear rate of 100 s 1 values were listed in table s4 sm without ein and after 1 5 and 10 rounds of ein were 0 0362 pa s 0 0309 pa s 0 0194 pa s and 0 0113 pa s respectively which showed that the viscosity decreased with increasing rounds of ein viscosity which is a measure of the resistance of a fluid to gradual deformation or flow induced by shear stresses depends on the fluid s chemical structure its morphology and the interactive forces between its components mezger 2019 therefore the decreased values of η 100 with increased rounds of ein indicated that flow resistance was reduced implying that the chemical structure morphology and internal interactive forces of sludge were modified by repeated rounds of ein additionally the flow curves of sludge indicated the existence of yield stress at low shear rates fig 4 red circle area values were listed in table s4 sm theoretically the existence of yield stress is attributed to the formation of cross linked network structures held together by intermolecular forces these network structures are stable under low shear forces but can be destroyed by sufficiently large external shear forces mezger 2019 the values of yield stress without ein and after 1 5 and 10 rounds of ein were 0 3634 pa 0 2333 pa 0 1026 pa and 0 0514 pa respectively which indicated that the yield stress of sludge decreased with increasing rounds of ein the decreased values of the yield stress indicated that the cross linked network structures formed by intermolecular forces were destroyed by the repeated rounds of ein sewage sludge consists both solid and liquid phases which is a viscoelastic material and shows both the viscous flow of liquids and the elastic deformation of a solid eshtiaghi et al 2013 amplitude sweep oscillation tests were performed to describe the evolution of viscoelasticity under different numbers of rounds of ein the elastic modulus g represents the elastic behaviour of a material and is a measure of the deformation energy stored in the sample while the viscous modulus g represents the viscous property of a sample and the viscous dissipation of energy due to inner friction processes mezger 2019 g and g were plotted as functions of the applied strain γ0 on logarithmic coordinates in fig 4 b in the linear viscoelastic lve region γ0 10 of fig 4 b g and g of sludge were constant with different numbers of rounds of ein the constant values of g and g in the lve region are denoted as g0 and g0 respectively values of g0 and g0 were listed in table s4 sm the constant values indicate that the structures of these sludge samples had no significant changes within low deformations additionally fig 4 b revealed that g0 was larger than g0 at the same number of rounds of ein which illustrated that the elastic behaviour of sludge dominated the viscous behaviour additionally g0 r2 0 9026 p 0 05 and g0 r2 0 9330 p 0 05 decreased according to a power law with increasing rounds of ein in the lve region figure s4 sm specifically fitting formulas showed that g0 had larger absolute values of its coefficients and powers 4 17 and 0 76 than g0 0 71 and 0 51 respectively which indicated that the values of g0 decreased more quickly than those of g0 with increased rounds of ein this suggested that ein had a stronger influence on the elasticity of sludge than on its viscosity as shown in fig 4 b when the strain exceeded that in the lve region g decreased as the strain increased while g value slightly increased to reach a peak and then decreased eventually g became larger than g this phenomenon is a typical feature of soft glassy materials and is called the payne effect baudez et al 2013 farno et al 2016 the existence of a g peak indicated that before the exerting of ein there was an initial network structure of sludge when the strain applied was lower than the intermolecular or interparticle forces sludge had the capacity to store energy and maintain both its initial configuration and solid like structure however when the applied strain was sufficiently high the mechanical energy imparted to the material was dissipated and the microstructure collapsed subsequently starting to flow as a whole mezger 2019 in fig 4 b peaks remained after 1 6 rounds of ein but almost disappeared after sludge has undergone 7 or more rounds of ein this suggested that the sludge eventually lost the capacity to store energy inputs and maintain its solid like structure with increased rounds of ein and the network structure of the sludge was gradually destroyed 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between the release of eos and multivalent metals ca and mg it has been reported that multivalent metals can interact with organic moleculars of sludge flocs and restrain the release of om xu et al 2017 2018a the release of the two most abundant multivalent metals ca and mg in sludge was analysed in this study as shown in table 1 significant positive correlations were found between the concentrations of soluble toc and ca r2 0 9451 p 0 01 or mg r2 0 9464 p 0 01 released from sludge with rounds of ein this indicated that the release of eos was positively related to the release of multivalent metals from the sludge for example after the first round of ein the concentration of soluble toc was 328 9 mg l and the concentrations of ca and mg released were 268 4 mg l and 162 1 mg l after 5 rounds of ein the concentration of soluble toc was 85 2 mg l and the concentrations of ca and mg released were 156 2 mg l and 105 4 mg l interestingly during 10 rounds of ein the concentrations of soluble toc were relatively high initially and then decreased finally approaching plateau values shown in fig 1 a as shown in figure s4 sm the changes in concentration of ca and mg decreased with the number of rounds of ein in a similar fashion to that of eos release and both relationships can be fitted by the power law in addition to the similar variation tendency between the concentration changes of ca and mg and that of eos release there were also linear correlations between the concentration of soluble toc and ca r2 0 9386 p 0 05 or mg r2 0 9413 p 0 05 fig 5 a these significant linear correlations suggested a crucial role for the multivalent metals ca and mg in restricting the release of eos from the sludge this was consistent with a previous report that the removal of organic binding metals can decrease the energy barrier of organic solubilisation of sludge xu et al 2017 4 2 relationship between the eos release and floc structures d50 and df eos are vital for the stability of floc structures based on the results of peak analysis in this study section 3 4 the effect of ein on the floc structures of sludge fig 3 it was proposed that sludge primarily aggerated with microcolonies by extra bacterial eos and then formed micro flocs and macro flocs by inter floc eos the relationships between the concentration of soluble toc and d50 or df two typical indexes of sludge floc structures with different numbers of rounds of ein were explored as shown in table 1 there were significant positive relationships between soluble toc concentration and d50 r2 0 8877 p 0 01 or df r2 0 8707 p 0 01 indicating that soluble toc release was related to the destruction of floc structures with increasing numbers of rounds of ein with the repeated input of ein both d50 r2 0 9785 p 0 05 and df r2 0 9655 p 0 05 decreased following a power law as shown in fig 3 a similar to the decrease of soluble toc concentration shown in fig 1 a this similarity between the changes in soluble toc and d50 or df indicated significant positive relationships between them furthermore linear correlations between the released concentrations of soluble toc and the values of d50 r2 0 8807 p 0 05 or df r2 0 8608 p 0 05 of sludge were observed in fig 5 b which indicated that decreased in the eos release and d50 or df were synchronised as bacteria microcolonies and flocs are known to be embedded in the eos matrix of sludge sheng et al 2010 it was inferred that eos were released simultaneously with the release of microcolonies or bacteria from macro flocs or micro flocs 4 3 relationships between the eos release and rheological properties g 0 and g 0 rheological indexes i e g0 and g0 of sludge can serve as indicators to estimate the network strength of sludge yen et al 2002 zhang et al 2017 therefore the relationships between the soluble toc concentrations and g0 or g0 of sludge were investigated and results were shown in table 1 sm and fig 5 c as shown in table 1 the values of g0 r2 0 9473 p 0 01 and g0 r2 0 9373 p 0 05 had significant positive correlations with the soluble toc concentration which indicated that eos release was related to changes of the viscoelasticity of sludge one plausible explanation was that parts of the entanglement of organic molecular chains in the sludge were opened up by the removal of multivalent metals under successive rounds of ein it resulted in loss of interactions between multivalent metals and organic molecules so eos was released mezger 2019 linear correlations between the released concentration of soluble toc and values of g0 r2 0 8858 p 0 05 or g0 r2 0 8646 p 0 05 of sludge were shown in fig 5 c the slope of the linear relationship between soluble toc concentration and g0 was 0 0121 which was higher than that of g0 0 0017 as g0 reflects the elasticity of sludge enabling it to resist deformation like a solid this finding suggested that the interactions between eos and multivalent metals in sludge were responsible for maintaining the elasticity and deformation resistance of sludge 4 4 energy level analyses of eos in sludge via bs the indexes of eos released multivalent metals floc structures and rheological properties acquired after different rounds of ein all had power law distributions fig 1 a figures s4 fig 3 a and figures s3 indicating that changes in these indexes were non linear in response to multiple rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round as discussed above these indexes were significantly linearly and positively related to eos release therefore the non linear distribution of these indexes with different rounds of ein indicated that the energy levels of the interactions of eos were heterogeneous to quantitatively characterise the binding interactions of eos the bs values of eos were calculated according to eq 1 and the results were shown intable 2 in the first round of ein the value of bs was as low as 3 45 which indicated that the content of eos released was high and the binding energy level of eos was low next the values of bs rapidly increased to 27 06 and 52 19 after two and three rounds of ein which were an order of magnitude higher than the bs of eos released in the first round of ein this indicated that the eos remaining in the sludge had a higher binding energy level then the values of bs increased at a lower rate to 67 18 and 74 98 with four and five rounds of ein and fluctuated between 70 and 80 after six to nine rounds of ein finally the bs value increased to 86 05 after 10 rounds of ein at this time the energy level of eos reached its highest value and ein was insufficient to overcome the binding interactions of eos it was evident that the changes in the values of bs with increased rounds of ein in distinct stages so hca was adopted to investigate the profile of eos release during 10 rounds of ein specifically hca was performed on the matrix of independent variable different numbers of rounds of ein and dependant variables indexes of main release components physical structures and rheological properties and the results were represented by a heat map with a dendrogram in fig 6 in the result of hierarchical trees in fig 6 the indexes acquired after 1 10 rounds of ein were grouped into three clusters namely 1 2 cluster 1 3 6 cluster 2 and 7 10 cluster 3 rounds of ein these results indicated that these indexes in different clusters had distinct profiles which may be due to the different energy levels of the bs of eos and the average values of the indexes decreased in the order cluster 1 2 3 which indicated that eos had three energy levels of bs depending on the characteristics of components and structure of sludge from these three distinct clusters of indexes with internally similar profiles the characteristics of clusters revealed by hca can be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively together with the calculated values of bs in table 2 in cluster 1 the bs values of eos ranged from 3 45 to 27 06 showing the lowest energy level of bs in eos the released concentrations of eos and multivalent metals were highest in cluster 1 meanwhile rheological indexes g0 and g0 at high values decreased by a large margin and the macro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies and bacteria in this period the input of ein was highly efficient in releasing organics consistent with the clsm images in fig 2 the eos released in this period were mainly distributed outside the flocs and were loosely bound in cluster 2 the bs values of eos ranged from 52 19 to 74 98 showing an increased energy level of eos remaining in the sludge the values of these indexes namely the released concentrations of soluble toc released concentrations of multivalent metals floc structures and rheological properties were smaller and decreased in slower rates than those in cluster 1 the micro flocs disintegrated into microcolonies and bacteria moreover the g0 and g0 values in cluster 2 were quite close evidently the input of ein in cluster 2 had a lower efficiency of organics release than in cluster 1 which indicated that eos were strongly bound with micro flocs and this restrained the release of eos in cluster 3 the bs values of eos were 73 44 86 05 showing the highest energy level of eos remaining in the sludge the released concentrations of eos and multivalent metals and rheological indexes g0 and g0 had low values and remained almost constant which indicated that it was difficult to release the residual eos in sludge by performing further rounds of ein 4 5 significance of this work and implications for future resource recovery of sludge om the poor understanding of the binding interactions of eos limits the om release efficiency from sludge which hinders resource recovery from sludge in this study the bs of eos in sludge was quantitatively characterised by repeated rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round and the corresponding changes in the main release components floc structures and rheological properties of sludge with different rounds of ein were explored it was concluded that the non uniform bs of eos with three energy levels was responsible for the occurrence states of organic molecules the stability of physical structure and the maintain of rheological property correlation analyses of the organic release the main multivalent metals median diameter fractal dimension elastic modulus viscous modulus and the number of repeated ein revealed the underlying mechanism limiting the release of om from sludge from the perspective of binding interactions and suggested that the release or recovery of sludge om can be divided into three stages this finding can provide a reference for further quantitative analysis of the organic binding interactions in sludge and provide a theoretical basis for multi stage release or recovery of organic matter from sludge for practical applications in improving om release efficiency it is suggested that the intensity of energy inputs of methods adopted needs to take into account the energy levels of bs in eos taking the profiles of bs in eos multi stage methods with different energy levels are beneficial to dismantle the complex interactions of sludge and make full use of energy inputs that is to say the eos with a low energy level of bs can be firstly released and separated by a milder method and a following harsher method can be applied to release eos with a high energy level of bs in the case of thermal hydrolysis th of sludge a uniform intensity of th was conventionally applied to all organics irrespective of the bs of eos however low temperature th was insufficient to release eos with high bs values while high temperature th had a higher efficiency of eos release but results in the over hydrolysis of om with low bs leading to mineralisation or formation of refractory organics which resulted in wasted energy and loss of organic matter therefore combining multi stage of th by adjusting temperature or other operational conditions for stepwise releasing om in sequence could not only overcome the drawbacks of a single stage method but also save energy benefitting organic resource recovery for the carbon neutralisation of wastewater treatment plants moreover the findings of this study can provide an important theoretical basis for developing new methods on enhancing the bioconversion of om in sludge the biodegradability of om usually governs the bioconversion efficiency of sludge and om with different energy levels of bs may have different biodegradability accordingly niche targeted methods or materials are expected to be developed to induce the destruction of bs with different energy levels which is conducive to enhancing the biodegradability of om in addition it also can provide some references for in depth studying the pollution migration and transformation i e resistance gene microplastics and the sludge dewatering because eos are the main organic components of sludge and widely regarded as an important shield of microbial cells the physiochemical properties of eos such as bs of eos will inevitably affect the migration and transformation of pollutants and the occurrence of water in sludge however in future studies from a microscopic perspective of sludge need to be further conducted the research on binding interactions covalent and non covalent interactions affecting the organic release from different structural levels of sludge by different sources and times of energy inputs could be an emphasis comprehensively understanding the complex physicochemical properties of sludge is conductive to its resource recovery the sources and times of energy inputs can be proposed as a basic tool to dismantle and analyse the complex nature of sludge which could be another emphasis in the future research conclusion in this study the release profiles of eos from sludge were revealed by the bs of eos which was quantitatively characterised by 10 rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round the corresponding changes in the main release components floc structures and rheological properties of sludge with different rounds of ein were explored the main conclusions are as follows 1 the bs of eos in sludge was in the power law distribution which was concluded by the changes in the main components eos and multivalent metals release floc structures d50 and df and rheological properties g0 and g0 in response to 10 rounds of ein with the same magnitude per round 2 the non uniform bs of eos was responsible for the occurrence state of organic molecules stability of floc structures and maintenance of rheological properties which was proved by the correlation analyses between eos release stoc multivalent metals ca and mg floc structures d50 and df and rheological properties g0 and g0 3 three bs levels of eos have been confirmed by the hca of the featural indexes related to eos release were conducted for pattern recognition during 10 rounds of ein in the future further research needs to be conducted in depth for investigating the components such as binding interactions of the bs of eos and design the targeted methods of weakening bs to maximize the om release from sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial interest
