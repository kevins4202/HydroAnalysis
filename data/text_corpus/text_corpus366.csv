1830,climate change impact studies commonly use impact models such as hydrological or crop models forced with corrected climate input data from global climate models a range of downscaling and bias correction methods have been developed to increase the spatial resolution and remove systematic biases in climate model outputs to be applied before use in impact models many studies have focused on evaluating such approaches for the climate variables they aim to correct however due to nonlinear error propagation there can be large remaining biases in model outputs even when ingesting bias corrected climate forcings here we propose an impact centric evaluation framework for downscaling and bias correction methods to be used in climate change risk assessments this framework evaluates and compares the strengths and limitations of downscaling and bias correction in the impact domain highlighting approaches that lead to reduced biases in impact variables of interest we demonstrate the evaluation framework in the context of assessing downscaling and bias correction methods for hydrological projections in australia our results show that although all downscaling and bias correction methods evaluated perform adequately for the input climate variables their errors vary markedly when the impact is modelled our proposed evaluation framework involves selecting a number of key performance metrics and ranking the four downscaling and bias correction methods to compute an overall ranking highlighting the best performing methods for each statistical metric and the overall best performing approach we present an application of this approach using performance metrics relevant to hydrological applications relating to mean biases variability heavy precipitation and peak runoff days and dry conditions for impact studies related to hydrological applications we find that multi variate bias correction that considers cross correlations temporal auto correlations and biases at multiple time scales daily to annual performs best in reducing biases in hydrological output variables for australia our proposed evaluation approach can be applied to a wide range of climate change applications where downscaling and bias correction are required including impacts on agricultural production wildfires energy generation human health ecosystem functioning and water resource management keywords downscaling bias correction climate change impacts hydrological projections water resources evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change risk assessments commonly use impact models such as hydrological agricultural or wildfire risk models these are typically forced with corrected climate inputs from global climate models gcms e g climate models of the coupled model intercomparison project e g cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and cmip6 eyring et al 2016 climate model outputs can exhibit biases for example due to parameterisations and missing or incomplete representation of physical or biological processes di luca et al 2020 hyder et al 2018 richter 2015 additionally the resolution of climate model outputs is generally coarser i e at the scale of several 100 km2 than what is needed for use in impact models i e a local scale of several km2 downscaling and bias correction methods are required to increase the spatial resolution of the climate model outputs and remove any systematic biases before use in impact models ekström et al 2015 maraun and widmann 2018 downscaling means inferring local scale climate information from large scale climate which might include taking into account local features such as topography or coastlines bias correction refers to the adjustment of raw model outputs to remove biases in summary statistics at a given location such as the mean and variance and potentially other statistics depending on the method compared to observation based data maraun 2016 downscaling methods include statistical and dynamical approaches statistical downscaling is based on identifying relationships between large scale climate drivers and local scale climate large scale climate drivers simulated by gcms are then used as predictors in statistical models to infer local climate variables for example analogue downscaling pierce et al 2014 timbal et al 2008 turco et al 2017 dynamical downscaling uses regional climate models rcm at high resolution forced with boundary conditions from the driving gcm giorgi and gutowski 2015 xu et al 2019 bias correction methods vary in complexity and include simpler approaches such as linear scaling and more complex methods including empirical and parametric quantile mapping gudmundsson et al 2012 gutjahr and heinemann 2013 reviews of existing downscaling and bias correction methods are provided by maraun 2016 and maraun and widmann 2018 many previous studies have compared and assessed bias correction and downscaling methods for the climate variables they are aiming to correct e g precipitation temperature benestad et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2018 ji et al 2020 langousis et al 2016 maraun et al 2018 räty et al 2014 schmidli et al 2007 previous studies evaluating bias correction and downscaling methods can be classified across two dimensions as shown in table 1 i was the evaluation done in the climate domain i e for post processed gcm outputs categories a and b or in the impacts domain i e focusing on impact model outputs driven by gcm inputs categories c and d and ii was the evaluation focused on a single target variable univariate evaluation categories a and c or a range of connected variables multivariate evaluation categories b and d these approaches range from simpler evaluations category a focusing on individual climate variables e g rainfall to more complex evaluation methods category d evaluations for multiple connected impact variables we find that the majority of evaluations of bias correction and downscaling methods are done in the climate domain categories a and b e g dosio and paruolo 2011 räty et al 2014 terink et al 2010 watanabe et al 2012 while fewer studies assess these methods in the impact domain categories c and d e g fang et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 however climate risk assessments that aim to translate future climate changes into impact information require impact modelling such as statistical or process based modelling therefore they rely on bias correction and downscaling methods that preserve statistics critical for the selected impacts modelling approach for example to understand the risk of severe multiannual drought under future climate change it is essential to preserve cross correlations and the interannual and multiannual variability of precipitation and other hydro climate drivers including temperature solar radiation and wind speed several studies do attempt to examine the influence of bias correction and downscaling methods on derived impacts e g hydrology charles et al 2020 chiew et al 2010 gutmann et al 2014 muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2012 agriculture bakker et al 2014 hawkins et al 2013 ines and hansen 2006 energy generation costoya et al 2020 frank et al 2018 but evaluation approaches vary considerably between studies and as stated are rarely performed or evaluated comprehensively here synthesising existing approaches we develop an impacts centric evaluation framework to assess downscaling and bias correction methods for impact assessment ensuring future climate change impact studies are based upon robust evaluation we demonstrate the approach by evaluating the influence of three statistical bias correction methods and one combined dynamical downscaling and bias correction method on hydrological projections for australia using local high resolution climate data and a hydrological model calibrated for the australian continent we outline the strengths and limitations of different methods and inform the appropriate use of these methods for australia while highlighting lessons learnt that can be transferable to impact studies more globally section 2 outlines the proposed evaluation framework section 3 presents the climate forcing data including bias correction and downscaling methods and the hydrological model that underpins the impact simulations section 4 details the evaluation applied to the hydrological outputs and section 5 presents the results and discussion of the evaluation followed by conclusions in section 6 2 evaluation of downscaling and bias correction approaches for climate impact studies we propose an impacts centric evaluation framework that focuses the assessment on the impact domain by identifying downscaling and bias correction methods that minimise biases in impacts across a range of variables key statistical domains and temporal and regional aggregations this approach which falls into category d in table 1 presents an objective framework to evaluate and select downscaling and bias correction methods for climate impact studies the approach is summarised in fig 1 section s 1 1 in the supplement includes a detailed step by step description the framework consists of three parts first a user selects the climate data including historical observations and climate model data and the bias correction and downscaling methods next an impact model is driven using historical observations and climate model based data to produce a historical reference simulation and gcm based impact simulations third the downscaling and bias correction methods are evaluated in the impacts modelling space i e a comparison of gcm based impact simulations against a historical reference simulation for selected evaluation metrics spatial and temporal scales is performed finally the different bias correction and downscaling methods are ranked in terms of their individual biases for each metric and an overall ranking is calculated we use the same validation period as the period used for calibrating the bias correction methods to avoid introducing any biases from selecting a different calibration and validation period as the impact modelling outputs are not directly calibrated by the downscaling or bias correction method they can be considered out of sample for the purpose of evaluation hereby we focus on the effect of the bias correction methods on the modelled impact variables as opposed to evaluating the climate inputs we emphasise that our framework should not replace existing evaluation of bias correction and downscaling methods focused on climate model outputs using split sample approaches e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 categories a and b in table 1 instead it should be seen as complementary adding an additional layer of information on the suitability of these methods for impact modelling 3 data we demonstrate the proposed impacts centric evaluation framework for hydrological impacts assessment using a case of hydrological projections for australia the australian bureau of meteorology bom in partnership with the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and australian universities has led the development of the national hydrological projections nhp service that provides nationally consistent high resolution projections of climate change impacts on water resources across australia wilson et al 2022 this includes an ensemble of application ready bias corrected and downscaled cmip5 climate model data based on three statistical bias correction methods and one combined downscaling and bias correction approach and hydrological simulations using the bom s operational continental scale landscape water balance model awra l we evaluate the bias correction and downscaling methods that underpin the nhp service focusing on their suitability for hydrological impact assessments the following sections describe the climate data underpinning the nhp service including bias corrected and downscaled climate forcings section 3 1 followed by a description of the impact simulations using the hydrological model awra l section 3 2 3 1 climate data 3 1 1 historical climate observations historical climate observations were used 1 as a target dataset for the bias correction methods section 3 1 2 and 2 as input into the historical hydrological simulation to be used as a reference for the evaluation section 3 2 2 daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature data were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology s australian gridded climate dataset agcd version 1 previously known as awap dataset jones et al 2009 this dataset is built by interpolating station based data onto a 0 05 x 0 05 grid using a combination of the barnes successive correction method and three dimensional smoothing splines jones et al 2009 remotely sensed daily solar radiation data grant et al 2008 and daily average wind speed data derived from station based 2 m wind speed observations available on the same 0 05 x 0 05 grid mcvicar et al 2008 were also used in remote regions of the continent especially in parts of western australia the rainfall observations network and other weather variables are very sparse or lacking entirely reliable interpolation of observations cannot be done in these locations therefore grid cells for these regions have been masked and excluded when calculating regional averages of evaluation metrics for the downscaling and bias correction methods see white areas in fig 3 3 1 2 downscaled and bias corrected climate data four gcms of the 5th phase of the climate model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 were downscaled and bias corrected these four gcms were selected based on 1 the ability of the models to reproduce climate features important in australia moise et al 2015 2 representing the range of gcm uncertainty in future projections i e models with varying climate sensitivity and diverging projections of rainfall changes wetter and drier models and 3 the availability of all climate variables needed to force the bureau of meteorology s hydrological model awra l

watanabe et al 2010 three statistical bias correction methods isimip2b qme and mrnbc were applied to the raw gcm data additionally dynamically downscaled climate data based on the conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam model mcgregor and dix 2008 were bias corrected using the isimip2b method this resulted in three statistical bias correction approaches and one combined downscaling and bias correction approach srikanthan et al 2022 wilson et al 2022 which are outlined in the following see also table 2 for further details these downscaling and bias correction methods were selected as they are published and established methods which have been used in a wide number of climate change impact studies csiro and bom 2021 dowdy 2019 2020 dowdy et al 2021 frieler et al 2017 hempel et al 2013

a parametric quantile matching method an additive correction is applied for temperature whereas a multiplicative correction is applied for all other variables the isimip2b method was applied to daily scale anomalies for each month of the year separately further details on the isimip2b method can be found in hempel et al 2013 qme bias correction for climate extremes the quantile matching for extremes qme method is an empirical quantile mapping based bias correction method focused on correcting values that are rarely observed including in a changing background climate dowdy 2019 2020 the top and bottom five values are averaged and used to correct the bias in high and low values respectively between the model and the reference data by considering at least five observations the qme method aims to derive more robust correction factors for high and low values the qme method was applied to daily values for each 3 month season december february djf mar may mam june august jja

isimip2b dynamical downscaling and statistical bias correction the conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam mcgregor and dix 2008 regional climate model was used to dynamically downscale projections of the four cmip5 gcms listed in the previous section ccam is a global atmosphere only climate model with a stretched grid with high resolution over australia and broader resolution in other regions ccam simulates atmospheric variables over australia on a 50 km grid using bias corrected sea surface temperatures ssts from the host gcm as inputs clarke et al 2019 hoffmann et al 2016 ccam outputs were bias corrected using one of the bias correction methods isimip2b the outputs of this combined downscaling and bias correction approach are in the following sections referred to as ccam isimip2b before applying bias correction the gcm and rcm outputs were regridded to match the resolution of the observational dataset regridding was done using conservative remapping using the climate data operators cdo https www mpimet mpg de cdo remapcon function the calibration of the bias correction methods was done using the historical baseline period 1976 2005 30 year reference periods are commonly used by the world meteorological organization and in climate change studies to represent baseline climate wmo 2021 one exception is the qme bias correction method due to its focus on extremes this method included more recent observations to capture recent temperature extremes and hence a longer calibration period 1975 2017 was used for the calibration using the qme method gcm outputs for 1975 2005 from the historical simulations and outputs for 2006 2017 from one of the emission scenarios representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 were combined prior to the application of the bias correction method given that gcm projections for different rcps generally do not diverge until after 2030 e g rauniyar and power 2020 we do not expect the rcp selection which rcp to use for the years 2006 2017 for qme to have any influence on the results presented here in the remainder of this paper the term ensemble member defines a combination of gcm and downscaling bias correction method the nhp dataset consists of 16 ensemble members four gcms combined with four downscaling bias correction methods 3 2 impact model 3 2 1 the hydrological model awra l hydrological simulations were produced using the

frost and wright 2018 awra l has been shown to perform well for a wide range of water balance variables at observation sites across the country holgate et al 2016 khan et al 2020 and to reproduce historical hydrological trends wasko et al 2021 a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the most influential model parameters on the simulated hydrological outputs is presented in azarnivand et al 2022 3 2 2 historical reference simulation a historical awra l reference simulation was prepared using observed climate inputs rainfall minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and 2 m wind speeds section 3 1 1 as inputs this reference simulation is used as a comparison dataset to evaluate the hydrological simulations based on downscaled and bias corrected gcm outputs section 3 2 3 3 2 3 gcm based hydrological simulations awra l was forced with downscaled and bias corrected climate outputs of the four gcms access1 0 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m and miroc5 see section 3 1 2 for details the awra l simulations were run for the period 1960 2005 using outputs of the historical gcm simulations run for the same period awra l was initialised using initial states for 31 dec 1959 from the awra l historical reference run which is forced with observed climate inputs section 3 1 1 for the qme method additional simulations covering the years 2006 2017 were forced with qme bias corrected outputs details in section 3 1 2 the evaluation period for all performance metrics starts in 1976 hence the spin up period of the awra l model forced with gcm inputs has a length of 16 years 1 jan 1960 to 31 dec 1975 4 evaluation the gcm forced hydrological simulations were compared against the historical reference simulation to evaluate the downscaling and bias correction methods the evaluation period was the same as the calibration period 1976 2005 for all methods but longer for qme 1975 2017 see section 3 1 2 the main analyses presented in this paper focus on variables relevant to hydrological impact assessments 1 precipitation based on the downscaled and bias corrected climate forcings section 3 1 2 2 potential evapotranspiration 3 root zone soil moisture and 4 runoff using awra l outputs section 3 2 3 to better understand differences in the bias correction and downscaling methods additional evaluation was done for all climate forcings and are briefly presented in section 5 6 a full description of the methods underpinning the climate focused evaluation is presented in section s 1 2 in the supplement 4 1 performance metrics in the development of the hydrological projections service potential use cases were identified through interviews with a wide range of stakeholders this process identified indices representing the mean hydrological change and hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts as particularly critical thus the following performance metrics representing mean conditions variability heavy rainfall and peak runoff days as well as dry conditions were selected in our evaluation mean bias the mean bias represents biases in mean climate and hydrological conditions annual and seasonal averages first the average of annual and seasonal mean values for soil moisture or totals for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff was calculated for the evaluation period subsequently the bias was computed as the difference between each ensemble member and the historical reference the relative bias was calculated as the difference or bias relative to the climatological mean in the historical reference the bias was obtained from annual and seasonal for 3 monthly seasons djf mam jja son values climatology the monthly climatology was calculated as the average of monthly values mean for root zone soil moisture and sum for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff over the evaluation period the bias was calculated as the difference between the climatology of the historical reference and each ensemble member interannual and multi year variability the interannual variability was calculated as the standard deviation of annual values mean for root zone soil moisture annual total for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff over the evaluation period in addition to the interannual variability the multiannual variability at 2 to 5 year time scales was computed to assess low frequency variability biases we first computed a 2 to 5 year moving average of the annual values and subsequently calculated the standard deviation of annual smoothed values heavy rainfall and peak runoff days to evaluate the magnitude of heavy rainfall and peak runoff days we calculated the 5 year maximum value of daily precipitation and runoff values calculated using a 5 year resampled time series using a non overlapping moving window subsequently the average of the 5 year maximum over the evaluation period was calculated dry conditions to assess the magnitude of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts we calculated the minimum of annual precipitation soil moisture and runoff over the evaluation period as a deviation from the climatological mean equally we calculated the minimum over the evaluation period from 2 to 5 year averaged values using 2 to 5 year moving averages as a deviation from the long term mean to evaluate the magnitude of multi annual droughts all evaluation metrics used here are based on summary statistics this is due to the fact that the historical time series of global climate models are not synchronous with observations and evaluation approaches typically used in forecast verification or model validation such as a pairwise comparison of modelled and observed daily values are not applicable and the assessment of bias correction generally focuses on summary statistics maraun 2016 to aid the interpretation of mean biases at the grid cell and nrm regional scale we applied significance testing using bootstrapping see section s 1 3 in the supplement for details the biases in all metrics outlined above were calculated at grid cell scale as well as regional scale using eight natural resources management nrm clusters and an australia wide aggregation the nrm clusters are eco climatic zones characterised by unique geography and hydroclimate fig 2 a further description of the ecosystems and characteristics of the nrm clusters can be found in chapter 2 of csiro and bom 2015 4 2 ranking of downscaling and bias correction methods we calculated the mean bias for each combination of 1 variable 2 performance metric 3 spatial aggregation and 4 temporal aggregation as well as for each ensemble member resulting in 29 376 bias values the 16 ensemble members were then ranked in terms of their absolute bias positive or negative deviation from zero starting with the lowest rank 1 for the smallest bias through to the largest rank 16 for the largest bias for each performance area the average rank was calculated for each bias correction downscaling method over all variables spatial and regional scales and gcms the method with the lowest average ranking was considered strongest in this performance area finally the overall best performing method was identified by calculating the average ranking across all performance areas using equal weights 5 results and discussion 5 1 mean bias fig 3 presents maps of mean biases between key water balance variables precipitation potential evapotranspiration root zone soil moisture and runoff across australia for one of the gcms access1 0 mean biases at the regional scale for australia and nrm regions are presented in fig 4 for further details see section s 2 1 in the supplement for bias maps for all gcms section s 2 2 for the significance maps of the bias and section s 2 3 for biases of gcm and rcm precipitation outputs before and after bias correction all downscaling and bias correction methods succeed in removing biases in precipitation which was directly bias corrected with resulting bias close to zero fig 4 the largest but not significant biases are found for mrnbc which corrects all variables jointly in a multi variate approach and hence the correction of other variables influences rainfall due to this there is a small remaining bias in precipitation despite it being one of the input variables that have been directly corrected the mean relative bias in rainfall at nrm regional scale is within 1 5 across most regions and gcms except for access1 0 bias corrected using isimip2b in the wet tropics where the average bias is 3 this is due to an upper limit in the daily precipitation amount of 400 mm implemented in the isimip2b method which fails in the region around mount bellenden ker and tully in north queensland this region is the wettest in australia and regularly experiences daily rainfall amounts exceeding 400 mm leading to strong negative biases biases in potential evapotranspiration are equally small with regional biases within 2 for all nrm regions except for gfdl esm2m bias corrected using isimip2b in the east coast and wet tropics potential evapotranspiration is computed from daily minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and wind speeds which are all directly corrected we note that prior to applying gcm forcing to impact models this is where most studies terminate their evaluation of their downscaling and bias correction methods if we were to do this here we would conclude that all the bias correction methods are equally suitable to hydrological impact studies with mrnbc exhibiting largest biases while the remaining bias in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration which are both closely linked to gcm outputs are overall small the biases in root zone soil moisture and runoff are greater and more variable between regions gcms and downscaling and bias correction methods the mean bias in root zone soil moisture ranges between 8 across nrm regions fig 4 the most considerable variations in soil moisture biases can be found for isimip2b and qme while the magnitude of biases is greatly reduced for the mrnbc method and in some regions for ccam isimip2b however all biases at the nrm regional scale in soil moisture were found to be insignificant at the p 0 05 level fig 4 and less than 2 of grid cells have significant biases across all ensemble members fig s11 in the supplement biases in runoff which is the impact variable of greatest interest for assessing future flooding risks are overall largest with average biases at nrm regional scale within 45 except for gfdl esm2m bias corrected using isimip2b and qme for the central slope region while the relative biases in runoff appear great the relative bias values for runoff tend to be inflated due to 1 low average runoff in dry inland regions and 2 a large variability in runoff compared to other variables less than 10 of land areas show a significant bias for mrnbc for all gcms and for qme except for gfdl esm2m see fig s12 in the supplement the biases in runoff at the nrm regional scale are not significant for mrnbc for all regions and gcms for qme except for some regions with gfdl esm2m and ccam isimip2b except for the dry rangelands cluster overall we found the largest bias magnitude and most significant biases for the isimip2b method this may be due to multiple statistical aspects in relation to the climate forcings that are not well represented in the isimip2b outputs including the wet day frequency the number of days with at least 1 mm of rainfall interannual variability and extreme percentiles table 3 the variability and magnitude of biases in hydrological outputs are generally the smallest in the mrnbc outputs despite being greater for the inputs in addition dynamical downscaling appears to reduce the variability and magnitude of biases in hydrological outputs especially runoff when comparing the bias for isimip2b applied directly to raw gcm outputs and isimip2b applied to dynamically downscaled outputs using ccam the range of runoff bias for australia is within 20 for isimip2b and within 5 for ccam isimip2b ccam overrides the gcm signal to some extent bringing the results from the four gcms closer together which in turn may also reduce variations in biases between gcms overall we find that while biases in climate forcings are close to zero for all methods there are considerable differences in the ability of the methods to reduce biases in water balance variables the differences between methods are minor for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration however the downscaling and bias correction methods have a more significant influence on biases for soil moisture and runoff the mrnbc method which corrects biases across multiple time scales and considers cross correlations and temporal autocorrelation led to strongest reductions in biases and the least significant biases in hydrological outputs this was followed by dynamical downscaling and subsequent univariate bias correction ccam isimip2b with the exception of runoff in the rangelands cluster this conclusion is different if the ranking of performance was solely based on the input variables that is precipitation and pet 5 2 climatology bias fig 5 presents the australia averaged climatology in the historical reference compared against the climatology obtained using downscaled and bias corrected gcm data for further details see fig s17 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm rainfall biases the climatologies for precipitation and pet top two rows overlap well with the historical references for all ensemble members except for some variations for precipitation bias corrected using qme the qme method has been applied at the seasonal scale i e days within each three month season were combined in the quantile mapping approach whereas isimip2b and mrnbc apply bias correction for each month of the year separately the application at the seasonal scale in the qme method was chosen to triple the sample size for a better representation of rare events due to this the rainfall biases at the monthly scale in isimip2b mrnbc and ccam isimip2b are smaller than for qme highlighting the importance of considering the time scale at which bias correction is applied when focusing on hydrological impact assessments the qme method does not strictly have to be applied at the seasonal scale hence future applications of this method could use a monthly time scale to reduce biases in monthly climatologies after careful assessment of impacts on the representation of rare high impact events the biases in soil moisture are overall small and the mean climatology follows the historical reference for all ensemble members runoff shows the most prominent deviations from the historical reference in december to march i e during the wet season in the monsoon dominated northern parts of australia here biases are most considerable for isimip2b and qme with an under or overestimation of runoff depending on the gcm ccam isimip2b runoff is closer to the historical reference although there is a slight underestimation of runoff during the wet season across all host gcms for mrnbc runoff closely follows the climatology of the historical reference and the biases are small for all months of the year these results suggest that even with low biases in climate forcings particularly rainfall systematic biases in the sequencing and temporal auto correlation of rainfall within the bias corrected climate data can lead to large errors in the runoff outputs 5 3 interannual and multi annual variability bias fig 6 a and b present the bias in interannual variability precipitation and runoff after downscaling and bias correction fig s18 in the supplement presents the raw gcm and rcm biases in interannual variability the most prominent biases in the interannual variability of rainfall can be found for cnrm cm5 and gfdl esm2m in isimip2b and qme and miroc5 in the isimip2b data fig 6a mrnbc appears to reduce the bias in interannual variability most of all methods followed by ccam which reduces the magnitude of mean bias overall but also imprints a new spatial pattern of bias consistent across host gcms fig 6a for runoff the biases under or overestimation are similar to those of rainfall but the influence of downscaling and bias correction is less clear than for precipitation for applications in water resources management such as management of urban and regional water supply or agricultural management variability at longer time scales spanning multiple years plays an important role for example if the interannual variability at multi year time scales is high we may see multiple consecutive wet or dry years leading to potentially more damaging impacts on agriculture and water management therefore reproducing realistic multiannual variability is of importance to many end users and applications such as dam operations and agricultural management fig 7 presents the interannual variability at 1 to 5 year time scales for the historical reference simulation and all ensemble members for further information see fig s19 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm biases in interannual variability the bias in multi year variability 2 to 5 years for rainfall is consistent with the bias at the 1 year time scale for all methods the only exception is ccam isimip2b which shows decreasing bias in variability at longer time scales this suggests that the regional climate model reproduces realistic statistical patterns of variability at multi year time scales possibly due to an improved representation of large scale teleconnections e g spatial rainfall patterns associated with enso while the bias in precipitation variability is low for ccam it does not translate into low biases in multiannual variability in runoff highlighting the difficulty of reproducing higher order statistical features of hydrological output variables using downscaling and bias correction when comparing the three statistical bias correction methods the most considerable differences are found for gfdl esm2m for this gcm the interannual variability is strongly overestimated in isimip2b and qme which follows raw gcm outputs see fig s18 in the supplement but matches well with observations in mrnbc figs 6 and 7 for the other three gcms we see an underestimation of interannual and multiannual variability across all three bias correction methods and no difference between bias correction methods the overall pattern of bias in rainfall translates into similar biases in multiannual variability for runoff fig 7 there is a large spread of bias in isimip2b and qme across the different gcms and a somewhat reduced bias in mrnbc however at longer time scales 5 year variability mrnbc underestimates the variability for all gcms 5 4 bias in heavy rainfall and peak runoff days fig 8 presents the bias of the 5 year maximum rainfall and runoff averaged over the evaluation period using a 5 year moving window for the 5 year maximum values for each ensemble member and region for further details see fig s20 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm biases in heavy precipitation isimip2b mrnbc and ccam isimip2b show considerable variation in biases while qme shows the smallest biases for heavy precipitation days however translated into runoff biases in 5 year maximum runoff are most reduced in the mrnbc method suggesting that other factors such as temporal auto correlation patterns and variable cross correlations play an essential role in reducing biases in runoff including peak runoff events 5 5 bias in dry conditions to assess the magnitude of drought at multiple time scales annual to 5 year multiannual drought we calculated the minimum of 1 to 5 year precipitation soil moisture and runoff averaged values and compared it against the long term average in other words we assessed how dry was the driest 1 to 5 year period relative to average precipitation soil moisture and runoff in the observations and downscaled bias corrected data in terms of precipitation most of the bias corrected data align well with the observations fig 9 see fig s21 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm biases in meteorological drought the exception is gfdl esm2m which shows an overestimation of drought severity at 1 to 5 year time scales as indicated by underestimated minimum 1 to 5 year total precipitation mrnbc reduces this underestimation to some extent in line with a correction of the interannual variability of gfdl esm2m as seen in figs 6 and 7 the dynamically downscaled and bias corrected data ccam isimip2b also shows strong alignment with observations except for a slight overestimation of drought magnitude for access1 0 and cnrm cm5 regarding soil moisture and runoff the patterns are similar to precipitation indicating that biases in meteorological drought translate into biases in agricultural and hydrological drought mrnbc and ccam isimip2b reproduce observed patterns best whereas for isimip2b and qme the overestimation in precipitation drought for gfdl esm2m is visible in the soil moisture and runoff drought patterns as well in terms of longer term drought e g 4 to 5 year drought ccam isimip2b produces the most realistic patterns for all drought types and mrnbc for runoff drought 5 6 overall performance in sections 5 1 5 5 we compared the performance of four downscaling and bias correction approaches for correcting the mean and variability in key hydrological variables for different regions and spatial and temporal aggregations to perform a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the various approaches and to identify key strengths and limitations of the four methods the bias in 15 statistical features was calculated nine related to the climate forcings and six related to the hydrological outputs this was done for all possible combinations of 1 variables in climate inputs or hydrological outputs 2 regional aggregation for australia wide as well as each nrm region and 3 temporal aggregation such as annually for each season and where applicable for each month table 3 presents the average rank over all combinations for each performance area the lowest average rank per row highlighted in green suggests the given downscaling and bias correction method overall performs best for the statistical feature in contrast the highest average rank highlighted in orange suggests there is potential for improvement in this statistical feature for a given downscaling bias correction approach for a detailed description of the statistical features computed for this extended performance table see section s 1 1 and table s1 in the supplement we find that ccam isimip2b performs best in reducing biases in the mean and climatology of the climate forcings and the key strength of the qme method is to reduce biases in representing 5 year maxima higher order statistics related to temporal patterns e g interannual variability temporal auto correlation multiannual drought and wet day frequency as well as variable cross correlations are best represented using the mrnbc method table 3 regarding the hydrological outputs the mrnbc method outperforms the other methods across all dimensions this highlights the importance of considering temporal correlation and variability and cross correlation patterns for producing realistic hydrological outputs that can be used in hydrological impact studies one crucial aspect to consider in climate change impact studies is to which degree downscaling and bias correction methods modulate the future climate change signal that is projected by the gcm maraun 2016 for example overfitting the training data in the historical period may lead to implausible future trends here we assessed the adjustment of the climate change signal by comparing the raw gcm change signal relative for precipitation absolute for temperature with the change signal in the downscaled and bias corrected data the mrnbc method is identified as the most trend preserving approach by contrast ccam isimip2b due to the regional climate model imprinting its own climate change signal on top of the gcm signal shows the largest deviation between gcm and downscaled bias corrected trend see row 10 change signal in table 3 however it should be noted that gcms cannot simulate many key physical processes e g rain bearing phenomena such as thunderstorms and therefore preserving the trends from gcms may not be desirable depending on the application if a calibration method or downscaling results in a different trend from their host gcm this may be considered a form of realised added value e g di virgilio et al 2020 5 7 key recommendations for impact studies we presented an evaluation framework to assess bias correction and downscaling methods for use in climate change impact studies and demonstrated the approach for hydrological projections for australia this framework is flexible and can be applied to other impact domains such as wildfire risk projections impacts of climate change on human health infrastructure ecosystems or energy systems the steps would follow the same as outlined in this study 1 selection of an impact model that was comprehensively evaluated and adequately describes the impacts associated with a range of climate conditions e g an ecological model 2 application of multiple downscaling or bias correction methods to gcm outputs using suitable historical climate observations or reanalysis data or identification of existing downscaled bias corrected data for the region of interest 3 impact simulations using historical climate observations and downscaled or bias corrected gcm data 4 evaluation of the impact simulations using appropriate evaluation metrics at multiple temporal and spatial scales relevant to the impact domain 5 ranking of the different downscaling and bias correction methods and identification of overall best performing method see also fig 1 the selection of evaluation metrics and temporal and spatial scales of relevance is ideally based on engagement with stakeholders who will be users of climate change impact projections in this evaluation we assessed four downscaling and bias correction approaches using a selection of performance metrics that aimed to capture a variety of statistical features relevant to a range of hydrological applications particularly mean biases biases in variability peak rainfall runoff days and severe dry conditions however more detailed evaluation could include methods applied in flood risk studies for example based on extreme value distributions or using drought indices such as drought duration frequency and severity moving beyond evaluations based on individual statistical metrics such as mean and variability future research could assess the suitability of bias correction across the whole probability distribution using bias metrics computed in the probability frequency domain e g emmanouil et al 2021 perkins et al 2007 there are also many potential avenues to refine and improve the evaluation framework our proposed evaluation framework assumes stationary biases unaffected by climate change trends however with changes in future temperature and hydrological regimes biases may vary and the performance of bias correction will change a pseudo reality approach also called perfect predictor or perfect sibling approach could be applied to assess the non stationarity of biases and evaluate downscaling and bias correction methods under changing climate conditions gutiérrez et al 2018 maraun et al 2018 2017 navarro racines et al 2020 schmith et al 2021 model structural uncertainty is an important source of uncertainty in climate impact projections and in our evaluation framework the results of the evaluation and associated ranking in bias correction and downscaling methods may be influenced by the choice of impact model future research could assess the sensitivity of the evaluation results to model selection using a number of hydrological models moving beyond the evaluation framework the results presented here have large implications for future hydrological impact studies in terms of downscaling and bias correction the key findings are 1 bias correction that removes biases in the mean variability and temporal autocorrelation and variable cross correlations performs best in reducing biases in hydrological modelling outputs that underpin hydrological impact studies 2 bias correction applied at multiple time scales such as daily monthly and annual produces realistic hydrological outputs while capturing low frequency variability i e multi year variability and droughts which is of importance for many hydrological impacts e g on water resources and agricultural management 3 removing mean biases in climate forcings does not automatically lead to low biases in hydrological output variables due to for example biases in the sequencing of precipitation events cross correlations and biases in variability see also points 1 and 2 4 hydrological impact studies as well as impact studies in other domains require an evaluation of downscaling and bias correction for the target variables of interest at the spatial and temporal time scale of interest 6 conclusions downscaling and bias correction methods are critical components in climate change impact studies however previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of such approaches in correcting climate variables while the effect on impact simulations was generally less investigated in this study we introduced an impacts centric evaluation framework for downscaling and bias correction methods that evaluates the performance in the impact space we demonstrated the approach for evaluating downscaling and bias correction methods for hydrological impact studies in australia we outlined key strengths and limitations for all selected methods based on a selection of performance metrics we find that bias correction that considers cross correlations between climate drivers temporal autocorrelations and biases at multiple time scales performs best in reducing biases in hydrological variables such as soil moisture and runoff our proposed evaluation approach can be applied to a wide range of climate change impact studies where downscaling and bias correction is required such as agricultural production wildfire risks energy generation human health ecosystem functioning

1830,climate change impact studies commonly use impact models such as hydrological or crop models forced with corrected climate input data from global climate models a range of downscaling and bias correction methods have been developed to increase the spatial resolution and remove systematic biases in climate model outputs to be applied before use in impact models many studies have focused on evaluating such approaches for the climate variables they aim to correct however due to nonlinear error propagation there can be large remaining biases in model outputs even when ingesting bias corrected climate forcings here we propose an impact centric evaluation framework for downscaling and bias correction methods to be used in climate change risk assessments this framework evaluates and compares the strengths and limitations of downscaling and bias correction in the impact domain highlighting approaches that lead to reduced biases in impact variables of interest we demonstrate the evaluation framework in the context of assessing downscaling and bias correction methods for hydrological projections in australia our results show that although all downscaling and bias correction methods evaluated perform adequately for the input climate variables their errors vary markedly when the impact is modelled our proposed evaluation framework involves selecting a number of key performance metrics and ranking the four downscaling and bias correction methods to compute an overall ranking highlighting the best performing methods for each statistical metric and the overall best performing approach we present an application of this approach using performance metrics relevant to hydrological applications relating to mean biases variability heavy precipitation and peak runoff days and dry conditions for impact studies related to hydrological applications we find that multi variate bias correction that considers cross correlations temporal auto correlations and biases at multiple time scales daily to annual performs best in reducing biases in hydrological output variables for australia our proposed evaluation approach can be applied to a wide range of climate change applications where downscaling and bias correction are required including impacts on agricultural production wildfires energy generation human health ecosystem functioning and water resource management keywords downscaling bias correction climate change impacts hydrological projections water resources evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change risk assessments commonly use impact models such as hydrological agricultural or wildfire risk models these are typically forced with corrected climate inputs from global climate models gcms e g climate models of the coupled model intercomparison project e g cmip5 taylor et al 2012 and cmip6 eyring et al 2016 climate model outputs can exhibit biases for example due to parameterisations and missing or incomplete representation of physical or biological processes di luca et al 2020 hyder et al 2018 richter 2015 additionally the resolution of climate model outputs is generally coarser i e at the scale of several 100 km2 than what is needed for use in impact models i e a local scale of several km2 downscaling and bias correction methods are required to increase the spatial resolution of the climate model outputs and remove any systematic biases before use in impact models ekström et al 2015 maraun and widmann 2018 downscaling means inferring local scale climate information from large scale climate which might include taking into account local features such as topography or coastlines bias correction refers to the adjustment of raw model outputs to remove biases in summary statistics at a given location such as the mean and variance and potentially other statistics depending on the method compared to observation based data maraun 2016 downscaling methods include statistical and dynamical approaches statistical downscaling is based on identifying relationships between large scale climate drivers and local scale climate large scale climate drivers simulated by gcms are then used as predictors in statistical models to infer local climate variables for example analogue downscaling pierce et al 2014 timbal et al 2008 turco et al 2017 dynamical downscaling uses regional climate models rcm at high resolution forced with boundary conditions from the driving gcm giorgi and gutowski 2015 xu et al 2019 bias correction methods vary in complexity and include simpler approaches such as linear scaling and more complex methods including empirical and parametric quantile mapping gudmundsson et al 2012 gutjahr and heinemann 2013 reviews of existing downscaling and bias correction methods are provided by maraun 2016 and maraun and widmann 2018 many previous studies have compared and assessed bias correction and downscaling methods for the climate variables they are aiming to correct e g precipitation temperature benestad et al 2007 gutiérrez et al 2018 ji et al 2020 langousis et al 2016 maraun et al 2018 räty et al 2014 schmidli et al 2007 previous studies evaluating bias correction and downscaling methods can be classified across two dimensions as shown in table 1 i was the evaluation done in the climate domain i e for post processed gcm outputs categories a and b or in the impacts domain i e focusing on impact model outputs driven by gcm inputs categories c and d and ii was the evaluation focused on a single target variable univariate evaluation categories a and c or a range of connected variables multivariate evaluation categories b and d these approaches range from simpler evaluations category a focusing on individual climate variables e g rainfall to more complex evaluation methods category d evaluations for multiple connected impact variables we find that the majority of evaluations of bias correction and downscaling methods are done in the climate domain categories a and b e g dosio and paruolo 2011 räty et al 2014 terink et al 2010 watanabe et al 2012 while fewer studies assess these methods in the impact domain categories c and d e g fang et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 however climate risk assessments that aim to translate future climate changes into impact information require impact modelling such as statistical or process based modelling therefore they rely on bias correction and downscaling methods that preserve statistics critical for the selected impacts modelling approach for example to understand the risk of severe multiannual drought under future climate change it is essential to preserve cross correlations and the interannual and multiannual variability of precipitation and other hydro climate drivers including temperature solar radiation and wind speed several studies do attempt to examine the influence of bias correction and downscaling methods on derived impacts e g hydrology charles et al 2020 chiew et al 2010 gutmann et al 2014 muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2012 agriculture bakker et al 2014 hawkins et al 2013 ines and hansen 2006 energy generation costoya et al 2020 frank et al 2018 but evaluation approaches vary considerably between studies and as stated are rarely performed or evaluated comprehensively here synthesising existing approaches we develop an impacts centric evaluation framework to assess downscaling and bias correction methods for impact assessment ensuring future climate change impact studies are based upon robust evaluation we demonstrate the approach by evaluating the influence of three statistical bias correction methods and one combined dynamical downscaling and bias correction method on hydrological projections for australia using local high resolution climate data and a hydrological model calibrated for the australian continent we outline the strengths and limitations of different methods and inform the appropriate use of these methods for australia while highlighting lessons learnt that can be transferable to impact studies more globally section 2 outlines the proposed evaluation framework section 3 presents the climate forcing data including bias correction and downscaling methods and the hydrological model that underpins the impact simulations section 4 details the evaluation applied to the hydrological outputs and section 5 presents the results and discussion of the evaluation followed by conclusions in section 6 2 evaluation of downscaling and bias correction approaches for climate impact studies we propose an impacts centric evaluation framework that focuses the assessment on the impact domain by identifying downscaling and bias correction methods that minimise biases in impacts across a range of variables key statistical domains and temporal and regional aggregations this approach which falls into category d in table 1 presents an objective framework to evaluate and select downscaling and bias correction methods for climate impact studies the approach is summarised in fig 1 section s 1 1 in the supplement includes a detailed step by step description the framework consists of three parts first a user selects the climate data including historical observations and climate model data and the bias correction and downscaling methods next an impact model is driven using historical observations and climate model based data to produce a historical reference simulation and gcm based impact simulations third the downscaling and bias correction methods are evaluated in the impacts modelling space i e a comparison of gcm based impact simulations against a historical reference simulation for selected evaluation metrics spatial and temporal scales is performed finally the different bias correction and downscaling methods are ranked in terms of their individual biases for each metric and an overall ranking is calculated we use the same validation period as the period used for calibrating the bias correction methods to avoid introducing any biases from selecting a different calibration and validation period as the impact modelling outputs are not directly calibrated by the downscaling or bias correction method they can be considered out of sample for the purpose of evaluation hereby we focus on the effect of the bias correction methods on the modelled impact variables as opposed to evaluating the climate inputs we emphasise that our framework should not replace existing evaluation of bias correction and downscaling methods focused on climate model outputs using split sample approaches e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 categories a and b in table 1 instead it should be seen as complementary adding an additional layer of information on the suitability of these methods for impact modelling 3 data we demonstrate the proposed impacts centric evaluation framework for hydrological impacts assessment using a case of hydrological projections for australia the australian bureau of meteorology bom in partnership with the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro and australian universities has led the development of the national hydrological projections nhp service that provides nationally consistent high resolution projections of climate change impacts on water resources across australia wilson et al 2022 this includes an ensemble of application ready bias corrected and downscaled cmip5 climate model data based on three statistical bias correction methods and one combined downscaling and bias correction approach and hydrological simulations using the bom s operational continental scale landscape water balance model awra l we evaluate the bias correction and downscaling methods that underpin the nhp service focusing on their suitability for hydrological impact assessments the following sections describe the climate data underpinning the nhp service including bias corrected and downscaled climate forcings section 3 1 followed by a description of the impact simulations using the hydrological model awra l section 3 2 3 1 climate data 3 1 1 historical climate observations historical climate observations were used 1 as a target dataset for the bias correction methods section 3 1 2 and 2 as input into the historical hydrological simulation to be used as a reference for the evaluation section 3 2 2 daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature data were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology s australian gridded climate dataset agcd version 1 previously known as awap dataset jones et al 2009 this dataset is built by interpolating station based data onto a 0 05 x 0 05 grid using a combination of the barnes successive correction method and three dimensional smoothing splines jones et al 2009 remotely sensed daily solar radiation data grant et al 2008 and daily average wind speed data derived from station based 2 m wind speed observations available on the same 0 05 x 0 05 grid mcvicar et al 2008 were also used in remote regions of the continent especially in parts of western australia the rainfall observations network and other weather variables are very sparse or lacking entirely reliable interpolation of observations cannot be done in these locations therefore grid cells for these regions have been masked and excluded when calculating regional averages of evaluation metrics for the downscaling and bias correction methods see white areas in fig 3 3 1 2 downscaled and bias corrected climate data four gcms of the 5th phase of the climate model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 were downscaled and bias corrected these four gcms were selected based

atmospheric model ccam model mcgregor and dix 2008 were bias corrected using the isimip2b method this resulted in three statistical bias correction approaches and one combined downscaling and bias correction approach srikanthan et al 2022 wilson et al 2022 which are outlined in the following see also table 2 for further details these downscaling and bias correction methods were selected as they are published and established methods which have been used in a wide number of climate change impact studies csiro and bom 2021 dowdy 2019 2020 dowdy et al 2021 frieler et al 2017 hempel et al 2013

bias corrected using one of the bias correction methods isimip2b the outputs of this combined downscaling and bias correction approach are in the following sections referred to as ccam isimip2b before applying bias correction the gcm and rcm outputs were regridded to match the resolution of the observational dataset regridding was done using conservative remapping using the climate data operators cdo https www mpimet mpg de cdo remapcon function the calibration of the bias correction methods was done using the historical baseline period 1976 2005 30 year reference periods are commonly used by the world meteorological organization and in climate change studies to represent baseline climate wmo 2021 one exception is the qme bias correction method due to its focus on extremes this method included more recent observations to capture recent temperature extremes and hence a longer calibration period 1975 2017 was used for the calibration using the qme method gcm outputs for 1975 2005 from the historical simulations and outputs for 2006 2017 from one of the emission scenarios representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 were combined prior to the application of the bias correction

section 3 2 3 to better understand differences in the bias correction and downscaling methods additional evaluation was done for all climate forcings and are briefly presented in section 5 6 a full description of the methods underpinning the climate focused evaluation is presented in section s 1 2 in the supplement 4 1 performance metrics in the development of the hydrological projections service potential use cases were identified through interviews with a wide range of stakeholders this process identified indices representing the mean hydrological change and hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts as particularly critical thus the following performance metrics representing mean conditions variability heavy rainfall and peak runoff days as well as dry conditions were selected in our evaluation mean bias the mean bias represents biases in mean climate and hydrological conditions annual and seasonal averages first the average of annual and seasonal mean values for soil moisture or totals for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff was calculated for the evaluation period subsequently the bias was computed as the difference between each ensemble member and the historical reference the relative bias was calculated as the difference or bias relative to the climatological mean in the historical reference the bias was obtained from annual and seasonal for 3 monthly seasons djf mam jja son values climatology the monthly climatology was calculated as the average of monthly values mean for root zone soil moisture and sum for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff over the evaluation period the bias was calculated as the difference between the climatology of the historical reference and each ensemble member interannual and multi year variability the interannual variability was calculated as the standard deviation of annual values mean for root zone soil moisture annual total for precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff over the evaluation period in addition to the interannual variability the multiannual variability at 2 to 5 year time scales was computed to assess low frequency variability biases we first computed a 2 to 5 year moving average of the annual values and subsequently calculated the standard deviation of annual smoothed values heavy rainfall and peak runoff days to evaluate the magnitude of heavy rainfall and peak runoff days we calculated the 5 year maximum value of daily precipitation and runoff values calculated using a 5 year resampled time series using a non overlapping moving window subsequently the average of the 5 year maximum over the evaluation period was calculated dry conditions to assess the magnitude of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts we calculated the minimum of annual precipitation soil moisture and runoff over the evaluation period as a deviation from the climatological mean equally we calculated the minimum over the evaluation period from 2 to 5 year averaged values using 2 to 5 year moving averages as a deviation from the long term mean to evaluate the magnitude of multi annual droughts all evaluation metrics used here are based on summary statistics this is due to the fact that the historical time series of global climate models are not synchronous with observations and evaluation approaches typically used in forecast verification or model validation such as a pairwise comparison of modelled and observed daily values are not applicable and the assessment of bias correction generally focuses on summary statistics maraun 2016 to aid the interpretation of mean biases at the grid cell and nrm regional scale we applied significance testing using bootstrapping see section s 1 3 in the supplement for details the biases in all metrics outlined above were calculated at grid cell scale as well as regional scale using eight natural resources management nrm clusters and an australia wide aggregation the nrm clusters are eco climatic zones characterised by unique geography and hydroclimate fig 2 a further description of the ecosystems and characteristics of the nrm clusters can be found in chapter 2 of csiro and bom 2015 4 2 ranking of downscaling and bias correction methods we calculated the mean bias for each combination of 1 variable 2 performance metric 3 spatial aggregation and 4 temporal aggregation as well as for each ensemble member resulting in 29 376 bias values the 16 ensemble members were then ranked in terms of their absolute bias positive or negative deviation from zero starting with the lowest rank 1 for the smallest bias through to the largest rank 16 for the largest bias for each performance area the average rank was calculated for each bias correction downscaling method over all variables spatial and regional scales and gcms the method with the lowest average ranking was considered strongest in this performance area finally the overall best performing method was identified by calculating the average ranking across all performance areas using equal weights 5 results and discussion 5 1 mean bias fig 3 presents maps of mean biases between key water balance variables precipitation potential evapotranspiration root zone soil moisture and runoff across australia for one of the gcms access1 0 mean biases at the regional scale for australia and nrm regions are presented in fig 4 for further details see section s 2 1 in the supplement for bias maps for all gcms section s 2 2 for the significance maps of the bias and section s 2 3 for biases of gcm and rcm precipitation outputs before and after bias correction all downscaling and bias correction methods succeed in removing biases in precipitation which was directly bias corrected with resulting bias close to zero fig 4 the largest but not significant biases are found for mrnbc which corrects all variables jointly in a multi variate approach and hence the correction of other variables influences rainfall due to this there is a small remaining bias in precipitation despite it being one of the input variables that have been directly corrected the mean relative bias in rainfall at nrm regional scale is within 1 5 across most regions and gcms except for access1 0 bias corrected using isimip2b in the wet tropics where the average bias is 3 this is due to an upper limit in the daily precipitation amount of 400 mm implemented in the isimip2b method which fails in the region around mount bellenden ker and tully in north queensland this region is the wettest in australia and regularly experiences daily rainfall amounts exceeding 400 mm leading to strong negative biases biases in potential evapotranspiration are equally small with regional biases within 2 for all nrm regions except for gfdl esm2m bias corrected using isimip2b in the east coast and wet tropics potential evapotranspiration is computed from daily minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation and wind speeds which are all directly corrected we note that prior to applying gcm forcing to impact models this is where most studies terminate their evaluation of their downscaling and bias correction methods if we were to do this here we would conclude that all the bias correction methods are equally suitable to hydrological impact studies with mrnbc exhibiting largest biases while the remaining bias in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration which are both closely linked to gcm outputs are overall small the biases in root zone soil moisture and runoff are greater and more variable between regions gcms and downscaling and bias correction methods the mean bias in root zone soil moisture ranges between 8 across nrm regions fig 4 the most considerable variations in soil moisture biases can be found for isimip2b and qme while the magnitude of biases is greatly reduced for the mrnbc method and in some regions for ccam isimip2b however all biases at the nrm regional scale in soil moisture were found to be insignificant at the p 0 05 level fig 4 and less than 2 of grid cells have significant biases across all ensemble members fig s11 in the supplement biases in runoff which is the impact variable of greatest interest for assessing future flooding risks are overall largest with average biases at nrm regional scale within 45 except for gfdl esm2m bias corrected using isimip2b and qme for the central slope region while the relative biases in runoff appear great the relative bias values for runoff tend to be inflated due to 1 low average runoff in dry inland regions and 2 a large variability in runoff compared to other variables less than 10 of land areas show a significant bias for mrnbc for all gcms and for qme except for gfdl esm2m see fig s12 in the supplement the biases in runoff at the nrm regional scale are not significant for mrnbc for all regions and gcms for qme except for some regions with gfdl esm2m and ccam isimip2b except for the dry rangelands cluster overall we found the largest bias magnitude and most significant biases for the isimip2b method this may be due to multiple statistical aspects in relation to the climate forcings that are not well represented in the isimip2b outputs including the wet day frequency the number of days with at least 1 mm of rainfall interannual variability and extreme percentiles table 3 the variability and magnitude of biases in hydrological outputs are generally the smallest in the mrnbc outputs despite being greater for the inputs in addition dynamical downscaling appears to reduce the variability and magnitude of biases in hydrological outputs especially runoff when comparing the bias for isimip2b applied directly to raw gcm outputs and isimip2b applied to dynamically downscaled outputs using ccam the range of runoff bias for australia is within 20 for isimip2b and within 5 for ccam isimip2b ccam overrides the gcm signal to some extent bringing the results from the four gcms closer together which in turn may also reduce variations in biases between gcms overall we find that while biases in climate forcings are close to zero for all methods there are considerable differences in the ability of the methods to reduce biases in water balance variables the differences between methods are minor for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration however the downscaling and bias correction methods have a more significant influence on biases for soil moisture and runoff the mrnbc method which corrects biases across multiple time scales and considers cross correlations and temporal autocorrelation led to strongest reductions in biases and the least significant biases in hydrological outputs this was followed by dynamical downscaling and subsequent univariate bias correction ccam isimip2b with the exception of runoff in the rangelands cluster this conclusion is different if the ranking of performance was solely based on the input variables that is precipitation and pet 5 2 climatology bias fig 5 presents the australia averaged climatology in the historical reference compared against the climatology obtained using downscaled and bias corrected gcm data for further details see fig s17 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm rainfall biases the climatologies for precipitation and pet top two rows overlap well with the historical references for all ensemble members except for some variations for precipitation bias corrected using qme the qme method has been applied at the seasonal scale i e days within each three month season were combined in the quantile mapping approach whereas isimip2b and mrnbc apply bias correction for each month of the year separately the application at the seasonal scale in the qme method was chosen to triple the sample size for a better representation of rare events due to this the rainfall biases at the monthly scale in isimip2b mrnbc and ccam isimip2b are smaller than for qme highlighting the importance of considering the time scale at which bias correction is applied when focusing on hydrological impact assessments the qme method does not strictly have to be applied at the seasonal scale hence future applications of this method could use a monthly time scale to reduce biases in monthly climatologies after careful assessment of impacts on the representation of rare high impact events the biases in soil moisture are overall small and the mean climatology follows the historical reference for all ensemble members runoff shows the most prominent deviations from the historical reference in december to march i e during the wet season in the monsoon dominated northern parts of australia here biases are most considerable for isimip2b and qme with an under or overestimation of runoff depending on the gcm ccam isimip2b runoff is closer to the historical reference although there is a slight underestimation of runoff during the wet season across all host gcms for mrnbc runoff closely follows the climatology of the historical reference and the biases are small for all months of the year these results suggest that even with low biases in climate forcings particularly rainfall systematic biases in the sequencing and temporal auto correlation of rainfall within the bias corrected climate data can lead to large errors in the runoff outputs 5 3 interannual and multi annual variability bias fig 6 a and b present the bias in interannual variability precipitation and runoff after downscaling and bias correction fig s18 in the supplement presents the raw gcm and rcm biases in interannual variability the most prominent biases in the interannual variability of rainfall can be found for cnrm cm5 and gfdl esm2m in isimip2b and qme and miroc5 in the isimip2b data fig 6a mrnbc appears to reduce the bias in interannual variability most of all methods followed by ccam which reduces the magnitude of mean bias overall but also imprints a new spatial pattern of bias consistent across host gcms fig 6a for runoff the biases under or overestimation are similar to those of rainfall but the influence of downscaling and bias correction is less clear than for precipitation for applications in water resources management such as management of urban and regional water supply or agricultural management variability at longer time scales spanning multiple years plays an important role for example if the interannual variability at multi year time scales is high we may see multiple consecutive wet or dry years leading to potentially more damaging impacts on agriculture and water management therefore reproducing realistic multiannual variability is of importance to many end users and applications such as dam operations and agricultural management fig 7 presents the interannual variability at 1 to 5 year time scales for the historical reference simulation and all ensemble members for further information see fig s19 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm biases in interannual variability the bias in multi year variability 2 to 5 years for rainfall is consistent with the bias at the 1 year time scale for all methods the only exception is ccam isimip2b which shows decreasing bias in variability at longer time scales this suggests that the regional climate model reproduces realistic statistical patterns of variability at multi year time scales possibly due to an improved representation of large scale teleconnections e g spatial rainfall patterns associated with enso while the bias in precipitation variability is low for ccam it does not translate into low biases in multiannual variability in runoff highlighting the difficulty of reproducing higher order statistical features of hydrological output variables using downscaling and bias correction when comparing the three statistical bias correction methods the most considerable differences are found for gfdl esm2m for this gcm the interannual variability is strongly overestimated in isimip2b and qme which follows raw gcm outputs see fig s18 in the supplement but matches well with observations in mrnbc figs 6 and 7 for the other three gcms we see an underestimation of interannual and multiannual variability across all three bias correction methods and no difference between bias correction methods the overall pattern of bias in rainfall translates into similar biases in multiannual variability for runoff fig 7 there is a large spread of bias in isimip2b and qme across the different gcms and a somewhat reduced bias in mrnbc however at longer time scales 5 year variability mrnbc underestimates the variability for all gcms 5 4 bias in heavy rainfall and peak runoff days fig 8 presents the bias of the 5 year maximum rainfall and runoff averaged over the evaluation period using a 5 year moving window for the 5 year maximum values for each ensemble member and region for further details see fig s20 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm biases in heavy precipitation isimip2b mrnbc and ccam isimip2b show considerable variation in biases while qme shows the smallest biases for heavy precipitation days however translated into runoff biases in 5 year maximum runoff are most reduced in the mrnbc method suggesting that other factors such as temporal auto correlation patterns and variable cross correlations play an essential role in reducing biases in runoff including peak runoff events 5 5 bias in dry conditions to assess the magnitude of drought at multiple time scales annual to 5 year multiannual drought we calculated the minimum of 1 to 5 year precipitation soil moisture and runoff averaged values and compared it against the long term average in other words we assessed how dry was the driest 1 to 5 year period relative to average precipitation soil moisture and runoff in the observations and downscaled bias corrected data in terms of precipitation most of the bias corrected data align well with the observations fig 9 see fig s21 in the supplement for raw gcm and rcm biases in meteorological drought the exception is gfdl esm2m which shows an overestimation of drought severity at 1 to 5 year time scales as indicated by underestimated minimum 1 to 5 year total precipitation mrnbc reduces this underestimation to some extent in line with a correction of the interannual variability of gfdl esm2m as seen in figs 6 and 7 the dynamically downscaled and bias corrected data ccam isimip2b also shows strong alignment with observations except for a slight overestimation of drought magnitude for access1 0 and cnrm cm5 regarding soil moisture and runoff the patterns are similar to precipitation indicating that biases in meteorological drought translate into biases in agricultural and hydrological drought mrnbc and ccam isimip2b reproduce observed patterns best whereas for isimip2b and qme the overestimation in precipitation drought for gfdl esm2m is visible in the soil moisture and runoff drought patterns as well in terms of longer term drought e g 4 to 5 year drought ccam isimip2b produces the most realistic patterns for all drought types and mrnbc for runoff drought 5 6 overall performance in sections 5 1 5 5 we compared the performance of four downscaling and bias correction approaches for correcting the mean and variability in key hydrological variables for different regions and spatial and temporal aggregations to perform a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the various approaches and to identify key strengths and limitations of the four methods the bias in 15 statistical features was calculated nine related to the climate forcings and six related to the hydrological outputs this was done for all possible combinations of 1 variables in climate inputs or hydrological outputs 2 regional aggregation for australia wide as well as each nrm region and 3 temporal aggregation such as annually for each season and where applicable for each month table 3 presents the average rank over all combinations for each performance area the lowest average rank per row highlighted in green suggests the given downscaling and bias correction method overall performs best for the statistical feature in contrast the highest average rank highlighted in orange suggests there is potential for improvement in this statistical feature for a given downscaling bias correction approach for a detailed description of the statistical features computed for this extended performance table see section s 1 1 and table s1 in the supplement we find that ccam isimip2b performs best in reducing biases in the mean and climatology of the climate forcings and the key strength of the qme method is to reduce biases in representing 5 year maxima higher order statistics related to temporal patterns e g interannual variability temporal auto correlation multiannual drought and wet day frequency as well as variable cross correlations are best represented using the mrnbc method table 3 regarding the hydrological outputs the mrnbc method outperforms the other methods across all dimensions this highlights the importance of considering temporal correlation and variability and cross correlation patterns for producing realistic hydrological outputs that can be used in hydrological impact studies one crucial aspect to consider in climate change impact studies is to which degree downscaling and bias correction methods modulate the future climate change signal that is projected by the gcm maraun 2016 for example overfitting the training data in the historical period may lead to implausible future trends here we assessed the adjustment of the climate change signal by comparing the raw gcm change signal relative for precipitation absolute for temperature with the change signal in the downscaled and bias corrected data the mrnbc method is identified as the most trend preserving approach by contrast ccam isimip2b due to the regional climate model imprinting its own climate change signal on top of the gcm signal shows the largest deviation between gcm and downscaled bias corrected trend see row 10 change signal in table 3 however it should be noted that gcms cannot simulate many key physical processes e g rain bearing phenomena such as thunderstorms and therefore preserving the trends from gcms may not be desirable depending on the application if a calibration method or downscaling results in a different trend from their host gcm this may be considered a form of realised added value e g di virgilio et al 2020 5 7 key recommendations for impact studies we presented an evaluation framework to assess bias correction and downscaling methods for use in climate change impact studies and demonstrated the approach for hydrological projections for australia this framework is flexible and can be applied to other impact domains such as wildfire risk projections impacts of climate change on human health infrastructure ecosystems or energy systems the steps would follow the same as outlined in this study 1 selection of an impact model that was comprehensively evaluated and adequately describes the impacts associated with a range of climate conditions e g an ecological model 2 application of multiple downscaling or bias correction methods to gcm outputs using suitable historical climate observations or reanalysis data or identification of existing downscaled bias corrected data for the region of interest 3 impact simulations using historical climate observations and downscaled or bias corrected gcm data 4 evaluation of the impact simulations using appropriate evaluation metrics at multiple temporal and spatial scales relevant to the impact domain 5 ranking of the different downscaling and bias correction methods and identification of overall best performing method see also fig 1 the selection of evaluation metrics and temporal and spatial scales of relevance is ideally based on engagement with stakeholders who will be users of climate change impact projections in this evaluation we assessed four downscaling and bias correction approaches using a selection of performance metrics that aimed to capture a variety of statistical features relevant to a range of hydrological applications particularly mean biases biases in variability peak rainfall runoff days and severe dry conditions however more detailed evaluation could include methods applied in flood risk studies for example based on extreme value distributions or using drought indices such as drought duration frequency and severity moving beyond evaluations based on individual statistical metrics such as mean and variability future research could assess the suitability of bias correction across the whole probability distribution using bias metrics computed in the probability frequency domain e g emmanouil et al 2021 perkins et al 2007 there are also many potential avenues to refine and improve the evaluation framework our proposed evaluation framework assumes stationary biases unaffected by climate change trends however with changes in future temperature and hydrological regimes biases may vary and the performance of bias correction will change a pseudo reality approach also called perfect predictor or perfect sibling approach could be applied to assess the non stationarity of biases and evaluate downscaling and bias correction methods under changing climate conditions gutiérrez et al 2018 maraun et al 2018 2017 navarro racines et al 2020 schmith et al 2021 model structural uncertainty is an important source of uncertainty in climate impact projections and in our evaluation framework the results of the evaluation and associated ranking in bias correction and downscaling methods may be influenced by the choice of impact model future research could assess the sensitivity of the evaluation results to model selection using a number of hydrological models moving beyond the evaluation framework the results presented here have large implications for future hydrological impact studies in terms of downscaling and bias correction the key findings are 1 bias correction that removes biases in the mean variability and temporal autocorrelation and variable cross correlations performs best in reducing biases in hydrological modelling outputs that underpin hydrological impact studies 2 bias correction applied at multiple time scales such as daily monthly and annual produces realistic hydrological outputs while capturing low frequency variability i e multi year variability and droughts which is of importance for many hydrological impacts e g on water resources and agricultural management 3 removing mean biases in climate forcings does not automatically lead to low biases in hydrological output variables due to for example biases in the sequencing of precipitation events cross correlations and biases in variability see also points 1 and 2 4 hydrological impact studies as well as impact studies in other domains require an evaluation of downscaling and bias correction for the target variables of interest at the spatial and temporal time scale of interest 6 conclusions downscaling and bias correction methods are critical components in climate change impact studies however previous research has primarily focused on assessing the performance of such approaches in correcting climate variables while the effect on impact simulations was generally less investigated in this study we introduced an impacts centric evaluation framework for downscaling and bias correction methods that evaluates the performance in the impact space we demonstrated the approach for evaluating downscaling and bias correction methods for hydrological impact studies in australia we outlined key strengths and limitations for all selected methods based on a selection of performance metrics we find that bias correction that considers cross correlations between climate drivers temporal autocorrelations and biases at multiple time scales performs best in reducing biases in hydrological variables such as soil moisture and runoff our proposed evaluation approach can be applied to a wide range of climate change impact studies where downscaling and bias correction is required such as agricultural production wildfire risks energy generation human health ecosystem functioning

1831,the rainfall product derived from the sm2rain soil moisture to rain algorithm has been widely used however there is still a large uncertainty partly due to the soil moisture input and parameters estimation of the sm2rain algorithm which limits the application of the model in alpine regions here the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm was developed by integrating the sm2rain algorithm and bayesian optimization to improve the estimation of parameters z a b tbase tpot subsequently incorporating smap level 3 soil moisture products for rainfall estimation the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm was evaluated based on observed rainfall data under different environmental conditions in three typical alpine regions namely tibetan plateau heihe river basin and shandian river basin moreover sm2rain bayesopt imerg v06b and era5 reanalysis rainfall estimates were also compared with in situ rainfall observations the results showed that the proposed sm2rain bayesopt algorithm can obtain more accurate rainfall estimates in all studied areas in terms of different evaluation metrics it was also found that our proposed sm2rain bayesopt algorithm performs better in alpine meadows and grassland than in desert and forestland sm2rain bayesopt algorithm can considerably improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation and it is of significant value for rainfall monitoring in alpine regions where observational data are scarce keywords rainfall estimation soil moisture smap sm2rain bayesian optimization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rainfall plays a critical role in the global water and energy cycles liang et al 2013 tong et al 2014 li et al 2020 it is also the main atmospheric forcing variable driving land surface hydrological processes xia et al 2021 the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of rainfall significantly affect water resource management abera et al 2017 agricultural production thaler et al 2018 and drought monitoring forootan et al 2019 in situ measurements from rain gauges and ground based radar are the most direct methods for observing rainfall rossi et al 2017 fereidoon and koch 2018 however the distribution of rain gauges is uneven over the world particularly in isolated mountainous regions kidd et al 2016 additionally the use of surface rainfall estimates is constrained by the expense of rain gauge maintenance particularly in developing nations ciabatta et al 2018 satellite remote sensing holds considerable promise for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall because satellites can provide data simultaneously with greater spatial coverage and at continuous temporal scale satellite rainfall products have gradually become an important data source in the field of hydrology and meteorology chintalapudi et al 2014 fang et al 2019 filippucci et al 2021 for example the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa jointly developed the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and its subsequent global precipitation measurement gpm hou et al 2014 trmm and gpm capture precipitation by measuring the intensity of electromagnetic radiation or energy emitted or reflected from cloud tops or the raindrops themselves based on a top down view kidd and levizzani 2011 this observation method can distinguish different types of precipitation including snow light rain and hail however the indirectness and instantaneity of satellite observations can cause great uncertainty in precipitation products trenberth and asrar 2014 the current findings demonstrate both model based and satellite based rainfall products perform poorly for alpine areas climate xu et al 2022 the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2013a together with remotely sensed soil moisture estimates have been proven to be a powerful tool for deriving regional and global rainfall brocca et al 2014 2019 ciabatta et al 2018 filippucci et al 2021 satellite sm2rain based rainfall estimation depends on the soil water balance equation and is a bottom up approach using the feedback characteristics of soil moisture to rainfall the sm2rain algorithm can estimate cumulative rainfall based on the observed differences in soil moisture in adjacent time phases compared to satellite rainfall products obtained from top down methods the sm2rain bottom up method can continuously and accurately estimate rainfall over a limited number of satellite overpasses brocca et al 2019 currently different versions of rainfall products are developed and released using the sm2rain algorithm and varying satellite soil moisture products as inputs such as rainfall sm2rain cci and sm2rain ascat ciabatta et al 2018 brocca et al 2019 the results demonstrated that sm2rain ascat generally outperformed terrestrial gpcc products particularly in africa and south america in the southern hemisphere the midwest of the united states and central asia brocca et al 2019 and its derived rainfall estimates are increasingly used for certain applications to mention one important application given the different characteristics of the bottom up method the sm2rain derived rainfall products are considered to be independent of various satellite rainfall products that are based on the top down methods and thus sm2rain rainfall products are increasingly used as a unique and important input data to the novel triple collaboration analysis to facilitate the evaluation of satellite rainfall products without the need for ground truth duan et al 2021 dong et al 2020 massari et al 2017 chen et al 2022 however there are still a wide variety of challenges that restrict the growth of sm2rain algorithmic and application development sm2rain model parameters need to be calibrated with in situ rainfall data the sm2rain currently mainly uses the fourth order runge kutta algorithm for parameter optimization brocca et al 2013a and it lacks stability and accuracy leading to uncertainty in parameter estimation the bayesian optimization is a comprehensive framework to estimate model parameters huang et al 2021 which provides a new opportunity for improved estimation of parameters z a b tbase tpot of the sm2rain algorithm in addition the accuracy of the sm2rain model in estimating rainfall can be affected by various factors such as the choice of study area and soil moisture products tarpanelli et al 2017 previous studies have reported that smap soil moisture products exhibit good performance in the study area investigated in this paper chen et al 2017 qu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 therefore utilizing smap l3 soil moisture products as inputs in the model could potentially improve the sm2rain model in this region this study aims to address the challenges mentioned above in this study we optimize the parameters of the sm2rain algorithm under the bayesian framework and propose a more robust sm2rain bayesopt model for estimating rainfall based on this model rainfall was estimated using the smap level 3 soil moisture product three study areas including the tibetan plateau the heihe river basin and the shandian river basin were selected to evaluate the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt model therefore this study has three specific objectives 1 to improve the parameter estimation in the sm2rain algorithm using the bayesian optimization 2 to evaluate the performance of our proposed sm2rain bayesopt algorithm model in typical areas with the alpine climate 3 to compare the sm2rain bayesopt with imerg v06b and era5 reanalysis rainfall estimates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study regions are situated in the shandian river basin the heihe river basin and the tibetan plateau fig 1 the tibetan plateau ranges from 25 81 to 39 82 n and 68 02 to 104 68 e with an average elevation of more than 4000 m 75 of rainfall events occur between may and october and the annual rainfall is about 500 mm chen et al 2012 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 wei et al 2019 the tibetan plateau belongs to a typical alpine climate region and the regional climate is mainly influenced by westerlies south asian monsoons and east asian monsoon circulations hu et al 2019 vegetation types in tibetan plateau were classified as follows steppe 22 5 meadow 18 4 desert 19 6 needle leaf forest 5 9 broad leaf forest 2 5 shrub 19 8 and crop 1 1 while non vegetation area 8 9 including dune gobi bare rock and glacier and water body 1 3 peng et al 2012 the heihe river basin is between 2000 and 5600 m above sea level and the average annual rainfall is between 200 and 700 mm yao et al 2017 tian et al 2020 lai et al 2022 the main land cover types in the heihe river basin are grassland 49 forestland 17 barren land 27 and farmland 3 hu et al 2015 the shandian river basin is characterized a temperate continental climate with flat terrain all of its stations have elevations between 1200 and 1500 m the average annual rainfall in most areas is 300 500 mm of which 70 is concentrated in july september the vegetation in the shandian river basin is dominated by grassland and belongs to a semi arid climate in the shandian river basin the soil is relatively dry in spring due to the influence of the monsoon while it is humid in summer due to abundant rainfall zhao et al 2020 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 in situ observation the in situ rainfall data are provided by national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn a total of 25 rain gauge stations are used in the tibetan plateau zhu and peng 2020 the heihe river basin liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 and the shandian river basin zhao et al 2020 these stations are situated in the alpine meadows 12 stations grassland 9 stations desert 2 stations forestland 1 station and farmland table 1 in the tibetan plateau region the rain gauge is set up above the ground and continuously records rainfall in situ soil moisture observations are made by sensors placed 4 cm below the surface at ground sites in the heihe basin which produce rainfall and soil moisture observations every 10 min in shandian river basin rainfall gauge measurements and in situ soil moisture observations are sampled every 10 or 15 min depending on when the measurement period began before june 2019 or after june 2019 in situ soil moisture measurements are derived from sensors deployed at 3 cm beneath the surface the ground observations from the shandian river basin were aggregated into a half hour time resolution the calibration and validation period for each study area using the sm2rain algorithm varies since the three study areas have different frequencies of site observations table 1 for the effect of temperature on the sensor we made temperature corrections for soil moisture saito et al 2013 kapilaratne and lu 2017 zhao et al 2020 in addition we aggregated the observation data for 1 h to avoid the effect of high frequency 10 15 min noise of in situ soil moisture gao et al 2019 surface temperature observations and smap mask information were used to remove seasonal frozen periods mostly january may and october december data huang et al 2019 gao et al 2021 the soil moisture data were normalized to the range of 0 1 when estimating rainfall using the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2015 2 2 2 smap level 3 soil moisture products currently the smap radiometer is capable of providing soil moisture observations at a resolution of 36 km with a revisit period of 2 3 days colliander et al 2022 smap has four levels of data products including level 1 sensor observations level 2 single orbit soil moisture data level 3 multi orbit daily synthetic soil moisture data and level 4 assimilation products all data products are projected onto ease 2 grid equal area scalable earth grid ver 2 these products are available through nasa the national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov for free here we used surface soil moisture data from smap level 3 version 8 spl3smp covering the period from 2016 to 2021 with a temporal resolution of 2 3 days and spatial resolution 36 km in units c m 3 c m 3 we used discrete cosine transform and penalized least square regression dct pls algorithm to fill the gaps in smap sm improving the time resolution of sm data from 2 to 3 days to 1 day as a mature algorithm garcia 2010 dct pls algorithm has been widely used to fill missing values in observed data wang et al 2012 saeedi et al 2022 2 2 3 rainfall products era5 is the latest generation of global reanalysis data set produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf providing dozens of commonly used surface and atmospheric variables covering the period from 1950 to the present hersbach et al 2020 benefiting from improvements in model processes core dynamics and data assimilation era5 has a significantly higher data quality xu et al 2022 era5 reanalyzed precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 h era5 precipitation data is the sum of large scale precipitation and convective precipitation here we use precipitation product to subtract snowfall to obtain rainfall product depending on the retrieval algorithm gpm the global precipitation measurement mission can provide three levels of remote sensing data products including the level 3 imerg product which is an infrared precipitation estimate generated from calibrated microwaves in addition to the integration of ground based observations which has been updated to version v06b the imerg product final run has the highest quality and is most suitable for scientific research which has a spatial coverage of s60 n60 with a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a temporal resolution of 0 5 h the rain gauges we use at ground stations are independent of the imerg precipitation data huffman et al 2019 we have obtained rainfall estimates using the probability of liquid precipitation provided by imerg huffman et al 2019 2 3 methods 2 3 1 sm2rain bayesopt model using the dynamic change information of soil moisture the sm2rain method directly estimates the total amount of rainfall between the two intervals using the soil water balance equation as the retrieval foundation specifically the soil water balance equation can be described by the following equation over non irrigated areas 1 z d s t d t p t r t e t g t where z is soil water capacity z zn z mm is soil depth and n is soil porosity brocca et al 2019 where s t is the soil relative moisture or soil relative saturation t d is the time and p t r t e t and g t mm d are the rainfall runoff evapotranspiration and drainage rate respectively brocca et al 2013a whenever it rains the evaporation rate can be safely assumed as negligible e t 0 moreover by assuming that all precipitation infiltrates into the soil the runoff rate is zero r t 0 brocca et al 2013a in the study area little rainfall 1 xiao et al 2020 he et al 2012 gao et al 2018 niu et al 2019 dai et al 2020 dai et al 2021 is directly converted into the surface runoff in alpine meadows other land cover types in the study area have strong permeability and almost no surface runoff was observed kang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 xin et al 2021 therefore it is reasonable to believe that runoff is valid to ignore in these three study areas for the drainage rate the following relation may be adopted g t a s t b where a mm d is the saturated hydraulic conductivity b is exponent related to the pore size distribution index famiglietti and wood 1994 brocca et al 2015 brocca et al 2019 rearrange equation 1 as follows 2 p t z d s t d t a s t b as described in equation 2 rainfall can be estimated by using soil relative moisture or soil relative saturation and its temporal fluctuation due to the high frequency fluctuation of soil moisture caused by the errors of the satellite soil moisture retrieval algorithm the satellite soil moisture products need to be filtered before being used as the input of sm2rain brocca et al 2019 in previous studies exponential filtering is proven to be an effective method wagner et al 1999 stroud et al 1999 su et al 2013 the recursive equation of the soil moisture index filter is as follows albergel et al 2008 3 s w i n s w i n 1 k n s t n s w i n 1 where swi is the filtered soil moisture k is the gain of t n given by the following equation 4 k n k n 1 k n 1 e t n t n 1 t assuming that the parameter t changes with swi brocca et al 2013b as the drainage rate increases with the increase of soil moisture the parameter t decreases with the increase of soil moisture brocca et al 2019 to take account of the nonlinearity of the percolation process brocca et al 2008 t is determined by two parameters tbase and tpot 5 t t b a s e s w i t p o t tbase controls the minimum value of t parameter and tpot is allowed to increase t by decreasing swi t brocca et al 2013b so far five parameters z a b tbase tpot that need to be estimated for the sm2rain algorithm constitute parameter set θ parameter estimation for complex models can be regarded as a nonlinear optimization problem to find the optimal parameter set θ opt to minimize the rmse of the objective function f 6 θ opt argmax θ r d f θ where θ is the model parameter set and r d is the d dimensional value space of the parameter the bayesian optimization process utilizes the bayesian theorem 7 p θ d p θ p d θ p d where p θ and p θ d a priori and a posteriori probability distribution of the f p d stands for the probability density function of the observed data while p d θ is the conditional probability density function of the observed data when combined with prior knowledge the bayesian algorithm was implemented in matlab 2021 bull 2011 the bayesian algorithm is to find the best parameter in a bounded region the initial parameter θ i is selected randomly in the

variance we set the parameter ranges taking into account the physical meaning and regional conditions of each parameter filippucci et al 2021 the range of optimal parameters z a b tbase tpot for most sites is respectively 0 200 0 100 0 100 0 10 0 10 of course the range of parameters varies slightly from site to site the flowchart fig 2 displays the specific workflow that was investigated in this study 2 3 2 performance metrics four metrics were used to evaluate the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm including pearson s correlation r nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias between estimated rainfall and measured rainfall table 2 where r denotes the correlation between the two data sets and ranges in value from 1 1 ns range 1 which represents the estimated performance as a whole if the ns value is closer to 1 the model would be more reliable the population estimation error is represented by rmse pbias which measures the deviation between estimates and observations can be divided into three categories underestimations pbias 10 overestimations pbias greater than 10 and almost equal values pbias from 10 to 10 yang and luo 2014 3 results here we focus on the performance of sm2rain bayesopt in rainfall estimation the sm2rain bayesopt and sm2rain rainfall estimates are evaluated by comparing them with ground rainfall observation in situ and smap soil moisture were used as input terms respectively the performance of the rainfall estimation was evaluated using four performance metrics r ns rmse and pbias the dct pls method was used to fill in the gaps in the smap soil moisture product and then the smap pixels containing the rain gauge were used as input terms to estimate rainfall 3 1 optimal time step for sm2rain the sm2rain algorithm can estimate rainfall from soil moisture with different time steps so the optimal value needs to be determined in the study area to determine the daily cumulative rainfall we employed in situ sm at 1 2 3 4 6 8 and 12 hour sampling intervals and applied sm2rain fig 3 similar to the earlier study the daily rainfall s performance declines with larger sm time intervals lai et al 2022 the 1 hour sm interval had the best performance calibration period r mean 0 85 ns mean 0 73 validation period r mean 0 83 ns mean 0 60 and the 12 hour sm interval had the worst performance calibration period r mean 0 68 ns mean 1 53 validation period r mean 0 68 ns mean 0 97 therefore in this investigation cumulative rainfall was estimated using 1 hour time intervals of in situ soil moisture we used 1 hour in situ sm sampling intervals to analyze aggregated aggr rainfall performance over 1 72 h fig 4 the mean values of r and ns increased with the increase of aggr with a considerable rise throughout the phase of growing aggr from 0 to 12 h after an aggr of more than 24 h the mean values of r and ns stabilized this result is similar to previous studies brocca et al 2013a lai et al 2022 it suggests that using data with aggr longer than 24 h offers a more stable performance for the in situ soil moisture driven sm2rain algorithm therefore we used in situ soil moisture to estimate daily rainfall using 1 hour sampling intervals for smap sm the discrete cosine transform dct approach is used to fill the gap in the smap sm time series due to its revisit time of 2 3 days then using daily smap sm resolution data cumulative rainfall for 1 7 14 and 30 days was estimated saeedi et al 2022 3 2 evaluation of in situ soil moisture driven sm2rain bayesopt algorithm daily scale rainfall data are invaluable for hydrological studies here we compared the performance of in situ soil moisture as an input term to the sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms respectively for rainfall estimate of aggr 24 fig 5 it can be seen from r ns pbias and rmse that the performance of the two algorithms is very similar on the whole no matter in the calibration period or the validation period for example the sm2rain has r means of 0 86 and ns means of 0 75 respectively during the calibration periods while the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm has r means of 0 86 and ns means of 0 74 pbias and rmse for sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt are also almost the same as a result it can be concluded that when in situ soil moisture is used as an input the rainfall results estimated by the two methods often do not differ noticeably the temporal variation of rainfall estimated by sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms is demonstrated for site m5 as an example to further assess the performance of rainfall estimation utilizing in situ soil moisture as input data as seen in fig 6 the time series variation of in situ soil moisture and ground observed rainfall is very consistent and the estimated rainfall of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms match well with the variation of ground observed rainfall indicating that the performance of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms is similar for in situ soil moisture data of good quality for the in situ observation data with high frequency and good quality it can respond to the change of soil moisture in time this makes it easier to establish stable sm2rain algorithm parameters from high quality field soil moisture data even if it is only a simple parameter optimization model it is not surprising that good observation data is conducive to the construction of the model which reflects the correctness of the physical mechanism of sm2rain algorithm from the side and provides strong support for the sm2rain algorithm input by satellite sm 3 3 evaluation of smap soil moisture driven sm2rain bayesopt algorithm figs 7 and 8 compares the r and ns at each site when smap soil moisture is used as the input of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithm respectively with aggr of 1 7 14 and 30 days overall it is evident that when the aggr rises the r and ns between estimated and observed rainfall gradually increase at aggr of 7 14 and 30 r and ns are both noticeably higher than the value at aggr of 1 day the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt method is much higher than that of sm2rain and the algorithm is more effective during the calibration period than during the validation period for example in site a13 in fig 7b r improves from 0 08 to 0 54 after bayesian optimization with aggr of 1 day meanwhile in site a13 in fig 8b ns improves from 0 45 to 0 28 this demonstrates that the smap soil moisture driven sm2rain algorithm performs well using bayesian optimization in addition when using smap soil moisture to estimate rainfall data it is recommended to use estimates with aggr greater than 1 day in the calibration period the statistics of pbias of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt are p 0 0008 0 05 and the pbias of sm2rain bayesopt is closer to 0 fig 9 c this indicates that the pbias performance of sm2rain bayesopt is significantly better than sm2rain during the validation period there was no significant difference in pbias between sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt but the results of sm2rain bayesopt were closer to 0 overall sm2rain bayesopt performed better than sm2rain in r n and rmse performance but there was no significant difference fig 9 fig 10 shows the average values of r ns pbias and rmse between observed and estimated rainfall for all stations using smap soil moisture as the input term for the sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms respectively compared with sm2rain sm2rain bayesopt improved the r and ns mean values by 3 5 and 5 8 in the calibration period and by 2 6 and 1 9 in the validation period respectively indicating that the use of bayesian optimization enhanced the robustness of sm2rain algorithm the mean value of pbias between rainfall estimated by sm2rain bayesopt and observed rainfall decreases by 4 7 during the calibration period and is closer to zero than that of the sm2rain algorithm for various values of aggr fig 10c it is worth noting that when aggr is 7 days the pbias between the estimated rainfall and the measured rainfall is the largest in calibration period the values of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithm are 15 10 and 8 10 respectively indicating that sm2rain algorithm is more underestimating rainfall the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm is closer to the measured rainfall during the validation period for various aggr values the mean pbias values between the two rainfall estimates and the measured rainfall were in the range of 10 to 10 and both exhibited good performance during the calibration and validation periods the mean rmse between the rainfall derived by sm2rain bayesopt and the observed rainfall is lower than that of the sm2rain algorithm fig 10d indicating that the sm2rain bayesopt method demonstrates superior accuracy 3 4 parameter estimation and parameter behavior here we highlight how well the parameters behave when smap soil moisture is utilized as the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm s input term fig 11 shows the estimated parameters of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm under different land cover types the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm s parameters under various land cover types have similarities the parameter z was sensitive to how humid the climate was while the parameters a b tbase tpot did not exhibit any obvious characteristic the land cover types for sites in semi arid climate zones are primarily grassland desert and farmland and the parameter z value fluctuates below 50 mm the land cover types for sites in semi humid climate zones are alpine meadow and the parameter z value fluctuates below 100 mm and the land cover types for sites in humid climate zones are forestland and the parameter z value fluctuates below 150 mm this supports its physical mechanism and suggests that parameter z is larger in regions with wetter climates the more frequent the rainfall the stronger the infiltration of water into the soil 4 discussion in section 3 2 we found that there was no obvious difference in performance between the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm and the sm2rain algorithm for in situ soil moisture data with good data quality therefore we focused on comparing the differences between in situ and smap soil moisture as input items of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm named as the sm2rain bayesopt insitu sbi and sm2rain bayesopt smap sbs respectively secondly we did not consider the performance of rainfall estimation during the freezing period here we analyzed the rainfall estimation performance of the sm2rain algorithm during the freezing period with two representative stations in arou and yakou in addition we analyzed the performance of sbs algorithm parameters under different land cover types finally the estimated rainfall findings from sm2rain bayesopt are compared against those from the imerg satellite rainfall product and the era5 reanalysis rainfall product 4 1 sm2rain insitu versus sm2rain smap it can be seen from section 3 3 that smap soil moisture as an input of the sm2rain algorithm has poor performance for aggr 1 therefore we compared the performance of sbi and sbs algorithms in rainfall estimation for aggr 7 fig 12 during the calibration period the r and ns means for sbi algorithm r mean 0 89 ns mean 0 8 were significantly better than those of sbs algorithm r mean 0 81 ns mean 0 65 fig 12a and b the performance metrics of the validation period are similar to that of the calibration period indicating that the robustness of sbi was considerably higher than that of sbs during calibration and validation the pbias performance of sbi was closer to 0 than that of sbs and sbi showed better pbias performance fig 12c especially in the validation period sbs both overestimated rainfall and underestimated rainfall sometimes the overall rmse of the sbi algorithm in rainfall estimation was significantly lower than that of the sbs algorithm fig 12d to further analyze the differences between the sbi and sbs algorithms in rainfall estimation arou and yakou were taken as representatives and the time series curves of rainfall estimation by the sbi and sbs algorithms were compared for aggr 7 fig 13 both algorithms underestimated rainfall during peak rainfall events at arou and yakou stations but sbs underestimated rainfall more than sbi it should be noted that the temporal resolution of in situ soil moisture at the arou and yakou stations was 10 min while the temporal resolution of smap soil moisture was 1 day after filling in missing values this indicates that high frequency soil moisture data can improve the sm2rain algorithm to underestimate rainfall in the peak rainfall event lai et al 2022 4 2 the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm under different land cover types fig 14 shows the comparison of the performance of the sbs algorithm under different land cover at the aggr of 1 7 14 and 30 days during the calibration and validation periods in terms of r and ns the alpine meadow displays the best performance in comparison to other land cover types fig 14a b for the alpine meadow little rainfall 1 xiao et al 2020 is directly converted into the surface runoff in alpine meadows therefore sm2rain algorithm is very advantageous to estimate rainfall in alpine meadow during the calibration period desert and forestland performed poorly with r median values of 0 70 and 0 80 and ns median values of 0 48 and 0 64 respectively the mean pbias values in the alpine meadow and grassland over the calibration period which ranged from 10 to 10 were 2 09 and 8 02 respectively the average pbias values for the validation period were 1 52 and 12 54 during the calibration period some stations in alpine meadow and grassland underestimated rainfall but overall performance was reliable during the validation period the rainfall of the alpine meadow and grassland was both underestimated and overestimated but overestimated in general there are few sites in desert forestland and farmland and the assessment under these land cover types may be less representative the sbs algorithm tends to underestimate rainfall in deserts and farmland while tending to overestimate rainfall in forestland fig 14c however more in situ data will be required in the future to confirm this in more detail 4 3 influence of freezing period on sm2rain algorithm winter temperatures in alpine regions are lower most precipitation accumulates on the ground as snow and soil freezing results in relatively constant soil moisture the following spring with the temperature rising the melting of snow cover and frozen soil increased soil moisture chen et al 2016 tian et al 2020 the sm2rain algorithm overestimates rainfall due to the increase in soil moisture caused by snowmelt to analyze the influence of the soil freezing period on rainfall estimation by the sm2rain algorithm we selected the representative arou and yakou stations for analysis including the freezing period fig 15 depicts the temporal variations in rainfall estimated by the sm2rain insitu and sm2rain smap algorithms during the spring freezing period for aggr 7 in situ soil moisture at the arou station 3033 m fluctuated more than the smap around april 1 but the sbi rainfall estimates were much higher than the rain gauge observations and the era5 snowmelt data fig 15 thus the increase in soil moisture in situ is not only caused by rainfall and snowmelt according to the land surface temperature data observed at the station the soil at arou station alternated between freezing and melting around april 1 therefore the increase of soil moisture in arou station may be caused by the thawing of seasonal frozen soil similarly through the land surface temperature data of yakou station 4148 m it was found that the frozen soil melted around june 1 while the in situ soil moisture increased dramatically at this time this indicates that in situ soil moisture observation is sensitive to permafrost thawing the higher the elevation the later the thawing of permafrost the effect of permafrost thawing should be avoided when using in situ soil moisture to estimate rainfall at yakou station the increase rate of smap sm was slower than that of in situ sm in addition when seasonal permafrost melts at yakou station smap sm increases at a slower rate than in situ sm the paper used dct pls algorithm to fill smap soil moisture has some uncertainties this may be caused by the excessive vacancy value of smap soil water during the freezing period in the future a more robust soil water filling algorithm and considering the influence of permafrost melting can improve the accuracy of sbs rainfall estimation 4 4 comparison of different rainfall estimation fig 16 shows the comparison of the accuracy of rainfall estimated by the sbs algorithm with that of the era5 rainfall product and imerg v06b rainfall product with the measured rainfall as a reference during the calibration period for aggr 1 the mean r between sbs era5 and imerg rainfall data and observed rainfall was 0 37 0 55 and 0 45 respectively and for aggr 30 the mean r reached 0 95 0 85 and 0 84 respectively this indicates that the correlation between the rainfall estimated by the sm2rain algorithm and the observed rainfall on the daily scale is lower than that of era5 and imerg but it is opposite on the monthly scale which is consistent with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2020 fan et al 2021 the ns mean value of rainfall estimated by the sm2rain algorithm is significantly higher than that of era5 and imerg fig 16b the main reason is that era5 pbias mean 67 and imerg pbias mean 58 overestimate rainfall fig 16c however the mean value of pbias of sm2rain algorithm is between 10 10 indicating that sm2rain algorithm has a reliable performance in estimating cumulative rainfall 5 conclusions to address the uncertainty of the smap level 3 soil moisture input and parameter estimates in the sm2rain model we proposed the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm for estimating rainfall by integrating the sm2rain algorithm and bayesian optimization the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm was evaluated and compared with the original sm2rain algorithm against rain gauge data in three typical areas tibetan plateau the heihe river basin and the shandian river basin in the alpine region our results showed that the sm2rain bayesopt model outperforms the sm2rain model in terms of optimization efficiency and it can guarantee that the model with optimized parameters has a superior fitting outcome specifically the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm can increase the mean values of metrics r and ns by 3 8 and 1 9 with lower pbias and rmse at different aggr it can be concluded that the satellite sm with higher temporal resolution could further improves the performance of sm2rain algorithm on a global scale we additionally examined the impact of integrating freezing and thawing and we discovered that sm2rain bayesopt algorithm has the potential to estimate rainfall and snowmelt during the freezing period to further conform it additional investment will be required in the future credit authorship contribution statement linguang miao conceptualization methodology

1831,the rainfall product derived from the sm2rain soil moisture to rain algorithm has been widely used however there is still a large uncertainty partly due to the soil moisture input and parameters estimation of the sm2rain algorithm which limits the application of the model in alpine regions here the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm was developed by integrating the sm2rain algorithm and bayesian optimization to improve the estimation of parameters z a b tbase tpot subsequently incorporating smap level 3 soil moisture products for rainfall estimation the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm was evaluated based on observed rainfall data under different environmental conditions in three typical alpine regions namely tibetan plateau heihe river basin and shandian river basin moreover sm2rain bayesopt imerg v06b and era5 reanalysis rainfall estimates were also compared with in situ rainfall observations the results showed that the proposed sm2rain bayesopt algorithm can obtain more accurate rainfall estimates in all studied areas in terms of different evaluation metrics it was also found that our proposed sm2rain bayesopt algorithm performs better in alpine meadows and grassland than in desert and forestland sm2rain bayesopt algorithm can considerably improve the accuracy of rainfall estimation and it is of significant value for rainfall monitoring in alpine regions where observational data are scarce keywords rainfall estimation soil moisture smap sm2rain bayesian optimization data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rainfall plays a critical role in the global water and energy cycles liang et al 2013 tong et al 2014 li et al 2020 it is also the main atmospheric forcing variable driving land surface hydrological processes xia et al 2021 the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of rainfall significantly affect water resource management abera et al 2017 agricultural production thaler et al 2018 and drought monitoring forootan et al 2019 in situ measurements from rain gauges and ground based radar are the most direct methods for observing rainfall rossi et al 2017 fereidoon and koch 2018 however the distribution of rain gauges is uneven over the world particularly in isolated mountainous regions kidd et al 2016 additionally the use of surface rainfall estimates is constrained by the expense of rain gauge maintenance particularly in developing nations ciabatta et al 2018 satellite remote sensing holds considerable promise for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall because satellites can provide data simultaneously with greater spatial coverage and at continuous temporal scale satellite rainfall products have gradually become an important data source in the field of hydrology and meteorology chintalapudi et al 2014 fang et al 2019 filippucci et al 2021 for example the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa jointly developed the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm and its subsequent global precipitation measurement gpm hou et al 2014 trmm and gpm capture precipitation by measuring the intensity of electromagnetic radiation or energy emitted or reflected from cloud tops or the raindrops themselves based on a top down view kidd and levizzani 2011 this observation method can distinguish different types of precipitation including snow light rain and hail however the indirectness and instantaneity of satellite observations can cause great uncertainty in precipitation products trenberth and asrar 2014 the current findings demonstrate both model based and satellite based rainfall products perform poorly for alpine areas climate xu et al 2022 the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2013a together with remotely sensed soil moisture estimates have been proven to be a powerful tool for deriving regional and global rainfall brocca et al 2014 2019 ciabatta et al 2018 filippucci et al 2021 satellite sm2rain based rainfall estimation depends on the soil water balance equation and is a bottom up approach using the feedback characteristics of soil moisture to rainfall the sm2rain algorithm can estimate cumulative rainfall based on the observed differences in soil moisture in adjacent time phases compared to satellite rainfall products obtained from top down methods the sm2rain bottom up method can continuously and accurately estimate rainfall over a limited number of satellite overpasses brocca et al 2019 currently different versions of rainfall products are developed and released using the sm2rain algorithm and varying satellite soil moisture products as inputs such as rainfall sm2rain cci and sm2rain ascat ciabatta et al 2018 brocca et al 2019 the results demonstrated that sm2rain ascat generally outperformed terrestrial gpcc products particularly in africa and south america in the southern hemisphere the midwest of the united states and central asia brocca et al 2019 and its derived rainfall estimates are increasingly used for certain applications to mention one important application given the different characteristics of the bottom up method the sm2rain derived rainfall products are considered to be independent of various satellite rainfall products that are based on the top down methods and thus sm2rain rainfall products are increasingly used as a unique and important input data to the novel triple collaboration analysis to facilitate the evaluation of satellite rainfall products without the need for ground truth duan et al 2021 dong et al 2020 massari et al 2017 chen et al 2022 however there are still a wide variety of challenges that restrict the growth of sm2rain algorithmic and application development sm2rain model parameters need to be calibrated with in situ rainfall data the sm2rain currently mainly uses the fourth order runge kutta algorithm for parameter optimization brocca et al 2013a and it lacks stability and accuracy leading to uncertainty in parameter estimation the bayesian optimization is a comprehensive framework to estimate model parameters huang et al 2021 which provides a new opportunity for improved estimation of parameters z a b tbase tpot of the sm2rain algorithm in addition the accuracy of the sm2rain model in estimating rainfall can be affected by various factors such as the choice of study area and soil moisture products tarpanelli et al 2017 previous studies have reported that smap soil moisture products exhibit good performance in the study area investigated in this paper chen et al 2017 qu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 therefore utilizing smap l3 soil moisture products as inputs in the model could potentially improve the sm2rain model in this region this study aims to address the challenges mentioned above in this study we optimize the parameters of the sm2rain algorithm under the bayesian framework and propose a more robust sm2rain bayesopt model for estimating rainfall based on this model rainfall was estimated using the smap level 3 soil moisture product three study areas including the tibetan plateau the heihe river basin and the shandian river basin were selected to evaluate the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt model therefore this study has three specific objectives 1 to improve the parameter estimation in the sm2rain algorithm using the bayesian optimization 2 to evaluate the performance of our proposed sm2rain bayesopt algorithm model in typical areas with the alpine climate 3 to compare the sm2rain bayesopt with imerg v06b and era5 reanalysis rainfall estimates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study regions are situated in the shandian river basin the heihe river basin and the tibetan plateau fig 1 the tibetan plateau ranges from 25 81 to 39 82 n and 68 02 to 104 68 e with an average elevation of more than 4000 m 75 of rainfall events occur between may and october and the annual rainfall is about 500 mm chen et al 2012 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 wei et al 2019 the tibetan plateau belongs to a typical alpine climate region and the regional climate is mainly influenced by westerlies south asian monsoons and east asian monsoon circulations hu et al 2019 vegetation types in tibetan plateau were classified as follows steppe 22 5 meadow 18 4 desert 19 6 needle leaf forest 5 9 broad leaf forest 2 5 shrub 19 8 and crop 1 1 while non vegetation area 8 9 including dune gobi bare rock and glacier and water body 1 3 peng et al 2012 the heihe river basin is between 2000 and 5600 m above sea level and the average annual rainfall is between 200 and 700 mm yao et al 2017 tian et al 2020 lai et al 2022 the main land cover types in the heihe river basin are grassland 49 forestland 17 barren land 27 and farmland 3 hu et al 2015 the shandian river basin is characterized a temperate continental climate with flat terrain all of its stations have elevations between 1200 and 1500 m the average annual rainfall in most areas is 300 500 mm of which 70 is concentrated in july september the vegetation in the shandian river basin is dominated by grassland and belongs to a semi arid climate in the shandian river basin the soil is relatively dry in spring due to the influence of the monsoon while it is humid in summer due to abundant rainfall zhao et al 2020 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 in situ observation the in situ rainfall data are provided by national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn a total of 25 rain gauge stations are used in the tibetan plateau zhu and peng 2020 the heihe river basin liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 and the shandian river basin zhao et al 2020 these stations are situated in the alpine meadows 12 stations grassland 9 stations desert 2 stations forestland 1 station and farmland table 1 in the tibetan plateau region the rain gauge is set up above the ground and continuously records rainfall in situ soil moisture observations are made by sensors placed 4 cm below the surface at ground sites in the heihe basin which produce rainfall and soil moisture observations every 10 min in shandian river basin rainfall gauge measurements and in situ soil moisture observations are sampled every 10 or 15 min depending on when the measurement period began before june 2019 or after june 2019 in situ soil moisture measurements are derived from sensors deployed at 3 cm beneath the surface the ground observations from the shandian river basin were aggregated into a half hour time resolution the calibration and validation period for each study area using the sm2rain algorithm varies since the three study areas have different frequencies of site observations table 1 for the effect of temperature on the sensor we made temperature corrections for soil moisture saito et al 2013 kapilaratne and lu 2017 zhao et al 2020 in addition we aggregated the observation data for 1 h to avoid the effect of high frequency 10 15 min noise of in situ soil moisture gao et al 2019 surface temperature observations and smap mask information were used to remove seasonal frozen periods mostly january may and october december data huang et al 2019 gao et al 2021 the soil moisture data were normalized to the range of 0 1 when estimating rainfall using the sm2rain algorithm brocca et al 2015 2 2 2 smap level 3 soil moisture

projected onto ease 2 grid equal area scalable earth grid ver 2 these products are available through nasa the national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov for free here we used surface soil moisture data from smap level 3 version 8 spl3smp covering the period from 2016 to 2021 with a temporal resolution of 2 3 days and spatial resolution 36 km in units c m 3 c m 3 we used discrete cosine transform and penalized least square regression dct pls algorithm to fill the gaps in smap sm improving the time resolution of sm

variables covering the period from 1950 to the present hersbach et al 2020 benefiting from improvements in model processes core dynamics and data assimilation era5 has a significantly higher data quality xu et al 2022 era5 reanalyzed precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 1 h era5 precipitation data is the sum of large scale precipitation and convective precipitation here we use precipitation product to subtract snowfall to obtain rainfall product depending on the retrieval algorithm gpm the global precipitation measurement mission can provide three levels of remote sensing data products including the level 3 imerg product which is an infrared precipitation estimate generated from calibrated microwaves in addition to the integration of ground based observations which has been updated to version v06b the imerg product final run has the highest quality and is most suitable for scientific research which has a spatial coverage of s60 n60 with a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a temporal resolution of 0 5 h the rain gauges we use at ground stations are independent of the imerg precipitation data huffman et al 2019 we have obtained rainfall estimates using the probability of liquid precipitation provided by imerg huffman et al 2019 2 3 methods 2 3 1 sm2rain bayesopt model using the dynamic change information of soil moisture the sm2rain method directly estimates the total amount of rainfall between the two intervals using the soil water balance equation as the retrieval foundation specifically the soil water balance equation can be described by the following equation over non irrigated areas 1 z d s t d t p t r t e t g t where z is soil water capacity z zn z mm is soil depth and n is soil porosity brocca et al 2019 where s t is the soil relative moisture or soil relative saturation t d is the time and p t r t e t and g t mm d are the rainfall runoff evapotranspiration and drainage rate respectively brocca et al 2013a whenever it rains the evaporation rate can be safely assumed as negligible e t 0 moreover by assuming that all precipitation infiltrates into the soil the runoff rate is zero r t 0 brocca et al 2013a in the study area little rainfall 1 xiao et al 2020 he et al 2012 gao et al 2018 niu et al 2019 dai et al 2020 dai et al 2021 is directly converted into the surface runoff in alpine meadows other land cover types in the study area have strong permeability and almost no surface runoff was observed kang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 xin et al 2021 therefore it is reasonable to believe that runoff is valid to ignore in these three study areas for the drainage rate the following relation may be adopted g t a s t b where a mm d is the saturated hydraulic conductivity b is exponent related to the pore size distribution index famiglietti and wood 1994 brocca et al 2015 brocca et al 2019 rearrange equation 1 as follows 2 p t z d s t d t a s t b as described in equation 2 rainfall can be estimated by using soil relative moisture or soil relative saturation and its temporal fluctuation due to the high frequency fluctuation of soil moisture caused by the errors of the satellite soil moisture retrieval algorithm the satellite soil moisture products need to be filtered before being used as the input of sm2rain brocca et al 2019 in previous studies exponential filtering is proven to be an effective method wagner et al 1999 stroud et al 1999 su et al 2013 the recursive equation of the soil moisture index filter is as follows albergel et al 2008 3 s w i n s w i n 1 k n s t n s w i n 1 where swi is the filtered soil moisture k is the gain of t n given by the following equation 4 k n k n 1 k n 1 e t n t n 1 t assuming that the parameter t changes with swi brocca et al 2013b as the drainage rate increases with the increase of soil moisture the parameter t decreases with the increase of soil moisture brocca et al 2019 to take account of the nonlinearity of the percolation process brocca et al 2008 t is determined by two parameters tbase and tpot 5 t t b a s e s w i t p o t tbase controls the minimum value of t parameter and tpot is allowed to increase t by decreasing swi t brocca et al 2013b so far five parameters z a b tbase tpot that need to be estimated for the sm2rain algorithm constitute parameter set θ parameter estimation for complex models can be regarded as a nonlinear optimization problem to find the optimal parameter set θ opt to minimize the rmse of the objective function f 6 θ opt argmax θ r d f θ where θ is the model parameter set and r d is the d dimensional value space of the parameter the bayesian optimization process utilizes the bayesian theorem 7 p θ d p θ p d θ p d where p θ and p θ d a priori and a posteriori probability distribution of the f p d stands for the probability density function of the observed data while p d θ is the conditional probability density function of the observed data when combined with prior knowledge the bayesian algorithm was implemented in matlab 2021 bull 2011 the bayesian algorithm is to find the best parameter in a bounded region the initial parameter θ i is selected randomly in the bounded region and then the following two steps are repeated to obtain the best parameter 1 update the posterior distribution f θ based on the gaussian process model 2 find the next evaluation point θ i 1 m a x θ α i θ d 1 t that maximizes the acquisition function α θ the acquisition function is constructed from a posterior distribution of observed t data d 1 t the acquisition function is mainly to find the next best evaluation point based on prior probabilities snoek et al 2012 gelbart et al 2014 the gaussian distribution is 8 f θ 1 2 π σ exp θ μ 2 σ 2 where μ is the expectation and σ is the variance we set the parameter ranges taking into account the physical meaning and regional conditions of each parameter filippucci et al 2021 the range of optimal parameters z a b tbase tpot for most sites is respectively 0 200 0 100 0 100 0 10 0 10 of course the range of parameters varies slightly from site to site the flowchart fig 2 displays the specific workflow that was investigated in this study 2 3 2 performance metrics four metrics were used to evaluate the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm including pearson s correlation r nash sutcliffe efficiency index ns root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias between estimated rainfall and measured rainfall table 2 where r denotes the correlation between the two data sets and ranges in value from 1 1 ns range 1 which represents the estimated performance as a whole if the ns value is closer to 1 the model would be more reliable the population estimation error is represented by rmse pbias which measures the deviation between estimates and observations can be divided into three categories underestimations pbias 10 overestimations pbias greater than 10 and almost equal values pbias from 10 to 10 yang and luo 2014 3 results here we focus on the performance of sm2rain bayesopt in rainfall estimation the sm2rain bayesopt and sm2rain rainfall estimates are evaluated by comparing them with ground rainfall observation in situ and smap soil moisture were used as input terms respectively the performance of the rainfall estimation was evaluated using four performance metrics r ns rmse and pbias the dct pls method was used to fill in the gaps in the smap soil moisture product and then the smap pixels containing the rain gauge were used as input terms to estimate rainfall 3 1 optimal time step for sm2rain the sm2rain algorithm can estimate rainfall from soil moisture with different time steps so the optimal value needs to be determined in the study area to determine the daily cumulative rainfall we employed in situ sm at 1 2 3 4 6 8 and 12 hour sampling intervals and applied sm2rain fig 3 similar to the earlier study the daily rainfall s performance declines with larger sm time intervals lai et al 2022 the 1 hour sm interval had the best performance calibration period r mean 0 85 ns mean 0 73 validation period r mean 0 83 ns mean 0 60 and the 12 hour sm interval had the worst performance calibration period r mean 0 68 ns mean 1 53 validation period r mean 0 68 ns mean 0 97 therefore in this investigation cumulative rainfall was estimated using 1 hour time intervals of in situ soil moisture we used 1 hour in situ sm sampling intervals to analyze aggregated aggr rainfall performance over 1 72 h fig 4 the mean values of r and ns increased with the increase of aggr with a considerable rise throughout the phase of growing aggr from 0 to 12 h after an aggr of more than 24 h the mean values of r and ns stabilized this result is similar to previous studies brocca et al 2013a lai et al 2022 it suggests that using data with aggr longer than 24 h offers a more stable performance for the in situ soil moisture driven sm2rain algorithm therefore we used in situ soil moisture to estimate daily rainfall using 1 hour sampling intervals for smap sm the discrete cosine transform dct approach is used to fill the gap in the smap sm time series due to its revisit time of 2 3 days then using daily smap sm resolution data cumulative rainfall for 1 7 14 and 30 days was estimated saeedi et al 2022 3 2 evaluation of in situ soil moisture driven sm2rain bayesopt algorithm daily scale rainfall data are invaluable for hydrological studies here we compared the performance of in situ soil moisture as an input term to the sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms respectively for rainfall estimate of aggr 24 fig 5 it can be seen from r ns pbias and rmse that the performance of the two algorithms is very similar on the whole no matter in the calibration period or the validation period for example the sm2rain has r means of 0 86 and ns means of 0 75 respectively during the calibration periods while the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm has r means of 0 86 and ns means of 0 74 pbias and rmse for sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt are also almost the same as a result it can be concluded that when in situ soil moisture is used as an input the rainfall results estimated by the two methods often do not differ noticeably the temporal variation of rainfall estimated by sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms is demonstrated for site m5 as an example to further assess the performance of rainfall estimation utilizing in situ soil moisture as input data as seen in fig 6 the time series variation of in situ soil moisture and ground observed rainfall is very consistent and the estimated rainfall of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms match well with the variation of ground observed rainfall indicating that the performance of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms is similar for in situ soil moisture data of good quality for the in situ observation data with high frequency and good quality it can respond to the change of soil moisture in time this makes it easier to establish stable sm2rain algorithm parameters from high quality field soil moisture data even if it is only a simple parameter optimization model it is not surprising that good observation data is conducive to the construction of the model which reflects the correctness of the physical mechanism of sm2rain algorithm from the side and provides strong support for the sm2rain algorithm input by satellite sm 3 3 evaluation of smap soil moisture driven sm2rain bayesopt algorithm figs 7 and 8 compares the r and ns at each site when smap soil moisture is used as the input of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithm respectively with aggr of 1 7 14 and 30 days overall it is evident that when the aggr rises the r and ns between estimated and observed rainfall gradually increase at aggr of 7 14 and 30 r and ns are both noticeably higher than the value at aggr of 1 day the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt method is much higher than that of sm2rain and the algorithm is more effective during the calibration period than during the validation period for example in site a13 in fig 7b r improves from 0 08 to 0 54 after bayesian optimization with aggr of 1 day meanwhile in site a13 in fig 8b ns improves from 0 45 to 0 28 this demonstrates that the smap soil moisture driven sm2rain algorithm performs well using bayesian optimization in addition when using smap soil moisture to estimate rainfall data it is recommended to use estimates with aggr greater than 1 day in the calibration period the statistics of pbias of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt are p 0 0008 0 05 and the pbias of sm2rain bayesopt is closer to 0 fig 9 c this indicates that the pbias performance of sm2rain bayesopt is significantly better than sm2rain during the validation period there was no significant difference in pbias between sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt but the results of sm2rain bayesopt were closer to 0 overall sm2rain bayesopt performed better than sm2rain in r n and rmse performance but there was no significant difference fig 9 fig 10 shows the average values of r ns pbias and rmse between observed and estimated rainfall for all stations using smap soil moisture as the input term for the sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithms respectively compared with sm2rain sm2rain bayesopt improved the r and ns mean values by 3 5 and 5 8 in the calibration period and by 2 6 and 1 9 in the validation period respectively indicating that the use of bayesian optimization enhanced the robustness of sm2rain algorithm the mean value of pbias between rainfall estimated by sm2rain bayesopt and observed rainfall decreases by 4 7 during the calibration period and is closer to zero than that of the sm2rain algorithm for various values of aggr fig 10c it is worth noting that when aggr is 7 days the pbias between the estimated rainfall and the measured rainfall is the largest in calibration period the values of sm2rain and sm2rain bayesopt algorithm are 15 10 and 8 10 respectively indicating that sm2rain algorithm is more underestimating rainfall the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm is closer to the measured rainfall during the validation period for various aggr values the mean pbias values between the two rainfall estimates and the measured rainfall were in the range of 10 to 10 and both exhibited good performance during the calibration and validation periods the mean rmse between the rainfall derived by sm2rain bayesopt and the observed rainfall is lower than that of the sm2rain algorithm fig 10d indicating that the sm2rain bayesopt method demonstrates superior accuracy 3 4 parameter estimation and parameter behavior here we highlight how well the parameters behave when smap soil moisture is utilized as the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm s input term fig 11 shows the estimated parameters of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm under different land cover types the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm s parameters under various land cover types have similarities the parameter z was sensitive to how humid the climate was while the parameters a b tbase tpot did not exhibit any obvious characteristic the land cover types for sites in semi arid climate zones are primarily grassland desert and farmland and the parameter z value fluctuates below 50 mm the land cover types for sites in semi humid climate zones are alpine meadow and the parameter z value fluctuates below 100 mm and the land cover types for sites in humid climate zones are forestland and the parameter z value fluctuates below 150 mm this supports its physical mechanism and suggests that parameter z is larger in regions with wetter climates the more frequent the rainfall the stronger the infiltration of water into the soil 4 discussion in section 3 2 we found that there was no obvious difference in performance between the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm and the sm2rain algorithm for in situ soil moisture data with good data quality therefore we focused on comparing the differences between in situ and smap soil moisture as input items of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm named as the sm2rain bayesopt insitu sbi and sm2rain bayesopt smap sbs respectively secondly we did not consider the performance of rainfall estimation during the freezing period here we analyzed the rainfall estimation performance of the sm2rain algorithm during the freezing period with two representative stations in arou and yakou in addition we analyzed the performance of sbs algorithm parameters under different land cover types finally the estimated rainfall findings from sm2rain bayesopt are compared against those from the imerg satellite rainfall product and the era5 reanalysis rainfall product 4 1 sm2rain insitu versus sm2rain smap it can be seen from section 3 3 that smap soil moisture as an input of the sm2rain algorithm has poor performance for aggr 1 therefore we compared the performance of sbi and sbs algorithms in rainfall estimation for aggr 7 fig 12 during the calibration period the r and ns means for sbi algorithm r mean 0 89 ns mean 0 8 were significantly better than those of sbs algorithm r mean 0 81 ns mean 0 65 fig 12a and b the performance metrics of the validation period are similar to that of the calibration period indicating that the robustness of sbi was considerably higher than that of sbs during calibration and validation the pbias performance of sbi was closer to 0 than that of sbs and sbi showed better pbias performance fig 12c especially in the validation period sbs both overestimated rainfall and underestimated rainfall sometimes the overall rmse of the sbi algorithm in rainfall estimation was significantly lower than that of the sbs algorithm fig 12d to further analyze the differences between the sbi and sbs algorithms in rainfall estimation arou and yakou were taken as representatives and the time series curves of rainfall estimation by the sbi and sbs algorithms were compared for aggr 7 fig 13 both algorithms underestimated rainfall during peak rainfall events at arou and yakou stations but sbs underestimated rainfall more than sbi it should be noted that the temporal resolution of in situ soil moisture at the arou and yakou stations was 10 min while the temporal resolution of smap soil moisture was 1 day after filling in missing values this indicates that high frequency soil moisture data can improve the sm2rain algorithm to underestimate rainfall in the peak rainfall event lai et al 2022 4 2 the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm under different land cover types fig 14 shows the comparison of the performance of the sbs algorithm under different land cover at the aggr of 1 7 14 and 30 days during the calibration and validation periods in terms of r and ns the alpine meadow displays the best performance in comparison to other land cover types fig 14a b for the alpine meadow little rainfall 1 xiao et al 2020 is directly converted into the surface runoff in alpine meadows therefore sm2rain algorithm is very advantageous to estimate rainfall in alpine meadow during the calibration period desert and forestland performed poorly with r median values of 0 70 and 0 80 and ns median values of 0 48 and 0 64 respectively the mean pbias values in the alpine meadow and grassland over the calibration period which ranged from 10 to 10 were 2 09 and 8 02 respectively the average pbias values for the validation period were 1 52 and 12 54 during the calibration period some stations in alpine meadow and grassland underestimated rainfall but overall performance was reliable during the validation period the rainfall of the alpine meadow and grassland was both underestimated and overestimated but overestimated in general there are few sites in desert forestland and farmland and the assessment under these land cover types may be less representative the sbs algorithm tends to underestimate rainfall in deserts and farmland while tending to overestimate rainfall in forestland fig 14c however more in situ data will be required in the future to confirm this in more detail 4 3 influence of freezing period on sm2rain algorithm winter temperatures in alpine regions are lower most precipitation accumulates on the ground as snow and soil freezing results in relatively constant soil moisture the following spring with the temperature rising the melting of snow cover and frozen soil increased soil moisture chen et al 2016 tian et al 2020 the sm2rain algorithm overestimates rainfall due to the increase in soil moisture caused by snowmelt to analyze the influence of the soil freezing period on rainfall estimation by the sm2rain algorithm we selected the representative arou and yakou stations for analysis including the freezing period fig 15 depicts the temporal variations in rainfall estimated by the sm2rain insitu and sm2rain smap algorithms during the spring freezing period for aggr 7 in situ soil moisture at the arou station 3033 m fluctuated more than the smap around april 1 but the sbi rainfall estimates were much higher than the rain gauge observations and the era5 snowmelt data fig 15 thus the increase in soil moisture in situ is not only caused by rainfall and snowmelt according to the land surface temperature data observed at the station the soil at arou station alternated between freezing and melting around april 1 therefore the increase of soil moisture in arou station may be caused by the thawing of seasonal frozen soil similarly through the land surface temperature data of yakou station 4148 m it was found that the frozen soil melted around june 1 while the in situ soil moisture increased dramatically at this time this indicates that in situ soil moisture observation is sensitive to permafrost thawing the higher the elevation the later the thawing of permafrost the effect of permafrost thawing should be avoided when using in situ soil moisture to estimate rainfall at yakou station the increase rate of smap sm was slower than that of in situ sm in addition when seasonal permafrost melts at yakou station smap sm increases at a slower rate than in situ sm the paper used dct pls algorithm to fill smap soil moisture has some uncertainties this may be caused by the excessive vacancy value of smap soil water during the freezing period in the future a more robust soil water filling algorithm and considering the influence of permafrost melting can improve the accuracy of sbs rainfall estimation 4 4 comparison of different rainfall estimation fig 16 shows the comparison of the accuracy of rainfall estimated by the sbs algorithm with that of the era5 rainfall product and imerg v06b rainfall product with the measured rainfall as a reference during the calibration period for aggr 1 the mean r between sbs era5 and imerg rainfall data and observed rainfall was 0 37 0 55 and 0 45 respectively and for aggr 30 the mean r reached 0 95 0 85 and 0 84 respectively this indicates that the correlation between the rainfall estimated by the sm2rain algorithm and the observed rainfall on the daily scale is lower than that of era5 and imerg but it is opposite on the monthly scale which is consistent with the results of previous studies zhang et al 2020 fan et al 2021 the ns mean value of rainfall estimated by the sm2rain algorithm is significantly higher than that of era5 and imerg fig 16b the main reason is that era5 pbias mean 67 and imerg pbias mean 58 overestimate rainfall fig 16c however the mean value of pbias of sm2rain algorithm is between 10 10 indicating that sm2rain algorithm has a reliable performance in estimating cumulative rainfall 5 conclusions to address the uncertainty of the smap level 3 soil moisture input and parameter estimates in the sm2rain model we proposed the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm for estimating rainfall by integrating the sm2rain algorithm and bayesian optimization the performance of the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm was evaluated and compared with the original sm2rain algorithm against rain gauge data in three typical areas tibetan plateau the heihe river basin and the shandian river basin in the alpine region our results showed that the sm2rain bayesopt model outperforms the sm2rain model in terms of optimization efficiency and it can guarantee that the model with optimized parameters has a superior fitting outcome specifically the sm2rain bayesopt algorithm can increase the mean values of metrics r and ns by 3 8 and 1 9 with lower pbias and rmse at different aggr it can be concluded that the satellite sm with higher temporal resolution could further improves the performance of sm2rain algorithm on a global scale we additionally examined the impact of integrating freezing and thawing and we discovered that sm2rain bayesopt algorithm has the potential to estimate rainfall and snowmelt during the freezing period to further conform it additional investment will be required in the future credit authorship contribution statement linguang miao conceptualization methodology

1832,quantifying the causes of drought trends is critical for disaster prevention and water resource management in recent years not only climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation pre have changed but also environmental factors including vegetation restoration increased co2 concentration and land cover conversion however the role of diverse factors particularly large scale vegetation restoration in influencing drought trends is still indeterminate in this study a ball berry canopy conductance model was incorporated into the shuttleworth wallace s w model to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet in the huang huai hai yangtze river basin from 2001 to 2019 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which considers both water supply from pre and demand from pet was adopted to identify drought conditions given the complex non linear relationships in the model an interpretable machine learning model was applied to the attribution of pet and spei trends the results were as follows 1 the pre and pet showed significant upward trends whereas the change rate of pet 60 mm 10a p 0 01 was higher than that of pet 44 mm 10a p 0 1 in the region 2 the spei at an annual scale non significantly decreased at a rate of 0 12 10a p 0 1 increasing pet dominated spei trends with a contribution of 0 28 10a p 0 01 whereas increasing pre contributed 0 16 10a p 0 1 3 the interpretable machine learning model performed better than multiple linear regression in attributing pet trends 4 large scale vegetation restoration the increased leaf area index lai and wind speed were the two dominant factors influencing pet trends with contributions of 32 4 mm 10a 32 and 19 6 mm 10a 20 respectively 5 in terms of the trends in drought across the entire region the increase in lai almost offset the positive contributions of pre to spei variations hence combined with the influence of the other factors drought was non significantly accelerated keywords drought

scarcity which has negative effects on agricultural production water resource supply and the ecological environment accurately determining drought trends and the causes of drought changes in a rapidly changing environment are important for disaster prevention and water resource planning and management a concise and clear definition of drought is the condition that occurs when the demand of water exceeds the supply capacity ault 2020 where precipitation pre is the main source of water supply and the potential evapotranspiration pet the maximum evapotranspiration assuming sufficient moisture supply represents water demand wang et al 2022c in addition to the direct effects of pre on drought trends other climatic factors also affect drought by altering the pet previous studies have proved the significant feedback between pet and climatic factors including air temperature wind speed sunshine radiation relative humidity and atmospheric pressure de oliveira et al 2021 dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 han et al 2018 luo et al 2017 pour et al 2020 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhao and ma 2021 in recent years not only climatic variables but the surrounding environment has also changed considerably within the last 20 years research indicated that the world has become greener with china in particular contributing a 25 increase in leaf area to the world due to large scale vegetation restoration chen et al 2019 niu et al 2019 found that in china large scale vegetation restoration not only increased the total evapotranspiration but also changed the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration apart from the increased vegetation coverage and biomass land cover lc reflecting the vegetation and land type has also changed song et al 2018 which affects evapotranspiration properties in addition the increase in co2 concentration can affect the stomatal behavior and photosynthesis of vegetation and therefore influence evapotranspiration chen et al 2021 piao et al 2013 although large scale vegetation restoration land cover conversion and increasing co2 concentrations may substantially alter the trend in drought occurrence by affecting pet research is currently limited in this area among the numerous drought indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei developed from the standardized precipitation index considers both water supply from pre and demand from pet vicente serrano et al 2010 and has been widely used to measure the degree of drought diaz et al 2020 el kenawy et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 l shi et al 2020a wang et al 2022c the trends in spei depend on the changes in pre and pet pre can be observed with relative certainty from monitoring in meteorological stations whereas many driving factors influence pet and introduce large uncertainties into its estimates l shi et al 2020a accurate pet calculations that consider the effects of diverse driving factors are crucial for estimating drought occurrences and trends multiple methods have been developed to estimate pet valipour et al 2017 these can be classified into mass transfer temperature and radiation based and synthetic methods xiang et al 2020 however most of these methods assume a fixed underlying surface and only consider the influence of climatic factors on pet the shuttleworth wallace s w model is a two source model developed from the p m model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 that reflects the competition between transpiration and evaporation by considering a two coupled source in a resistance network zhou et al 2006 therefore it performs better than other models in calculating regional evapotranspiration bao et al 2021 in addition the s w model considers the effects of climate vegetation and land cover on evapotranspiration zhou et al 2007 some studies have applied the s w model to estimate pet by setting the soil water content at field capacity and obtained better results than traditional pet estimation methods zhang et al 2017 zhao and ma 2021 zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 in pet estimations canopy conductance or stomatal conductance is a key parameter that links the processes of transpiration and vegetation physiology including photosynthesis and stomatal behavior and reflects the effects of environmental factors such as climate vegetation type and co2 concentration on evapotranspiration at present the two main methods for estimating stomal conductance are the jarvis stewart js and ball berry bb models the js model estimates stomatal conductance by limiting the maximum stomatal conductance through a series of environmental factors including inter alia photosynthetically active radiation air temperature and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd jarvis 1976 the bb model is a semi physical mechanism model that initially constructs stomatal conductance as a function of the photosynthetic rate relative humidity rh and co2 concentration ball et al 1987 leuning 1995 revised the bb model by replacing rh with vpd as its physical mechanism reflects the effects of diverse environmental factors on stomatal conductance some studies have applied the bb model to evapotranspiration and achieved better performances bao et al 2022 hu et al 2017 hu et al 2013 yu et al 2004 simplified the bb model and used the gross assimilation rate instead of the photosynthetic rate the pml v2 evapotranspiration model which uses the bb stomatal conductance model proposed by yu et al 2004 has markedly improved the accuracy of modeling global evapotranspiration gan et al 2018 y zhang et al 2019b understanding the drivers of drought and pet trends depends on an appropriate attribution method in the past correlation coefficients sensitivity analyses multiple linear regression mlr and partial differential methods have been applied to attribute pet trends the correlation coefficient qualitatively describes the linear relationship between pet and driving factors de oliveira et al 2021 luo et al 2017 sensitivity analyses determine the sensitivity of pet to a single driving factor assuming that all other factors are fixed liu et al 2018 pour et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 mlr estimates the relative contributions of different factors to pet trends han et al 2018 wang et al 2017 whereas partial differential methods calculate the absolute contributions of each climatic driver dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 tang and tang 2021 however the structure of the s w model is complex and many factors affect pet trends especially a strong non linear relationship exists between lai and pet zhou et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 these methods do not account for non linear relationships and thus cannot fully attribute the pet trends to the driving factors machine learning ml models with a strong ability to build and mine complicated and non linear relationships have been applied to model evapotranspiration bai et al 2021 however ml is classified as a black box model and is therefore difficult to interpret hence most studies using this model focused primarily on pet modeling and prediction and rarely on pet trend attributions ferreira and frança 2020a saggi and jain 2019 h yu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 the emerging shapley additive explanations shap method proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 is a unified framework used to interpret the predictions of ml the combination of ml and shap is called interpretable machine learning and has been used in many fields shap expresses the output of ml models as the sum of shap values i e the contributions of all features to the model output which is similar to the form of mlr benefiting from this additivity shap can attribute pet trends modeled by ml to diverse drivers the huang huai hai yangtze hhhy river basin is a generic term for the four main river basins in china the region has a dense population and rapidly developing economy that has undergone significant climate and underlying surface changes in recent years in this study we incorporated a bb model based canopy conductance model into the s w model to estimate the daily pet from 2001 2019 in the hhhy and then calculated the spei at an annual scale as the s w model considers more than just climatic factors and is relatively complex we attempted to build a non linear relationship between pet and driving factors using extreme gradient boosting xgboost model and then used shap to separate the respective contributions of diverse driving factors to pet trends the main objectives of this study were to determine the changes in drought and pet in the hhhy and quantify the effects of diverse drivers especially the large scale vegetation restoration on drought and pet trends in rapidly changing environments 2 study area and data 2 1

considering both water supply and demand this method is based on the difference between monthly precipitation and pet water deficit the three parameter log logistic probability distribution was used to fit the probability density distribution of water deficit and spei can be calculated as the value of standardized cumulative probability distribution of water deficit um et al 2022 uml et al 2017 the pre data from the meteorological stations and the pet estimated by the s w model were used to calculate the spei the detailed calculation process can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 spei has different timescales and can therefore represent drought conditions at different time scales in this study spei at an annual 12 month scale was applied to represent the drought conditions in 1 year in addition the degree of drought was divided into five categories according to the spei value as shown in table 1 3 4 trends estimation method a linear slope was used to estimate the trend of a time series over a period this was computed as follows 24 slope y n i 1 n i y i i 1 n i i 1 n y i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope y represents the linear change rate of the time series y i is the serial number of the year yi is the value in the year and n is the total number of years n 19 in this study when the slope y is negative the time series decreases and when the slope y is positive the time series increases the absolute value of slope y represents the degree of variation in addition f test was used to test the significance of linear trend 3 5 attributing spei and pet trends using a combination of xgboost and shap according to the calculations of spei and pei spei is a function of pre and pet whereas pet is mainly a function of t rs rh ws ap lai co2 concentration co2 and the proportions of the 14 land cover types xgboost is a type of boosting ensemble algorithm of machine learning chen and guestrin 2016 it has a strong ability to model complex and non linear relationships and has been used in previous studies to build relationships between pet and diverse climatic factors ferreira and frança 2020b wu et al 2021 in this study we first built relationships between spei pet and driving factors using xgboost to obtain the complex structure between the pet and driving factors we modeled pet at a daily timestep whereas spei was modeled with a monthly time step because of its relatively few influential variables and simple structure shap proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 is a unified framework for interpreting predictions in this study we used shap to separate the pet and spei trends contributed by each driving factor based on shap each spei and pet value output by xgboost was expressed as the accumulation of shap values and contributions to the model output for diverse driving factors and the actual spei and pet values were expressed as follows 25 spei ϕ 0 ϕ pre ϕ pet ε 26 pet ϕ 0 ϕ t ϕ rs ϕ rh ϕ ws ϕ ap ϕ lai ϕ c o 2 ϕ lc ε where ϕ 0 is the baseline value and a constant ε represents the errors i e the portions that could not be modeled by xgboost ϕpre and ϕpet are the shap values for pre and pet respectively from the modeling of spei using xgboost and ϕt ϕrs ϕrh ϕws ϕap ϕlai ϕco2 and ϕlc are the shap values for t rs rh ws ap lai co2 and lc respectively from the modeling of pet using xgboost it should be noted that ϕlc is the sum of all shap values for the 14 land cover factors taking the linear slopes from both sides of eqs 25 and 26 the spei and pet trends were expressed as follows 27 slope s p e i slope ϕ pre slope ϕ pet δ 28 slope p e t slope ϕ t slope ϕ rs slope ϕ rh slope ϕ ws slope ϕ ap slope ϕ lai slope ϕ c o 2 slope ϕ lc δ where slope spei and slope pet represent the trends in spei and pet respectively slope ϕpre and slope ϕpet are the absolute contributions of pre and pet to spei trends respectively slope ϕt slope ϕrs slope ϕrh slope ϕws slope ϕap slope ϕlai slope ϕco2 and slope ϕlc are the absolute contributions of t rs rh ws ap lai co2 and lc to pet trends respectively and δ represents the error that cannot be attributed the relative contribution rate was also calculated as the ratio of the absolute values of contribution of each driving factor to the sum of all absolute values of contributions han et al 2018 in previous studies the contributions of driving factors to pet trends have often been estimated based on mlr for comparison mlr was also applied in this study to model the daily pet and the partial differential method which is also an mlr based method was used to attribute the pet trends zheng et al 2009 in addition to measure the performance of modeling and attribution of interpretable ml and mlr we adopted three indices the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae mehdizadeh 2018 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial trends in pre pet and spei fig 2 shows the distribution and spatiotemporal variation of pet and pre across the hhhy from 2001 to 2019 the multi year mean pet exhibited a decreasing spatial pattern from east to west ranging from 132 to 3115 mm fig 2a whereas the multi year pre had a declining distribution from southeast to northwest ranging from 135 to 2336 mm fig 2b for the temporal variation the average annual pet showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 60 mm 10a p 0 01 fig 2e and pre also showed an increasing trend but at a rate of 44 mm 10a p 0 1 which was lower than that of pet fig 2f spatially pet generally increased across the region particularly in the harb and yerb fig 2c the pre showed an upward trend in most regions but had a significant downward trend in the eastern part of the region especially in the hurb and southwestern yarb fig 2d according to the results presented in table 2 the pet and pre at a river basin scale showed an upward trend in the harb and yerb but the increasing rates of the pet were greater than those of the pre and the trends were more significant in the hurb the pet increased non significantly at a rate of 26 4 mm 10a p 0 1 whereas the pre decreased non significantly at a rate of 30 4 mm 10a p 0 1 thus resulting in a non significant difference of 56 8 mm 10a p 0 1 between the pet and pre in the yarb the increasing rate of the pet did not reach that of the pre in addition the proportion of area with increase in pre was slightly larger than that with increase in pet overall the results demonstrate that the increased pet exceeded the increase in pre but their difference was not significant fig 3 a e show the temporal trends in the spei from 2001 to 2019 the spei decreased non significantly in the harb yerb and hurb at rates of 0 46 10a p 0 1 0 27 10a p 0 1 and 0 23 10a p 0 1 respectively moreover the proportions of the area where drought events occurred spei 1 0 also increased by 15 4 10a p 0 1 8 7 10a p 0 1 and 4 5 10a p 0 1 in the harb yerb and hurb respectively however the spei in the yarb increased slightly at a rate of 0 03 10a p 0 1 and the proportions of the area where drought events occurred also showed a slight decrease at a rate of 2 6 10a p 0 1 in the whole region of the hhhy the spei and proportions of the area with drought events occurring showed a non significant downtrend 0 12 10a p 0 1 and a non significant uptrend 2 7 10a p 0 1 which was consistent with that pre increased more than pet and their difference was not significant spatially areas with significant downtrends in spei were mostly distributed in the north and southwest of the hhhy fig 3 f overall the results show that drought showed a non significant accelerating trend in the hhhy 4 2 contributions of pre and pet to trends in spei using xgboost and shap the respective contributions of the pre and pet to the spei trends were estimated using eq 27 as shown in fig 4 d the actual spei trends i e slope spei were consistent with the predicted spei trends i e slope ϕ in all grids which proved the efficiency of xgboost and shap to attribute spei trends the r2 value was close to 1 and the mae and rmse were 0 00026 and 0 00031 respectively the spatial contributions of the pre and pet to the spei trends are illustrated in fig 4 a and b the increased pre trends evidently contributed increasing spei trends whereas the increased pet trends contributed decreasing spei trends the study compared the contributions of the pre and pet to the spei trends at the river basin scale fig 4 c and the results show that the pet dominated the spei trends in the hhhy in the harb the pre showed positive contributions and pet showed negative contributions to spei in almost all areas however the pet contributed 0 59 10a p 0 01 to the spei trends and the pre contributed 0 13 10a p 0 1 thus leading to a non significant decrease in the spei in the yerb the pre contributed almost positive trends and pet contributed almost negative trends to the spei with total contributions of 0 19 10a p 0 01 and 0 46 10a p 0 1 for the pre and pet respectively which also caused a non significant decline in the spei the pre and pet all negatively contributed to the spei trends in most areas of the hurb pre and pet non significantly contributed 0 18 10a p 0 1 and 0 06 10a p 0 1 to the spei trend respectively in the yarb significant positive contributions from the pre 0 22 10a p 0 1 offset the significant negative contributions from the pet 0 19 10a p 0 05 which non significantly raised the spei in the entire region the negative effects of the pet 0 28 10a p 0 01 outweighed the positive effects of the pre on the spei trends 0 16 10a p 0 1 overall the increased pet counteracted the increased pre in the hhhy which resulted in a non significant decrease in the spei 4 3 variations in factors driving pet trends fig 5 shows the spatial trends of the seven factors driving pet trends during the period 2001 2019 and table 3 counts trends in the river basin scale t showed upward trends in most areas approximately 78 4 of the hhhy with an average slope of 0 241 10a p 0 05 indicating the occurrence of climatic warming the trends of t were significant in most sub regions except for the harb rs showed a non significant downtrend with a slope of 0 123 mj m 2 10a p 0 1 and decreased in most areas approximately 64 1 of the hhhy except in the yerb the trends of rs in sub regions of the hhhy were not significant rh decreased in 55 7 of the hhhy areas with an average slope of 0 04 10a p 0 1 only in the harb the trend of rh was significant p 0 1 ws showed a significant uptrend with an average slope of 0 068 m s 1 10a p 0 01 and increased in 64 1 of the hhhy areas especially in the yarb 70 of the area however ws decreased in most areas in the hurb the increasing trend of ws was significant in the yerb and yarb and not significant in the harb and the decreasing trend in the hurb was also significant trends in ap showed strong spatial variability and downward trends in most areas and the average slope was 0 129 p 0 01 ap showed a decreasing trend in all sub regions of the hhhy and the trend was significant in most regions except in the hurb large scale vegetation restoration occurred in the hhhy and lai had increased in over 90 of the area with an average increase rate of 0 12 10a p 0 01 in all sub regions of the hhhy lai has a significant uptrend in addition the co2 concentration had been increasing significantly at a rate of 22 13 ppm 10a p 0 01 from approximately 370 ppm in 2001 to about 410 ppm in 2019 table 4 shows the variation rates of area proportion for each lc type the land cover transfer matrixes are shown in supplementary table s1 s5 in the entire hhhy river basin the main increasing lc was forest land fo including enf ebf dnf dbf and mf with the main decreasing lc types being wsa and gr the main conversion was wsa to fo and gr to sa and fa 4 4 contribution estimation of driving factors to trends in pet and spei like the attribution of spei trends xgboost and shap were applied to quantitatively attribute various driving factors to pet trends we first validated the performance of xgboost in modeling the daily pet and then compared it with mlr we selected 1 000 grids randomly since it is time consuming and requires high computing power to run 32 487 grids for 50 fold cross validation as shown in fig 6 a and b scatters of the daily pet simulated by s w model and predicted by xgboost were uniformly distributed around the diagonal line i e the black dotted line and scatters of daily pet simulated by s w model and predicted by mlr were more dispersed the average r2 mae and rmse of xgboost were 0 986 0 19 and 0 28 respectively which were better than those of mlr 0 921 0 50 and 0 68 respectively overall xgboost performed better than mlr in modeling daily pet this study also compared the actual pet trends with the predicted pet trends contributed by all driving factors as shown in fig 6 c and d xgboost shap also performed better than mlr in attributing pet trends with an r2 mae and rmse of 1 00 0 10 and 0 11 respectively therefore it can be deduced that mlr would cause larger errors than xgboost and shap when attributing pet trends fig 7 shows the spatial contributions of different factors to the pet trends evidently increased t rs ws had positive effects on pet trends whereas increased rh and ap had negative effects on pet trends the increased lai also positively affected pet trends but lai contributed more to increased pet in the north than south of the hhhy the rising co2 concentrations had contradictory contributions to the pet trends in different regions given that an interaction existed among the proportions of different land use types we considered land use factors as one factor where their contributions were the sum of all land cover factors in this study table 5 lists various factors absolute contributions and relative contribution rates to the pet trends in the harb the increased rs and lai and the decreased rh dominated pet trends and particularly lai contributed 56 7 mm 10a which was almost half of the pet trend in the yerb lai was also the dominant factor and contributed to more than half of the pet trends in the hurb the increased lai was the dominant factor and contributed positively to pet trends whereas the decreased ws was the dominant factor that negatively contributed to pet trends in the yarb ws contributed the most to the increase in pet which was greater than lai while lc contributed the most to the decrease in pet in the entire hhhy river basin the increased ws and lai were the two dominant factors driving pet trends with contributions of 19 6 mm 10a and 32 4 mm 10a respectively by allocating the contributions of pet to spei trends to each driving factor driving pet trends we calculated the contributions of different drivers to the spei trend at the basin scale in the harb pre rh and lai were the dominant factors driving spei trends in particular vegetation growth led to a decrease in spei 0 26 10a which far exceeded the positive contribution from pre fig 8 a in the yerb pre and lai were the primary factors driving spei trends and the negative effects of lai also exceeded the positive effects of pre fig 8 b in the hurb pre ws and lai dominated the spei trends and pre and lai all showed negative contributions whereas ws contributed positively fig 8 c in the yarb pre and ws were the two dominant driving factors causing pet to increase by 0 22 10a and to decline by 0 13 10a respectively whereas lai resulted in a spei decline of only 0 09 10a fig 8 d over the entire region pre rs and lc caused spei to increase and t rh ws ap lai and co2 caused a decrease in spei pre and lai were the two dominated factors driving pet trends and the contributions of lai almost offset the positive effects of pre on spei trends in conclusion vegetation restoration has counteracted the alleviating effects of increased pre to drought thus exacerbating drought when superimposed on the effects of other factors 5 discussion 5 1 drivers of pet and drought in this study the climatic factors were ranked in the ascending order of ws t rh rs and ap based on the corresponding contribution rates to pet trends however according to the importance to pet trend climatic factors rank in the order of t rs rh ws and ap which is consistent with the finding of chakraborty et al 2021 as shown in supplementary fig s1 it is because that the contribution depends not only the importance to pet but the self variation rate of each influential factors a positive correlation existed between pet and ws because ws reduces aerodynamic resistance zhou et al 2006 our results indicate that ws was the dominant climatic factor driving pet trends which is consistent with recent studies showing that increased ws has dominated the rise in pet in recent years although ws has undergone a long term downward trend in the past thus leading to a decrease in pet dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 han et al 2018 however in 36 of the areas in the hhhy especially hurb ws has decreased in the last 20 years fig 7 d and negatively contributed to the pet change fig 7 d the influence of t on pet is complex t promotes pet by increasing the vpd t increased pet by increasing photosynthetic rate under a certain threshold but decreases it beyond a certain threshold gan et al 2018 y zhang et al 2019b overall an increase in t promotes pet dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 han et al 2018 although climate warming is a primary trend we also found that t showed a downward trend in 29 3 of the area from 2001 to 2019 and led to a decrease in pet fig 7 a decreased rh increased the vpd reflecting a water deficit thus negatively contributing to pet trends de oliveira et al 2021 han et al 2018 wang et al 2017 although the total contribution of rh to the pet trends was not significant across the entire region decreased rh markedly increased pet in the northern hhhy particularly in the harb and hurb fig 7 c rs is the direct energy driver for evapotranspiration but was not the dominant factor affecting pet trends at the river basin scale because of the insignificance of its trends table 3 an increased ap promoted the pet by increasing the air density and restrained it by increasing the latent heat of water vaporization ap was negatively correlated with the pet overall but the pet was not sensitive to ap zhao and ma 2021 in recent years large scale vegetation restoration has become a global phenomenon in this study we used the lai to represent vegetation dynamics which could also be used in the s w model to estimate pet increased lai promoted pet in the following ways 1 more solar radiation was allocated to the canopy transpiration than to soil evaporation 2 the canopy resistance and canopy boundary layer resistance decreased and 3 the soil heat flux density decreased although lai increased in most areas of the hhhy and the north south gap of the rising rate was not prominent its contributions to the pet increase in the three northern river basins were greater than those in the south of the hhhy fig 7 f according to eq 12 eq 16 and eq 22 reciprocal and exponential relationships exist in lai influencing pet and the effects of lai on pet decrease when the absolute lai value increases previous studies have also noted a strong non linear relationship between lai and pet zhou et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 and the sensitivity of pet to lai decreases with increasing lai zhao et al 2016 therefore because of the lower vegetation cover in the north than south the same increased lai contributed more to the pet increase in the north than south an increase in co2 generally affects pet due to its interaction with vegetation previous studies have focused on the negative effects of increased co2 concentrations on evapotranspiration by closing the stomata gui et al 2021 liao et al 2021 x zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2022 however we obtained a contradictory conclusion that increased co2 concentrations had both positive and negative effects on pet trends spatially according to eqs 18 and 19 increased co2 concentration can not only decrease stomatal conductance but also increase it by promoting the photosynthetic rate and the gross primary production gpp recent studies have also reported that co2 fertilization can counteract the stomatal closure effect on trends in evapotranspiration and runoff by promoting vegetation growth zhang et al 2022 the results show that environmental changes particularly large scale vegetation restoration contribute more to pet trends than climate change our results are inconsistent with the conclusion of zhao and ma 2021 which state that climatic factors particularly temperature are more important than vegetation and energy in pet trends although zhao and ma 2021 also used the s w model to estimate pet the differences in the results could be explained by three reasons firstly we used a bb model to calculate the canopy resistance whereas they used the js model secondly the attribution method was different an interpretable ml model that combined xgboost and shap and focused on non linear relationships was used in our study whereas they used linear regressions lastly the study area period and data resources were different there are counteracting effects of increasing pre and pet on drought especially in last 20 years for example rising precipitation offset the effect of increasing et on water scarcity in over northern part of china during 2001 2020 huang et al 2023 our study revealed that the increasing pet dominated the downtrends of spei compared with pre previous study has also found that changes in pet were the dominant driver to drought variations in 60 areas of the yerb wang et al 2022c however the effect of large scale vegetation restoration on pet increase was often not considered thus the drought may be underestimated when ignoring the water consumption capacity of vegetation in the main grain production area of china spei calculated by s w model based pei considering vegetation was more correlated with soil moisture standardized anomaly than penman monteith based spei indicating the efficiency of s w model in estimating pet and spei zhao and ma 2021 the increasing pet was similarly the main driver of increasing drought 5 2 the interactive relationship between vegetation and drought in this study vegetation restoration significantly increased the pet and exceeded the increase in the pre almost offsetting the increasing effects of pre on the spei trends thus vegetation is a key factor in drought control however many previous studies have found that drought is a limiting factor for vegetation growth for example deng et al 2021 found that extreme drought results in the largest reduction in gpp a slight decrease in net ecosystem productivity and a reduced lai c xu et al 2019a indicated that extreme droughts had increasingly stronger effects on the gpp therefore drought and vegetation are mutually influenced some studies on the interaction between vegetation climate and hydrology have indicated that vegetation can adjust its coverage and achieve a water heat balanced state in its long evolutionary process of the natural state cong et al 2017 mo et al 2016 y zhang et al 2021b vegetation is not only affected by climatic factors but also human activity some studies have shown that anthropogenic factors such as the implementation of ecological restoration projects have dominated vegetation restoration beyond natural restrictions qi et al 2019 y shi et al 2020b over vegetation restoration has resulted in a series of consequences in the water cycle in addition to increasing total evapotranspiration and the proportion of transpiration to evaporation increased vegetation coverage has also led to soil drying and reduced runoff jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 these findings also confirm the accelerating effect of increased lai on drought in the harb and yerb where ecological restoration projects were mainly implemented the accelerating effects of lai have considerably exceeded the reducing effects of pre on drought fig 8 in recent years several studies have reported decreased runoff in the harb and yerb bin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2014 5 3 the application of the interpretable ml in pet attribution machine learning has become increasingly popular in simulating potential reference and actual evapotranspiration benefiting from its strong ability to model non linear relationships ml algorithms used in modeling evapotranspiration include catboost xgboost random forest gradient boosting decision tree deep learning methods artificial neural networks convolutional neural networks and support vector machines fan et al 2018 ferreira and frança 2020b hu et al 2021 huang et al 2019 saggi and jain 2019 wu et al 2021 h yu et al 2020a due to the characteristics of a black box model it is difficult to explain the ml outputs although ml has a strong ability to model complex non linear relationships previous studies mainly focused on modeling and predictions of pet using ml but have not applied it in attribution recently the emerging shap method has endowed ml with interpretability which is termed interpretable ml shap separates the output of ml as the accumulation of shap values of different features and can be used to quantitatively measure the effects of diverse drivers on the study object this method has been used in many domains such as for runoff s wang et al 2022a groundwater level liu et al 2022 water quality wang et al 2021 s wang et al 2022b and grassland degradation batunacun et al 2021 based on a review of the literature there are few applications of shap in analyzing evapotranspiration at present hu et al 2021 used shap to identify the effects of different features on evapotranspiration and found that net radiation was the most important feature in different models chakraborty et al 2021 used the global interpretability of shap and revealed that the order of importance of climatic factors to et0 was rs t rh ws ap however the two applications only revealed the macro relationship between evapotranspiration and the driving factors in shap and the relative importance of each factor in this study we quantitatively estimated the respective contributions of diverse drivers to pet trends by calculating the linear slopes of the shap values for diverse features based on the additivity of shap as shown in fig 6 regardless of cross validation or attribution xgboost and shap performed better than the traditional linear based method also proving the non linear relationships between pet and driving factors 5 4 uncertainties some uncertainties exist in this study firstly a spatial resolution of 10 km was used in this study which may neglect the heterogeneity of the underlying surface to some extent though we have considered the proportions of different land cover types in each computing unit the rugged or steep terrain and climatic difference were ignored secondly we used daily observation data from meteorological stations and interpolated it to each grid using the radial basis function method because of the dispersion of data in stations the spatial patterns of climatic factors produced by interpolation were extremely scattered in addition different interpolation methods may bring discrepant results especially in areas with few meteorological stations thirdly lc mainly had negative contributions to pet trends across the region particularly in the yarb this is probably because that the conversion of land cover from 2001 to 2019 reduced the stomatal conductance the main conversion was from wsa to fo although fo has more evapotranspiration rates at the canopy sale because it is generally denser and has a greater lai than was fo had lower stomatal conductance than wsa at the stoma scale thus the conversion from wsa to fo resulted in a decrease in pet after eliminating the influence of lai however the effects of conversion in land cover to pet were complicated which may bring uncertainties to pet estimation finally the influential variables were not completely independent from each other which may bring some uncertainties to the results of attribution for pet and spei trends on the one hand there are considerable correlations in climatic factors dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 for example if precipitation is high the relative humidity will be high on the other hand there is a reciprocal feedback relationship between climate factors and vegetation dynamics vegetation change is affected by climatic change and the vegetation restoration will also change regional climate in china the vegetation increase has resulted in surface cooling of 0 11 c and a precipitation increase of 0 02 mm d during summer with the analysis of a high resolution land atmosphere coupled regional climate mode l yu et al 2020b however how much of the precipitation increase is due to vegetation restoration and climate change remains to be resolved 6 conclusions drought trends are influenced by the variations in pre and pet but pet is not only affected by climatic factors but also environmental factors including vegetation co2 concentration and land cover in this study the s w model and revised bb stomatal conductance model were combined to estimate the daily pet in the hhhy from 2001 to 2019 during the study period pet increased by 60 mm 10a p 0 01 which exceeded the increase in pre by 44 mm 10a p 0 1 spei at an annual scale was estimated and showed a non significant decrease at a rate of 0 12 10a p 0 1 considering the complex non linear relationships in the s w model we proposed an interpretable ml based method to estimate contributions of diverse driving factors to spei and pet trends this method has considered the complex non linear relationships and performed better than the traditional linear based method pet contributed 0 28 10a p 0 01 to the spei trend whereas pre contributed only 0 16 10a p 0 1 for the pet trend according to the relative contribution rate these influential factors were ranked in the ascending order of lai ws lc co2 t rh rs and ap environmental factors especially the increased lai contributed more to pet trends than climatic factors lai and ws were the two dominant factors with contributions of 19 6 mm 10a 20 and 32 4 mm 10a 32 respectively by allocating the contributions of pet to the spei and diverse factors we quantified the causes of drought large scale vegetation restoration almost offset the positive effects of increased pre on spei variation combined with the influence of other factors drought was non significantly accelerated in the hhhy this study provides a combined method for estimating pet that reflects the effects of both climatic and environmental factors and an interpretable ml based method for attributing pet and spei trends which could be used as a reference by other studies however the feedback between climate change and vegetation dynamics were not considered in this study and need a further study credit

1832,quantifying the causes of drought trends is critical for disaster prevention and water resource management in recent years not only climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation pre have changed but also environmental factors including vegetation restoration increased co2 concentration and land cover conversion however the role of diverse factors particularly large scale vegetation restoration in influencing drought trends is still indeterminate in this study a ball berry canopy conductance model was incorporated into the shuttleworth wallace s w model to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet in the huang huai hai yangtze river basin from 2001 to 2019 the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which considers both water supply from pre and demand from pet was adopted to identify drought conditions given the complex non linear relationships in the model an interpretable machine learning model was applied to the attribution of pet and spei trends the results were as follows 1 the pre and pet showed significant upward trends whereas the change rate of pet 60 mm 10a p 0 01 was higher than that of pet 44 mm 10a p 0 1 in the region 2 the spei at an annual scale non significantly decreased at a rate of 0 12 10a p 0 1 increasing pet dominated spei trends with a contribution of 0 28 10a p 0 01 whereas increasing pre contributed 0 16 10a p 0 1 3 the interpretable machine learning model performed better than multiple linear regression in attributing pet trends 4 large scale vegetation restoration the increased leaf area index lai and wind speed were the two dominant factors influencing pet trends with contributions of 32 4 mm 10a 32 and 19 6 mm 10a 20 respectively 5 in terms of the trends in drought across the entire region the increase in lai almost offset the positive contributions of pre to spei variations hence combined with the influence of the other factors drought was non significantly accelerated keywords drought

scarcity which has negative effects on agricultural production water resource supply and the ecological environment accurately determining drought trends and the causes of drought changes in a rapidly changing environment are important for disaster prevention and water resource planning and management a concise and clear definition of drought is the condition that occurs when the demand of water exceeds the supply capacity ault 2020 where precipitation pre is the main source of water supply and the potential evapotranspiration pet the maximum evapotranspiration assuming sufficient moisture supply represents water demand wang et al 2022c in addition to the direct effects of pre on drought trends other climatic factors also affect drought by altering the pet previous studies have proved the significant feedback between pet and climatic factors including air temperature wind speed sunshine radiation relative humidity and atmospheric pressure de oliveira et al 2021 dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 han et al 2018 luo et al 2017 pour et al 2020 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 zhao and ma 2021 in recent years not only climatic variables but the surrounding environment has also changed considerably within the last 20 years research indicated that the world has become greener with china in particular contributing a 25 increase in leaf area to the world due to large scale vegetation restoration chen et al 2019 niu et al 2019 found that in china large scale vegetation restoration not only increased the total evapotranspiration but also changed the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration apart from the increased vegetation coverage and biomass land cover lc reflecting the vegetation and land type has also changed song et al 2018 which affects evapotranspiration properties in addition the increase in co2 concentration can affect the stomatal behavior and photosynthesis of vegetation and therefore influence evapotranspiration chen et al 2021 piao et al 2013 although large scale vegetation restoration land cover conversion and increasing co2 concentrations may substantially alter the trend in drought occurrence by affecting pet research is currently limited in this area among the numerous drought indices the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei developed from the standardized precipitation index considers both water supply from pre and demand from pet vicente serrano et al 2010 and has been widely used to measure the degree of drought diaz et al 2020 el kenawy et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 l shi et al 2020a wang et al 2022c the trends in spei depend on the changes in pre and pet pre can be observed with relative certainty from monitoring in meteorological stations whereas many driving factors influence pet and introduce large uncertainties into its estimates l shi et al 2020a accurate pet calculations that consider the effects of diverse driving factors are crucial for estimating drought occurrences and trends multiple methods have been developed to estimate pet valipour et al 2017 these can be classified into mass transfer temperature and radiation based and synthetic methods xiang et al 2020 however most of these methods assume a fixed underlying surface and only consider the influence of climatic factors on pet the shuttleworth wallace s w model is a two source model developed from the p m model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 that reflects the competition between transpiration and evaporation by considering a two coupled source in a resistance network zhou et al 2006 therefore it performs better than other models in calculating regional evapotranspiration bao et al 2021 in addition the s w model considers the effects of climate vegetation and land cover on evapotranspiration zhou et al 2007 some studies have applied the s w model to estimate pet by setting the soil water content at field capacity and obtained better results than traditional pet estimation methods zhang et al 2017 zhao and ma 2021 zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2008 in pet estimations canopy conductance or stomatal conductance is a key parameter that links the processes of transpiration and vegetation physiology including photosynthesis and stomatal behavior and reflects the effects of environmental factors such as climate vegetation type and co2 concentration on evapotranspiration at present the two main methods for estimating stomal conductance are the jarvis stewart js and ball berry bb models the js model estimates stomatal conductance by limiting the maximum stomatal conductance through a series of environmental factors including inter alia photosynthetically active radiation air temperature and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd jarvis 1976 the bb model is a semi physical mechanism model that initially constructs stomatal conductance as a function of the photosynthetic rate relative humidity rh and co2 concentration ball et al 1987 leuning 1995 revised the bb model by replacing rh with vpd as its physical mechanism reflects the effects of diverse environmental factors on stomatal conductance some studies have applied the bb model to evapotranspiration and achieved better performances bao et al 2022 hu et al 2017 hu et al 2013 yu et al 2004 simplified the bb model and used the gross assimilation rate instead of the photosynthetic rate the pml v2 evapotranspiration model which uses the bb stomatal conductance model proposed by yu et al 2004 has markedly improved the accuracy of modeling global evapotranspiration gan et al 2018 y zhang et al 2019b understanding the drivers of drought and pet trends depends on an appropriate attribution method in the past correlation coefficients sensitivity analyses multiple linear regression mlr and partial differential methods have been applied to attribute pet trends the correlation coefficient qualitatively describes the linear relationship between pet and driving factors de oliveira et al 2021 luo et al 2017 sensitivity analyses determine the sensitivity of pet to a single driving factor assuming that all other factors are fixed liu et al 2018 pour et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 mlr estimates the relative contributions of different factors to pet trends han et al 2018 wang et al 2017 whereas partial differential methods calculate the absolute contributions of each climatic driver dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 tang and tang 2021 however the structure of the s w model is complex and many factors affect pet trends especially a strong non linear relationship exists between lai and pet zhou et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 these methods do not account for non linear relationships and thus cannot fully attribute the pet trends to the driving factors machine learning ml models with a strong ability to build and mine complicated and non linear relationships have been applied to model evapotranspiration bai et al 2021 however ml is classified as a black box model and is therefore difficult to interpret hence most studies using this model focused primarily on pet modeling and prediction and rarely on pet trend attributions ferreira and frança 2020a saggi and jain 2019 h yu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 the emerging shapley additive explanations shap method proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 is a unified framework used to interpret the predictions of ml the combination of ml and shap is called interpretable machine learning and has been used in many fields shap expresses the output of ml models as the sum of shap values i e the contributions of all features to the model output which is similar to the form of mlr benefiting from this additivity shap can attribute pet trends modeled by ml to diverse drivers the huang huai hai yangtze hhhy river basin is a generic term for the four main river basins in china the region has a dense population and rapidly developing economy that has undergone significant climate and underlying surface changes in recent years in this study we incorporated a bb model based canopy conductance model into the s w model to estimate the daily pet from 2001 2019 in the hhhy and then calculated the spei at an annual scale as the s w model considers more than just climatic factors and is relatively complex we attempted to build a non linear relationship between pet and driving factors using extreme gradient boosting xgboost model and then used shap to separate the respective contributions of diverse driving factors to pet trends the main objectives of this study were to determine the changes in drought and pet in the hhhy and quantify the effects of diverse drivers especially the large scale vegetation restoration on drought and pet trends in rapidly changing environments 2 study area and data 2 1

various land cover types and average lai values considering the heterogeneity of the underlying surface corresponding to each land cover type were counted in each grid 3 methodologies 3 1 shuttleworth

considering both water supply and demand this method is based on the difference between monthly precipitation and pet water deficit the three parameter log logistic probability distribution was used to fit the probability density distribution of water deficit and spei can be calculated as the value of standardized cumulative probability distribution of water deficit um et al 2022 uml et al 2017 the pre data from the meteorological stations and the pet estimated by the s w model were used to calculate the spei the detailed calculation process can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 spei has different timescales and can therefore represent drought conditions at different time scales in this study spei at an annual 12 month scale was applied to represent the drought conditions in 1 year in addition the degree of drought was divided into five categories according to the spei value as shown in table 1 3 4 trends estimation method a linear slope was used to estimate the trend of a time series over a period this was computed as follows 24 slope y n i 1 n i y i i 1 n i i 1 n y i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope y represents the linear change rate of the time series y i is the serial number of the year yi is the value in the year and n is the total number of years n 19 in this study when the slope y is negative the time series decreases and when the slope y is positive the time series increases the absolute value of slope y represents the degree of variation in addition f test was used to test the significance of linear trend 3 5 attributing spei and pet trends using a combination of xgboost and shap according to the calculations of spei and pei spei is a function of pre and pet whereas pet is mainly a function of t rs rh ws ap lai co2 concentration co2 and the proportions of the 14 land cover types xgboost is a type of boosting ensemble algorithm of machine learning chen and guestrin 2016 it has a strong ability to model complex and non linear relationships and has been used in previous studies to build relationships between pet and diverse climatic factors ferreira and frança 2020b wu et al 2021 in this study we first built relationships between spei pet and driving factors using xgboost to obtain the complex structure between the pet and driving factors we modeled pet at a daily timestep whereas spei was modeled with a monthly time step because of its relatively few influential variables and simple structure shap proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 is a unified framework for interpreting predictions in this study we used shap to separate the pet and spei trends contributed by each driving factor based on shap each spei and pet value output by xgboost was expressed as the accumulation of shap values and contributions to the model output for diverse driving factors and the actual spei and pet values were expressed as follows 25 spei ϕ 0 ϕ pre ϕ pet ε 26 pet ϕ 0 ϕ t ϕ rs ϕ rh ϕ ws ϕ ap ϕ lai ϕ c o 2 ϕ lc ε where ϕ 0 is the baseline value and a constant ε represents the errors i e the portions that could not be modeled by xgboost ϕpre and ϕpet are the shap values for pre and pet respectively from the modeling of spei using xgboost and ϕt ϕrs ϕrh ϕws ϕap ϕlai ϕco2 and ϕlc are the shap values for t rs rh ws ap lai co2 and lc respectively from the modeling of pet using xgboost it should be noted that ϕlc is the sum of all shap values for the 14 land cover factors taking the linear slopes from both sides of eqs 25 and 26 the spei and pet trends were expressed as follows 27 slope s p e i slope ϕ pre slope ϕ pet δ 28 slope p e t slope ϕ t slope ϕ rs slope ϕ rh slope ϕ ws slope ϕ ap slope ϕ lai slope ϕ c o 2 slope ϕ lc δ where slope spei and slope pet represent the trends in spei and pet respectively slope ϕpre and slope ϕpet are the absolute contributions of pre and pet to spei trends respectively slope ϕt slope ϕrs slope ϕrh slope ϕws slope ϕap slope ϕlai slope ϕco2 and slope ϕlc are the absolute contributions of t rs rh ws ap lai co2 and lc to pet trends respectively and δ represents the error that cannot be attributed the relative contribution rate was also calculated as the ratio of the absolute values of contribution of each driving factor to the sum of all absolute values of contributions han et al 2018 in previous studies the contributions of driving factors to pet trends have often been estimated based on mlr for comparison mlr was also applied in this study to model the daily pet and the partial differential method which is also an mlr based method was used to attribute the pet trends zheng et al 2009 in addition to measure the performance of modeling and attribution of interpretable ml and mlr we adopted three indices the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae mehdizadeh 2018 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial trends in pre pet and spei fig 2 shows the distribution and spatiotemporal variation of pet and pre across the hhhy from 2001 to 2019 the multi year mean pet exhibited a decreasing spatial pattern from east to west ranging from 132 to 3115 mm fig 2a whereas the multi year pre had a declining distribution from southeast to northwest ranging from 135 to 2336 mm fig 2b for the temporal variation the average annual pet showed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 60 mm 10a p 0 01 fig 2e and pre also showed an increasing trend but at a rate of 44 mm 10a p 0 1 which was lower than that of pet fig 2f spatially pet generally increased across the region particularly in the harb and yerb fig 2c the pre showed an upward trend in most regions but had a significant downward trend in the eastern part of the region especially in the hurb and southwestern yarb fig 2d according to the results presented in table 2 the pet and pre at a river basin scale showed an upward trend in the harb and yerb but the increasing rates of the pet were greater than those of the pre and the trends were more significant in the hurb the pet increased non significantly at a rate of 26 4 mm 10a p 0 1 whereas the pre decreased non significantly at a rate of 30 4 mm 10a p 0 1 thus resulting in a non significant difference of 56 8 mm 10a p 0 1 between the pet and pre in the yarb the increasing rate of the pet did not reach that of the pre in addition the proportion of area with increase in pre was slightly larger than that with increase in pet overall the results demonstrate that the increased pet exceeded the increase in pre but their difference was not significant fig 3 a e show the temporal trends in the spei from 2001 to 2019 the spei decreased non significantly in the harb yerb and hurb at rates of 0 46 10a p 0 1 0 27 10a p 0 1 and 0 23 10a p 0 1 respectively moreover the proportions of the area where drought events occurred spei 1 0 also increased by 15 4 10a p 0 1 8 7 10a p 0 1 and 4 5 10a p 0 1 in the harb yerb and hurb respectively however the spei in the yarb increased slightly at a rate of 0 03 10a p 0 1 and the proportions of the area where drought events occurred also showed a slight decrease at a rate of 2 6 10a p 0 1 in the whole region of the hhhy the spei and proportions of the area with drought events occurring showed a non significant downtrend 0 12 10a p 0 1 and a non significant uptrend 2 7 10a p 0 1 which was consistent with that pre increased more than pet and their difference was not significant spatially areas with significant downtrends in spei were mostly distributed in the north and southwest of the hhhy fig 3 f overall the results show that drought showed a non significant accelerating trend in the hhhy 4 2 contributions of pre and pet to trends in spei using xgboost and shap the respective contributions of the pre and pet to the spei trends were estimated using eq 27 as shown in fig 4 d the actual spei trends i e slope spei were consistent with the predicted spei trends i e slope ϕ in all grids which proved the efficiency of xgboost and shap to attribute spei trends the r2 value was close to 1 and the mae and rmse were 0 00026 and 0 00031 respectively the spatial contributions of the pre and pet to the spei trends are illustrated in fig 4 a and b the increased pre trends evidently contributed increasing spei trends whereas the increased pet trends contributed decreasing spei trends the study compared the contributions of the pre and pet to the spei trends at the river basin scale fig 4 c and the results show that the pet dominated the spei trends in the hhhy in the harb the pre showed positive contributions and pet showed negative contributions to spei in almost all areas however the pet contributed 0 59 10a p 0 01 to the spei trends and the pre contributed 0 13 10a p 0 1 thus leading to a non significant decrease in the spei in the yerb the pre contributed almost positive trends and pet contributed almost negative trends to the spei with total contributions of 0 19 10a p 0 01 and 0 46 10a p 0 1 for the pre and pet respectively which also caused a non significant decline in the spei the pre and pet all negatively contributed to the spei trends in most areas of the hurb pre and pet non significantly contributed 0 18 10a p 0 1 and 0 06 10a p 0 1 to the spei trend respectively in the yarb significant positive contributions from the pre 0 22 10a p 0 1 offset the significant negative contributions from the pet 0 19 10a p 0 05 which non significantly raised the spei in the entire region the negative effects of the pet 0 28 10a p 0 01 outweighed the positive effects of the pre on the spei trends 0 16 10a p 0 1 overall the increased pet counteracted the increased pre in the hhhy which resulted in a non significant decrease in the spei 4 3 variations in factors driving pet trends fig 5 shows the spatial trends of the seven factors driving pet trends during the period 2001 2019 and table 3 counts trends in the river basin scale t showed upward trends in most areas approximately 78 4 of the hhhy with an average slope of 0 241 10a p 0 05 indicating the occurrence of climatic warming the trends of t were significant in most sub regions except for the harb rs showed a non significant downtrend with a slope of 0 123 mj m 2 10a p 0 1 and decreased in most areas approximately 64 1 of the hhhy except in the yerb the trends of rs in sub regions of the hhhy were not significant rh decreased in 55 7 of the hhhy areas with an average slope of 0 04 10a p 0 1 only in the harb the trend of rh was significant p 0 1 ws showed a significant uptrend with an average slope of 0 068 m s 1 10a p 0 01 and increased in 64 1 of the hhhy areas especially in the yarb 70 of the area however ws decreased in most areas in the hurb the increasing trend of ws was significant in the yerb and yarb and not significant in the harb and the decreasing trend in the hurb was also significant trends in ap showed strong spatial variability and downward trends in most areas and the average slope was 0 129 p 0 01 ap showed a decreasing trend in all sub regions of the hhhy and the trend was significant in most regions except in the hurb large scale vegetation restoration occurred in the hhhy and lai had increased in over 90 of the area with an average increase rate of 0 12 10a p 0 01 in all sub regions of the hhhy lai has a significant uptrend in addition the co2 concentration had been increasing significantly at a rate of 22 13 ppm 10a p 0 01 from approximately 370 ppm in 2001 to about 410 ppm in 2019 table 4 shows the variation rates of area proportion for each lc type the land cover transfer matrixes are shown in supplementary table s1 s5 in the entire hhhy river basin the main increasing lc was forest land fo including enf ebf dnf dbf and mf with the main decreasing lc types being wsa and gr the main conversion was wsa to fo and gr to sa and fa 4 4 contribution estimation of driving factors to trends in pet and spei like the attribution of spei trends xgboost and shap were applied to quantitatively attribute various driving factors to pet trends we first validated the performance of xgboost in modeling the daily pet and then compared it with mlr we selected 1 000 grids randomly since it is time consuming and requires high computing power to run 32 487 grids for 50 fold cross validation as shown in fig 6 a and b scatters of the daily pet simulated by s w model and predicted by xgboost were uniformly distributed around the diagonal line i e the black dotted line and scatters of daily pet simulated by s w model and predicted by mlr were more dispersed the average r2 mae and rmse of xgboost were 0 986 0 19 and 0 28 respectively which were better than those of mlr 0 921 0 50 and 0 68 respectively overall xgboost performed better than mlr in modeling daily pet this study also compared the actual pet trends with the predicted pet trends contributed by all driving factors as shown in fig 6 c and d xgboost shap also performed better than mlr in attributing pet trends with an r2 mae and rmse of 1 00 0 10 and 0 11 respectively therefore it can be deduced that mlr would cause larger errors than xgboost and shap when attributing pet trends fig 7 shows the spatial contributions of different factors to the pet trends evidently increased t rs ws had positive effects on pet trends whereas increased rh and ap had negative effects on pet trends the increased lai also positively affected pet trends but lai contributed more to increased pet in the north than south of the hhhy the rising co2 concentrations had contradictory contributions to the pet trends in different regions given that an interaction existed among the proportions of different land use types we considered land use factors as one factor where their contributions were the sum of all land cover factors in this study table 5 lists various factors absolute contributions and relative contribution rates to the pet trends in the harb the increased rs and lai and the decreased rh dominated pet trends and particularly lai contributed 56 7 mm 10a which was almost half of the pet trend in the yerb lai was also the dominant factor and contributed to more than half of the pet trends in the hurb the increased lai was the dominant factor and contributed positively to pet trends whereas the decreased ws was the dominant factor that negatively contributed to pet trends in the yarb ws contributed the most to the increase in pet which was greater than lai while lc contributed the most to the decrease in pet in the entire hhhy river basin the increased ws and lai were the two dominant factors driving pet trends with contributions of 19 6 mm 10a and 32 4 mm 10a respectively by allocating the contributions of pet to spei trends to each driving factor driving pet trends we calculated the contributions of different drivers to the spei trend at the basin scale in the harb pre rh and lai were the dominant factors driving spei trends in particular vegetation growth led to a decrease in spei 0 26 10a which far exceeded the positive contribution from pre fig 8 a in the yerb pre and lai were the primary factors driving spei trends and the negative effects of lai also exceeded the positive effects of pre fig 8 b in the hurb pre ws and lai dominated the spei trends and pre and lai all showed negative contributions whereas ws contributed positively fig 8 c in the yarb pre and ws were the two dominant driving factors causing pet to increase by 0 22 10a and to decline by 0 13 10a respectively whereas lai resulted in a spei decline of only 0 09 10a fig 8 d over the entire region pre rs and lc caused spei to increase and t rh ws ap lai and co2 caused a decrease in spei pre and lai were the two dominated factors driving pet trends and the contributions of lai almost offset the positive effects of pre on spei trends in conclusion vegetation restoration has counteracted the alleviating effects of increased pre to drought thus exacerbating drought when superimposed on the effects of other factors 5 discussion 5 1 drivers of pet and drought in this study the climatic factors were ranked in the ascending order of ws t rh rs and ap based on the corresponding contribution rates to pet trends however according to the importance to pet trend climatic factors rank in the order of t rs rh ws and ap which is consistent with the finding of chakraborty et al 2021 as shown in supplementary fig s1 it is because that the contribution depends not only the importance to pet but the self variation rate of each influential factors a positive correlation existed between pet and ws because ws reduces aerodynamic resistance zhou et al 2006 our results indicate that ws was the dominant climatic factor driving pet trends which is consistent with recent studies showing that increased ws has dominated the rise in pet in recent years although ws has undergone a long term downward trend in the past thus leading to a decrease in pet dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 han et al 2018 however in 36 of the areas in the hhhy especially hurb ws has decreased in the last 20 years fig 7 d and negatively contributed to the pet change fig 7 d the influence of t on pet is complex t promotes pet by increasing the vpd t increased pet by increasing photosynthetic rate under a certain threshold but decreases it beyond a certain threshold gan et al 2018 y zhang et al 2019b overall an increase in t promotes pet dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 han et al 2018 although climate warming is a primary trend we also found that t showed a downward trend in 29 3 of the area from 2001 to 2019 and led to a decrease in pet fig 7 a decreased rh increased the vpd reflecting a water deficit thus negatively contributing to pet trends de oliveira et al 2021 han et al 2018 wang et al 2017 although the total contribution of rh to the pet trends was not significant across the entire region decreased rh markedly increased pet in the northern hhhy particularly in the harb and hurb fig 7 c rs is the direct energy driver for evapotranspiration but was not the dominant factor affecting pet trends at the river basin scale because of the insignificance of its trends table 3 an increased ap promoted the pet by increasing the air density and restrained it by increasing the latent heat of water vaporization ap was negatively correlated with the pet overall but the pet was not sensitive to ap zhao and ma 2021 in recent years large scale vegetation restoration has become a global phenomenon in this study we used the lai to represent vegetation dynamics which could also be used in the s w model to estimate pet increased lai promoted pet in the following ways 1 more solar radiation was allocated to the canopy transpiration than to soil evaporation 2 the canopy resistance and canopy boundary layer resistance decreased and 3 the soil heat flux density decreased although lai increased in most areas of the hhhy and the north south gap of the rising rate was not prominent its contributions to the pet increase in the three northern river basins were greater than those in the south of the hhhy fig 7 f according to eq 12 eq 16 and eq 22 reciprocal and exponential relationships exist in lai influencing pet and the effects of lai on pet decrease when the absolute lai value increases previous studies have also noted a strong non linear relationship between lai and pet zhou et al 2008 zhou et al 2007 and the sensitivity of pet to lai decreases with increasing lai zhao et al 2016 therefore because of the lower vegetation cover in the north than south the same increased lai contributed more to the pet increase in the north than south an increase in co2 generally affects pet due to its interaction with vegetation previous studies have focused on the negative effects of increased co2 concentrations on evapotranspiration by closing the stomata gui et al 2021 liao et al 2021 x zhang et al 2021a zhou et al 2022 however we obtained a contradictory conclusion that increased co2 concentrations had both positive and negative effects on pet trends spatially according to eqs 18 and 19 increased co2 concentration can not only decrease stomatal conductance but also increase it by promoting the photosynthetic rate and the gross primary production gpp recent studies have also reported that co2 fertilization can counteract the stomatal closure effect on trends in evapotranspiration and runoff by promoting vegetation growth zhang et al 2022 the results show that environmental changes particularly large scale vegetation restoration contribute more to pet trends than climate change our results are inconsistent with the conclusion of zhao and ma 2021 which state that climatic factors particularly temperature are more important than vegetation and energy in pet trends although zhao and ma 2021 also used the s w model to estimate pet the differences in the results could be explained by three reasons firstly we used a bb model to calculate the canopy resistance whereas they used the js model secondly the attribution method was different an interpretable ml model that combined xgboost and shap and focused on non linear relationships was used in our study whereas they used linear regressions lastly the study area period and data resources were different there are counteracting effects of increasing pre and pet on drought especially in last 20 years for example rising precipitation offset the effect of increasing et on water scarcity in over northern part of china during 2001 2020 huang et al 2023 our study revealed that the increasing pet dominated the downtrends of spei compared with pre previous study has also found that changes in pet were the dominant driver to drought variations in 60 areas of the yerb wang et al 2022c however the effect of large scale vegetation restoration on pet increase was often not considered thus the drought may be underestimated when ignoring the water consumption capacity of vegetation in the main grain production area of china spei calculated by s w model based pei considering vegetation was more correlated with soil moisture standardized anomaly than penman monteith based spei indicating the efficiency of s w model in estimating pet and spei zhao and ma 2021 the increasing pet was similarly the main driver of increasing drought 5 2 the interactive relationship between vegetation and drought in this study vegetation restoration significantly increased the pet and exceeded the increase in the pre almost offsetting the increasing effects of pre on the spei trends thus vegetation is a key factor in drought control however many previous studies have found that drought is a limiting factor for vegetation growth for example deng et al 2021 found that extreme drought results in the largest reduction in gpp a slight decrease in net ecosystem productivity and a reduced lai c xu et al 2019a indicated that extreme droughts had increasingly stronger effects on the gpp therefore drought and vegetation are mutually influenced some studies on the interaction between vegetation climate and hydrology have indicated that vegetation can adjust its coverage and achieve a water heat balanced state in its long evolutionary process of the natural state cong et al 2017 mo et al 2016 y zhang et al 2021b vegetation is not only affected by climatic factors but also human activity some studies have shown that anthropogenic factors such as the implementation of ecological restoration projects have dominated vegetation restoration beyond natural restrictions qi et al 2019 y shi et al 2020b over vegetation restoration has resulted in a series of consequences in the water cycle in addition to increasing total evapotranspiration and the proportion of transpiration to evaporation increased vegetation coverage has also led to soil drying and reduced runoff jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 these findings also confirm the accelerating effect of increased lai on drought in the harb and yerb where ecological restoration projects were mainly implemented the accelerating effects of lai have considerably exceeded the reducing effects of pre on drought fig 8 in recent years several studies have reported decreased runoff in the harb and yerb bin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 xu et al 2014 5 3 the application of the interpretable ml in pet attribution machine learning has become increasingly popular in simulating potential reference and actual evapotranspiration benefiting from its strong ability to model non linear relationships ml algorithms used in modeling evapotranspiration include catboost xgboost random forest gradient boosting decision tree deep learning methods artificial neural networks convolutional neural networks and support vector machines fan et al 2018 ferreira and frança 2020b hu et al 2021 huang et al 2019 saggi and jain 2019 wu et al 2021 h yu et al 2020a due to the characteristics of a black box model it is difficult to explain the ml outputs although ml has a strong ability to model complex non linear relationships previous studies mainly focused on modeling and predictions of pet using ml but have not applied it in attribution recently the emerging shap method has endowed ml with interpretability which is termed interpretable ml shap separates the output of ml as the accumulation of shap values of different features and can be used to quantitatively measure the effects of diverse drivers on the study object this method has been used in many domains such as for runoff s wang et al 2022a groundwater level liu et al 2022 water quality wang et al 2021 s wang et al 2022b and grassland degradation batunacun et al 2021 based on a review of the literature there are few applications of shap in analyzing evapotranspiration at present hu et al 2021 used shap to identify the effects of different features on evapotranspiration and found that net radiation was the most important feature in different models chakraborty et al 2021 used the global interpretability of shap and revealed that the order of importance of climatic factors to et0 was rs t rh ws ap however the two applications only revealed the macro relationship between evapotranspiration and the driving factors in shap and the relative importance of each factor in this study we quantitatively estimated the respective contributions of diverse drivers to pet trends by calculating the linear slopes of the shap values for diverse features based on the additivity of shap as shown in fig 6 regardless of cross validation or attribution xgboost and shap performed better than the traditional linear based method also proving the non linear relationships between pet and driving factors 5 4 uncertainties some uncertainties exist in this study firstly a spatial resolution of 10 km was used in this study which may neglect the heterogeneity of the underlying surface to some extent though we have considered the proportions of different land cover types in each computing unit the rugged or steep terrain and climatic difference were ignored secondly we used daily observation data from meteorological stations and interpolated it to each grid using the radial basis function method because of the dispersion of data in stations the spatial patterns of climatic factors produced by interpolation were extremely scattered in addition different interpolation methods may bring discrepant results especially in areas with few meteorological stations thirdly lc mainly had negative contributions to pet trends across the region particularly in the yarb this is probably because that the conversion of land cover from 2001 to 2019 reduced the stomatal conductance the main conversion was from wsa to fo although fo has more evapotranspiration rates at the canopy sale because it is generally denser and has a greater lai than was fo had lower stomatal conductance than wsa at the stoma scale thus the conversion from wsa to fo resulted in a decrease in pet after eliminating the influence of lai however the effects of conversion in land cover to pet were complicated which may bring uncertainties to pet estimation finally the influential variables were not completely independent from each other which may bring some uncertainties to the results of attribution for pet and spei trends on the one hand there are considerable correlations in climatic factors dong et al 2021 gui et al 2021 for example if precipitation is high the relative humidity will be high on the other hand there is a reciprocal feedback relationship between climate factors and vegetation dynamics vegetation change is affected by climatic change and the vegetation restoration will also change regional climate in china the vegetation increase has resulted in surface cooling of 0 11 c and a precipitation increase of 0 02 mm d during summer with the analysis of a high resolution land atmosphere coupled regional climate mode l yu et al 2020b however how much of the precipitation increase is due to vegetation restoration and climate change remains to be resolved 6 conclusions drought trends are influenced by the variations in pre and pet but pet is not only affected by climatic factors but also environmental factors including vegetation co2 concentration and land cover in this study the s w model and revised bb stomatal conductance model were combined to estimate the daily pet in the hhhy from 2001 to 2019 during the study period pet increased by 60 mm 10a p 0 01 which exceeded the increase in pre by 44 mm 10a p 0 1 spei at an annual scale was estimated and showed a non significant decrease at a rate of 0 12 10a p 0 1 considering the complex non linear relationships in the s w model we proposed an interpretable ml based method to estimate contributions of diverse driving factors to spei and pet trends this method has considered the complex non linear relationships and performed better than the traditional linear based method pet contributed 0 28 10a p 0 01 to the spei trend whereas pre contributed only 0 16 10a p 0 1 for the pet trend according to the relative contribution rate these influential factors were ranked in the ascending order of lai ws lc co2 t rh rs and ap environmental factors especially the increased lai contributed more to pet trends than climatic factors lai and ws were the two dominant factors with contributions of 19 6 mm 10a 20 and 32 4 mm 10a 32 respectively by allocating the contributions of pet to the spei and diverse factors we quantified the causes of drought large scale vegetation restoration almost offset the positive effects of increased pre on spei variation combined with the influence of other factors drought was non significantly accelerated in the hhhy this study provides a combined method for estimating pet that reflects the effects of both climatic and environmental factors and an interpretable ml based method for attributing pet and spei trends which could be used as a reference by other studies however the feedback between climate change and vegetation dynamics were not considered in this study and need a further study credit

1833,engineered leaky barriers are increasingly used as natural flood management methods providing ecosystem and water quality benefits in addition to flood attenuation complementing hard engineering flood defences field based monitoring of a natural flood management site wilde brook in the corvedale catchment england uk studied the rainfall runoff relationship for a 5 36 km reach with 105 leaky barriers over two years paired pressure transducers were placed upstream and downstream of three channel spanning leaky barriers allowing evaluation of upstream backwater rise relative to rainfall intensity storm magnitude and frequency by increasing backwater rise the leaky barriers caused overbank flows resulting in a reduction in the cross sectional area velocity after the event the incidence of overbank flow depended on the local stream cross sectional profile barrier properties location in the reach and storm magnitude barrier operational flow conditions were classified into five modes according to relative bank inundation and barrier submergence extent the backwater rise magnitude depended on barrier physical properties and evolution over time through cycles of accretion and build up of brash and leafy material in the barrier in addition to local bedload sediment transport dynamics where instances of scour around the barriers were observed backwater rise and net volume hydrographs showed rapid filling up behind the barriers on the rising limb and slower water release on the falling limb for a 4 yr return period storm event results indicated that one leaky barrier increased storage volume by up to 102 m3 which translates to an overall net volume increase of 10 700 m3 for the full reach these new findings provide quantitative evidence of leaky barrier backwater and storage performance and leaky barrier design recommendations for storms up to a 4 yr return period this evidence can be used to develop and validate flood modelling generalised approaches for smaller more frequent storms and work towards the development of an approach for modelling leaky barriers for larger storm magnitudes keywords natural flood management leaky barrier

socio economic costs and flood risk further worsened by expected increases in storm intensity and flooding due to climate change ipcc 2014 flood defences traditionally use hard engineering methods to mitigate flood risk in order to add flood resilience nature based solutions to flooding or natural flood management nfm utilises natural catchment process methods in upper catchments to reduce and delay low return period flood peaks further downstream burgess gamble et al 2017 dadson et al 2017 nfm interventions additionally benefit surface and groundwater quality by reconnecting fragmented watercourses increasing wet spaces and creating more heterogenous spaces for wildlife therefore enhancing biodiversity faustini and jones 2003 bouwes et al 2016 wohl et al 2016 these soft engineering methods include runoff attenuation instream structures such as wood leaky barriers which slow down temporally store and gradually release flood flows therefore reducing downstream flood levels and attenuating flood peaks burgess gamble et al 2017 studies evaluating leaky barrier performance quantify effectiveness using the following metrics reduction in downstream peak flow reduction in

leaky barriers achieve 27 peak outflow discharge reduction norbury et al 2021 a time lag of ten minutes on the outflow peak discharge for a 3 5 year return period storm event was estimated for a one kilometre reach based on upscaling results from a small experimental test channel with a single wood barrier wenzel et al 2014 while an increasein the delay of times of peak discharge compared to observed rainfall peaks ranging from 2 6 to 7 3 h have been observed at a catchment scale for a mixture of leaky barriers storage ponds and woodland planting black et al 2020 modelling studies also estimate peak outflow discharge reduction for reaches ranging from 4 hankin et al 2019 to 11 metcalfe et al 2017 and 30 nicholson et al 2020 at a catchment scale for leaky barriers used in conjunction with other nfm measures the role of large wood in increasing heterogeneity of flow and regulating sediment transport in the river landscape has been recognised with the reintroduction of wood and wood retention in river restoration and river management practices nisbet et al 2011 bouwes et al 2016 burgess gamble et al 2017 dadson et al 2017 black et al 2020 norbury et al 2021 in such practices the benefits of ecological improvement are balanced with impacts on channel conveyance and flood management previous studies have given insight into the dynamic interrelationships between flow hydraulics and wood patch morphology and channel morphology the structure of wood barriers has been observed to change over time through the accumulation and depletion of organic material and local scour and deposition of bedload sediment which alters the surrounding channel and bank morphology gibling et al 2010 wohl and beckman 2014 dixon and sear 2014 wohl and iskin 2022 changes to the wood barrier and channel morphology result in changes in backwater rise over time geertsema et al 2020 and supports previous studies that observed backwater rise magnitude to be a function of the wood patch height curran and wohl 2003 wilcox and wohl 2006 the backwater rise discharge relationship for large wood barriers on a streambed has been characterised by a steeper increase in backwater rise with increasing discharge until a threshold is reached related to the barrier geometry and channel profile after which the increase in backwater rise declines geertsema et al 2020 the backwater rise has been related to the barrier physical structure with momentum loss proportional to the number size and packing density of the logs and the barrier length and lower gap width allowing description of barriers with a common structural metric and development of a rating curve for depths below the barrier crest follett et al 2020 follett et al 2021 however research gaps remain for the effect of barriers at water depths above the barrier crest and the impact of barriers during periods of unsteady flow in this paper the impact of barriers for water depths above the barrier crest and unsteady flow conditions is examined using monitoring evidence from a natural flood management site wood barriers generate an increase in flood peak lag time by increasing upstream water depth and local floodplain water storage burgess gamble et al 2017 keys et al 2018 follett et al 2020 follett et al 2021 muhawenimana et al 2021 wood barriers also alter the transport of bedload and channel bank sediment schalko et al 2019 follett and wilson 2020 and increase hydraulic roughness wilcox and wohl 2006 geertsema et al 2020 follett and hankin 2022 evaluation of the effectiveness of leaky barriers is still advancing with few studies attempting to quantify the functional behaviour of leaky barriers water storage potential and how their evolution impacts on their function wenzel et al 2014 burgess gamble et al 2017 in addition empirical evidence is still lacking to quantify the hydraulic impact of leaky barriers at the structure and reach scales there is little practical guidance on leaky barrier design and its optimisation for flood risk management purposes this information is crucial for stakeholders for nfm scheme design and facilitating the wider use of nfm in flood risk management in this paper we present new field monitoring evidence of a natural flood management site comprising 105 leaky barriers on the wilde brook corvedale shropshire uk this scheme is one of the 26 fluvial natural flood management monitoring projects funded by the uk government in 2018 with the key aim of learning by doing arnott et al 2018 using a flow sensor rain gauge and paired water level loggers upstream and downstream of the leaky barriers in three locations along the reach we evaluate the hydraulic effect of the leaky barriers for storm events recorded over a two year monitoring duration relative to the local channel bathymetry the rise in upstream backwater and water storage volume are compared between barriers with different physical characteristics for selected storm events the new evidence on leaky barrier operation will inform the planning and design stages of future flood risk management projects 2 methods 2 1 field site description the wilde brook monitored test reach site is 5 36 km in length and has a catchment area of 5 3 km2 it is bounded on the north west by wenlock edge which is limestone escarpment and a site of special scientific interest due to its geology england 1986 the catchment s land use is comprised of agricultural land with a mix of pasture and arable wilde brook is one of eight tributaries of the river corve in the coverdale catchment in shropshire england fig 1 the upstream section of the wilde brook reach is referred to as the wilderhope upper reach while the wilderhope middle reach refers to the section of the reach prior to the confluence with an ephemeral stream at the upper confluence fig 1 the wilderhope lower reach indicates the section of the reach between the upper confluence and the downstream corve confluence fig 1 sequentially the streamwise distances of reach segments between measurement locations from the upstream end of wilde brook to wilderhope upper is 870 m from wilderhope upper to wilderhope middle is 758 m 888 m from wilderhope middle to upper confluence 1 426 m from upper confluence to wilderhope lower 2 26 m from wilderhope lower 2 to wilderhope lower 1 784 m from wilderhope lower 1 to flow site velocity sensor which is 617 m to corve confluence 2 2 monitoring instrumentation paired pressure transducers rain gauge and flow meter hydrometric monitoring instrumentation was first installed in april may 2019 and georeferenced using dgps and regularly checked manually and maintained the monitoring instrumentation consisted of 10 vented pressure transducers ott orpheus mini pressure level sensor of which eight were paired located 2 4 4 m upstream and downstream of the selected leaky barriers in the wilderhope upper wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower reaches and two were placed as single pressure sensors at the wilderhope upper confluence and corve confluence fig 1 the pressure transducers recorded water levels every 15 min with an accuracy of 0 05 ott 2021 rainfall was recorded at the stanway raingauge station fig 1 using a lambrecht tipping bucket raingauge which recorded 0 2 mm events at 15 min intervals due to low battery voltage there is a gap in the data from 11 april 2020 and 29 may 2020 the data and analysis presented in this paper relates to the period 12 april 2019 to 22 june 2021 the investigation of the barrier at wilderhope lower 2 did not commence until november 2020 when the paired pressure transducers were installed therefore lower 2 is not included in the current analysis to ensure consistency in the monitoring durations for the paired leaky barriers hereafter wilderhope lower refers to the wilderhope lower 1 barrier a flow meter av 9000 area velocity sensor with a hach fl900 flow logger was placed downstream of a culvert 1 57 m wide and 1 1 m high indicated as flow site velocity sensor in fig 1 the flow logger recorded water level flow velocity and discharge at 15 min intervals battery malfunctions occurred for the flow logger and battery replacement did not resolve data quality issues therefore only flow data from april september 2019 is presented here the recorded discharge data was fitted to the rating curve equation q 1 6525 h 2 6102 r 2 0 99 where q is discharge m3 s and h is water depth m the uncertainty in estimated discharge associated with using a rating curve derived from a short record length is acknowledged and the discharge uncertainty was determined the refh approach version 2 was used to estimate the flood frequency of each peak river discharge kjeldsen 2007 wallingford hydrosolutions 2021 the return period estimates provided an indicative magnitude for the observed storm events placing them within a flood frequency context four substantial storm events observed during the two year monitoring period are highlighted in this paper 2 yr return period events on 19 december 2019 and 14 november 2019 and 4 yr return period events on 26 october 2019 and 16 february 2020 2 3 leaky barrier properties and local channel bathymetry 105 leaky barriers were constructed on the wilde brook monitored test reach between winter 2016 and february 2018 using wood alder hazel and oak species sourced locally from the riverbanks and floodplain the longitudinal spacing between barriers varied from 11 to 50 m while the vertical gap below the barriers varied between zero to 0 75 m the leaky barriers consisted of channel spanning key members as well as secondary members of varying diameters and lengths the channel spanning members were secured using wooden pegs and rebar and anchored to bankside tree trunks where available a vertical gap above the bed was maintained below the barriers to ensure free passage of baseflow the majority of designs followed available engineered barrier guidance adept 2019 which were adapted for specific channel cross sections neal l personal communication 14 september 2021 the most frequent leaky barrier design consisted of channel spanning parallel large logs placed perpendicular to the main flow direction and pinned in place while other barriers consisted of smaller logs and tree branches resembling natural woody accumulations where the logs were accumulated rather than engineered in geometrical arrangement and others were built as woven structures the barriers were georeferenced and their characteristics including elevation above bed number of key members composition and size were measured photographic records of the barriers were collected annually to track their time evolution natural accretion and washout or depletion of brash material from the leaky barriers was allowed to take place maintenance of the leaky barriers was carried out only when key members became dislodged or moved usually during higher flow events which occurred for 10 of the leaky barriers since installation leaky barrier repairs were carried out in winter 2020 neal l personal communication 10 december 2021 2 4 description of the selected leaky barriers with paired pressure transducers three sets of paired pressure transducers measured the sensor submergence depth upstream and downstream of three leaky barriers located in the wilderhope upper wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower sub reaches beginning on 12 april 2019 these three paired leaky barriers were selected to represent a range of leaky barrier designs barrier bank profiles and bed slopes at various stations along the reach the water surface elevation was measured relative to a yellow survey peg georeferenced at installation and during four service visits november 2019 may 2020 november 2020 july 2021 september 2021 barrier vertical extent visually apparent structural composition accumulation of brash and leaves and visually apparent bedload sediment transport were observed at field visits february 2019 november 2019 november 2020 july 2021 september 2021 through repeat photographs of the barriers and survey measurements using a wading rod to an accuracy of 1 cm stream cross section profiles were surveyed in november 2020 at the location of the pressure transducers the channel right hand side rhs and left hand side lhs are defined looking in the downstream flow direction characteristics of the wilderhope upper middle and lower barriers are shown in table 1 and photographs of the barriers are shown in fig 2 the wilderhope upper measurement site comprised of a barrier composed of two logs placed across the upper channel and pinned upstream and downstream on both banks with wooden stakes no changes in bed level due to bedload sediment transport were visually apparent during the monitoring period the wilderhope middle measurement site leaky barrier comprised a woven structure perpendicular to the flow direction at the wilderhope lower measurement site the barrier used a naturalised engineered design composed of a varied accumulation of logs constructed perpendicular to the flow direction table 2 shows the channel cross sections at the pressure loggers upstream of each barrier 2 5 wilde brook structure from motion sfm photogrammetry to obtain ultra high spatial resolution topographic survey data of a sub reach of the wilderhope lower site fig 1 that has significant canopy cover pole mounted photography gonçalves et al 2016 luhmann et al 2019 supplemented with imagery from an uncrewed aerial system uas where feasible was utilised structure from motion sfm photogrammetry was applied to a sub reach 130 m long reach length defined as measured along the thalweg that included five leaky barriers the field survey was conducted at low flow in march 2021 which enabled an uninhibited view of the stream bed through the clear and shallow water initially 26 ground control points were placed along the channel margins and their locations surveyed with the trimble r10 rtk gps pole mounted images were obtained with a dji phantom 4 rtk uas attached with clamps to two extendable carbon fibre poles with image locations corrected with connection to a dji d rtk 2 gnss base station located within 50 m of the surveyed reach images were taken at a height of 3 m above the ground at an oblique angle of 75 spaced approximately every 0 4 m along each bank in order to create 80 overlap between images additional nadir imagery was collected by carefully flying the uas under the canopy and above the water surface at a height of approximately 3 m above the channel wherever possible sfm photogrammetry was applied to the resulting 825 images using agisoft metashape 1 7 3 to create a dense point cloud consisting of 389 815 240 points digital elevation model dem and orthophotomosaic refraction correction was applied to the submerged areas in the dem following established procedures westaway et al 2000 woodget et al 2015 the dem has a spatial resolution of 2 mm pixel a point density of approximately 25 points per cm2 and its positional accuracy had a root mean square error rmse of 2 cm in the horizontal direction and 4 cm vertically 2 6 storage volume calculation 2 6 1 using sfm photogrammetry derived dem for the wilderhope lower sub reach water volumes stored upstream of the wilderhope lower leaky barrier for a given water level were calculated by trapezoidal numerical integration over the meshgrid interpolated from the sfm photogrammetry derived 2 mm resolution dem using matlab r2021a the area of interest was delimited from the upstream face of the leaky barrier of interest to the downstream face of the leaky barrier immediately upstream the measured upstream pressure transducer water level was assumed to be horizontal over this area and applied to the trapezoidal interpolation of volumes local cross sections from the dem at the pressure transducer location were verified with bed survey transects the trapezoidal integration was performed for submerged areas of the dem only i e areas with water elevation greater than bed elevation the net storage volume represents the difference between the estimated storage volume upstream and downstream of the leaky barrier or the increase in storage volume attributed to the leaky barrier similarly the trapezoidal integration method was used to calculate the flow velocity upstream of the leaky barriers using the stream cross section profiles the measured water level the flow cross section area and the discharge recorded at the flow site velocity sensor 2 6 2 using 2 m dtm lidar data the sfm photogrammetry derived dem provided an ultra high resolution survey of the majority of the modelled reach at the wilderhope lower monitoring location however for flood inundation exceeding the upstream extent of the sfm photogrammetry derived dem ordnance survey 2 m dtm lidar from the environment agency with accuracy of 15 cm rmse lidar composite digital terrain model england 2m resolution 2016 edina lidar digimap service https digimap edina ac uk was used to evaluate the water volume upstream of the leaky barrier of interest the coordinates for each lidar tile were obtained using lower left corner and y coordinates for the given elevation the resulting matrix was then reshaped into column arrays which could be used to create a meshgrid of the bathymetry the trapezoidal interpolation method outlined in section 2 6 1 was used to obtain the water volume stored inbank and overbank upstream of the leaky barrier using the lidar meshgrid processing and analysis were again conducted using matlab r2021a 3 results 3 1 rainfall intensity hourly cumulative rainfall is shown in fig 3 grey circles where the wilderhope lower upstream and downstream paired pressure transducer submergence depths at the time of the rainfall record are also plotted fig 3 black and blue solid lines several heavy rainfall events with daily rainfall magnitude greater than 20 mm per day occurred during the monitoring period as shown in table 3 along with storm names available from the uk s met office the highest recorded daily rainfall intensity reached 41 6 mm day on 11 june 2019 and the second and third highest intensity were 37 6 mm day on 26 october 2019 and 35 2 mm day on 12 august 2020 respectively the 12 august 2020 event showed the maximum recorded hourly rainfall intensity of 22 6 mm hour named storms of lesser magnitude were also recorded including storm jorge 28 february 01 march 2020 and storm ellen 19 20 august 2020 with recorded intensity of 10 6 mm day and 19 6 mm day respectively uk storm season 2019 20 met office key rainfall and storm events recorded are shown chronologically in table 3 with their duration rainfall intensity and lag time between rainfall and discharge centroids 3 2 paired pressure transducer water levels time series of sensor submergence depths recorded at paired pressure transducers upstream of three leaky barriers in the wilderhope upper wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower sub reaches are shown in fig 4 where upstream lhs and rhs channel banks are indicated the water levels relative to the channel banks indicated the occurrence of inbank bankfull partial overbank only one bank is inundated and fully overbank events a wide range of inundation levels were observed at the wilderhope upper site fig 4a including inbank flows below both rhs and lhs banks upstream and downstream of the barrier partial overbank flows where the water spilled over only the rhs bank upstream of the barrier and fully overbank events where both rhs and lhs banks were simultaneously inundated upstream of the barrier partial overbank events occurred on 23 24 february 16 december 2020 and 30 january 2021 fully overbank events occurred on 12 13 june 25 26 october 14 17 november 19 december 2019 15 16 february 2020 23 and 27 december 2020 20 21 and 28 january 2021 2 february 2021 and 13 may 2021 over the 802 days of monitoring partial overbank events at the upper site totalled 130 h 0 68 of total record time while full bank inundation lasted a total of 47 75 h 0 25 of total record time downstream of the barrier inundation of the rhs bank occurred on 26 october 2019 and both rhs and lhs banks were inundated during storm dennis on 16 february 2020 at the wilderhope middle site fig 4c flows remained inbank for the majority of the monitoring time for 97 09 of the total record time with partial overbank flows inundating the upstream rhs bank for 560 h i e 2 91 of the total record time due to the incised profile of the stream at the middle site the lhs bank was not inundated during the monitoring period the downstream rhs was inundated during storm dennis 15 16 february 2020 at the wilderhope lower site fig 4e similarly due to the steepness of the bank the rhs downstream bank was not inundated during the monitoring period while both the upstream and downstream lhs banks were only inundated i e fully overbank during storm dennis 15 16 february 2020 for 2 5 h the total time occupied by partial overbank events totalled 540 75 h i e 2 81 of total record time the majority of which occurred during autumn and winter seasons from october 2019 to february 2020 in the winter season between december 2020 and february 2021 as well as events in june 2019 and may 2021 fig 4 leaky barrier inundation relative to channel bank height can be classified into five operational flow conditions for a typical leaky barrier at wilde brook fig 5 1 base flow through the gap under the leaky barrier with nil to minor backwater rise 2 inbank flows obstructed by the barrier with water flowing through the barrier and bottom gap 3 overbank flows spilling onto one or both upstream floodplains prior to barrier overtopping 4 overbank flows overtopping the barrier upstream and 5 overbank flows with complete barrier submergence with the relative magnitude of backwater rise decreasing with increasing downstream water level in condition 5 for some cases the downstream water level meets the upstream level which coincides with inundation of both floodplains unobstructed base flow and inbank flows conditions 1 and 2 were the most prevalent occupying 99 82 99 48 98 83 of the total record time while overbank flows overtopping the barriers conditions 3 and 4 occurred during the heavy rainfall and storm events for 0 184 0 517 and 1 17 of the monitoring period for the wilderhope upper middle and lower sites respectively a fully submerged barrier condition 5 was observed once during storm dennis 15 16 february 2020 at the wilderhope upper and wilderhope middle sites lasting for 2 5 h and 0 75 h respectively the wilderhope middle leaky barrier developed significant scour underneath and on the downstream side of the structure as shown in fig 7 which increased the flow area below the structure and prevented the downstream water level from reaching the upstream water level in the fully submerged barrier condition condition 5 as often as the other monitored barriers even though flows overtopped the barrier the wilderhope lower site barrier became fully submerged condition 5 during the heavy rainfall on 25 26 october 2019 see table 3 and during the local storm on 14 nov 2019 during storm dennis and storm christoph as well as during the rainfall event of 28 january 2021 for a total of 28 75 h or 0 15 of the monitoring time the flow depth at which the barrier was submerged in condition 5 changed over time associated with formation of a hole on the left hand side of the barrier next to the bank which was observed during a site visit on 9 july 2021 3 3 upstream relative to downstream submergence depths for all leaky barriers the upstream sensor submergence depth increased relative to the downstream sensor submergence depth over the barrier vertical extent fig 6 a c the relative relationship between upstream and downstream depths differed between barriers and changed over time the depth recorded by the upstream sensor at the wilderhope upper site increased relative to the downstream sensor over the barrier vertical extent with the upstream and downstream sensor submergence depth near y x fig 6a black dotted line below the barrier lower edge a change in curvature was associated with the barrier top vertical edge due to flow overtopping the barrier fig 6a black solid line denoting barrier top edge the relative increase in upstream relative to downstream sensor submergence depth over the barrier vertical extent increased over time black blue and cyan to red open circles associated with accumulation of smaller logs leaves and brash upstream of the barrier observed on photographs and measurements of the longitudinal barrier length creating enhanced backwater effects at the wilderhope middle site initial barrier construction consisted of a woven barrier extending from the channel bed to approximately 1 m above the bed the relationship between upstream and downstream sensor submergence depth initially steepened following a period of steady rainfall 25 26 october 2020 fig 6b black blue to cyan open circles the increase in upstream relative to downstream sensor submergence depth is consistent with accumulation of brash leaves and fine material at the barrier a change in this relationship fig 6b cyan to red open circles was subsequently observed during storm dennis 16 february 2020 after this point the downstream sensor submergence depth was greater than the upstream sensor submergence depth fig 6b y x indicated by black line for low flows with a relative increase in relative upstream downstream relationship observed at higher flows photographs and survey observations recorded development of bedload transport immediately downstream of the barrier with a limited region of scour pool initially present in february 2019 prior to installation of monitoring equipment over time the downstream pool region increased in longitudinal extent extending past the downstream sensor in july 2021 bedload sediment removed from this pool was observed to accumulate and create an exit bar approximately 4 m downstream of the barrier these changes in bed morphology are shown in fig 7 following the change in relationship observed during storm dennis a repeated decrease increase then decrease in relative upstream downstream relationship was observed fig 6b red to pink pink to green green to yellow open circles over time in addition the change in curvature associated with the top vertical edge of the barrier was less pronounced than the observations just prior to storm dennis fig 6b cyan open circles 26 october 2019 to 16 february 2020 compared to the wilderhope upper monitoring site for which the top vertical edge of the barrier consisted of a substantial solid log the upstream edge of the wilderhope middle barrier was composed of a woven arrangement of much smaller interlinked members section 2 4 which was observed to be altered by the formation of a lateral gap in the barrier and bedload transport underneath the barrier over time as shown in photographs of the barrier in fig 7 at the wilderhope lower site an increase in relative upstream downstream depth relationship over the barrier vertical extent was initially observed fig 6c blue open circles during storm dennis the relative increase in upstream depth decreased relative to downstream sensor submergence depth blue to black open circles over time a sparser portion of the barrier adjacent to the lhs bank widened creating a lateral gap between the barrier and the lhs bank the relationship between upstream and downstream sensor depths was observed to shift following storm events fig 8 presents the backwater rise defined as the difference between the upstream us and downstream ds sensor depths against the upstream sensor depths relative to the bank and barrier heights for storm events on 25 31 october 2019 and 16 19 february 2020 corresponding to approximately 4 yr return period events the occurrence of each measurement point in the rising or falling limb of the storm hydrograph and relationship between upstream backwater depth and elevation of upstream channel banks and the barrier top edge are indicated by marker type and colour the maximum recorded backwater rise was 0 49 m on 16 february 2020 at wilderhope upper 0 80 m on 14 november 2019 at wilderhope middle and 0 40 m on 14 november 2019 at wilderhope lower during the inbank condition of the hydrograph before the barrier and banks were overtopped conditions 1 and 2 flows were characterised by an increase in us ds difference with increasing us depth open black circles and open blue squares the rate of which changed when the flow transitioned to partial overbank mode where the rate of increase of us ds depth diminishes condition 3 full black circles and full blue squares as the water level reached the top spill height of the barrier i e the barrier overtopping mode condition 4 red plus sign markers the relative backwater difference decreased with increasing upstream depth indicating that the upstream flow inundated the floodplains while the downstream depth similarly increased due to flow spilling over the barrier fig 8 in the falling limb of the storm hydrograph after the water level had fallen below the barrier top edge blue markers a similar pattern was observed to the hydrograph rising limb black markers with the exception of storm dennis in february 2020 during this event the us ds difference remained steady with increasing us depth indicating that the backwater rise of wilderhope middle fig 8d and wilderhope lower fig 8f barriers was matched by a similar rate of change of the downstream water depths this could be due to the formation of a deeper scour hole and washout of brash and leafy material following overtopping of the barrier for the wilderhope middle site and formation of a lateral gap between the barrier and bank at the wilderhope lower site during storm dennis for several storm events temporal shifts in the relative us and ds water level relationship described in section 3 3 were also observed in the relationship of backwater rise with us sensor depth fig 8 and flow rate fig 9 particularly amongst the october november and february 2020 storms for the wilderhope upper barrier for a given discharge there was a maximum net increase in backwater rise of 0 49 m on 13 february 2020 following storm ciara 08 09 february 2020 attributed to barrier accretion while for the wilderhope middle barrier following the 4 yr event on 25 31 october 2019 at lower flows a decrease in net backwater rise accompanied the falling limb of storm brendan 13 16 january 2020 linked to barrier depletion subsequent storm events storm ciara and storm dennis showed similar reduced peak and falling limb backwater rise than previously observed associated with depletion similarly at wilderhope lower barrier the higher backwater rise was observed following the 4 yr return period event in october 2019 was reduced during similar flows in the december 2019 events storm atiyah and the 1 7 yr event on 18 31 december 2019 due to accretion and depletion of material from the structure barrier performance and backwater rise changed cyclically following storm events fig 9 from blue green to yellow data series in fig 6 at wilderhope middle for instance for similar flow during the 25 31 october 2019 event peak backwater rise for the 13 november 2019 event was increased by a factor of 1 9 however depletion of the barrier diminished backwater rise to a factor of 1 2 by 27 february 2020 after storm dennis fig 9 the cyclical change in backwater rise observed for the wilderhope middle and lower barriers was not observed for the wilderhope upper barrier which saw an increase in backwater rise for a given discharge without diminishing over time fig 9 likely due to the cross section profile and two log structure at wilderhope upper table 1 where accumulated material became lodged and trapped between the two logs over time accretion of wood material and sediment and depletion of the barrier structure is therefore linked to the storms affecting the rate of rising of the upstream depth relative to the downstream depth fig 6 differences in the rising and falling limbs of the storm hydrograph may also demonstrate that the storms physically changed barrier structure for instance the falling limb being lower than the rising limb curve for the wilderhope upper site fig 8a while the opposite was observed for wilderhope middle fig 8c during the october 2019 event 3 4 storage volumes the meshgrid interpolated from sfm dem bathymetry data are shown in fig 10 a with locations of leaky barriers in the surveyed subreach indicated the area upstream of the wilderhope lower barrier up to the next upstream barrier for which the volume was integrated is outlined fig 10a dashed red line the volume of water stored in the area upstream of the wilderhope lower barrier was estimated using dem and lidar bathymetries section 2 6 the difference between lidar and dem generated volumes decreased with increasing water depth for h 0 68 m volume difference ranged between 25 and 31 and for 0 71 h 0 86 m volume difference was 20 visibility of the channel bed and bank and the spatial resolution difference are contributing factors to these differences as the water surface vegetation and tree canopy cover reduces the precision of the lidar measurement su and bork 2006 javernick et al 2014 the total water volume v shown in fig 10b was estimated by assuming a horizontal water surface level at the elevation recorded by the upstream pressure transducer the net water volume vn fig 10c was found from the difference between the water volume calculated using the upstream pressure transducer water elevation and that calculated using the downstream pressure transducer water elevation fig 10b shows the total storage volume and c the slope change of the total volume relative to the water depth with levels corresponding to 2 yr and 4 yr return periods indicated the total volume increased with increasing water depth and no abrupt changes in volumes were associated with inundation of the different bank and berm levels fig 10c bankfull storage volume upstream was estimated around 80 m3 and peak volume was 320 m3 for the 16 february 2020 event 4 yr return period the peak net volumes occurred during the highest flow magnitudes observed return periods of around 2 yr on 19 december 2019 and 14 november 2019 and 4 yr on 26 october 2019 and 16 february 2020 are shown in fig 11 b the associated water volume storage ranged between 52 to 56 m3 for the 2 yr return period events and between 56 and 102 m3 for the 4 yr return period events for the wilderhope lower barrier with the difference attributable to the uncertainty in the discharge derived from the rating curve having a standard error of 0 0271 m3s 1 and differences observed in water levels at the wilderhope lower barrier and the flow site velocity sensor the peak water level recorded at the flow site velocity sensor site during the 26 october event was only 0 009 m less than that recorded during the 16 february 2020 event which gave both events an estimated return period of 4 yr for both these events recorded peak water levels at the flow site velocity sensor h 1 08 1 09 m for october 2019 and february 2020 respectively were close to the measured culvert height of 1 1 m however at the wilderhope lower site the upstream water level during the october event was 0 266 m less than the february event which resulted in different storage volumes fig 11 b time series of the difference between upstream and downstream depths compared to the net storage volume fig 12 b and e with rainfall intensity fig 12a and d and upstream cross sectional average velocity and corresponding event discharge at the flow site velocity sensor fig 12c and f are shown in fig 12 for the october 2019 and february 2020 storm events during the storm rising limb the increase in backwater rise corresponded to an increase in net storage volume following the transition of flow conditions from inbank to overbank and overtopping of the barrier the rate of increase of net storage volumes was lessened by the decrease in relative us ds difference the net storage volume vn gradually decreased during the receding limb of the hydrographs as the barriers gradually released water with the exception of the prolonged rainfall event starting on 13 november 2019 where two low discharge events occurring in close succession resulted in coalescing net storage that remained throughout a 6 day period the sudden dip in upstream cross sectional velocity at the start of the rising limb indicates the commencement of overbank flow as the flow inundates the banks and area increases at a greater rate than the increase in discharge fig 12c and f this is followed by a sudden rise in velocity as the discharge rises as the surface runoff volume increases and levels of high discharge are maintained represented by a series of peak flows in the hydrograph after the flow recedes the upstream velocity remains lower than the before condition as the upstream storage provided by the leaky barrier is slowly released downstream over several days fig 12b and e 4 discussion 4 1 data uncertainties the results presented here are from the monitoring of a small catchment 5 3 km2 and small stream with a focus on paired pressure transducer gauged barriers in situ instrument battery problems caused gaps in flowmeter data limiting the duration over which the discharges were evaluated available flow data was extrapolated using a rating curve to obtain discharges for a period where the flow site velocity sensor had logged erroneous data the use of a rating curve derived from a short record length is a potential source of uncertainty in flow determination together with the application of a feh method for estimating the return period for small catchments 25 km2 faulkner et al 2012 in addition to catchment and stream size specific results various leaky barrier designs also perform differently as indicated by the wilde brook barriers interacting with the flow according to their properties local channel profile and location within the catchment 4 2 comparison of the paired barriers local impact on overbank flows the hydraulic response to the observed storm events varied amongst the barriers with paired pressure transducers the observed frequency of overbank flows depended on the local channel cross sectional profile including the elevation and steepness of the banks and berm which differed at the three measurement sites fig 44b d and f the wilderhope upper fig 4b4 and wilderhope lower fig 4f4 sites follow compound channel profiles while the wilderhope middle fig 4d4 site resembles an incised channel with steep banks incised channels are typical of upper catchment streams where leaky barriers have been installed in previous case studies burgess gamble et al 2017 the occurrence of overbank events fig 44 and the response of each barrier varied according to the barrier design and channel characteristics including the presence and extent of the barrier lower gap log number diameter and spacing barrier vertical extent channel bankfull depth and width and local bathymetry in addition barrier impact on backwater rise varied over time due to accretion and depletion of logs brash and leaves comprising the barriers and local scour at the channel bed wilderhope middle and sides wilderhope lower the increase and decrease in backwater rise over time is similar to that observed by geertsema et al 2019 where the local channel profile and type of wood patch also impacted backwater effects the highest magnitude backwater rise of the three monitored barriers was observed for the wilderhope middle barrier fig 9 which was located in a confined channel section with an 0 7 m barrier vertical extent and at installation no lower gap fig 2c a small lower gap extent 0 05 m relative to the channel bankfull depth developed following installation table 1 at wilderhope upper the backwater rise increased with time fig 9a blue to yellow series associated with accumulation and entrapment of small logs leaves and sediment fig 2a but the magnitude of backwater rise remained lower than that observed at wilderhope middle most likely due to the upper s lower channel cross sectional area and shallower vertical extent 0 47 0 5 m table 1 backwater rise reduced at the wilderhope lower site following storm dennis linked to development of a lateral gap due to local scour at the channel sides to maximize backwater rise a leaky barrier should extend over the full channel section in a deeper confined reach a small lower gap vertical distance increases the longitudinal velocity in the gap region and likelihood of sediment transport below the barrier generating a downstream scour pit as at the wilderhope middle site follett et al 2021 a larger lower gap reduces likelihood of local bedload transport but also reduces barrier vertical extent and maximum backwater rise the possibility of accretion and depletion of barrier material and potential for local sediment transport should be considered when locating barriers with barriers situated away from river infrastructure such as culverts bridges and road crossings at wilde brooke the bed slope was moderate s0 0 01 digimap observed bedload scour was associated with a deposition bar immediately downstream of the scoured area a barrier located downstream of the deposition area may have reduced further bedload transport of scoured sediment care should be taken when considering barrier placement and potential sediment transport at sites with significantly milder or steeper slope the temporal changes in backwater differences for various storms were reflected in the relative upstream and downstream sensor depths for the three barriers during barrier overtopping the downstream depth increased while the us ds difference decreased indicating that the upstream depth rate of increase was lower than the downstream with the exception of storm dennis in february 2020 fig 8 the falling limb of storm dennis showed nearly constant difference in us ds depth probably due to changes in structural composition of the barriers following barrier overtopping depletion of material from the barriers likely occurred at the peak discharge as physical gaps within the wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower barriers were observed in july 2020 a barrier design comprising two or more members present at all three monitoring sites allows flow through the barrier and encourages the trapping and lodging of debris between the gaps this results in accretion of barrier solid volume from locally occurring material fig 2 for no additional material and construction cost the reduction in cross sectional velocity at cross sections immediately upstream and downstream of three monitored leaky barriers are shown here fig 12 however the cumulative effect of the 105 barriers on the flood peak reduction and peak time lag requires further consideration and because there is no before data available this will be investigated in a future modelling study of the wilde brook test reach 4 3 temporal changes in barrier physical properties temporal changes in relative upstream and downstream sensor depths at the three measurement sites are shown in fig 6 river wood availability is subject to seasonal change in riparian vegetation and wood recruitment and transport along the river ruiz villanueva et al 2016 temporally affecting the barrier composition accumulation of brash and leaves mobilised and deposited by runoff following heavy rainfall and storm events followed by wash out or depletion due to decay change the barriers physical structure affecting barrier composition and backwater effect dixon 2016 pinto et al 2019 bedload transport and channel bed changes were observed through photographic records particularly at the wilderhope middle site where a bed scour hole developed and deepened over time addy and wilkinson 2016 also observed localised sediment scour and accumulation around engineered log jams and woody debris and vegetation displacement following a storm event indicating that storms impact barrier physical composition the relative water depth relationship upstream and downstream of the barriers also likely influenced bedload transport as the presence of a lower vertical gap increases near bed streamwise velocity bed shear stress and shields parameter or dimensionless shear stress found from ratio of hydrodynamic forces to submerged particle weight relative to conditions for an unobstructed channel schalko et al 2019 follett and wilson 2020 follett et al 2021 as conditions approach the critical threshold the likelihood of bedload sediment transport increases garcia et al 2000 julien 2010 as the vertical gap distance increases relative to bankfull depth the increase in longitudinal velocity and bed shear stress is reduced follett et al 2021 4 4 storage volume to evaluate the water storage generated by the leaky barrier the upstream volumes above the bed were estimated for a given water level the assumption of a horizontal water surface in the trapezoidal integration calculation of water volume was a likely source of uncertainty underestimating the true storage due to omission of volume due to water surface gradient similar to the relative water level rise between upstream and downstream of the barrier being governed by the barrier properties and channel profile the net storage volume is also governed by these factors hence an increase in backwater rise figs 4 and 5 following accretion of material likely results in increased storage volume for instance whilst both october 2019 and storm dennis in february 2020 were estimated to be of similar peak discharge at their peak storm dennis showed more net storage than the october event fig 11 due to greater backwater rise at the wilderhope lower barrier the results from both high resolution dem and 2 m lidar were consistent despite differences in resolution and precision demonstrating that verified lidar data may be used to approximate storage volumes gained by leaky barriers where high resolution bathymetries are unavailable however leaky barriers can lead to geomorphic changes causing bathymetry to change over time such as developing scour pools and riffles addy and wilkinson 2016 burgess gamble et al 2017 therefore we note that dem and lidar bathymetries only provide a single measurement of a temporally changing river the overall net volume increase for the 105 leaky barriers on the wilde brook test reach ranged between 5 900 and 10 7007 m3 for a 4 yr return period storm event which was based a volume of 56 m3 and 102 m3 per leaky barrier observed for the wilderhope lower barrier storage volumes estimated from other nfm monitoring studies vary widely due to differences in the scheme and setting and the only other quantitative field based study available gives a volume of 48 m3 per leaky barrier which was evaluated for a reach with 35 leaky barriers from water levels and photographic records barnes 2018 modelling studies evaluating storage volumes associated with leaky barriers often use lumped storage estimation methods from multiple runoff attenuation features and other nfm interventions for whole catchment without quantifying the net leaky barrier storage per barrier maximum additional storage volume was computed as 70 000 m3 for 59 leaky barriers with individual barriers storing between 1 500 and 5 000 m3 total volumes in a 29 km2 catchment by metcalfe et al 2017 hankin et al 2020 modelled maximum barrier storage volumes for various leaky barrier numbers along a reach ranging from 245 m3 to 457 m3 for 10 to 20 leaky barriers in a subcatchment of 0 5 km2 comparing leaky barrier storage volumes across modelling case studies is difficult due to different metrics used in volume reportage e g total maximum and return period estimation uncertainty and more field and evidence based studies are needed to elucidate leaky barrier storage performance from a range of different stream catchment settings 5 conclusions field based monitoring on an nfm test reach with 105 leaky barriers was conducted over two years using a raingauge a flow meter and paired pressure loggers upstream and downstream of three leaky barriers of varying design cross sectional profile and bank and berm levels the leaky barriers generated backwater rise which varied depending on the design and storm event magnitude events ranged from heavy rainfall to named storm events and featured storms up to return periods of approximately 4 yr 26 october 2019 and 16 february 2020 floodplain inundation was influenced by storm magnitude barrier and channel properties temporal shifts in relative backwater rise were observed to follow changes in leaky barrier physical properties and composition where accretion of wood material on the barrier increased backwater rise and depletion of material from the barrier decreased backwater rise the maximum recorded backwater rise at three barriers ranged from 0 4 m to 0 8 m during 2 and 4 yr return period events barrier accretion increased the maximum backwater rise by factors of 1 3 to 1 9 compared to the 26 october 2019 event and barrier performance and resulting backwater rise changed cyclically following subsequent storm events additionally bedload transport reduced changes in relative upstream and downstream depths and the incidence of barrier overtopping using high resolution dem 2 m lidar and recorded water levels upstream storage and net storage volumes were calculated showing that the bankfull storage volume upstream of the wilderhope lower barrier amounted to 80 m3 while net storage increase was 52 m3 during 2 yr return period events and up to 102 m3 during the 4 yr return period event which translates to 5 900 and 10 700 m3 net volume increase for the 105 leaky barriers on the wilde brook test reach for a 4 yr return period storm event backwater rise cross sectional average velocity and net storage hydrographs showed rapid filling of the barriers in the rising limb and in the falling limb the upstream velocity remained lower than the before condition as the upstream storage provided by the leaky barrier was slowly released downstream over several days this study s findings indicate that to maximise the magnitude of backwater rise leaky barriers should have a large vertical extent and be located in deeper confined cross sections along a stream reach where a lower gap is present reducing it so that members extend over at least half of the channel depth enhances backwater rise water storage and reduces longitudinal velocity over the backwater region designs composed of two or more members are effective at trapping material resulting in natural barrier accretion thus increasing backwater rise and water storage performance at no additional material and construction cost the potential for development of local scour leading to gaps between the barrier and bed or barrier and channel sides should be considered in light of site sediment management goals and barrier location although a larger lower gap reduces the likelihood of initiation of bedload sediment transport this design also reduces the barrier vertical extent and magnitude of backwater rise this study provides quantitative field based evidence on backwater rise velocity reduction and storage which can inform current and future leaky barrier implementations in addition it provides new information for developing generalised approaches for representing leaky barriers in flood models monitoring of the site is ongoing to further evaluate the leaky barrier performance temporal evolution backwater

1833,engineered leaky barriers are increasingly used as natural flood management methods providing ecosystem and water quality benefits in addition to flood attenuation complementing hard engineering flood defences field based monitoring of a natural flood management site wilde brook in the corvedale catchment england uk studied the rainfall runoff relationship for a 5 36 km reach with 105 leaky barriers over two years paired pressure transducers were placed upstream and downstream of three channel spanning leaky barriers allowing evaluation of upstream backwater rise relative to rainfall intensity storm magnitude and frequency by increasing backwater rise the leaky barriers caused overbank flows resulting in a reduction in the cross sectional area velocity after the event the incidence of overbank flow depended on the local stream cross sectional profile barrier properties location in the reach and storm magnitude barrier operational flow conditions were classified into five modes according to relative bank inundation and barrier submergence extent the backwater rise magnitude depended on barrier physical properties and evolution over time through cycles of accretion and build up of brash and leafy material in the barrier in addition to local bedload sediment transport dynamics where instances of scour around the barriers were observed backwater rise and net volume hydrographs showed rapid filling up behind the barriers on the rising limb and slower water release on the falling limb for a 4 yr return period storm event results indicated that one leaky barrier increased storage volume by up to 102 m3 which translates to an overall net volume increase of 10 700 m3 for the full reach these new findings provide quantitative evidence of leaky barrier backwater and storage performance and leaky barrier design recommendations for storms up to a 4 yr return period this evidence can be used to develop and validate flood modelling generalised approaches for smaller more frequent storms and work towards the development of an approach for modelling leaky barriers for larger storm magnitudes keywords natural flood management leaky barrier flood attenuation backwater rise barrier storage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flood disasters remain a challenging global problem with extreme human and socio economic costs and flood risk further worsened by expected increases in storm intensity and flooding due to climate change ipcc 2014 flood defences traditionally use hard engineering methods to mitigate flood risk in order to add flood resilience nature based solutions to flooding or natural flood management nfm utilises natural catchment process methods in upper catchments to reduce and delay low return period flood peaks further downstream burgess gamble et al 2017 dadson et al 2017 nfm interventions additionally benefit surface and groundwater quality by reconnecting fragmented watercourses increasing wet spaces and creating more heterogenous spaces for wildlife therefore enhancing biodiversity faustini and jones 2003 bouwes et al 2016 wohl et al 2016 these soft engineering methods include runoff attenuation instream structures such as wood leaky barriers which slow down temporally store and gradually release flood flows therefore reducing downstream flood levels and attenuating flood peaks burgess gamble et al 2017 studies evaluating leaky barrier performance quantify effectiveness using the following metrics reduction in downstream peak flow reduction in downstream water level delay in downstream peak flow and increase in catchment response time burgess gamble et al 2017 keys et al 2018 black et al 2020 field monitoring case studies have reported that leaky barriers achieve 27 peak outflow discharge reduction norbury et al 2021 a time lag of ten minutes on the outflow peak discharge for a 3 5 year return period storm event was estimated for a one kilometre reach based on upscaling results from a small experimental test channel with a single wood barrier wenzel et al 2014 while an increasein the delay of times of peak discharge compared to observed rainfall peaks ranging from 2 6 to 7 3 h have been observed at a catchment scale for a mixture of leaky barriers storage ponds and woodland planting black et al 2020 modelling studies also estimate peak outflow discharge reduction for reaches ranging from 4 hankin et al 2019 to 11 metcalfe et al 2017 and 30 nicholson et al 2020 at a catchment scale for leaky barriers used in conjunction with other nfm measures the role of large wood in increasing heterogeneity of flow and regulating sediment transport in the river landscape has been recognised with the reintroduction of wood and wood retention in river restoration and river management practices nisbet et al 2011 bouwes et al 2016 burgess gamble et al 2017 dadson et al 2017 black et al 2020 norbury et al 2021 in such practices the benefits of ecological improvement are balanced with impacts on channel conveyance and flood management previous studies have given insight into the dynamic interrelationships between flow hydraulics and wood patch morphology and channel morphology the structure of wood barriers has been observed to change over time through the accumulation and depletion of organic material and local scour and deposition of bedload sediment which alters the surrounding channel and bank morphology gibling et al 2010 wohl and beckman 2014 dixon and sear 2014 wohl and iskin 2022 changes to the wood barrier and channel morphology result in changes in backwater rise over time geertsema et al 2020 and supports previous studies that observed backwater rise magnitude to be a function of the wood patch height curran and wohl 2003 wilcox and wohl 2006 the backwater rise discharge relationship for large wood barriers on a streambed has been characterised by a steeper increase in backwater rise with increasing discharge until a threshold is reached related to the barrier geometry and channel profile after which the increase in backwater rise declines geertsema et al 2020 the backwater rise has been related to the barrier physical structure with momentum loss proportional to the number size and packing density of the logs and the barrier length and lower gap width allowing description of barriers with a common structural metric and development of a rating curve for depths below the barrier crest follett et al 2020 follett et al 2021 however research gaps remain for the effect of barriers at water depths above the barrier crest and the impact of barriers during periods of unsteady flow in this paper the impact of barriers for water depths above the barrier crest and unsteady flow conditions is examined using monitoring evidence from a natural flood management site wood barriers generate an increase in flood peak lag time by increasing upstream water depth and local floodplain water storage burgess gamble et al 2017 keys et al 2018 follett et al 2020 follett et al 2021 muhawenimana et al 2021 wood barriers also alter the transport of bedload and channel bank sediment schalko et al 2019 follett and wilson 2020 and increase hydraulic roughness wilcox and wohl 2006 geertsema et al 2020 follett and hankin 2022 evaluation of the effectiveness of leaky barriers is still advancing with few studies attempting to quantify the functional behaviour of leaky barriers water storage potential and how their evolution impacts on their function wenzel et al 2014 burgess gamble et al 2017 in addition empirical evidence is still lacking to quantify the hydraulic impact of leaky barriers at the structure and reach scales there is little practical guidance on leaky barrier design and its optimisation for flood risk management purposes this information is crucial for stakeholders for nfm scheme design and facilitating the wider use of nfm in flood risk management in this paper we present new field monitoring evidence of a natural flood management site comprising 105 leaky barriers on the wilde brook corvedale shropshire uk this scheme is one of the 26 fluvial natural flood management monitoring projects funded by the uk government in 2018 with the key aim of learning by doing arnott et al 2018 using a flow sensor rain gauge and paired water level loggers upstream and downstream of the leaky barriers in three locations along the reach we evaluate the hydraulic effect of the leaky barriers for storm events recorded over a two year monitoring duration relative to the local channel bathymetry the rise in upstream backwater and water storage volume are compared between barriers with different physical characteristics for selected storm events the new evidence on leaky barrier operation will inform the planning and design stages of future flood risk management projects 2 methods 2 1 field site description the wilde brook monitored test reach site is 5 36 km in length and has a catchment area of 5 3 km2 it is bounded on the north west by wenlock edge which is limestone escarpment and a site of special scientific interest due to its geology england 1986 the catchment s land use is comprised of agricultural land with a mix of pasture and arable wilde brook is one of eight tributaries of the river corve in the coverdale catchment in shropshire england fig 1 the upstream section of the wilde brook reach is referred to as the wilderhope upper reach while the wilderhope middle reach refers to the section of the reach prior to the confluence with an ephemeral stream at the upper confluence fig 1 the wilderhope lower reach indicates the section of the reach between the upper confluence and the downstream corve confluence fig 1 sequentially the streamwise distances of reach segments between measurement locations from the upstream end of wilde brook to wilderhope upper is 870 m from wilderhope upper to wilderhope middle is 758 m 888 m from wilderhope middle to upper confluence 1 426 m from upper confluence to wilderhope lower 2 26 m from wilderhope lower 2 to wilderhope lower 1 784 m from wilderhope lower 1 to flow site velocity sensor which is 617 m to corve confluence 2 2 monitoring instrumentation paired pressure transducers rain gauge and flow meter hydrometric monitoring instrumentation was first installed in april may 2019 and georeferenced using dgps and regularly checked manually and maintained the monitoring instrumentation consisted of 10 vented pressure transducers ott orpheus mini pressure level sensor of which eight were paired located 2 4 4 m upstream and downstream of the selected leaky barriers in the wilderhope upper wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower reaches and two were placed as single pressure sensors at the wilderhope upper confluence and corve confluence fig 1 the pressure transducers recorded water levels every 15 min with an accuracy of 0 05 ott 2021 rainfall was recorded at the stanway raingauge station fig 1 using a lambrecht tipping bucket raingauge which recorded 0 2 mm events at 15 min intervals due to low battery voltage there is a gap in the data from 11 april 2020 and 29 may 2020 the data and analysis presented in this paper relates to the period 12 april 2019 to 22 june 2021 the investigation of the barrier at wilderhope lower 2 did not commence until november 2020 when the paired pressure transducers were installed therefore lower 2 is not included in the current analysis to ensure consistency in the monitoring durations for the paired leaky barriers hereafter wilderhope lower refers to the wilderhope lower 1 barrier a flow meter av 9000 area velocity sensor with a hach fl900 flow logger was placed downstream of a culvert 1 57 m wide and 1 1 m high indicated as flow site velocity sensor in fig 1 the flow logger recorded water level flow velocity and discharge at 15 min intervals battery malfunctions occurred for the flow logger and battery replacement did not resolve data quality issues therefore only flow data from april september 2019 is presented here the recorded discharge data was fitted to the rating curve equation q 1 6525 h 2 6102 r 2 0 99 where q is discharge m3 s and h is water depth m the uncertainty in estimated discharge associated with using a rating curve derived from a short record length is acknowledged and the discharge uncertainty was determined the refh approach version 2 was used to estimate the flood frequency of each peak river discharge kjeldsen 2007 wallingford hydrosolutions 2021 the return period estimates provided an indicative magnitude for the observed storm events placing them within a flood frequency context four substantial storm events observed during the two year monitoring period are highlighted in this paper 2 yr return period events on 19 december 2019 and 14 november 2019 and 4 yr return period events on 26 october 2019 and 16 february 2020 2 3 leaky barrier properties and local channel bathymetry 105 leaky barriers were constructed on the wilde brook monitored test reach between winter 2016 and february 2018 using wood alder hazel and oak species sourced locally from the riverbanks and floodplain the longitudinal spacing between barriers varied from 11 to 50 m while the vertical gap below the barriers varied between zero to 0 75 m the leaky barriers consisted of channel spanning key members as well as secondary members of varying diameters and lengths the channel spanning members were secured using wooden pegs and rebar and anchored to bankside tree trunks where available a vertical gap above the bed was maintained below the barriers to ensure free passage of baseflow the majority of designs followed available engineered barrier guidance adept 2019 which were adapted for specific channel cross sections neal l personal communication 14 september 2021 the most frequent leaky barrier design consisted of channel spanning parallel large logs placed perpendicular to the main flow direction and pinned in place while other barriers consisted of smaller logs and tree branches resembling natural woody accumulations where the logs were accumulated rather than engineered in geometrical arrangement and others were built as woven structures the barriers were georeferenced and their characteristics including elevation above bed number of key members composition and size were measured photographic records of the barriers were collected annually to track their time evolution natural accretion and washout or depletion of brash material from the leaky barriers was allowed to take place maintenance of the leaky barriers was carried out only when key members became dislodged or moved usually during higher flow events which occurred for 10 of the leaky barriers since installation leaky barrier repairs were carried out in winter 2020 neal l personal communication 10 december 2021 2 4 description of the selected leaky barriers with paired pressure transducers three sets of paired pressure transducers measured the sensor submergence depth upstream and downstream of three leaky barriers located in the wilderhope upper wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower sub reaches beginning on 12 april 2019 these three paired leaky barriers were selected to represent a range of leaky barrier designs barrier bank profiles and bed slopes at various stations along the reach the water surface elevation was measured relative to a yellow survey peg georeferenced at installation and during four service visits november 2019 may 2020 november 2020 july 2021 september 2021 barrier vertical extent visually apparent structural composition accumulation of brash and leaves and visually apparent bedload sediment transport were observed at field visits february 2019 november 2019 november 2020 july 2021 september 2021 through repeat photographs of the barriers and survey measurements using a wading rod to an accuracy of 1 cm stream cross section profiles were surveyed in november 2020 at the location of the pressure transducers the channel right hand side rhs and left hand side lhs are defined looking in the downstream flow direction characteristics of the wilderhope upper middle and lower barriers are shown in table 1 and photographs of the barriers are shown in fig 2 the wilderhope upper measurement site comprised of a barrier composed of two logs placed across the upper channel and pinned upstream and downstream on both banks with wooden stakes no changes in bed level due to bedload sediment transport were visually apparent during the monitoring period the wilderhope middle measurement site leaky barrier comprised a woven structure perpendicular to the flow direction at the wilderhope lower measurement site the barrier used a naturalised engineered design composed of a varied accumulation of logs constructed perpendicular to the flow direction table 2 shows the channel cross sections at the pressure loggers upstream of each barrier 2 5 wilde brook structure from motion sfm photogrammetry to obtain ultra high spatial resolution topographic survey data of a sub reach of the wilderhope lower site fig 1 that has significant canopy cover pole mounted photography gonçalves et al 2016 luhmann et al 2019 supplemented with imagery from an uncrewed aerial system uas where feasible was utilised structure from motion sfm photogrammetry was applied to a sub reach 130 m long reach length defined as measured along the thalweg that included five leaky barriers the field survey was conducted at low flow in march 2021 which enabled an uninhibited view of the stream bed through the clear and shallow water initially 26 ground control points were placed along the channel margins and their locations surveyed with the trimble r10 rtk gps pole mounted images were obtained with a dji phantom 4 rtk uas attached with clamps to two extendable carbon fibre poles with image locations corrected with connection to a dji d rtk 2 gnss base station located within 50 m of the surveyed reach images were taken at a height of 3 m above the ground at an oblique angle of 75 spaced approximately every 0 4 m along each bank in order to create 80 overlap between images additional nadir imagery was collected by carefully flying the uas under the canopy and above the water surface at a height of approximately 3 m above the channel wherever possible sfm photogrammetry was applied to the resulting 825 images using agisoft metashape 1 7 3 to create a dense point cloud consisting of 389 815 240 points digital elevation model dem and orthophotomosaic refraction correction was applied to the submerged areas in the dem following established procedures westaway et al 2000 woodget et al 2015 the dem has a spatial resolution of 2 mm pixel a point density of approximately 25 points per cm2 and its positional accuracy had a root mean square error rmse of 2 cm in the horizontal direction and 4 cm vertically 2 6 storage volume calculation 2 6 1 using sfm photogrammetry derived dem for the wilderhope lower sub reach water volumes stored upstream of the wilderhope lower leaky barrier for a given water level were calculated by trapezoidal numerical integration over the meshgrid interpolated from the sfm photogrammetry derived 2 mm resolution dem using matlab r2021a the area of interest was delimited from the upstream face of the leaky barrier of interest to the downstream face of the leaky barrier immediately upstream the measured upstream pressure transducer water level was assumed to be horizontal over this area and applied to the trapezoidal interpolation of volumes local cross sections from the dem at the pressure transducer location were verified with bed survey transects the trapezoidal integration was performed for submerged areas of the dem only i e areas with water elevation greater than bed elevation the net storage volume represents the difference between the estimated storage volume upstream and downstream of the leaky barrier or the increase in storage volume attributed to the leaky barrier similarly the trapezoidal integration method was used to calculate the flow velocity upstream of the leaky barriers using the stream cross section profiles the measured water level the flow cross section area and the discharge recorded at the flow site velocity sensor 2 6 2 using 2 m dtm lidar data the sfm photogrammetry derived dem provided an ultra high resolution survey of the majority of the modelled reach at the wilderhope lower monitoring location however for flood inundation exceeding the upstream extent of the sfm photogrammetry derived dem ordnance survey 2 m dtm lidar from the environment agency with accuracy of 15 cm rmse lidar composite digital terrain model england 2m resolution 2016 edina lidar digimap service https digimap edina ac uk was used to evaluate the water volume upstream of the leaky barrier of interest the coordinates for each lidar tile were obtained using lower left corner and y coordinates for the given elevation the resulting matrix was then reshaped into column arrays which could be used to create a meshgrid of the bathymetry the trapezoidal interpolation method outlined in section 2 6 1 was used to obtain the water volume stored inbank and overbank upstream of the leaky barrier using the lidar meshgrid processing and analysis were again conducted using matlab r2021a 3 results 3 1 rainfall intensity hourly cumulative rainfall is shown in fig 3 grey circles where the wilderhope lower upstream and downstream paired pressure transducer submergence depths at the time of the rainfall record are also plotted fig 3 black and blue solid lines several heavy rainfall events with daily rainfall magnitude greater than 20 mm per day occurred during the monitoring period as shown in table 3 along with storm names available from the uk s met office the highest recorded daily rainfall intensity reached 41 6 mm day on 11 june 2019 and the second and third highest intensity were 37 6 mm day on 26 october 2019 and 35 2 mm day on 12 august 2020 respectively the 12 august 2020 event showed the maximum recorded hourly rainfall intensity of 22 6 mm hour named storms of lesser magnitude were also recorded including storm jorge 28 february 01 march 2020 and storm ellen 19 20 august 2020 with

relative to the channel banks indicated the occurrence of inbank bankfull partial overbank only one bank is inundated and fully overbank events a wide range of inundation levels were observed at the wilderhope upper site fig 4a including inbank flows below both rhs and lhs banks upstream and downstream of the barrier partial overbank flows where the water spilled over only the rhs bank upstream of the barrier and fully overbank events where both rhs and lhs banks were simultaneously inundated upstream of the barrier partial overbank events occurred on 23 24 february 16 december 2020 and 30 january 2021 fully overbank events occurred on 12 13 june 25 26 october 14 17 november 19 december 2019 15 16 february 2020 23 and 27 december 2020 20 21 and 28 january 2021 2 february 2021 and 13 may 2021 over the 802 days of monitoring partial overbank events at the upper site totalled 130 h 0 68 of total record time while full bank inundation lasted a total of 47 75 h 0 25 of total record time downstream of the barrier inundation of the rhs bank occurred on 26 october 2019 and both rhs and lhs banks were inundated during storm dennis on 16 february 2020 at the wilderhope middle site fig 4c flows remained inbank for the majority of the monitoring time for 97 09 of the total record time with partial overbank flows inundating the upstream rhs bank for 560 h i e 2 91 of the total record time due to the incised profile of the stream at the middle site the lhs bank was not inundated during the monitoring period the downstream rhs was inundated during storm dennis 15 16 february 2020 at the wilderhope lower site fig 4e similarly due to the steepness of the bank the rhs downstream bank was not inundated during the monitoring period while both the upstream and downstream lhs banks were only inundated i e fully overbank during storm dennis 15 16 february 2020 for 2 5 h the total time occupied by partial overbank events totalled 540 75 h i e 2 81 of total record time the majority of which occurred during autumn and winter seasons from october 2019 to february 2020 in the winter season between december 2020 and february 2021 as well as events in june 2019 and may 2021 fig 4 leaky barrier inundation relative to channel bank height can be classified into five operational flow conditions for a typical leaky barrier at wilde brook fig 5 1 base flow through the gap under the leaky barrier with nil to minor backwater rise 2 inbank flows obstructed by the barrier with water flowing through the barrier and bottom gap 3 overbank flows spilling onto one or both upstream floodplains prior to barrier overtopping 4 overbank flows overtopping the barrier upstream and 5 overbank flows with complete barrier submergence with the relative magnitude of backwater rise decreasing with increasing downstream water level in condition 5 for some cases the downstream water level meets the upstream level which coincides with inundation of both floodplains unobstructed base flow and inbank flows conditions 1 and 2 were the most prevalent occupying 99 82 99 48 98 83 of the total record time while overbank flows overtopping the barriers conditions 3 and 4 occurred during the heavy rainfall and storm events for 0 184 0 517 and 1 17 of the monitoring period for the wilderhope upper middle and lower sites respectively a fully submerged barrier condition 5 was observed once during storm dennis 15 16 february 2020 at the wilderhope upper and wilderhope middle sites lasting for 2 5 h and 0 75 h respectively the wilderhope middle leaky barrier developed significant scour underneath and on the downstream side of the structure as shown in fig 7 which increased the flow area below the structure and prevented the downstream water level from reaching the upstream water level in the fully submerged barrier condition condition 5 as often as the other monitored barriers even though flows overtopped the barrier the wilderhope lower site barrier became fully submerged condition 5 during the heavy rainfall on 25 26 october 2019 see table 3 and during the local storm on 14 nov 2019 during storm dennis and storm christoph as well as during the rainfall event of 28 january 2021 for a total of 28 75 h or 0 15 of the monitoring time the flow depth at which the barrier was submerged in condition 5 changed over time associated with formation of a hole on the left hand side of the barrier next to the bank which was observed during a site visit on 9 july 2021 3 3 upstream relative to downstream submergence depths for all leaky barriers the upstream sensor submergence depth increased relative to the downstream sensor submergence depth over the barrier vertical extent fig 6 a c the relative relationship between upstream and downstream depths differed between barriers and changed over time the depth recorded by the upstream sensor at the wilderhope upper site increased relative to the downstream sensor over the barrier vertical extent with the upstream and downstream sensor submergence depth near y x fig 6a black dotted line below the barrier lower edge a change in curvature was associated with the barrier top vertical edge due to flow overtopping the barrier fig 6a black solid line denoting barrier top edge the relative increase in upstream relative to downstream sensor submergence depth over the barrier vertical extent increased over time black blue and cyan to red open circles associated with accumulation of smaller logs leaves and brash upstream of the barrier observed on photographs and measurements of the longitudinal barrier length creating enhanced backwater effects at the wilderhope middle site initial barrier construction consisted of a woven barrier extending from the channel bed to approximately 1 m above the bed the relationship between upstream and downstream sensor submergence depth initially steepened following a period of steady rainfall 25 26 october 2020 fig 6b black blue to cyan open circles the increase in upstream relative to downstream sensor submergence depth is consistent with accumulation of brash leaves and fine material at the barrier a change in this relationship fig 6b cyan to red open circles was subsequently observed during storm dennis 16 february 2020 after this point the downstream sensor submergence depth was greater than the upstream sensor submergence depth fig 6b y x indicated by black line for low flows with a relative increase in relative upstream downstream relationship observed at higher flows photographs and survey observations recorded development of bedload transport immediately downstream of the barrier with a limited region of scour pool initially present in february 2019 prior to installation of monitoring equipment over time the downstream pool region increased in longitudinal extent extending past the downstream sensor in july 2021 bedload sediment removed from this pool was observed to accumulate and create an exit bar approximately 4 m downstream of the barrier these changes in bed morphology are shown in fig 7 following the change in relationship observed during storm dennis a repeated decrease increase then decrease in relative upstream downstream relationship was observed fig 6b red to pink pink to green green to yellow open circles over time in addition the change in curvature associated with the top vertical edge of the barrier was less pronounced than the observations just prior to storm dennis fig 6b cyan open circles 26 october 2019 to 16 february 2020 compared to the wilderhope upper monitoring site for which the top vertical edge of the barrier consisted of a substantial solid log the upstream edge of the wilderhope middle barrier was composed of a woven arrangement of much smaller interlinked members section 2 4 which was observed to be altered by the formation of a lateral gap in the barrier and bedload transport underneath the barrier over time as shown in photographs of the barrier in fig 7 at the wilderhope lower site an increase in relative upstream downstream depth relationship over the barrier vertical extent was initially observed fig 6c blue open circles during storm dennis the relative increase in upstream depth decreased relative to downstream sensor submergence depth blue to black open circles over time a sparser portion of the barrier adjacent to the lhs bank widened creating a lateral gap between the barrier and the lhs bank the relationship between upstream and downstream sensor depths was observed to shift following storm events fig 8 presents the backwater rise defined as the difference between the upstream us and downstream ds sensor depths against the upstream sensor depths relative to the bank and barrier heights for storm events on 25 31 october 2019 and 16 19 february 2020 corresponding to approximately 4 yr return period events the occurrence of each measurement point in the rising or falling limb of the storm hydrograph and relationship between upstream backwater depth and elevation of upstream channel banks and the barrier top edge are indicated by marker type and colour the maximum recorded backwater rise was 0 49 m on 16 february 2020 at wilderhope upper 0 80 m on 14 november 2019 at wilderhope middle and 0 40 m on 14 november 2019 at wilderhope lower during the inbank condition of the hydrograph before the barrier and banks were overtopped conditions 1 and 2 flows were characterised by an increase in us ds difference with increasing us depth open black circles and open blue squares the rate of which changed when the flow transitioned to partial overbank mode where the rate of increase of us ds depth diminishes condition 3 full black circles and full blue squares as the water level reached the top spill height of the barrier i e the barrier overtopping mode condition 4 red plus sign markers the relative backwater difference decreased with increasing upstream depth indicating that the upstream flow inundated the floodplains while the downstream depth similarly increased due to flow spilling over the barrier fig 8 in the falling limb of the storm hydrograph after the water level had fallen below the barrier top edge blue markers a similar pattern was observed to the hydrograph rising limb black markers with the exception of storm dennis in february 2020 during this event the us ds difference remained steady with increasing us depth indicating that the backwater rise of wilderhope middle fig 8d and wilderhope lower fig 8f barriers was matched by a similar rate of change of the downstream water depths this could be due to the formation of a deeper scour hole and washout of brash and leafy material following overtopping of the barrier for the wilderhope middle site and formation of a lateral gap between the barrier and bank at the wilderhope lower site during storm dennis for several storm events temporal shifts in the relative us and ds water level relationship described in section 3 3 were also observed in the relationship of backwater rise with us sensor depth fig 8 and flow rate fig 9 particularly amongst the october november and february 2020 storms for the wilderhope upper barrier for a given discharge there was a maximum net increase in backwater rise of 0 49 m on 13 february 2020 following storm ciara 08 09 february 2020 attributed to barrier accretion while for the wilderhope middle barrier following the 4 yr event on 25 31 october 2019 at lower flows a decrease in net backwater rise accompanied the falling limb of storm brendan 13 16 january 2020 linked to barrier depletion subsequent storm events storm ciara and storm dennis showed similar reduced peak and falling limb backwater rise than previously observed associated with depletion similarly at wilderhope lower barrier the higher backwater rise was observed following the 4 yr return period event in october 2019 was reduced during similar flows in the december 2019 events storm atiyah and the 1 7 yr event on 18 31 december 2019 due to accretion and depletion of material from the structure barrier performance and backwater rise changed cyclically following storm events fig 9 from blue green to yellow data series in fig 6 at wilderhope middle for instance for similar flow during the 25 31 october 2019 event peak backwater rise for the 13 november 2019 event was increased by a factor of 1 9 however depletion of the barrier diminished backwater rise to a factor of 1 2 by 27 february 2020 after storm dennis fig 9 the cyclical change in backwater rise observed for the wilderhope middle and lower barriers was not observed for the wilderhope upper barrier which saw an increase in backwater rise for a given discharge without diminishing over time fig 9 likely due to the cross section profile and two log structure at wilderhope upper table 1 where accumulated material became lodged and trapped between the two logs over time accretion of wood material and sediment and depletion of the barrier structure is therefore linked to the storms affecting the rate of rising of the upstream depth relative to the downstream depth fig 6 differences in the rising and falling limbs of the storm hydrograph may also demonstrate that the storms physically changed barrier structure for instance the falling limb being lower than the rising limb curve for the wilderhope upper site fig 8a while the opposite was observed for wilderhope middle fig 8c during the october 2019 event 3 4 storage volumes the meshgrid interpolated from sfm dem bathymetry data are shown in fig 10 a with locations of leaky barriers in the surveyed subreach indicated the area upstream of the wilderhope lower barrier up to the next upstream barrier for which the volume was integrated is outlined fig 10a dashed red line the volume of water stored in the area upstream of the wilderhope lower barrier was estimated using dem and lidar bathymetries section 2 6 the difference between lidar and dem generated volumes decreased with increasing water depth for h 0 68 m volume difference ranged between 25 and 31 and for 0 71 h 0 86 m volume difference was 20 visibility of the channel bed and bank and the spatial resolution difference are contributing factors to these differences as the water surface vegetation and tree canopy cover reduces the precision of the lidar measurement su and bork 2006 javernick et al 2014 the total water volume v shown in fig 10b was estimated by assuming a horizontal water surface level at the elevation recorded by the upstream pressure transducer the net water volume vn fig 10c was found from the difference between the water volume calculated using the upstream pressure transducer water elevation and that calculated using the downstream pressure transducer water elevation fig 10b shows the total storage volume and c the slope change of the total volume relative to the water depth with levels corresponding to 2 yr and 4 yr return periods indicated the total volume increased with increasing water depth and no abrupt changes in volumes were associated with inundation of the different bank and berm levels fig 10c bankfull storage volume upstream was estimated around 80 m3 and peak volume was 320 m3 for the 16 february 2020 event 4 yr return period the peak net volumes occurred during the highest flow magnitudes observed return periods of around 2 yr on 19 december 2019 and 14 november 2019 and 4 yr on 26 october 2019 and 16 february 2020 are shown in fig 11 b the associated water volume storage ranged between 52 to 56 m3 for the 2 yr return period events and between 56 and 102 m3 for the 4 yr return period events for the wilderhope lower barrier with the difference attributable to the uncertainty in the discharge derived from the rating curve having a standard error of 0 0271 m3s 1 and differences observed in water levels at the wilderhope lower barrier and the flow site velocity sensor the peak water level recorded at the flow site velocity sensor site during the 26 october event was only 0 009 m less than that recorded during the 16 february 2020 event which gave both events an estimated return period of 4 yr for both these events recorded peak water levels at the flow site velocity sensor h 1 08 1 09 m for october 2019 and february 2020 respectively were close to the measured culvert height of 1 1 m however at the wilderhope lower site the upstream water level during the october event was 0 266 m less than the february event which resulted in different storage volumes fig 11 b time series of the difference between upstream and downstream depths compared to the net storage volume fig 12 b and e with rainfall intensity fig 12a and d and upstream cross sectional average velocity and corresponding event discharge at the flow site velocity sensor fig 12c and f are shown in fig 12 for the october 2019 and february 2020 storm events during the storm rising limb the increase in backwater rise corresponded to an increase in net storage volume following the transition of flow conditions from inbank to overbank and overtopping of the barrier the rate of increase of net storage volumes was lessened by the decrease in relative us ds difference the net storage volume vn gradually decreased during the receding limb of the hydrographs as the barriers gradually released water with the exception of the prolonged rainfall event starting on 13 november 2019 where two low discharge events occurring in close succession resulted in coalescing net storage that remained throughout a 6 day period the sudden dip in upstream cross sectional velocity at the start of the rising limb indicates the commencement of overbank flow as the flow inundates the banks and area increases at a greater rate than the increase in discharge fig 12c and f this is followed by a sudden rise in velocity as the discharge rises as the surface runoff volume increases and levels of high discharge are maintained represented by a series of peak flows in the hydrograph after the flow recedes the upstream velocity remains lower than the before condition as the upstream storage provided by the leaky barrier is slowly released downstream over several days fig 12b and e 4 discussion 4 1 data uncertainties the results presented here are from the monitoring of a small catchment 5 3 km2 and small stream with a focus on paired pressure transducer gauged barriers in situ instrument battery problems caused gaps in flowmeter data limiting the duration over which the discharges were evaluated available flow data was extrapolated using a rating curve to obtain discharges for a period where the flow site velocity sensor had logged erroneous data the use of a rating curve derived from a short record length is a potential source of uncertainty in flow determination together with the application of a feh method for estimating the return period for small catchments 25 km2 faulkner et al 2012 in addition to catchment and stream size specific results various leaky barrier designs also perform differently as indicated by the wilde brook barriers interacting with the flow according to their properties local channel profile and location within the catchment 4 2 comparison of the paired barriers local impact on overbank flows the hydraulic response to the observed storm events varied amongst the barriers with paired pressure transducers the observed frequency of overbank flows depended on the local channel cross sectional profile including the elevation and steepness of the banks and berm which differed at the three measurement sites fig 44b d and f the wilderhope upper fig 4b4 and wilderhope lower fig 4f4 sites follow compound channel profiles while the wilderhope middle fig 4d4 site resembles an incised channel with steep banks incised channels are typical of upper catchment streams where leaky barriers have been installed in previous case studies burgess gamble et al 2017 the occurrence of overbank events fig 44 and the response of each barrier varied according to the barrier design and channel characteristics including the presence and extent of the barrier lower gap log number diameter and spacing barrier vertical extent channel bankfull depth and width and local bathymetry in addition barrier impact on backwater rise varied over time due to accretion and depletion of logs brash and leaves comprising the barriers and local scour at the channel bed wilderhope middle and sides wilderhope lower the increase and decrease in backwater rise over time is similar to that observed by geertsema et al 2019 where the local channel profile and type of wood patch also impacted backwater effects the highest magnitude backwater rise of the three monitored barriers was observed for the wilderhope middle barrier fig 9 which was located in a confined channel section with an 0 7 m barrier vertical extent and at installation no lower gap fig 2c a small lower gap extent 0 05 m relative to the channel bankfull depth developed following installation table 1 at wilderhope upper the backwater rise increased with time fig 9a blue to yellow series associated with accumulation and entrapment of small logs leaves and sediment fig 2a but the magnitude of backwater rise remained lower than that observed at wilderhope middle most likely due to the upper s lower channel cross sectional area and shallower vertical extent 0 47 0 5 m table 1 backwater rise reduced at the wilderhope lower site following storm dennis linked to development of a lateral gap due to local scour at the channel sides to maximize backwater rise a leaky barrier should extend over the full channel section in a deeper confined reach a small lower gap vertical distance increases the longitudinal velocity in the gap region and likelihood of sediment transport below the barrier generating a downstream scour pit as at the wilderhope middle site follett et al 2021 a larger lower gap reduces likelihood of local bedload transport but also reduces barrier vertical extent and maximum backwater rise the possibility of accretion and depletion of barrier material and potential for local sediment transport should be considered when locating barriers with barriers situated away from river infrastructure such as culverts bridges and road crossings at wilde brooke the bed slope was moderate s0 0 01 digimap observed bedload scour was associated with a deposition bar immediately downstream of the scoured area a barrier located downstream of the deposition area may have reduced further bedload transport of scoured sediment care should be taken when considering barrier placement and potential sediment transport at sites with significantly milder or steeper slope the temporal changes in backwater differences for various storms were reflected in the relative upstream and downstream sensor depths for the three barriers during barrier overtopping the downstream depth increased while the us ds difference decreased indicating that the upstream depth rate of increase was lower than the downstream with the exception of storm dennis in february 2020 fig 8 the falling limb of storm dennis showed nearly constant difference in us ds depth probably due to changes in structural composition of the barriers following barrier overtopping depletion of material from the barriers likely occurred at the peak discharge as physical gaps within the wilderhope middle and wilderhope lower barriers were observed in july 2020 a barrier design comprising two or more members present at all three monitoring sites allows flow through the barrier and encourages the trapping and lodging of debris between the gaps this results in accretion of barrier solid volume from locally occurring material fig 2 for no additional material and construction cost the reduction in cross sectional velocity at cross sections immediately upstream and downstream of three monitored leaky barriers are shown here fig 12 however the cumulative effect of the 105 barriers on the flood peak reduction and peak time lag requires further consideration and because there is no before data available this will be investigated in a future modelling study of the wilde brook test reach 4 3 temporal changes in barrier physical properties temporal changes in relative upstream and downstream sensor depths at the three measurement sites are shown in fig 6 river wood availability is subject to seasonal change in riparian vegetation and wood recruitment and transport along the river ruiz villanueva et al 2016 temporally affecting the barrier composition accumulation of brash and leaves mobilised and deposited by runoff following heavy rainfall and storm events followed by wash out or depletion due to decay change the barriers physical structure affecting barrier composition and backwater effect dixon 2016 pinto et al 2019 bedload transport and channel bed changes were observed through photographic records particularly at the wilderhope middle site where a bed scour hole developed and deepened over time addy and wilkinson 2016 also observed localised sediment scour and accumulation around engineered log jams and woody debris and vegetation displacement following a storm event indicating that storms impact barrier physical composition the relative water depth relationship upstream and downstream of the barriers also likely influenced bedload transport as the presence of a lower vertical gap increases near bed streamwise velocity bed shear stress and shields parameter or dimensionless shear stress found from ratio of hydrodynamic forces to submerged particle weight relative to conditions for an unobstructed channel schalko et al 2019 follett and wilson 2020 follett et al 2021 as conditions approach the critical threshold the likelihood of bedload sediment transport increases garcia et al 2000 julien 2010 as the vertical gap distance increases relative to bankfull depth the increase in longitudinal velocity and bed shear stress is reduced follett et al 2021 4 4 storage volume to evaluate the water storage generated by the leaky barrier the upstream volumes above the bed were estimated for a given water level the assumption of a horizontal water surface in the trapezoidal integration calculation of water volume was a likely source of uncertainty underestimating the true storage due to omission of volume due to water surface gradient similar to the relative water level rise between upstream and downstream of the barrier being governed by the barrier properties and channel profile the net storage volume is also governed by these factors hence an increase in backwater rise figs 4 and 5 following accretion of material likely results in increased storage volume for instance whilst both october 2019 and storm dennis in february 2020 were estimated to be of similar peak discharge at their peak storm dennis showed more net storage than the october event fig 11 due to greater backwater rise at the wilderhope lower barrier the results from both high resolution dem and 2 m lidar were consistent despite differences in resolution and precision demonstrating that verified lidar data may be used to approximate storage volumes gained by leaky barriers where high resolution bathymetries are unavailable however leaky barriers can lead to geomorphic changes causing bathymetry to change over time such as developing scour pools and riffles addy and wilkinson 2016 burgess gamble et al 2017 therefore we note that dem and lidar bathymetries only provide a single measurement of a temporally changing river the overall net volume increase for the 105 leaky barriers on the wilde brook test reach ranged between 5 900 and 10 7007 m3 for a 4 yr return period storm event which was based a volume of 56 m3 and 102 m3 per leaky barrier observed for the wilderhope lower barrier storage volumes estimated from other nfm monitoring studies vary widely due to differences in the scheme and setting and the only other quantitative field based study available gives a volume of 48 m3 per leaky barrier which was evaluated for a reach with 35 leaky barriers from water levels and photographic records barnes 2018 modelling studies evaluating storage volumes associated with leaky barriers often use lumped storage estimation methods from multiple runoff attenuation features and other nfm interventions for whole catchment without quantifying the net leaky barrier storage per barrier maximum additional storage volume was computed as 70 000 m3 for 59 leaky barriers with individual barriers storing between 1 500 and 5 000 m3 total volumes in a 29 km2 catchment by metcalfe et al 2017 hankin et al 2020 modelled maximum barrier storage volumes for various leaky barrier numbers along a reach ranging from 245 m3 to 457 m3 for 10 to 20 leaky barriers in a subcatchment of 0 5 km2 comparing leaky barrier storage volumes across modelling case studies is difficult due to different metrics used in volume reportage e g total maximum and return period estimation uncertainty and more field and evidence based studies are needed to elucidate leaky barrier storage performance from a range of different stream catchment settings 5 conclusions field based monitoring on an nfm test reach with 105 leaky barriers was conducted over two years using a raingauge a flow meter and paired pressure loggers upstream and downstream of three leaky barriers of varying design cross sectional profile and bank and berm levels the leaky barriers generated backwater rise which varied depending on the design and storm event magnitude events ranged from heavy rainfall to named storm events and featured storms up to return periods of approximately 4 yr 26 october 2019 and 16 february 2020 floodplain inundation was influenced by storm magnitude barrier and channel properties temporal shifts in relative backwater rise were observed to follow changes in leaky barrier physical properties and composition where accretion of wood material on the barrier increased backwater rise and depletion of material from the barrier decreased backwater rise the maximum recorded backwater rise at three barriers ranged from 0 4 m to 0 8 m during 2 and 4 yr return period events barrier accretion increased the maximum backwater rise by factors of 1 3 to 1 9 compared to the 26 october 2019 event and barrier performance and resulting backwater rise changed cyclically following subsequent storm events additionally bedload transport reduced changes in relative upstream and downstream depths and the incidence of barrier overtopping using high resolution dem 2 m lidar and recorded water levels upstream storage and net storage volumes were calculated showing that the bankfull storage volume upstream of the wilderhope lower barrier amounted to 80 m3 while net storage increase was 52 m3 during 2 yr return period events and up to 102 m3 during the 4 yr return period event which translates to 5 900 and 10 700 m3 net volume increase for the 105 leaky barriers on the wilde brook test reach for a 4 yr return period storm event backwater rise cross sectional average velocity and net storage hydrographs showed rapid filling of the barriers in the rising limb and in the falling limb the upstream velocity remained lower than the before condition as the upstream storage provided by the leaky barrier was slowly released downstream over several days this study s findings indicate that to maximise the magnitude of backwater rise leaky barriers should have a large vertical extent and be located in deeper confined cross sections along a stream reach where a lower gap is present reducing it so that members extend over at least half of the channel depth enhances backwater rise water storage and reduces longitudinal velocity over the backwater region designs composed of two or more members are effective at trapping material resulting in natural barrier accretion thus increasing backwater rise and water storage performance at no additional material and construction cost the potential for development of local scour leading to gaps between the barrier and bed or barrier and channel sides should be considered in light of site sediment management goals and barrier location although a larger lower gap reduces the likelihood of initiation of bedload sediment transport this design also reduces the barrier vertical extent and magnitude of backwater rise this study provides quantitative field based evidence on backwater rise velocity reduction and storage which can inform current and future leaky barrier implementations in addition it provides new information for developing generalised approaches for representing leaky barriers in flood models monitoring of the site is ongoing to further evaluate the leaky barrier performance temporal evolution backwater

1834,a comprehensive evaluation of the frequency distribution analysis of reservoir storage capacity plays an important role in reducing the uncertainty in the design and operation of reservoir systems in most studies a simplified reservoir system such as over year system and using annual data without incorporating evaporation losses and performance measures i e reliability vulnerability and constant monthly demand was investigated on the other hand the required reservoir capacity variable is not independent of other characteristics of the reservoir system such as performance measures critical period and evaporation losses and has a high correlation with these variables therefore in this study the joint probabilities of different characteristics of the reservoir system were comprehensively developed using copulas hence an extensive monte carlo reservoir simulation procedure incorporating monthly streamflow data performance measures evaporation losses and demand was applied to extract the population of dependent variables of an actual reservoir the results showed that a the required storage capacity in the reservoir system is highly dependent on other reservoir characteristics such as performance measures critical period and evaporation losses b the joint probability of the reservoir system characteristics are well modeled by a gaussian copula and c the joint probability of the reservoir characteristics has a systematic behavior for given reliability and vulnerability values keywords copula joint probability reservoir system stochastic spa storage capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflows are one of the main sources of water supply for agriculture industry domestic and hydropower generation therefore to ensure the required water supply of these purposes reservoir systems are designed and constructed to control and regulate streamflows in accordance with the required demand mays and tung 1992 while reservoir systems are among the most important high cost water supply constructions in the world so the optimal design and operation of reservoir systems become one of the high priorities of water supply projects an important feature of a reservoir system is a reliable demand supply design for probable future hydrological conditions the behavior of reservoir systems is often measured by performance measures which are established measured and evaluated based on operating conditions during failure periods therefore it is necessary to choose system performance measures to provide a clear view in selecting reservoir storage capacities system status purposes and operating policies mcmahon and adeloye 2005 specialists of water resources systems use these measures extensively to compare different alternative designs and to select the appropriate design project of the reservoir system hashimoto et al 1982 in order to investigate the performance of the reservoir system it is necessary to analyze the system under different operating policies for this purpose a simulation procedure based on the critical period method is often applied to analyze the reservoir systems a critical period is defined as a period during which a reservoir goes from a full condition to an empty condition without spilling in the intervening period mcmahon and adeloye 2005 fig 1 because the sequent peak algorithm spa provides a unique result is fast and controlled by two performance measures it has been often employed in reservoir system planning investigations thomas and burden 1963 loucks et al 1981 moy et al 1986 vogel and stedinger 1987 vogel and bolognese 1995 adeloye and montaseri 1999 montaseri and adeloye 1999 adeloye et al 2001 aksoy 2001 adeloye et al 2010 2015 asefa et al 2014 guimarães and santos 2011 kuria and vogel 2015 mcmahon et al 2006 2007 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 montaseri and adeloye 2002 2004 soundharajan et al 2016 characteristics of reservoir systems are classified as random variables this is because the historical streamflow data record is a sample from a streamflow population which could be assumed to have come from an infinity of alternative streamflow time series for operation future periods montaseri and amirataee 2017 montaseri et al 2017 one of the main random variables in reservoir systems is the required storage capacity or active storage for this purpose various studies have evaluated the probability distribution function of this random variable burges and linsley 1971 for the first time suggested that the cumulative distribution function of over year reservoir storage capacity was well described by the gumble probability distribution function their analysis was based on the simulation of a hypothetical reservoir system using the basic sequent peak algorithm basic spa method and 1000 series of annual flow data generated from the normal distribution they employed a lag one autoregressive stochastic model ar 1 to generate streamflow data in 1987 vogel and stedinger applied the ar 1 ln stochastic model to generate 1000 series of synthetic annual streamflow data and using the basic spa they estimated the required storage capacity for different demands 10 to 50 of the mean annual flow maf for each series of generated data in the next step the required storage capacity values were fitted with the normal 2 parameter log normal 3 parameter log normal and extreme values probability distributions the results based on the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc goodness of fit test showed the 3 parameter log normal distribution function was the most appropriate theoretical distribution function of the over year required storage capacity variable bayazit and bulu 1991 used four models of stochastic data generation models ar 1 n ar 1 ln arma 1 1 n arma 1 1 ln to generate annual streamflow data in large samples 1000 samples with a different record length and basic spa method to evaluate the probability distribution of reservoir capacity they showed that over year required storage capacity follows the 3 parameter log normal distribution phien 1993 using the ar 1 annual data generation model and the gamma probability distribution for streamflows showed that the 3 parameter log normal distribution function had the best distribution probability description of the required storage capacity variable also adeloye et al 2015 used a 3 parameter log normal distribution function to describe the required storage capacity variable these studies have been the most important valid research based on the monte carlo simulation method to determine the theoretical distribution of the required storage capacity in the surface water reservoir system however these studies have suffered from several limitations such as a using the annual synthetic streamflow data over year reservoir system b assuming constant monthly demand c ignoring the evaporation losses d not incorporating the reservoir performance measures e assuming that the required storage capacity is independent of reservoir performance measures evaporation losses and critical period in fact the required storage capacity in the reservoir system is the function of i either seasonal or annual inflows into the reservoir ii reservoir performance measures including reliability resilience and vulnerability iii evaporation losses in the critical period and iv critical period of the reservoir system therefore the various characteristics of the reservoir system such as required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses are dependent variables that should be considered in the probability distribution investigations of reservoir characteristics bayazit and onoz 2000 hence given the joint probability distribution of the different characteristics of the reservoir system it seems that the design and operation of the reservoir system should be done with a more comprehensive understanding of the actual behavior of such dependent characteristics in this regard the technique of copulas with high capability in analyzing the joint probability of dependent variables can be used innovatively in determining the bivariate multivariate distribution of the reservoir system characteristics in recent years copulas have been recognized as an efficient method in the bivariate multivariate analysis of various hydrological phenomena including rainfall frequency analysis flood frequency analysis drought analysis and so on de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 shiau 2006 shiau et al 2006 zhang and singh 2006 salvadori et al 2007 zhang and singh 2007 bárdossy and li 2008 serinaldi et al 2009 kao and govindaraju 2010 volpi and fiori 2014 hao et al 2017 amirataee et al 2018 ayantobo et al 2018 montaseri et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 copulas are able to represent a bivariate multivariate distribution based on the univariate probability distribution of dependent phenomena regardless of their form or type of marginal distribution zhang and singh 2006 accordingly joint probability analysis of the different characteristics of the reservoir system i e required storage capacity critical period evaporation losses and performance measures was necessary and has a high research priority which was innovatively done in this research for this purpose a stochastic disaggregation model with the ability to preserve or reproduce the historical streamflow statistics at both monthly and annual levels has been used to generate 1000 sequences of annual ar 1 model and monthly valencia schaake model streamflow data then the generated streamflow time series was used to simulate the reservoir system by incorporating various monthly demand evaporation loss and performance measures finally the joint probability of different characteristics of the reservoir system including the joint probability of required storage capacity critical period required storage capacity evaporation losses and critical period evaporation losses for the within year and over year reservoir system using the copula were determined 2 material and methods 2 1 stochastic modeling of streamflow time series determining the general behavior of reservoir systems requires access to the population data of reservoir characteristics for this purpose stochastic models are used to generate alternative series of streamflow in a large number of sequences in order to extract the population of different characteristics of the reservoir system such as required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses montaseri and adeloye 2004 guimarães and santos 2011 since the characteristics of most reservoir systems are affected by both within year and over year behavior for a comprehensive analysis of such systems it is necessary to use a stochastic model with the ability to preserve and reproduce the statistical parameters of historical streamflow data at both monthly and annual scales adeloye et al 2001 also since the introduction by valencia and schaake 1973 disaggregation models have been recognized as a reasonable way to divide original series e g annual flows into subseries e g seasonal or monthly flows therefore for this purpose first the annual streamflow data were generated using the lag one autoregressive ar 1 process eq 1 and then disaggregated to monthly streamflows using the valencia schaake approach eq 2 valencia and schaake 1973 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 1 q i q ρ q i 1 q ν i s 1 ρ 2 2 x i a z i b v i where qi 1 and qi are the annual streamflows for the years i and i 1 respectively q is the mean of annual streamflows s is the standard deviation of annual streamflows ρ is lag one serial correlation coefficient of annual streamflows υi is the standardized normal random variable xi is the 12 1 vector of transformed zero mean monthly streamflows for the year i zi is the transformed zero mean annual streamflow for the year i vi is the 12 1 vector of independent standard normal random variables for the year i and independent of zi and a and b are 12 1 and 12 12 coefficient vector and matrix respectively the advantage of disaggregation models i e valencia schaake over direct monthly data generation models such as arma p q and thomas fiering is that the disaggregation models can preserve the statistics parameters of annual and monthly streamflow data which are of great importance for reservoir analysis at both monthly and annual time scales conversely the arma p q and thomas fiering models can only preserve the streamflow statistics in monthly level mcmahon and adeloye 2005 2 2 reservoir system simulation in this study the modified spa method lele 1987 montaseri 1999 was used to simulate the reservoir system the spa model modified by montaseri 1999 was developed in two types of spa ii and spa iii for the analysis of single and multiple reservoir systems respectively these models provide the ability to apply and control two performance measures time based reliability and vulnerability in simulating the reservoir systems also in these models evaporation losses in the reservoir are based on the nonlinear or real surface volume relationship of the reservoir montaseri 1999 montaseri and adeloye 1999 montaseri and adeloye 2004 adeloye et al 2001 montaseri and adeloye 2002 the storage capacity of the reservoir in the basic spa method assuming 100 reliability and initially full reservoir capacity i e k0 0 0 is determined from the following equations 3 k t k t 1 r t e t i t i f 0 0 0 0 o t h e r w i s e t 1 t 4 k a max k t t 1 t where kt 1 and kt are the volumetric sequential deficit at the end of period t 1 and t respectively it is the volumetric inflow rt is the volumetric demand and et is the volumetric reservoir surface evaporation loss during period t ka is the required storage capacity sc and t is the total number of periods in this study the spa ii model was applied to simulate the single site reservoir system for specified time based reliability and vulnerability and then different characteristics of the reservoir system i e required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses were extracted it is noted that the details of the spa ii model are available in montaseri 1999 montaseri and adeloye 2004 however the details of incorporating performance measures in spa ii model at the end of this section are represented the likely performance of reservoir systems is often measured and evaluated by performance criteria which are based on the particular aspects of an unsatisfactory operation during drought periods an unsatisfactory operation is often described as a failure which is defined as the inability of a reservoir system to provide the target demand during a given period vogel and bolognese 1995 the time based reliability resilience and vulnerability are the three main performance measures in reservoir system analysis time based reliability δ represents the probability of normal operation no failure operation i e r t r t of a reservoir system over the planning period resilience λ is defined as the probability that a reservoir system will recover following a failure period r t r t vulnerability η is defined as the average proportion of average shortfalls occurring in each of the failure periods time based reliability resilience and vulnerability performance measures are defined as follows in eq 5 to eq 7 respectively 5 δ 1 f t 6 λ f s f 7 η t f r t t f r t t f r t where δ λ and η are the time based reliability resilience and vulnerability measures respectively f total number of failure periods t total number of time periods in the record fs number of continuous sequences of failure periods rt release of reservoir system during the t th failure periods rt target demand during the t th period in equations 5 to 7 the time based reliability resilience and vulnerability fall in the range of 0 δ λ and η 1 and the optimal values of time based reliability resilience and vulnerability are 1 1 and 0 respectively usually performance measure of 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability are more important in planning of actual reservoir system the schematic definition of different parameters of the reservoir performance measures on the mass curve diagram rippl 1883 is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the two performance measures of reliability and vulnerability that can be applied for specific values in the spa ii model are considered in this study the procedure for simulating the single site reservoir system for specified time based reliability and vulnerability can be summarized in the following steps mcmahon and adeloye 2005 step 1 set rt rt for t 1 t step 2 execute the modified spa to determine ka exact value of required storage capacity for the current set of releases rt step 3 if this is the f 1 th iteration then stop else go on to step 4 step 4 a from the end of the current critical period eccp determine the current critical period say ccp b if ccp is the same as for any of the previous iterations then put ccp ccp 1 and check again c reset rt crt c is the minimum fraction of target demand supplied in a failure or dry period for t corresponding to the period in the ccp th period d go back to step 2 2 3 copula functions copulas are functions that join multivariate distribution functions to their corresponding marginal distribution functions a copula is a joint distribution function of standard uniform random variables sklar 1959 joe 1997 nelsen 2006 according to sklar s theorem nelsen 2006 if fxy is a two dimensional joint distribution function of random variables of x and y with marginal distribution functions of fx and fy then there exists a copula such that 8 p x x y y f xy x y c f x x f y y conversely for any distribution functions of fx and fy and any copula c the function of fxy defined above is a two dimensional function with marginal fx and fy furthermore if fx and fy are continuous the copula is unique different families of copulas have been proposed and described by nelsen 2006 and salvadori et al 2007 in this study seven common copulas of clayton frank gumbel joe galambos plackett and normal used based on the copulas and considering the required storage capacity sc the critical period cp and evaporation losses in the critical period ev as random variables of the reservoir system the joint simple and conditional probabilities of one of the pairs of variables as an example for sc and ev can be defined as follows shiau et al 2006 the probability that the combination of both the required storage capacity sc and evaporation ev is less than or equal to specific thresholds of sc and ev respectively fig 2 9 p sc s c e v e v f sc e v s c e v c f sc s c f ev ev the probability that both storage capacity sc and evaporation ev exceeding their respective thresholds fig 2 10 p sc s c e v e v 1 f sc sc f ev ev c f sc sc f ev ev the conditional probabilities of ev and sc if the sc and ev exceeding a certain threshold sc and ev are 11 p ev e v s c s c p e v e v s c s c p s c s c f ev ev f sc e v s c e c 1 f

assumptions in modelling the copulas is that variables sc cp and ev are independent and identically distributed i i d the results of the initial tests homogeneity and randomness showed that the various characteristics of the reservoir system were independent and identically distributed i i d 2 4 study area and data this study was applied to the shaharchay reservoir in the northwest of iran fig 3 shows the geographical location of the shaharchay basin and its reservoir the shaharchay basin is located between 37 19 and 37 30 northern latitudes and 44 34 and 44 57 eastern longitudes and has a basin area of 324 km2 the shaharchay river takes its rise among the mountains in the western borders of iran 3574 m above sea level and flows towards the east west to east and eventually flowing into the lake urmia shaharchay river is one of the main sources of fresh water in the region and the shaharchay reservoir was constructed to regulate and control the streamflow of shaharchay river to supply the drinking water of urmia city and agricultural water in the urmia plain the data required in this study included streamflow input into the shaharchay reservoir precipitation evaporation demand and the surface volume relationship of the reservoir which was obtained from the iran water resources management company at the reservoir site 50 years 1968 2017 of monthly historical inflow precipitation and evaporation data records were available the amount of mean annual flow maf mean annual precipitation map and mean annual evaporation mae historical data recorded at the reservoir site are 205 mcm 368 mm and 1205 mm respectively mean monthly precipitation and evaporation at the reservoir site box plot of monthly inflows into the reservoir monthly demand based on different percentages of the mean annual flow and the surface volume relationship of the reservoir site are shown in fig 4 it should be noted that the actual annual demand of the shaharchay reservoir system has been about 60 of the mean annual flow since it was commissioned in the 2005 year however for a comprehensive analysis with full coverage of the within year and over year behavior of the reservoir system the annual demand was modeled at 7 classes of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 of the mean annual flow maf in this study to use the data in the streamflow time series modeling initial tests of homogeneity randomness and stationarity were performed adeloye and montaseri 2001 for this purpose double mass curve mann kendall and run test methods have been used for estimating the homogeneity randomness and stationarity of the record of annual streamflow data respectively kottegoda and horder 1980 salas 1993 the results of the double mass curve test for annual streamflow data show that the data was homogeneity with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 in addition the results of two mann kendall and run tests confirm the correctness of the hypothesis h0 of stationarity and randomness of annual streamflow data in the studied site at a 95 confidence level however the data of shaharchay river at the reservoir site were used by completely removing the trend another key step in the streamflow time series modeling is to determine the probability distribution function of data therefore five common probability distribution functions of normal two and three parameter log normal pearson type iii and log pearson type iii were evaluated using the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc goodness of fit test vogel 1986 the results of ppcc goodness of fit test confirmed that the pearson type iii probability distribution was the best probability distribution of both annual and monthly streamflow data for the studied site 2 5 methodology the methodology of this study was done in three main steps in the first step the 1000 series of annual and monthly streamflow data were generated using the ar 1 and valencia schaake models in equations 1 and 2 respectively in the second step the shaharchay reservoir system was simulated by the spa ii model based on each generated data series for different values of demand 20 30 80 of maf reliability 100 99 90 and vulnerability 5 10 20 and 30 then the different characteristics of the reservoir system required storage capacity critical period evaporation for 7 demand 8 reliability 4 vulnerability 1000 series were extracted it should be noted that for the first and second step of the research the stochastic reservoir system simulation srss package developed by montaseri in 1999 was used in the third step simple conditional probabilities of different characteristics of the reservoir system required storage capacity critical period evaporation loss in the reservoir site were estimated using copulas the summary details of the three steps are provided in fig 5 3 results the results of this study were prepared and arranged in 6 sections to present the detailed results clearly first the performance of the applied stochastic models in reproducing the historical streamflow statistics at both monthly and annual levels is evaluated this is very important in analyzing the behavior of the reservoir system which is a combination of within year and over year behavior the second section presents the generalized or long term behavior of different characteristics of reservoir system based on their population of data average 1000 values generated series in the third section the dependence of the different generated characteristics i e determined based on the generated streamflow time series in the reservoir for the within year transitional a transition system represents alternately both within year and over year behavior during operation years i e cpi 12 and cpi 1 12 months in years i and i 1 respectively and over year systems are evaluated in the next section the analysis of the univariate marginal distribution of the different generated characteristics of the reservoir and the systematic changes of their parameters based on the different performance measures and demands are presented explaining the joint probability structure of the different generated reservoir characteristics using copulas is reported in the fifth section in the last section the results of the joint probabilities simple conditional of reservoir characteristics according to different conditions governing the system are introduced and discussed 3 1 stochastic model performance in this study a combination of two annual ar 1 and monthly valencia schaake data generation models were applied to a comprehensive analysis of the probable behavior of the reservoir system i e within year transitional and over year these data generation models preserve or reproduce the streamflow statistics at both annual and monthly levels which is important to accurately determine the within year and over year behavior of reservoir systems however the models used in previous studies such as the thomas fiering mcmahon et al 2006 and fragment models soundharajan et al 2016 have two main limitations namely the lack of preserving the streamflow statistics at the annual level and the use of a deterministic approach to disaggregate annual flow to monthly flows respectively which could cause significant uncertainties in the calculations the combination of ar 1 and valencia schaake models can preserve the different streamflow statistics such as mean standard deviation skewness and correlation between annual and monthly data the applied stochastic model represented the desired performance in preserving the historical streamflow statistics at both annual and monthly levels which ensures the necessary accuracy of the results of this study a comparison of mean standard deviation skewness and correlation of annual and monthly data of generated and historical streamflow data is presented in fig 6 it should be noted that preserving the skewness coefficient of historical data depends solely on the use of the pearson type iii distribution for historical data also one of the criteria for evaluating the long term dependence of the generated time series is the hurst coefficient whose value in this research is estimated to be 0 668 and 0 587 for the annual generated and historical data respectively which indicates the acceptable preservation of the long term dependence in generated time series 3 2 general or long term behavior of surface water reservoir characteristics long term behavior analysis of different characteristics of the reservoir system plays an important role in the planning operation and management of reservoir systems therefore in this study the long term behavior of different characteristics of the reservoir system and their correlations with each other was evaluated the box plot and average values of generated required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses of the shaharchay reservoir for various demands 20 to 80 maf and performance measures were presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively fig 7 shows that the range of all three variables required storage capacity sc critical period cp and evaporation losses ev for the within year systems is very small and with increasing the demand or change the system to transitional and over year system this range will increase sharply also on the other hand with increasing the vulnerability vul the range of all three variables decreases fig 8 shows that the relationship between the mean values of three variables sc cp and ev and demand follows a power relationship and the rate of nonlinearity of the relationship decreases significantly with decreasing reliability reli and increasing vulnerability vul so that for within year systems cp 12 months the increase in required storage capacity with increasing demand has a slight slope and this increase continues at an exponential rate in transitional and over year systems cp 12 months finally considering the similarity in behavior of the sc cp and ev per demand figs 7 and 8 the joint dependence of these reservoir characteristics will not be far from reality 3 3 joint dependence of reservoir characteristics considering the similar behavior of the three variables of sc cp and ev per demand a significant joint dependence of these variables is expected therefore to evaluate the probable joint dependence of reservoir characteristics in three behavior classes of within year cp 12 months transitional and over year cp 12 months the scatter plot of pair generated variables sc cp and ev for three demands of 1 20 40 60 and 80 maf 2 98 reliability and 3 5 vulnerability were provided in fig 9 according to fig 9 the reservoir characteristics for all three states of within year transitional and over year classes have a direct relationship with each other and these relationships in the within year and especially in over year classes follow the continuous scatter plot whereas such behavior was completely discrete for transitional systems and it is distinctive and separable for both within year and over year systems in other words in demand maf 40 and 60 a critical period obtained for a part of 1000 series is estimated to be less than 12 and for another part greater than 12 months therefore the behavior of the system for some of the generated series is within year and for other series is over year in this case the system is classified as a transitional system and is not completely classified as a within year or over year system while this issue about the demand maf 20 and 80 shows the completely within year and over year behavior of the system in all the generated series therefore the analysis of the joint bivariate probability of the reservoir characteristics in the transitional behavior of reservoir system has high uncertainty and developing the joint probabilities in such systems will not be logical also according to a comparison of the results of the within year and over year system the over year system occurred in the state of demand with 80 maf had a higher priority due to having very suitable conditions and minimum uncertainty for analyzing the joint probability of the reservoir characteristics and was selected to continue the study kendall s tau coefficient of rank correlation between generated values of required storage capacity critical period and evaporation for the demand of 80 maf and different values of reliability 100 99 98 97 96 95 93 and 90 and vulnerability 5 10 20 and 30 were presented in table 1 the results confirm the reasonably significant correlation between the sc cp and ev 3 4 univariate marginal distribution of reservoir characteristics one of the basic steps in developing joint distribution functions using the copulas is to determine the marginal distribution of each variable for this purpose seven probability distribution of exponential gamma gumble normal log normal logistics and weibull were fitted to the generated values of storage capacity critical period and evaporation for particular combinations of reservoir performance measures e g reliability 0 98 and vulnerability 0 05 the parameters of the seven probability distributions were estimated using the maximum likelihood method and also two common aic and bic goodness of fit tests were used to evaluate and determine the best marginal distribution function of the variables the results of the goodness of fit test of the sc cp and ev values for different reliabilities and vulnerabilities are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 the gumbel distribution with a slightly difference compared to the log normal distribution was selected as the best marginal distribution function of the required storage capacity it should be noted that in most previous studies the log normal distribution was assumed or selected as the best distribution of storage capacity vogel and stedinger 1987 bayazit and bulu 1991 phien 1993 adeloye et al 2015 on the other hand the log normal distribution was determined as the most appropriate marginal distribution function for the critical period and evaporation variables the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function of gumbel and log normal distributions as the best probability distribution of sc cp and ev respectively are shown in fig 11 the results also show the systematic behavior of the best marginal distribution parameters with the performance measures and these parameters have a significant relationship with reliability and vulnerability fig 12 in that for particular vulnerabilities the parameters of marginal distribution functions have an exponential relationship with the reliability as the vulnerability decreases the values of the parameters increase and the relationship tends to a linear relationship 3 5 joint probability of reservoir characteristics using copulas to analyze the joint probability of the reservoir characteristics i e required storage capacity critical period sc cp required storage capacity evaporation sc ev and critical period evaporation cp ev seven copulas of clayton gumbel frank joe galambos plackett and normal were used for different values of reservoir performance measures the parameters of the copulas were estimated using the common ifm method joe 1997 finally the best copula of each pair of variables was determined based on log likelihood aic and bic evaluation criteria zhang and singh 2006 these evaluation criteria quantify the deviation of estimation and observational values at a given confidence level the best copulas are determined by the lowest aic bic and the highest log likelihood shiau 2006 the results of modeling the joint distributions of sc cp and ev with seven copulas for different reliabilities and vulnerabilities are presented in fig 13 according to fig 13 the gaussian normal copula was selected as the best copula for all three pairs of variables in addition to graphically compare the performance of the copula 10 000 random pair of required storage capacity critical period and evaporation were generated using the monte carlo simulation technique for each copula and then the generated data were transformed back into their original domains using marginal distribution functions fig 14 shows the scatter plot of generated random pair data gray dots and observed data red dots based on the best copula gaussian copula for the demand of 80 maf 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability this scatters plot shows the desirable performance of the best copula gaussian copula in fitting the observed data especially in the minimum and maximum tail values it should be noted that quite similar results were obtained for other combinations of reservoir performance measures the results also show the linear relationship between the parameters of the gaussian copula and the reliability at a particular vulnerability fig 15 the slope of the linear relationship of the parameters of the gaussian copula with reliability for the reservoir system with low vulnerabilities 5 and 10 was approximately zero this indicates a very low dependence of the parameters of the gaussian copula with reliability and this dependence increases slightly with increased vulnerability 3 6 joint probability of reservoir characteristics 3 6 1 joint probability using the gaussian copula the joint cumulative probability of the required storage capacity critical period i e p sc sc cp cp c fsc sc fcp cp required storage capacity evaporation and critical period evaporation were calculated fig 16 shows a contour plot of the joint cumulative probability distribution of the reservoir at 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability according to fig 16 the joint cumulative probability distribution of the storage capacity critical period i e p sc sc cp cp increases with increasing both variables this behavior is also observed for storage capacity evaporation and critical period evaporation for example the joint probability of sc 150 ev 40 sc 200 cp 50 and cp 20 ev 10 for demand 80 maf 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability is equal to 0 159 0 42 and 0 99 respectively the results also showed that the joint cumulative probability distribution of reservoir characteristics is a function of reliability and vulnerability and have a systematic behavior for example the joint probability of sc 200 cp 50 sc 150 ev 40 and cp 20 ev 10 based on different values of reliability and vulnerability is presented in fig 17 the results show that a the joint cumulative probabilities per reliability for larger vulnerability are higher values this is due to the reduction of required storage capacity critical period and evaporation with increasing vulnerability in the reservoir system b the joint cumulative probability indicates a decreasing trend with increasing the reliability for a particular vulnerability this is due to the increase in the required storage capacity critical period and evaporation for the higher values of reliability 3 6 2 conditional joint probability the conditional bivariate joint probability of the reservoir characteristics i e p x x y y and p y y x x for different combinations of reliabilities and vulnerabilities was determined for simple evaluation of the bivariate joint probabilities of the reservoir characteristics exceedance non occurrence and conditional probabilities of the reservoir characteristics for different values of f x p x x 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability are presented in table 2 for example based on the cumulative probability of f x 0 9 the cumulative joint probability of sc 293 5 cp 96 8 p jnx the joint exceedance probability of sc 293 5 cp 96 8 p jx and the conditional joint probability of p sc s c c p c p p c or p cp c p s c s c were estimated equal to 0 85 0 05 and 0 50 respectively 4 conclusion in this study a combination of two annual ar 1 and monthly valencia schaake data generation models were used to generate 1000 series of synthetic annual and monthly streamflow data respectively the spa ii model was then applied to simulate the shaharchay reservoir system for each generated streamflow time series and different values of demand reliability and vulnerability then the joint probabilities of different characteristics of the within year and over year reservoir system i e required storage capacity critical period and evaporation were estimated using copulas the results show that the required storage capacity in the reservoir system is highly dependent on other reservoir characteristics such as performance measures critical period and evaporation this indicates the necessity of considering the other reservoir dependent variables in determining the reservoir storage capacity which can have a significant effect on the planning and operation of storage reservoir systems accordingly the following results were achieved the reservoir characteristics for three classes of within year transitional and over year storage have a direct relationship with each other and these relationships in the within year and especially in over year classes follow the continuous behavior gumbel and log normal probability distributions have best describe the required storage capacity critical period and evaporation variable respectively the results also show the systematic behavior of best marginal distribution parameters with the reservoir performance measures the results of joint probability modeling show that the gaussian copula has the best performance in describing the observed reservoir pair characteristics especially in the lower and upper tail values also the results show the linear relationship between the parameter of gaussian copulas and reservoir performance measures reliability and vulnerability finally the results showed that the simple and conditional joint probabilities of reservoir characteristics are a function of the reliability and vulnerability and have a systematic behavior credit authorship contribution statement babak amirataee

1834,a comprehensive evaluation of the frequency distribution analysis of reservoir storage capacity plays an important role in reducing the uncertainty in the design and operation of reservoir systems in most studies a simplified reservoir system such as over year system and using annual data without incorporating evaporation losses and performance measures i e reliability vulnerability and constant monthly demand was investigated on the other hand the required reservoir capacity variable is not independent of other characteristics of the reservoir system such as performance measures critical period and evaporation losses and has a high correlation with these variables therefore in this study the joint probabilities of different characteristics of the reservoir system were comprehensively developed using copulas hence an extensive monte carlo reservoir simulation procedure incorporating monthly streamflow data performance measures evaporation losses and demand was applied to extract the population of dependent variables of an actual reservoir the results showed that a the required storage capacity in the reservoir system is highly dependent on other reservoir characteristics such as performance measures critical period and evaporation losses b the joint probability of the reservoir system characteristics are well modeled by a gaussian copula and c the joint probability of the reservoir characteristics has a systematic behavior for given reliability and vulnerability values keywords copula joint probability reservoir system stochastic spa storage capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflows are one of the main sources of water supply for agriculture industry domestic and hydropower generation therefore to ensure the required water supply of these purposes reservoir systems are designed and constructed to control and regulate streamflows in accordance with the required demand mays and tung 1992 while reservoir systems are among the most important high cost water supply constructions in the world so the optimal design and operation of reservoir systems become one of the high priorities of water supply projects an important feature of a reservoir system is a reliable demand supply design for probable future hydrological conditions the behavior of reservoir systems is often measured by performance measures which are established measured and evaluated based on operating conditions during failure periods therefore it is necessary to choose system performance measures to provide a clear view in selecting reservoir storage capacities system status purposes and operating policies mcmahon and adeloye 2005 specialists of water resources systems use these measures extensively to compare different alternative designs and to select the appropriate design project of the reservoir system hashimoto et al 1982 in order to investigate the performance of the reservoir system it is necessary to analyze the system under different operating policies for this purpose a simulation procedure based on the critical period method is often applied to analyze the reservoir systems a critical period is defined as a period during which a reservoir goes from a full condition to an empty condition without spilling in the intervening period mcmahon and adeloye 2005 fig 1 because the sequent peak algorithm spa provides a unique result is fast and controlled by two performance measures it has been often employed in reservoir system planning investigations thomas and burden 1963 loucks et al 1981 moy et al 1986 vogel and stedinger 1987 vogel and bolognese 1995 adeloye and montaseri 1999 montaseri and adeloye 1999 adeloye et al 2001 aksoy 2001 adeloye et al 2010 2015 asefa et

classified as random variables this is because the historical streamflow data record is a sample from a streamflow population which could be assumed to have come from an infinity of alternative streamflow time series for operation future periods montaseri and amirataee 2017 montaseri et al 2017 one of the main random variables in reservoir systems is the required storage capacity or active storage for this purpose various studies have evaluated the probability distribution function of this random variable burges and linsley 1971 for the first time suggested that the cumulative distribution function of over year reservoir storage capacity was well described by the gumble probability distribution function their analysis was based on the simulation of a hypothetical reservoir system using the basic sequent peak algorithm basic spa method and 1000 series of annual flow data generated from the normal distribution they employed a lag one autoregressive stochastic model ar 1 to generate streamflow data in 1987 vogel and stedinger applied the ar 1 ln stochastic model to generate 1000 series of synthetic annual streamflow data and using the basic spa they estimated the required storage capacity for different demands 10 to 50 of the mean annual flow maf for each series of generated data in the next step the required storage capacity values were fitted with the normal 2 parameter log normal 3 parameter log normal and extreme values probability distributions the results based on the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc goodness of fit test showed the 3 parameter log normal distribution function was the most appropriate theoretical distribution function of the over year required storage capacity variable bayazit and bulu 1991 used four models of stochastic data generation models ar 1 n ar 1 ln arma 1 1 n arma 1 1 ln to generate annual streamflow data in large samples 1000 samples with a different record length and basic spa method to evaluate the probability distribution of reservoir capacity they showed that over year required storage capacity follows the 3 parameter log normal distribution phien 1993 using the ar 1 annual data generation model and the gamma probability distribution for streamflows showed that the 3 parameter log normal distribution function had the best distribution probability description of the required storage capacity variable also adeloye et al 2015 used a 3 parameter log normal distribution function to describe the required storage capacity variable these studies have been the most important valid research based on the monte carlo simulation method to determine the theoretical distribution of the required storage capacity in the surface water reservoir system however these studies have suffered from several limitations such as a using the annual synthetic streamflow data over year reservoir system b assuming constant monthly demand c ignoring the evaporation losses d not incorporating the reservoir performance measures e assuming that the required storage capacity is independent of reservoir performance measures evaporation losses and critical period in fact the required storage capacity in the reservoir system is the function of i either seasonal or annual inflows into the reservoir ii reservoir performance measures including reliability resilience and vulnerability iii evaporation losses in the critical period and iv critical period of the reservoir system therefore the various characteristics of the reservoir system such as required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses are dependent variables that should be considered in the probability distribution investigations of reservoir characteristics bayazit and onoz 2000 hence given the joint probability distribution of the different characteristics of the reservoir system it seems that the design and operation of the reservoir system should be done with a more comprehensive understanding of the actual behavior of such dependent characteristics in this regard the technique of copulas with high capability in analyzing the joint probability of dependent variables can be used innovatively in determining the bivariate multivariate distribution of the reservoir system characteristics in recent years copulas have been recognized as an efficient method in the bivariate multivariate analysis of various hydrological phenomena including rainfall frequency analysis flood frequency analysis drought analysis and so on de michele and salvadori 2003 favre et al 2004 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 shiau 2006 shiau et al 2006 zhang and singh 2006 salvadori et al 2007 zhang and singh 2007 bárdossy and li 2008 serinaldi et al 2009 kao and govindaraju 2010 volpi and fiori 2014 hao et al 2017 amirataee et al 2018 ayantobo et al 2018 montaseri et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 copulas are able to represent a bivariate multivariate distribution based on the univariate probability distribution of dependent phenomena regardless of their form or type of marginal distribution zhang and singh 2006 accordingly joint probability analysis of the different characteristics of the reservoir system i e required storage capacity critical period evaporation losses and performance measures was necessary and has a high research priority which was innovatively done in this research for this purpose a stochastic disaggregation model with the ability to preserve or reproduce the historical streamflow statistics at both monthly and annual levels has been used to generate 1000 sequences of annual ar 1 model and monthly valencia schaake model streamflow data then the generated streamflow time series was used to simulate the reservoir system by incorporating various monthly demand evaporation loss and performance measures finally the joint probability of different characteristics of the reservoir system including the joint probability of required storage capacity critical period required storage capacity evaporation losses and critical period evaporation losses for the within year and over year reservoir system using the copula were determined 2 material and methods 2 1 stochastic modeling of streamflow time series determining the general behavior of reservoir systems requires access to the population data of reservoir characteristics for this purpose stochastic models are used to generate alternative series of streamflow in a large number of sequences in order to extract the population of different characteristics of the reservoir system such as required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses montaseri and adeloye 2004 guimarães and santos 2011 since the characteristics of most reservoir systems are affected by both within year and over year behavior for a comprehensive analysis of such systems it is necessary to use a stochastic model with the ability to preserve and reproduce the statistical parameters of historical streamflow data at both monthly and annual scales adeloye et al 2001 also since the introduction by valencia and schaake 1973 disaggregation models have been recognized as a reasonable way to divide original series e g annual flows into subseries e g seasonal or monthly flows therefore for this purpose first the annual streamflow data were generated using the lag one autoregressive ar 1 process eq 1 and then disaggregated to monthly streamflows using the valencia schaake approach eq 2 valencia and schaake 1973 mcmahon and adeloye 2005 1 q i q ρ q i 1 q ν i s 1 ρ 2 2 x i a z i b v i where qi 1 and qi are the annual streamflows for the years i and i 1 respectively q is the mean of annual streamflows s is the standard deviation of annual streamflows ρ is lag one serial correlation coefficient of annual streamflows υi is the standardized normal random variable xi is the 12 1 vector of transformed zero mean monthly streamflows for the year i zi is the transformed zero mean annual streamflow for the year i vi is the 12 1 vector of independent standard normal random variables for the year i and independent of zi and a and b are 12 1 and 12 12 coefficient vector and matrix respectively the advantage of disaggregation models i e valencia schaake over direct monthly data generation models such as arma p q and thomas fiering is that the disaggregation models can preserve the statistics parameters of annual and monthly streamflow data which are of great importance for reservoir analysis at both monthly and annual time scales conversely the arma p q and thomas fiering models can only preserve the streamflow statistics in monthly level mcmahon and adeloye 2005 2 2 reservoir system simulation in this study the modified spa method lele 1987 montaseri 1999 was used to simulate the reservoir system the spa model modified by montaseri 1999 was developed in two types of spa ii and spa iii for the analysis of single and multiple reservoir systems respectively these models provide the ability to apply and control two performance measures time based reliability and vulnerability in simulating the reservoir systems also in these models evaporation losses in the reservoir are based on the nonlinear or real surface volume relationship of the reservoir montaseri 1999 montaseri and adeloye 1999 montaseri and adeloye 2004 adeloye et al 2001 montaseri and adeloye 2002 the storage capacity of the reservoir in the basic spa method assuming 100 reliability and initially full reservoir capacity i e k0 0 0 is determined from the following equations 3 k t k t 1 r t e t i t i f 0 0 0 0 o t h e r w i s e t 1 t 4 k a max k t t 1 t where kt 1 and kt are the volumetric sequential deficit at the end of period t 1 and t respectively it is the volumetric inflow rt is the volumetric demand and et is the volumetric reservoir surface evaporation loss during period t ka is the required storage capacity sc and t is the total number of periods in this study the spa ii model was applied to simulate the single site reservoir system for specified time based reliability and vulnerability and then different characteristics of the reservoir system i e required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses were extracted it is noted that the details of the spa ii model are available in montaseri 1999 montaseri and adeloye 2004 however the details of incorporating performance measures in spa ii model at the end of this section are represented the likely performance of reservoir systems is often measured and evaluated by performance criteria which are based on the particular aspects of an unsatisfactory operation during drought periods an unsatisfactory operation is often described as a failure which is defined as the inability of a reservoir system to provide the target demand during a given period vogel and bolognese 1995 the time based reliability resilience and vulnerability are the three main performance measures in reservoir system analysis time based reliability δ represents the probability of normal operation no failure operation i e r t r t of a reservoir system over the planning period resilience λ is defined as the probability that a reservoir system will recover following a failure period r t r t vulnerability η is defined as the average proportion of average shortfalls occurring in each of the failure periods time based reliability resilience and vulnerability performance measures are defined as follows in eq 5 to eq 7 respectively 5 δ 1 f t 6 λ f s f 7 η t f r t t f r t t f r t where δ λ and η are the time based reliability resilience and vulnerability measures respectively f total number of failure periods t total number of time periods in the record fs number of continuous sequences of failure periods rt release of reservoir system during the t th failure periods rt target demand during the t th period in equations 5 to 7 the time based reliability resilience and vulnerability fall in the range of 0 δ λ and η 1 and the optimal values of time based reliability resilience and vulnerability are 1 1 and 0 respectively usually performance measure of 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability are more important in planning of actual reservoir system the schematic definition of different parameters of the reservoir performance measures on the mass curve diagram rippl 1883 is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the two performance measures of reliability and vulnerability that can be applied for specific values in the spa ii model are considered in this study the procedure for simulating the single site reservoir system for specified time based reliability and vulnerability can be summarized in the following steps mcmahon and adeloye 2005 step 1 set rt rt for t 1 t step 2 execute the modified spa to determine ka exact value of required storage capacity for the current set of releases rt step 3 if this is the f 1 th iteration then stop else go on to step 4 step 4 a from the end of the current critical period eccp determine the current critical period say ccp b if ccp is the same as for any of the previous iterations then put ccp ccp 1 and check again c reset rt crt c is the minimum fraction of target demand supplied in a failure or dry period for t corresponding to the period in the ccp th period d go back to step 2 2 3 copula functions copulas are functions that join multivariate distribution functions to their corresponding marginal distribution functions a copula is a joint distribution function of standard uniform random variables sklar 1959 joe 1997 nelsen 2006 according to sklar s theorem nelsen 2006 if fxy is a two dimensional joint distribution function of random variables of x and y with marginal distribution functions of fx and fy then there exists a copula such that 8 p x x y y f xy x y c f x x f y y conversely for any distribution functions of fx and fy and any copula c the function of fxy defined above is a two dimensional function with marginal fx and fy furthermore if fx and fy are continuous the copula is unique different families of copulas have been proposed and described by nelsen 2006 and salvadori et al 2007 in this study seven common copulas of clayton frank gumbel joe galambos plackett and normal used based on the copulas and considering the required storage capacity sc the critical period cp and evaporation losses in the critical period ev as random variables of the reservoir system the joint simple and conditional probabilities of one of the pairs of variables as an example for sc and ev can be defined as follows shiau et al 2006 the probability that the combination of both the required storage capacity sc and evaporation ev is less than or equal to specific thresholds of sc and ev respectively fig 2 9 p sc s c e v e v f sc e v s c e v c f sc s c f ev ev the probability that both storage capacity sc and evaporation ev exceeding their respective thresholds fig 2 10 p sc s c e v e v 1 f sc sc f ev ev c f sc sc f ev ev the conditional probabilities of ev and sc if the sc and ev exceeding a certain threshold sc and ev are 11 p ev e v s c s c p e v e v s c s c p s c s c f ev ev f sc e v s c e c 1 f

assumptions in modelling the copulas is that variables sc cp and ev are independent and identically distributed i i d the results of the initial tests homogeneity and randomness showed that the various characteristics of the reservoir system were independent and identically distributed i i d 2 4 study area and data this study was applied to the shaharchay reservoir in the northwest of iran fig 3 shows the geographical location of the shaharchay basin and its reservoir the shaharchay basin is located between 37 19 and 37 30 northern latitudes and 44 34 and 44 57 eastern longitudes and has a basin area of 324 km2 the shaharchay river takes its rise among the mountains in the western borders of iran 3574 m above sea level and flows towards the east west to east and eventually flowing into the lake urmia shaharchay river is one of the main sources of fresh water in the region and the shaharchay reservoir was constructed to regulate and control the streamflow of shaharchay river to supply the drinking water of urmia city and agricultural water in the urmia plain the data required in this study included streamflow input into the shaharchay reservoir precipitation evaporation demand and the surface volume relationship of the reservoir which was obtained from the iran water resources management company at the reservoir site 50 years 1968 2017 of monthly historical inflow precipitation and evaporation data records were available the amount of mean annual flow maf mean annual precipitation map and mean annual evaporation mae historical data recorded at the reservoir site are 205 mcm 368 mm and 1205 mm respectively mean monthly precipitation and evaporation at the reservoir site box plot of monthly inflows into the reservoir monthly demand based on different percentages of the mean annual flow and the surface volume relationship of the reservoir site are shown in fig 4 it should be noted that the actual annual demand of the shaharchay reservoir system has been about 60 of the mean annual flow since it was commissioned in the 2005 year however for a comprehensive analysis with full coverage of the within year and over year behavior of the reservoir system the annual demand was modeled at 7 classes of 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 of the mean annual flow maf in this study to use the data in the streamflow time series modeling initial tests of homogeneity randomness and stationarity were performed adeloye and montaseri 2001 for this purpose double mass curve mann kendall and run test methods have been used for estimating the homogeneity randomness and stationarity of the record of annual streamflow data respectively kottegoda and horder 1980 salas 1993 the results of the double mass curve test for annual streamflow data show that the data was homogeneity with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 in addition the results of two mann kendall and run tests confirm the correctness of the hypothesis h0 of stationarity and randomness of annual streamflow data in the studied site at a 95 confidence level however the data of shaharchay river at the reservoir site were used by completely removing the trend another key step in the streamflow time series modeling is to determine the probability distribution function of data therefore five common probability distribution functions of normal two and three parameter log normal pearson type iii and log pearson type iii were evaluated using the probability plot correlation coefficient ppcc goodness of fit test vogel 1986 the results of ppcc goodness of fit test confirmed that the pearson type iii probability distribution was the best probability distribution of both annual and monthly streamflow data for the studied site 2 5 methodology the methodology of this study was done in three main steps in the first step the 1000 series of annual and monthly streamflow data were generated using the ar 1 and valencia schaake models in equations 1 and 2 respectively in the second step the shaharchay reservoir system was simulated by the spa ii model based on each generated data series for different values of demand 20 30 80 of maf reliability 100 99 90 and vulnerability 5 10 20 and 30 then the different characteristics of the reservoir system required storage capacity critical period evaporation for 7 demand 8 reliability 4 vulnerability 1000 series were extracted it should be noted that for the first and second step of the research the stochastic reservoir system simulation srss package developed by montaseri in 1999 was used in the third step simple conditional probabilities of different characteristics of the reservoir system required storage capacity critical period evaporation loss in the reservoir site were estimated using copulas the summary details of the three steps are provided in fig 5 3 results the results of this study were prepared and arranged in 6 sections to present the detailed results clearly first the performance of the applied stochastic models in reproducing the historical streamflow statistics at both monthly and annual levels is evaluated this is very important in analyzing the behavior of the reservoir system which is a combination of within year and over year behavior the second section presents the generalized or long term behavior of different characteristics of reservoir system based on their population of data average 1000 values generated series in the third section the dependence of the different generated characteristics i e determined based on the generated streamflow time series in the reservoir for the within year transitional a transition system represents alternately both within year and over year behavior during operation years i e cpi 12 and cpi 1 12 months in years i and i 1 respectively and over year systems are evaluated in the next section the analysis of the univariate marginal distribution of the different generated characteristics of the reservoir and the systematic changes of their parameters based on the different performance measures and demands are presented explaining the joint probability structure of the different generated reservoir characteristics using copulas is reported in the fifth section in the last section the results of the joint probabilities simple conditional of reservoir characteristics according to different conditions governing the system are introduced and discussed 3 1 stochastic model performance in this study a combination of two annual ar 1 and monthly valencia schaake data generation models were applied to a comprehensive analysis of the probable behavior of the reservoir system i e within year transitional and over year these data generation models preserve or reproduce the streamflow statistics at both annual and monthly levels which is important to accurately determine the within year and over year behavior of reservoir systems however the models used in previous studies such as the thomas fiering mcmahon et al 2006 and fragment models soundharajan et al 2016 have two main limitations namely the lack of preserving the streamflow statistics at the annual level and the use of a deterministic approach to disaggregate annual flow to monthly flows respectively which could cause significant uncertainties in the calculations the combination of ar 1 and valencia schaake models can preserve the different streamflow statistics such as mean standard deviation skewness and correlation between annual and monthly data the applied stochastic model represented the desired performance in preserving the historical streamflow statistics at both annual and monthly levels which ensures the necessary accuracy of the results of this study a comparison of mean standard deviation skewness and correlation of annual and monthly data of generated and historical streamflow data is presented in fig 6 it should be noted that preserving the skewness coefficient of historical data depends solely on the use of the pearson type iii distribution for historical data also one of the criteria for evaluating the long term dependence of the generated time series is the hurst coefficient whose value in this research is estimated to be 0 668 and 0 587 for the annual generated and historical data respectively which indicates the acceptable preservation of the long term dependence in generated time series 3 2 general or long term behavior of surface water reservoir characteristics long term behavior analysis of different characteristics of the reservoir system plays an important role in the planning operation and management of reservoir systems therefore in this study the long term behavior of different characteristics of the reservoir system and their correlations with each other was evaluated the box plot and average values of generated required storage capacity critical period and evaporation losses of the shaharchay reservoir for various demands 20 to 80 maf and performance measures were presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively fig 7 shows that the range of all three variables required storage capacity sc critical period cp and evaporation losses ev for the within year systems is very small and with increasing the demand or change the system to transitional and over year system this range will increase sharply also on the other hand with increasing the vulnerability vul the range of all three variables decreases fig 8 shows that the relationship between the mean values of three variables sc cp and ev and demand follows a power relationship and the rate of nonlinearity of the relationship decreases significantly with decreasing reliability reli and increasing vulnerability vul so that for within year systems cp 12 months the increase in required storage capacity with increasing demand has a slight slope and this increase continues at an exponential rate in transitional and over year systems cp 12 months finally considering the similarity in behavior of the sc cp and ev per demand figs 7 and 8 the joint dependence of these reservoir characteristics will not be far from reality 3 3 joint dependence of reservoir characteristics considering the similar behavior of the three variables of sc cp and ev per demand a significant joint dependence of these variables is expected therefore to evaluate the probable joint dependence of reservoir characteristics in three behavior classes of within year cp 12 months transitional and over year cp 12 months the scatter plot of pair generated variables sc cp and ev for three demands of 1 20 40 60 and 80 maf 2 98 reliability and 3 5 vulnerability were provided in fig 9 according to fig 9 the reservoir characteristics for all three states of within year transitional and over year classes have a direct relationship with each other and these relationships in the within year and especially in over year classes follow the continuous scatter plot whereas such behavior was completely discrete for transitional systems and it is distinctive and separable for both within year and over year systems in other words in demand maf 40 and 60 a critical period obtained for a part of 1000 series is estimated to be less than 12 and for another part greater than 12 months therefore the behavior of the system for some of the generated series is within year and for other series is over year in this case the system is classified as a transitional system and is not completely classified as a within year or over year system while this issue about the demand maf 20 and 80 shows the completely within year and over year behavior of the system in all the generated series therefore the analysis of the joint bivariate probability of the reservoir characteristics in the transitional behavior of reservoir system has high uncertainty and developing the joint probabilities in such systems will not be logical also according to a comparison of the results of the within year and over year system the over year system occurred in the state of demand with 80 maf had a higher priority due to having very suitable conditions and minimum uncertainty for analyzing the joint probability of the reservoir characteristics and was selected to continue the study kendall s tau coefficient of rank correlation between generated values of required storage capacity critical period and evaporation for the demand of 80 maf and different values of reliability 100 99 98 97 96 95 93 and 90 and vulnerability 5 10 20 and 30 were presented in table 1 the results confirm the reasonably significant correlation between the sc cp and ev 3 4 univariate marginal distribution of reservoir characteristics one of the basic steps in developing joint distribution functions using the copulas is to determine the marginal distribution of each variable for this purpose seven probability distribution of exponential gamma gumble normal log normal logistics and weibull were fitted to the generated values of storage capacity critical period and evaporation for particular combinations of reservoir performance measures e g reliability 0 98 and vulnerability 0 05 the parameters of the seven probability distributions were estimated using the maximum likelihood method and also two common aic and bic goodness of fit tests were used to evaluate and determine the best marginal distribution function of the variables the results of the goodness of fit test of the sc cp and ev values for different reliabilities and vulnerabilities are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 the gumbel distribution with a slightly difference compared to the log normal distribution was selected as the best marginal distribution function of the required storage capacity it should be noted that in most previous studies the log normal distribution was assumed or selected as the best distribution of storage capacity vogel and stedinger 1987 bayazit and bulu 1991 phien 1993 adeloye et al 2015 on the other hand the log normal distribution was determined as the most appropriate marginal distribution function for the critical period and evaporation variables the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function of gumbel and log normal distributions as the best probability distribution of sc cp and ev respectively are shown in fig 11 the results also show the systematic behavior of the best marginal distribution parameters with the performance measures and these parameters have a significant relationship with reliability and vulnerability fig 12 in that for particular vulnerabilities the parameters of marginal distribution functions have an exponential relationship with the reliability as the vulnerability decreases the values of the parameters increase and the relationship tends to a linear relationship 3 5 joint probability of reservoir characteristics using copulas to analyze the joint probability of the reservoir characteristics i e required storage capacity critical period sc cp required storage capacity evaporation sc ev and critical period evaporation cp ev seven copulas of clayton gumbel frank joe galambos plackett and normal were used for different values of reservoir performance measures the parameters of the copulas were estimated using the common ifm method joe 1997 finally the best copula of each pair of variables was determined based on log likelihood aic and bic evaluation criteria zhang and singh 2006 these evaluation criteria quantify the deviation of estimation and observational values at a given confidence level the best copulas are determined by the lowest aic bic and the highest log likelihood shiau 2006 the results of modeling the joint distributions of sc cp and ev with seven copulas for different reliabilities and vulnerabilities are presented in fig 13 according to fig 13 the gaussian normal copula was selected as the best copula for all three pairs of variables in addition to graphically compare the performance of the copula 10 000 random pair of required storage capacity critical period and evaporation were generated using the monte carlo simulation technique for each copula and then the generated data were transformed back into their original domains using marginal distribution functions fig 14 shows the scatter plot of generated random pair data gray dots and observed data red dots based on the best copula gaussian copula for the demand of 80 maf 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability this scatters plot shows the desirable performance of the best copula gaussian copula in fitting the observed data especially in the minimum and maximum tail values it should be noted that quite similar results were obtained for other combinations of reservoir performance measures the results also show the linear relationship between the parameters of the gaussian copula and the reliability at a particular vulnerability fig 15 the slope of the linear relationship of the parameters of the gaussian copula with reliability for the reservoir system with low vulnerabilities 5 and 10 was approximately zero this indicates a very low dependence of the parameters of the gaussian copula with reliability and this dependence increases slightly with increased vulnerability 3 6 joint probability of reservoir characteristics 3 6 1 joint probability using the gaussian copula the joint cumulative probability of the required storage capacity critical period i e p sc sc cp cp c fsc sc fcp cp required storage capacity evaporation and critical period evaporation were calculated fig 16 shows a contour plot of the joint cumulative probability distribution of the reservoir at 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability according to fig 16 the joint cumulative probability distribution of the storage capacity critical period i e p sc sc cp cp increases with increasing both variables this behavior is also observed for storage capacity evaporation and critical period evaporation for example the joint probability of sc 150 ev 40 sc 200 cp 50 and cp 20 ev 10 for demand 80 maf 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability is equal to 0 159 0 42 and 0 99 respectively the results also showed that the joint cumulative probability distribution of reservoir characteristics is a function of reliability and vulnerability and have a systematic behavior for example the joint probability of sc 200 cp 50 sc 150 ev 40 and cp 20 ev 10 based on different values of reliability and vulnerability is presented in fig 17 the results show that a the joint cumulative probabilities per reliability for larger vulnerability are higher values this is due to the reduction of required storage capacity critical period and evaporation with increasing vulnerability in the reservoir system b the joint cumulative probability indicates a decreasing trend with increasing the reliability for a particular vulnerability this is due to the increase in the required storage capacity critical period and evaporation for the higher values of reliability 3 6 2 conditional joint probability the conditional bivariate joint probability of the reservoir characteristics i e p x x y y and p y y x x for different combinations of reliabilities and vulnerabilities was determined for simple evaluation of the bivariate joint probabilities of the reservoir characteristics exceedance non occurrence and conditional probabilities of the reservoir characteristics for different values of f x p x x 98 reliability and 5 vulnerability are presented in table 2 for example based on the cumulative probability of f x 0 9 the cumulative joint probability of sc 293 5 cp 96 8 p jnx the joint exceedance probability of sc 293 5 cp 96 8 p jx and the conditional joint probability of p sc s c c p c p p c or p cp c p s c s c were estimated equal to 0 85 0 05 and 0 50 respectively 4 conclusion in this study a combination of two annual ar 1 and monthly valencia schaake data generation models were used to generate 1000 series of synthetic annual and monthly streamflow data respectively the spa ii model was then applied to simulate the shaharchay reservoir system for each generated streamflow time series and different values of demand reliability and vulnerability then the joint probabilities of different characteristics of the within year and over year reservoir system i e required storage capacity critical period and evaporation were estimated using copulas the results show that the required storage capacity in the reservoir system is highly dependent on other reservoir characteristics such as performance measures critical period and evaporation this indicates the necessity of considering the other reservoir dependent variables in determining the reservoir storage capacity which can have a significant effect on the planning and operation of storage reservoir systems accordingly the following results were achieved the reservoir characteristics for three classes of within year transitional and over year storage have a direct relationship with each other and these relationships in the within year and especially in over year classes follow the continuous behavior gumbel and log normal probability distributions have best describe the required storage capacity critical period and evaporation variable respectively the results also show the systematic behavior of best marginal distribution parameters with the reservoir performance measures the results of joint probability modeling show that the gaussian copula has the best performance in describing the observed reservoir pair characteristics especially in the lower and upper tail values also the results show the linear relationship between the parameter of gaussian copulas and reservoir performance measures reliability and vulnerability finally the results showed that the simple and conditional joint probabilities of reservoir characteristics are a function of the reliability and vulnerability and have a systematic behavior credit authorship contribution statement babak amirataee
