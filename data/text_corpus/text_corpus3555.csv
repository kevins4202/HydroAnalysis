introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a rapidly developing water desalination technology that uses multiple porous electrode pairs in a configuration similar to a supercapacitor to electrostatically trap salt ions oren 2008 suss et al 2015 cdi has been identified as a potential replacement for traditional large scale water desalination processes such as reverse osmosis ro for feedwater with salinity significantly lower than sea water such as brackish water with salt concentrations less than roughly 10 g l 1 oren 2008 suss et al 2015 cdi has also been demonstrated and applied to the selective removal of ionic impurities including nitrate oyarzun et al 2018 to establish cdi as a viable technology for brackish water desalination research has mostly focused on developing and assessing operational modes for cdi kim and yoon 2015 a subset of this work has sought to optimize the design and or operation of cdi cells under specified performance constraints demirer et al 2013 wang and lin 2019 recently a set of standard performance metrics namely water recovery wr volume averaged average desalination depth δ c mm productivity p l h 1 m 2 and volumetric energy consumption e v kwh m 3 have been developed hawks et al 2019 to enable direct quantitative evaluation of cdi operating schemes and comparison with other water technologies for constant feed flow rates this treatment has been applied to constant voltage cv and constant current cc operation to assess key contributors to operating costs for example energy consumption hemmatifar et al 2016 qu et al 2016 dykstra et al 2018 qin et al 2019 ramachandran et al 2019 hand et al 2019b recently similar treatments have also been extended to sinusoidal voltage and current electrical inputs ramachandran et al 2018a the aforementioned simple comparisons of energy related operating costs are insufficient to compare among the many desalination technologies in addition to other operating costs such as brine disposal labor and electrode replacements there are other initial capital investment costs such as cdi plant components power electronics and any capacitive energy recovery components e g see oyarzun et al 2020 notably hand et al 2019a presented a techno economic study of cdi which included a detailed framework for sizing and pricing cdi and membrane cdi cells hand et al explored a fairly wide cdi design space for constant flow rate given cc operation and found the additional material and capital costs greatly outweigh operational costs this initial study by hand et al encourages further and more comprehensive analysis of capital cost mitigation particularly exploration of the complex coupling between operational modes electrode costs and electrode aging also useful would be an easy to use and open source modeling tool to enable simulations of one or more cdi cells and their interaction with ancillary systems e g power conversion units or brine disposal method to determine balances among streams of cost energy and species we present an experimentally validated cdi dynamics and techno economic simulation program for development and assessment of novel cdi systems we developed an open source matlab program with an intuitive graphical user interface gui which allows simulation of effluent concentration dynamics coupled with electric double layer edl and faradaic efficiencies calculation of cycle performance parameters and full economic analyses in contrast to the previous work mentioned where flow rates and electrical input were held constant our program allows fairly arbitrary temporal variations of electrical and flow rate forcing functions we demonstrate the program to study effluent concentration dynamics in response to sinusoidal flow rate and current inputs we vary the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal flow rate to explore a wide parameter design space for sinusoidal flow rate inputs and calculate resulting cell performance parameters within the space the program s ability to deal with arbitrary electrical input and flow rate input enables exploration of complex trade offs among important figures of merit we further use our program to perform an example techno economic analysis of cdi considering the relative effects of capital costs operating costs and electrode aging mechanisms on the net levelized cost of water to this end we consider three separate electrode aging hypotheses two in the main paper and one in the supplementary information si document these hypotheses are encoded into the program as possible electrode replacement criteria see lu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 in this way we study the relative effect of electrode lifetime on the overall produced water cost for a number of different electrode unit costs for present day constituent material cost estimates we find that capital and material costs are more dominant than operating costs over the lifetime of a non membrane cdi plant 2 theory 2 1 well mixed reactor model with extendable electric double layer formulations for salt removal dynamics we model the cdi cell as a well mixed reactor coupled with a non linear rc circuit formulation based on the experimentally validated model of ramachandran et al 2018a applying a salt mass balance over the cell volume yields the well mixed reactor formulation for salt concentration dynamics 1 τ t d δ c t d t δ c t i t λ c λ d l f q t here i t is the current supplied to the cell q t is the flow rate of fluid through the cell and δ c t c 0 c t is the instantaneous salt concentration reduction from the feed concentration c 0 τ t q t is a time scale proportional to the flow residence time as a function of the mixed reactor cell volume and the instantaneous flow rate q t f is faraday s constant and λ c and λ d l are respectively the coulombic and differential charge efficiencies ramachandran et al 2018a 2018b the values of λ d l reflect the treatment of electric double layer physics at the electrodes two commonly used formulations are the modified donnan md biesheuvel et al 2011 and guoy chapman stern gcs biesheuvel et al 2009 models for simplicity we here treat λ d l as a simple numerical input reflecting the appropriate cycle averaged value represented as λ d l see discussion and calculations by ramachandran et al 2018b we note that the current modeling program can be reconfigured to accommodate virtually any model for λ d l we present a detailed discussion on selecting a cycle averaged value for λ d l for a given operational voltage window in section s2 of the si document similarly our model uses a single cycle averaged value of coulombic efficiency λ c the latter treatment is motivated by the work of hawks et al 2018 and ramachandran et al 2018b who showed that λ c which is governed by leakage currents faradaic charge transfer reactions at high voltage potentials can be estimated using preliminary experimental data for the cell see for example fig s5 and associate discussion in the si of hawks et al 2019 2 2 performance metrics to assess the operation of cdi cells first the water recovery ratio w r is a non dimensional measure of the quantity of desalinated water produced for a given total volume of water processed it can be calculated as 2 w r v d e s a l v d e s a l v w a s t e the volume of desalinated water and waste brine water produced per cycle are respectively calculated as v d e s a l t c y c δ c t 0 q d e s a l t d t v w a s t e t c y c δ c t 0 q w a s t e t d t q d e s a l t and q w a s t e t are arbitrary time varying functions describing the flow rate passed through the cell during desalination δ c t 0 and electrode regeneration δ c t 0 respectively the limits of these integrals indicate that we consider a specific instantaneous output salt concentration as delimiting the start and end of the adsorption and desorption phases of the cycle note the choice of this salt concentration limit determines the value of wr second the productivity p l h 1 m 2 of the cdi stack quantifies throughput and is defined as the volume of desalinated water v d e s a l produced per time and per total electrode area as follows 3 p v d e s a l n e a e t c y c here n e is the number of single electrodes in the cdi stack a e is the projected facial surface area of a single electrode and t c y c is the cycle time i e including adsorption and desorption phases third the volume averaged concentration reduction δ c expressed in mm is a measure of the volume averaged desalination depth as 4 δ c n d e s a l v d e s a l note in this work we differentiate volume averaged desalination depth δ c from instantaneous desalination depth δ c t through omission of t n d e s a l is the number of moles of salt removed in the adsorption phase where n d e s a l t c y c δ c t 0 q d e s a l t δ c t d t lastly the volumetric energy consumption e v kwh m 3 represents the energy used to produce a given volume of desalinated water as follows 5 e v e c h a r g e η e d i s c h a r g e v d e s a l for simplicity we treat η 0 1 as a user specified energy recovery efficiency factor which governs how much energy can be recovered by the system during the discharging phase see oyarzun et al 2020 for a detailed discussion of energy recovery efficiency in cdi the energy consumed recovered during charging discharging are respectively e c h a r g e t c y c i 0 i t v c e l l t d t e d i s c h a r g e t c y c i 0 i t v c e l l t d t here v c e l l t is the instantaneous voltage potential across the cell note that other formulations of other performance paramers such as average salt adsorption rate asar can be derived from the performance parameters above see hawks et al 2019 2 3 techno economic analysis of cdi systems the techno economic analysis of cdi includes conversions among streams of species energy and costs and includes comparisons among future recurring and present costs as per standard present worth of cost analysis newman et al 2015 each future expense f c incurred n interest periods in the future is converted to an equivalent present cost p c through 6 p c f c 1 i n here i is the discount rate assumed for the analysis this rate can be used to account for interest inflation and other factors and can be compared to the rate of return of competing investments newman et al 2015 similarly a set of regularly occurring uniform payments a incurred for n periods is converted to a single present day cost using 7 p c a 1 i n 1 i 1 i n note the pre factor obtained from inverting this equation is defined as the fixed charge rate f c r 1 i n 1 i 1 i n 1 in our analysis the fcr is determined from the user selected value for i and is a parameter used to compute the total levelized cost of produced desalted water l c as follows 8 l c m 3 i 1 n c c i f c r a i v t o t where c c is a capital cost and v t o t is the total volume of desalinated water produced over a specified timeframe this relation describes the summation of all distributed costs over a given time period typically annually and normalizing by the volume of desalted water produced over that period see for example bartholomew et al 2018 and hand et al 2019a for similar techno economic analyses applied respectively to osmotically assisted reverse osmosis oaro and cdi both with and without membranes 3 open source matlab graphical user interface gui program for cdi process design and techno economic analysis 3 1 cdi system specification through drag and drop design in simulink to specify cdi plant configurations the user chooses from among a set of pre constructed simulink blocks provided in the open source block library slx file icons are arranged in simulink via drag and drop to connect cdi cells to desired peripheries including power and water feed systems once a cdi configuration is specified in simulink our gui matlab program is used to run the model and view results the fully modular nature of the simulink environment allows simulation of cdi cells in context with other auxiliary non water systems for example a cdi system can be developed which draws electricity from solar panels and disposes of wastewater into a sink i e disposal method which has varying costs based on waste concentration once blocks are connected lines represent flows of species energy and cost and the program automatically converts dimensions between flows further the program mimics cdi operation in real world time meaning the plant is simulated to run each day of the year for a specified operational schedule in this way peripheries such as electricity costs can be modeled as the real time energy costs which vary throughout the day and the seasons specific to a given location in our study we use published electricity prices for the san francisco ca bay area pg and e 2019 a user manual for the cdi program which outlines best practices for using simulink and the gui can be found in section s3 of the si fig 1 a shows how a configuration that includes waste disposal energy requirements and electrode replacement can be designed in simulink 3 2 cdi cell parameters operational parameter inputs and graphical outputs in the gui once a user has specified a cdi configuration in simulink the gui matlab program e g fig 1b can be used to specify physical cdi plant parameters such as cell resistance capacitance and volume operating conditions e g current forcing functions flow rate functions number of cycles and economic input parameters e g discount rates operation schedules capital costs once the simulation has been executed the gui program is also used to display results of the techno economic analysis including cycle performance parameters volume of clean water produced time varying concentration responses and full economic cost breakdowns in addition to the levelized cost of desalinated water users can run standalone dynamics simulations with or without economic analysis as well as full parameter sweep batch simulations in parameter batch simulations any number of variables are specified as vectors over which they are varied the cdi program sequentially runs a simulation for each variable permutation and all relevant results are stored in a data structure for later use see section s3 6 in the si for further discussion on specifying and running parameter batch simulations in this regard the program allows preliminary sensitivity and trade off studies for any parameter of choice we use this functionality in section 4 1 to study the performance of sinusoidal flow rate operation within a parameter design space 3 3 validation of current model predictions with experimental data from lab scale experiments curves of model predicted effluent concentrations are shown in fig 1c as solid curves these predictions compare very well with experimental data of ramachandran et al 2018a shown are cases of sinusoidal voltage forcing at frequencies of 0 9 2 5 and 8 8 mhz and constant feed flow rate cell parameters reported by ramachandran et al 2018a were used to specify the physical cdi inputs and are consistent with those shown in fig 1b see section s1 in the si for a complete list of cell parameters and detailed discussion of operational conditions and assumptions users are warned by the program if an operating scheme causes certain model assumptions to be violated these include conditions for the well mixed reactor realistic constant resistance and capacitance values and assumptions regarding cycle efficiencies see sections s1 and s3 3 in the si for more information on running the program within the model s limits 4 results discussion we here present example applications of our validated cdi program to a study of cdi effluent salt concentration in response to complex forcing functions and a techno economic analysis of electrode cost relative to total levelized water costs table 1 presents a complete list of the cdi plant parameters used for these and all subsequent modeling studies presented in this paper unless otherwise specified the values are consistent with the system discussed in detail by ramachandran et al 2018a 4 1 simulations of variable flow rate and variable applied current operations we here consider a cell subject to sinusoidal input current we further consider a flow rate forcing function composed of a constant value plus a sinusoidal component with both varying amplitude and phase the sinusoidal current forcing is described by i t δ i sin ω t where δ i 70 a m 2 and the sinusoidal flow rate is described by q t q d c δ q sin ω t φ where q d c 4 l m 2 min 1 fig 2 a and b respectively show plots of effluent concentration versus normalized time t t c y c for several values of magnitude δ q q d c 0 0 5 1 and phase φ 0 π 2 π rads drawing from ramachandran et al 2018a we chose a current and flow rate frequency ω 0 026 rad s that corresponds to resonance for the constant dc flow rate component ω r e s 1 τ r c where here τ q d c 16 1 s we note that there is no known cdi resonance criterion for the present case of time varying flow rate fig 2a isolates the effect of flow rate amplitude on desalination depth higher flow rate amplitude in phase with the desalination period implies less desalination sacrificing salt removal for increased instantaneous productivity conversely lower flow rate amplitude in phase with regeneration results in higher brine concentration the latter sacrifices instantaneous productivity for improved water recovery ratio the combined effects of in phase flow rate amplitude are therefore higher water recovery ratio high productivity and lower energy consumption per volume of produced water at the expense of a low cycle averaged desalination depth fig 2b isolates the effect of phase change for a single case of flow rate amplitude δ q q d c 0 5 we observe that instantaneous concentration deviation from the inlet value increases as current to flow rate phase difference increases from 0 to π radians thus a low high flow rate in phase with desalination regeneration decreases increases instantaneous output concentration this has a significant effect on all of the figures of merit discussed in section 2 2 overall increasingly out of phase flow rate results in improved δ c but the relatively low flow rates during desalination result in decreased wr p and e v fig 3 presents a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of flow rate sinusoid amplitude and phase on the aforementioned figures of merit for cdi the axes of the contours of fig 3 span all values of δ q q d c 0 1 and φ 0 π radians plots a through d show quantitative predictions of performance measures wr δ c p and e v respectively note that φ is limited to π radians as the performance parameters are identically mirrored about the φ π axis regions marked as not feasible represent operating conditions where effluent concentration approaches 0 mm during desalination complete desalination or applied voltage exceeds 1 2 v faradaic limits of water splitting violating the assumptions of the model fig 3 shows clearly the tradeoff between water recovery productivity and energy consumption on one hand and desalination depth on the other as before low instantaneous flow rate in phase with the regeneration period favors higher concentration duration desalination and higher brine concentration collectively favoring wr p and e v in contrast the highest desalination depth is achieved with a sinusoidal flow rate that is a half period out of phase with current this minimizes the volume of produced desalted water note the tradeoff between desalination depth and the other parameters also holds for a constant value of flow rate we note that these results and insights are limited to the case of both sinusoidal flow rate and current we hypothesize that a much more generalized study of these tradeoffs would require considerations of arbitrary shape as well as phase we suggest that such optimizations may significantly benefit from the simulation program presented here 4 2 techno economic analysis assessing fractional impact of electrode replacement cost to overall levelized water cost we here present an example techno economic analysis considering the contribution of electrode cost to the net levelized cost of water produced by cdi we will also consider several criteria for electrode aging and replacement cdi electrode costs are a significant fraction of total cost in cdi and so we will consider them a special category of cost apart from more typical capital or operational costs we first consider electrode costs ranging from 1 m 2 to 10 m 2 the 10 m 2 value is closest to what is currently attainable for complete electrodes carbon binder conductivity additive in industry hand et al 2019a while the lower values represent future possible values given advancements in fabrication and increase of the scale of production we will term capital costs as non electrode but cdi specific construction of plant costs frames housing current collectors etc we conservatively increase capital costs by a factor of 1 6 to account for additional up front expenditures siting infrastructure development pumps electronics etc following traditional water technology analyses malek et al 1996 bartholomew et al 2018 operational costs are comprised of electricity brine disposal and labor maintenance we model electricity costs after rates published for small to medium businesses by the california pacific gas electric company pg and e 2019 and we account for hourly and seasonal variations traditional cdi techno economic analyses typically neglect brine disposal costs due to the low salinity feeds commonly associated with cdi however for completeness we will include disposal costs in this analysis for brackish water desalination with c 0 20 mm and an average brine concentration of 29 6 mm δ c 9 6 mm we assume a brine disposal cost of 0 02 m 3 labor is estimated to be 3 of the total capital cost of the plant following analyses of comparable water technologies vince et al 2008 bartholomew et al 2018 hand et al 2019a further we consider a cdi plant which has a 5 year lifespan and operates 90 of the time each year table 2 lists all economic parameters and unit costs used in the following analysis fig 4 plots fractions of costs which comprise overall water desalination costs for cdi predicted by our model we vary the electrode unit cost to be a 10 m 2 b 6 m 2 and c 1 m 2 each and consider electrode replacement frequencies of 1 3 and 5 replacements over the plant s 5 year lifetime displayed above each bar is the resulting levelized cost of water for each condition for this study we consider a constant flow rate sinusoidal current at system resonance ω r e s 1 τ r c operating condition with c 0 20 mm δ c 9 6 mm wr 0 5 p 6 l m 2 h 1 and e v 0 32 kwh m 3 as expected the predicted data of fig 4 indicate that the relative importance of electrode costs increasingly dominate levelized costs as electrode replacement frequency is increased for example in fig 4a electrodes a 10 m 2 electrode cost and other capital costs comprise roughly 70 of the 0 38 m 3 levelized cost for one replacement per year on the other hand fig 4c a 1 m 2 electrode cost suggests these constitute only 40 of the 0 16 m 3 lc for a replacement every 5 y in comparison to previous studies we note yu et al 2016 assumed a 1 y electrode lifetime while hand et al 2019a reported a levelized cost of roughly 0 38 m 3 for non membrane cdi with an electrode and overall plant lifetime of 2 y the data presented here strongly suggest that existing cdi economics are likely dominated by capital and material costs versus energy and other operational costs and so improvements in electrode aging can have significant impact on cdi water levelized cost note also that the data of fig 4 is independent of the mechanism by which electrodes age only the resulting replacement frequency we will next explore specific aging mechanisms 4 3 techno economic analysis evaluating the effect of electrode aging and replacement criteria on the overall levelized cost of water we here hypothesize two practically relevant mechanisms that drive electrode aging and then formulate these mechanisms into our techno economic model in addition to aging criteria this analysis explores the effects of cdi operation and electrode cost on levelized cost we emphasize that while this analysis focuses on resulting levelized cost the calculations are applicable to the study of the effects cdi operational modes have on electrode replacement costs for simplicity we neglect fouling but note that fouling and feedwater composition can be a significant electrode aging mechanism liu et al 2019 suggested fouling can be mitigated through upstream water conditioning and electrode cleaning the first hypothesized criterion is an electrode lifetime based on the number of electrical charge discharge cycles this hypothesis is simple and could be coded into the controller of a cdi cell for the second criterion we posit that electrode aging is governed by the cumulative time of operation above a certain value of applied total cell potential this hypothesis is informed by the studies of cohen et al 2013 and lu et al 2017 which showed that operation at reduced cell potentials below 0 7 v for the former and 0 8 v for the latter significantly delayed electrode oxidation when compared to operation at higher and more commonly used applied potentials e g 1 2 v also experiments performed by cohen et al 2015 implemented an alternating polarization operation mode between 0 9 v and showed retained adsorption concentration and cell stability after 816 h of continuous operation we thus hypothesize that electrode degradation is related to the time spent at higher potentials for the present study we chose operation time spent at cell potential above a threshold of 0 8 v as one aging and electrode replacement criterion in future work we hope to study the effects of electrode oxidation and the related issue of the effects of surface functionalities on electrode aging li et al 2020 in section s4 of the si we present a third hypothesis for electrode aging which considers only operational time electrodes replaced every 1 y this type of replacement criterion has been used in cdi techno economic and lifecycle analyses as a baseline estimate yu et al 2016 hand et al 2019a we stress that the simulation and techno economic analysis tool described here is useful in making comparisons among these and other aging criteria on the levelized cost of water fig 5 a and b shows plots of levelized cost versus p and δ c subject to the two aforementioned electrode aging hypotheses fig 5a shows levelized cost for electrodes replaced every 500 h of operation above a voltage threshold of 0 8 v while fig 5b shows costs for electrodes replaced every 24 000 cycles the value of 500 h is encapsulated by the study performed by cohen et al 2015 and the value of 24 000 cycles was selected to result in electrode replacement frequencies from 0 to 6 per plant lifetime encapsulating the analysis of fig 4 note all related parameters can be specified by the user as before we consider a constant flow rate resonant sinusoidal current operating condition with c 0 20 mm however we here expand the operational regime to include desalination depths of δ c 3 11 mm and productivities p 3 18 l m 2 h 1 areas marked as not feasible represent operational regimes where a given desalination depth is not attainable for a fixed productivity with a voltage window below 1 2 v in fig 5c we reduce the unit cost of electrodes to 1 m 2 a regime where levelized cost is more strongly affected by operational costs for the electrode aging criterion based on time spent above 0 8 v fig 5a shows that lc is determined by both desalination depth and water throughput we see that lc decreases monotonically with decreasing δ c demand for δ c above about 8 mm increases lc and strongly limits the feasible p range interestingly a demand for increased productivity can either decrease or increase lc this reflects the competing influence between electrode replacement and total water production for example for δ c at values between about 3 and 5 mm lc exhibits a local minimum for increasing p e g a minimum value of 0 13 m 3 for δ c 4 mm and p 8 l m 2 h 1 initially increases in p drive for constant δ c lower levelized cost past the local minimum lc increases as increases in productivity drive more frequent electrode replacements since operation requires higher peak voltages to maintain the constant δ c fig 5b shows lc for the second criterion associated with 24 000 cell cycles and a 10 m 2 electrode cost within the feasible region the cycle based electrode replacement criterion is exactly independent of the voltage values imposed in the cell and energy costs are approximately negligible that is a higher operational voltage window required for increased desalination depth at a given productivity does not decrease electrode life hence the electrode replacement cost is high enough that lc is driven by a ratio of the present worth of capital costs including electrodes and the amount of water produced and so lc is approximately inversely proportional to p in fig 5c the electrode cost is sufficiently low 1 m 2 such that energy costs are again important to lc here lc depends more strongly on both p and δ c and the lowest lc of all cases is achievable for low δ c lowering energy costs and high productivity increasing amount of produced water lc is an important metric in comparing among economic feasibility of various desalination technologies for example lc for electrodialysis ed has been reported at about 0 60 m 3 for brackish feed water desalination younos 2009 mezher et al 2011 reported values for ro systems applied to brackish water desalination range from about 0 20 to 0 70 m 3 younos 2009 mezher et al 2011 of course such comparisons are not easily made as these lcs depend on operating conditions such as initial concentration decreases in concentration and throughput as well as operating modes for example energy consumption an important contributor to lc by ed is reported to be a function of amount and rate of salt removed turek 2003 also ro energy consumption also depends on initial salinity as well as flow rate therefore throughput and membrane type which in turn influences pumping pressure lee et al 2011 li 2011 further ro is typically applied to higher salinity feeds and achieves higher desalination depths of course membrane and or electrode replacement costs also significantly affect the lcs of these technologies accurate and more comprehensive determination of lc as a function of operation for cdi motivates further work in developing and applying techno economic tools 5 summary and conclusions we presented a newly developed open source cdi analysis and design program the tool is built as an installable matlab gui program matlab s simulink environment is used to design and build cdi systems and the gui is used to run the simulink model and view results included are tools for physics based modeling of one or more cdi cells and coupled techno economic models to compute economic parameters such as levelized cost of water the program allows for coupling of one or more cdi cells to related systems such as power conversion and disposal costs and the techno economic analysis converts among various dimensional streams of species e g feed desalted water and brine energy and cost the physics based model was validated by quantitative comparison to experimental cdi data from laboratory experiments we demonstrated the program in performing two distinct cdi design and analysis investigations the physics based program was used to simulate cdi dynamics subject to sinusoidal flow rate operation the investigation analyzed the effects of varying flow rate amplitude and phase offset with respect to a sinusoidal current electrical input including independent variation of flow rate sinusoid amplitude and phase on water recovery ratio productivity volumetric energy consumption and volume averaged desalination depth we observed desalination depth is achieved at the expense of the other three figures of merit similar to the case of constant flow rate the model enables analyses of arbitrary flow rate and electric forcing in cdi and may aid in development of new and optimized cdi operation strategies as relevant techno economic analyses we explored electrode lifetime and replacement criteria on levelized cost of produced water the analyses suggest that electrode costs in cdi are currently a greater contributor than operational costs e g electrical energy input to overall levelized cost of produced water the model was also used to study the effects of three plausible electrode aging mechanisms on the levelized cost of water operation time above 0 8 v to account for electrode oxidation versus simple number of cycles operation in the si we presented operational time as a third aging criterion our study highlights the importance of further research toward identifying electrode aging mechanisms and development of operational methods which extend electrode lifetimes of course decreasing of electrode costs remains an important challenge in cdi declaration of competing interest the

introduction capacitive deionization cdi is a rapidly developing water desalination technology that uses multiple porous electrode pairs in a configuration similar to a supercapacitor to electrostatically trap salt ions oren 2008 suss et al 2015 cdi has been identified as a potential replacement for traditional large scale water desalination processes such as reverse osmosis ro for feedwater with salinity significantly lower than sea water such as brackish water with salt concentrations less than roughly 10 g l 1 oren 2008 suss et al 2015 cdi has also been demonstrated and applied to the selective removal of ionic impurities including nitrate oyarzun et al 2018 to establish cdi as a viable technology for brackish water desalination research has mostly focused on developing and assessing operational modes for cdi kim and yoon 2015 a subset of this work has sought to optimize the design and or operation of cdi cells under specified performance constraints demirer et al 2013 wang and lin 2019 recently a set of standard performance metrics namely water recovery wr volume averaged average desalination depth δ c mm productivity p l h 1 m 2 and volumetric

flow rates this treatment has been applied to constant voltage cv and constant current cc operation to assess key contributors to operating costs for example energy consumption hemmatifar et al 2016 qu et al 2016 dykstra et al 2018 qin et al 2019 ramachandran et al 2019 hand et al 2019b recently similar treatments have also been extended to sinusoidal voltage and current electrical inputs ramachandran et al 2018a the aforementioned simple comparisons of energy related operating costs are insufficient to compare among the many desalination technologies in addition to other operating costs such as brine disposal labor and electrode replacements there are other initial capital investment costs such as cdi plant components power electronics and any capacitive energy recovery components e g see oyarzun et al 2020 notably hand et al 2019a presented a techno economic study of cdi which included a detailed framework for sizing and pricing cdi and membrane cdi cells hand et al explored a fairly wide cdi design space for constant flow rate given cc operation and found the additional material and capital costs greatly outweigh operational costs this initial study by hand et al encourages further and more comprehensive analysis of capital cost mitigation particularly exploration of the complex coupling between operational modes electrode costs and electrode aging also useful would be an easy to use and open source modeling tool to enable simulations of one or more cdi cells and their interaction with ancillary systems e g power conversion units or brine disposal method to determine balances among streams of cost energy and species we present an experimentally validated cdi dynamics and techno economic simulation program for development and assessment of novel cdi systems we developed an open source matlab program with an intuitive graphical user interface gui which allows simulation of effluent concentration dynamics coupled with electric double layer edl and faradaic efficiencies calculation of cycle performance parameters and full economic analyses in contrast to the previous work mentioned where flow rates and electrical input were held constant our program allows fairly arbitrary temporal variations of electrical and flow rate forcing functions we demonstrate the program to study effluent concentration dynamics in response to sinusoidal flow rate and current inputs we vary the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal flow rate to explore a wide parameter design space for sinusoidal flow rate inputs and calculate resulting cell performance parameters within the space the program s ability to deal with arbitrary electrical input and flow rate input enables exploration of complex trade offs among important figures of merit we further use our program to perform an example techno economic analysis of cdi considering the relative effects of capital costs operating costs and electrode aging mechanisms on the net levelized cost of water to this end we consider three separate electrode aging hypotheses two in the main paper and one in the supplementary information si document these hypotheses are encoded into the program as possible electrode replacement criteria see lu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 in this way we study the relative effect of electrode lifetime on the overall produced water cost for a number of different electrode unit costs for present day constituent material cost estimates we find that capital and material costs are more dominant than operating costs over the lifetime of a non membrane cdi plant 2 theory 2 1 well mixed reactor model with extendable electric double layer formulations for salt removal dynamics we model the cdi cell as a well mixed reactor coupled with a non linear rc circuit formulation based on the experimentally validated model of ramachandran et al 2018a applying a salt mass balance over the cell volume yields the well mixed reactor formulation for salt concentration dynamics 1 τ t d δ c t d t δ c t i t λ c λ d l f q t here i t is the current supplied to the cell q t is the flow rate of fluid through the cell and δ c t c 0 c t is the instantaneous salt concentration reduction from the feed concentration c 0 τ t q t is a time scale proportional to the flow residence time as a function of the mixed reactor cell volume and the instantaneous flow rate q t f is faraday s constant and λ c and λ d l are respectively the coulombic and differential charge efficiencies ramachandran et al 2018a 2018b the values of λ d l reflect the treatment of electric double layer physics at the electrodes two commonly used formulations are the modified donnan md biesheuvel et al 2011 and guoy chapman stern gcs biesheuvel et al 2009 models for simplicity we here treat λ d l as a simple numerical input reflecting the appropriate cycle averaged value represented as λ d l see discussion and calculations by ramachandran et al 2018b we note that the current modeling program can be reconfigured to accommodate virtually any model for λ d l we present a detailed discussion on selecting a cycle averaged value for λ d l for a given operational voltage window in section s2 of the si document similarly our model uses a single cycle averaged value of coulombic efficiency λ c the latter treatment is motivated by the work of hawks et al 2018 and ramachandran et al 2018b who showed that λ c which is governed by leakage currents faradaic charge transfer reactions at high voltage potentials can be estimated using preliminary experimental data for the cell see for example fig s5 and associate discussion in the si of hawks et al 2019 2 2 performance metrics to assess the operation of cdi cells first the water recovery ratio w r is a non dimensional measure of the quantity of desalinated water produced for a given total volume of water processed it can be calculated as 2 w r v d e s a l v d e s a l v w a s t e the volume of desalinated water and waste brine water produced per cycle are respectively calculated as v d e s a l t c y c δ c t 0 q d e s a l t d t v w a s t e t c y c δ c t 0 q w a s t e t d t q d e s a l t and q w a s t e t are arbitrary time varying functions describing the flow rate passed through the cell during desalination δ c t 0 and electrode regeneration δ c t 0 respectively the limits of these integrals indicate that we consider a specific instantaneous output salt concentration as delimiting the start and end of the adsorption and desorption phases of the cycle note the choice of this salt concentration limit determines the value of wr second the productivity p l h 1 m 2 of the cdi stack quantifies throughput and is defined as the volume of desalinated water v d e s a l produced per time and per total electrode area as follows 3 p v d e s a l n e a e t c y c here n e is the number of single electrodes in the cdi stack a e is the projected facial surface area of a single electrode and t c y c is the cycle time i e including adsorption and desorption phases third the volume averaged concentration reduction δ c expressed in mm is a measure of the volume averaged desalination depth as 4 δ c n d e s a l v d e s a l note in this work we differentiate volume averaged desalination depth δ c from instantaneous desalination depth δ c t through omission of t n d e s a l is the number of moles of salt removed in the adsorption phase where n d e s a l t c y c δ c t 0 q d e s a l t δ c t d t lastly the volumetric energy consumption e v kwh m 3 represents the energy used to produce a given volume of desalinated water as follows 5 e v e c h a r g e η e d i s c h a r g e v d e s a l for simplicity we treat η 0 1 as a user specified energy recovery efficiency factor which governs how much energy can be recovered by the system during the discharging phase see oyarzun et al 2020 for a detailed discussion of energy recovery efficiency in cdi the energy consumed recovered during charging discharging are respectively e c h a r g e t c y c i 0 i t v c e l l t d t e d i s c h a r g e t c y c i 0 i t v c e l l t d t here v c e l l t is the instantaneous voltage potential across the cell note that other formulations of other performance paramers such as average salt adsorption rate asar can be derived from the performance parameters above see hawks et al 2019 2 3 techno economic analysis of cdi systems the techno economic analysis of cdi includes conversions among streams of species energy and costs and includes comparisons among future recurring and present costs as per standard present worth of cost analysis newman et al 2015 each future expense f c incurred n interest periods in the future is converted to an equivalent present cost p c through 6 p c f c 1 i n here i is the discount rate assumed for the analysis this rate can be used to account for interest inflation and other factors and can be compared to the rate of return of competing investments newman et al 2015 similarly a set of regularly occurring uniform payments a incurred for n periods is converted to a single present day cost using 7 p c a 1 i n 1 i 1 i n note the pre factor obtained from inverting this equation is defined as the fixed charge rate f c r 1 i n 1 i 1 i n 1 in our analysis the fcr is determined from the user selected value for i and is a parameter used to compute the total levelized cost of produced desalted water l c as follows 8 l c m 3 i 1 n c c i f c r a i v t o t where c c is a capital cost and v t o t is the total volume of desalinated water produced over a specified timeframe this relation describes the summation of all distributed costs over a given time period typically annually and normalizing by the volume of desalted water produced over that period see for example bartholomew et al 2018 and hand et al 2019a for similar techno economic analyses applied respectively to osmotically assisted reverse osmosis oaro and cdi both with and without membranes 3 open source matlab graphical user interface gui program for cdi process design and techno economic analysis 3 1 cdi system specification through drag and drop design in simulink to specify cdi plant configurations the user chooses from among a set of pre constructed simulink blocks provided in the open source block library slx file icons are arranged in simulink via drag and drop to connect cdi cells to desired peripheries including power and water feed systems once a cdi configuration is specified in simulink our gui matlab program is used to run the model and view results the fully modular nature of the simulink environment allows simulation of cdi cells in context with other auxiliary non water systems for example a cdi system can be developed which draws electricity from solar panels and disposes of wastewater into a sink i e disposal method which has varying costs based on waste concentration once blocks are connected lines represent flows of species energy and cost and the program automatically converts dimensions between flows further the program mimics cdi operation in real world time meaning the plant is simulated to run each day of the year for a specified operational schedule in this way peripheries such as electricity costs can be modeled as the real time energy costs which vary throughout the day and the seasons specific to a given location in our study we use published electricity prices for the san francisco ca bay area pg and e 2019 a user manual for the cdi program which outlines best practices for using simulink and the gui can be found in section s3 of the si fig 1 a shows how a configuration that includes waste disposal energy requirements and electrode replacement can be designed in simulink 3 2 cdi cell parameters operational parameter inputs and graphical outputs in the gui once a user has specified a cdi configuration in simulink the gui matlab program e g fig 1b can be used to specify physical cdi plant parameters such as cell resistance capacitance and volume operating conditions e g current forcing functions flow rate functions number of cycles and economic input parameters e g discount rates operation schedules capital costs once the simulation has been executed the gui program is also used to display results of the techno economic analysis including cycle performance parameters volume of clean water produced time varying concentration responses and full economic cost breakdowns in addition to the levelized cost of desalinated water users can run standalone dynamics simulations with or without economic analysis as well as full parameter sweep batch simulations in parameter batch simulations any number of variables are specified as vectors over which they are varied the cdi program sequentially runs a simulation for each variable permutation and all relevant results are stored in a data structure for later use see section s3 6 in the si for further discussion on specifying and running parameter batch simulations in this regard the program allows preliminary sensitivity and trade off studies for any parameter of choice we use this functionality in section 4 1 to study the performance of sinusoidal flow rate operation within a parameter design space 3 3 validation of current model predictions with experimental data from lab scale experiments curves of model predicted effluent concentrations are shown in fig 1c as solid curves these predictions compare very well with experimental data of ramachandran et al 2018a shown are cases of sinusoidal voltage forcing at frequencies of 0 9 2 5 and 8 8 mhz and constant feed flow rate cell parameters reported by ramachandran et al 2018a were used to specify the physical cdi inputs and are consistent with those shown in fig 1b see section s1 in the si for a complete list of cell parameters and detailed discussion of operational conditions and assumptions users are warned by the program if an operating scheme causes certain model assumptions to be violated these include conditions for the well mixed reactor realistic constant resistance and capacitance values and assumptions regarding cycle efficiencies see sections s1 and s3 3 in the si for more information on running the program within the model s limits 4 results discussion we here present example applications of our validated cdi program to a study of cdi effluent salt concentration in response to complex forcing functions and a techno economic analysis of electrode cost relative to total levelized water costs table 1 presents a complete list of the cdi plant parameters used for these and all subsequent modeling studies presented in this paper unless otherwise specified the values are consistent with the system discussed in detail by ramachandran et al 2018a 4 1 simulations of variable flow rate and variable applied current operations we here consider a cell subject to sinusoidal input current we further consider a flow rate forcing function composed of a constant value plus a sinusoidal component with both varying amplitude and phase the sinusoidal current forcing is described by i t δ i sin ω t where δ i 70 a m 2 and the sinusoidal flow rate is described by q t q d c δ q sin ω t φ where q d c 4 l m 2 min 1 fig 2 a and b respectively show plots of effluent concentration versus normalized time t t c y c for several values of magnitude δ q q d c 0 0 5 1 and phase φ 0 π 2 π rads drawing from ramachandran et al 2018a we chose a current and flow rate frequency ω 0 026 rad s that corresponds to resonance for the constant dc flow rate component ω r e s 1 τ r c where here τ q d c 16 1 s we note that there is no known cdi resonance criterion for the present case of time varying flow rate fig 2a isolates the effect of flow rate amplitude on desalination depth higher flow rate amplitude in phase with the desalination period implies less desalination sacrificing salt removal for increased instantaneous productivity conversely lower flow rate amplitude in phase with regeneration results in higher brine concentration the latter sacrifices instantaneous productivity for improved water recovery ratio the combined effects of in phase flow rate amplitude are therefore higher water recovery ratio high productivity and lower energy consumption per volume of produced water at the expense of a low cycle averaged desalination depth fig 2b isolates the effect of phase change for a single case of flow rate amplitude δ q q d c 0 5 we observe that instantaneous concentration deviation from the inlet value increases as current to flow rate phase difference increases from 0 to π radians thus a low high flow rate in phase with desalination regeneration decreases increases instantaneous output concentration this has a significant effect on all of the figures of merit discussed in section 2 2 overall increasingly out of phase flow rate results in improved δ c but the relatively low flow rates during desalination result in decreased wr p and e v fig 3 presents a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of flow rate sinusoid amplitude and phase on the aforementioned figures of merit for cdi the axes of the contours of fig 3 span all values of δ q q d c 0 1 and φ 0 π radians plots a through d show quantitative predictions of performance measures wr δ c p and e v respectively note that φ is limited to π radians as the performance parameters are identically mirrored about the φ π axis regions marked as not feasible represent operating conditions where effluent concentration approaches 0 mm during desalination complete desalination or applied voltage exceeds 1 2 v faradaic limits of water splitting violating the assumptions of the model fig 3 shows clearly the tradeoff between water recovery productivity and energy consumption on one hand and desalination depth on the other as before low instantaneous flow rate in phase with the regeneration period favors higher concentration duration desalination and higher brine concentration collectively favoring wr p and e v in contrast the highest desalination depth is achieved with a sinusoidal flow rate that is a half period out of phase with current this minimizes the volume of produced desalted water note the tradeoff between desalination depth and the other parameters also holds for a constant value of flow rate we note that these results and insights are limited to the case of both sinusoidal flow rate and current we hypothesize that a much more generalized study of these tradeoffs would require considerations of arbitrary shape as well as phase we suggest that such optimizations may significantly benefit from the simulation program presented here 4 2 techno economic analysis assessing fractional impact of electrode replacement cost to overall levelized water cost we here present an example techno economic analysis considering the contribution of electrode cost to the net levelized cost of water produced by cdi we will also consider several criteria for electrode aging and replacement cdi electrode costs are a significant fraction of total cost in cdi and so we will consider them a special category of cost apart from more typical capital or operational costs we first consider electrode costs ranging from 1 m 2 to 10 m 2 the 10 m 2 value is closest to what is currently attainable for complete electrodes carbon binder conductivity additive in industry hand et al 2019a while the lower values represent future possible values given advancements in fabrication and increase of the scale of production we will term capital costs as non electrode but cdi specific construction of plant costs frames housing current collectors etc we conservatively increase capital costs by a factor of 1 6 to account for additional up front expenditures siting infrastructure development pumps electronics etc following traditional water technology analyses malek et al 1996 bartholomew et al 2018 operational costs are comprised of electricity brine disposal and labor maintenance we model electricity costs after rates published for small to medium businesses by the california pacific gas electric company pg and e 2019 and we account for hourly and seasonal variations traditional cdi techno economic analyses typically neglect brine disposal costs due to the low salinity feeds commonly associated with cdi however for completeness we will include disposal costs in this analysis for brackish water desalination with c 0 20 mm and an average brine concentration of 29 6 mm δ c 9 6 mm we assume a brine disposal cost of 0 02 m 3 labor is estimated to be 3 of the total capital cost of the plant following analyses of comparable water technologies vince et al 2008 bartholomew et al 2018 hand et al 2019a further we consider a cdi plant which has a 5 year lifespan and operates 90 of the time each year table 2 lists all economic parameters and unit costs used in the following analysis fig 4 plots fractions of costs which comprise overall water desalination costs for cdi predicted by our model we vary the electrode unit cost to be a 10 m 2 b 6 m 2 and c 1 m 2 each and consider electrode replacement frequencies of 1 3 and 5 replacements over the plant s 5 year lifetime displayed above each bar is the resulting levelized cost of water for each condition for this study we consider a constant flow rate sinusoidal current at system resonance ω r e s 1 τ r c operating condition with c 0 20 mm δ c 9 6 mm wr 0 5 p 6 l m 2 h 1 and e v 0 32 kwh m 3 as expected the predicted data of fig 4 indicate that the relative importance of electrode costs increasingly dominate levelized costs as electrode replacement frequency is increased for example in fig 4a electrodes a 10 m 2 electrode cost and other capital costs comprise roughly 70 of the 0 38 m 3 levelized cost for one replacement per year on the other hand fig 4c a 1 m 2 electrode cost suggests these constitute only 40 of the 0 16 m 3 lc for a replacement every 5 y in comparison to previous studies we note yu et al 2016 assumed a 1 y electrode lifetime while hand et al 2019a reported a levelized cost of roughly 0 38 m 3 for non membrane cdi with an electrode and overall plant lifetime of 2 y the data presented here strongly suggest that existing cdi economics are likely dominated by capital and material costs versus energy and other operational costs and so improvements in electrode aging can have significant impact on cdi water levelized cost note also that the data of fig 4 is independent of the mechanism by which electrodes age only the resulting replacement frequency we will next explore specific aging mechanisms 4 3 techno economic analysis evaluating the effect of electrode aging and replacement criteria on the overall levelized cost of water we here hypothesize two practically relevant mechanisms that drive electrode aging and then formulate these mechanisms into our techno economic model in addition to aging criteria this analysis explores the effects of cdi operation and electrode cost on levelized cost we emphasize that while this analysis focuses on resulting levelized cost the calculations are applicable to the study of the effects cdi operational modes have on electrode replacement costs for simplicity we neglect fouling but note that fouling and feedwater composition can be a significant electrode aging mechanism liu et al 2019 suggested fouling can be mitigated through upstream water conditioning and electrode cleaning the first hypothesized criterion is an electrode lifetime based on the number of electrical charge discharge cycles this hypothesis is simple and could be coded into the controller of a cdi cell for the second criterion we posit that electrode aging is governed by the cumulative time of operation above a certain value of applied total cell potential this hypothesis is informed by the studies of cohen et al 2013 and lu et al 2017 which showed that operation at reduced cell potentials below 0 7 v for the former and 0 8 v for the latter significantly delayed electrode oxidation when compared to operation at higher and more commonly used applied potentials e g 1 2 v also experiments performed by cohen et al 2015 implemented an alternating polarization operation mode between 0 9 v and showed retained adsorption concentration and cell stability after 816 h of continuous operation we thus hypothesize that electrode degradation is related to the time spent at higher potentials for the present study we chose operation time spent at cell potential above a threshold of 0 8 v as one aging and electrode replacement criterion in future work we hope to study the effects of electrode oxidation and the related issue of the effects of surface functionalities on electrode aging li et al 2020 in section s4 of the si we present a third hypothesis for electrode aging which considers only operational time electrodes replaced every 1 y this type of replacement criterion has been used in cdi techno economic and lifecycle analyses as a baseline estimate yu et al 2016 hand et al 2019a we stress that the simulation and techno economic analysis tool described here is useful in making comparisons among these and other aging criteria on the levelized cost of water fig 5 a and b shows plots of levelized cost versus p and δ c subject to the two aforementioned electrode aging hypotheses fig 5a shows levelized cost for electrodes replaced every 500 h of operation above a voltage threshold of 0 8 v while fig 5b shows costs for electrodes replaced every 24 000 cycles the value of 500 h is encapsulated by the study performed by cohen et al 2015 and the value of 24 000 cycles was selected to result in electrode replacement frequencies from 0 to 6 per plant lifetime encapsulating the analysis of fig 4 note all related parameters can be specified by the user as before we consider a constant flow rate resonant sinusoidal current operating condition with c 0 20 mm however we here expand the operational regime to include desalination depths of δ c 3 11 mm and productivities p 3 18 l m 2 h 1 areas marked as not feasible represent operational regimes where a given desalination depth is not attainable for a fixed productivity with a voltage window below 1 2 v in fig 5c we reduce the unit cost of electrodes to 1 m 2 a regime where levelized cost is more strongly affected by operational costs for the electrode aging criterion based on time spent above 0 8 v fig 5a shows that lc is determined by both desalination depth and water throughput we see that lc decreases monotonically with decreasing δ c demand for δ c above about 8 mm increases lc and strongly limits the feasible p range interestingly a demand for increased productivity can either decrease or increase lc this reflects the competing influence between electrode replacement and total water production for example for δ c at values between about 3 and 5 mm lc exhibits a local minimum for increasing p e g a minimum value of 0 13 m 3 for δ c 4 mm and p 8 l m 2 h 1 initially increases in p drive for constant δ c lower levelized cost past the local minimum lc increases as increases in productivity drive more frequent electrode replacements since operation requires higher peak voltages to maintain the constant δ c fig 5b shows lc for the second criterion associated with 24 000 cell cycles and a 10 m 2 electrode cost within the feasible region the cycle based electrode replacement criterion is exactly independent of the voltage values imposed in the cell and energy costs are approximately negligible that is a higher operational voltage window required for increased desalination depth at a given productivity does not decrease electrode life hence the electrode replacement cost is high enough that lc is driven by a ratio of the present worth of capital costs including electrodes and the amount of water produced and so lc is approximately inversely proportional to p in fig 5c the electrode cost is sufficiently low 1 m 2 such that energy costs are again important to lc here lc depends more strongly on both p and δ c and the lowest lc of all cases is achievable for low δ c lowering energy costs and high productivity increasing amount of produced water lc is an important metric in comparing among economic feasibility of various desalination technologies for example lc for electrodialysis ed has been reported at about 0 60 m 3 for brackish feed water desalination younos 2009 mezher et al 2011 reported values for ro systems applied to brackish water desalination range from about 0 20 to 0 70 m 3 younos 2009 mezher et al 2011 of course such comparisons are not easily made as these lcs depend on operating conditions such as initial concentration decreases in concentration and throughput as well as operating modes for example energy consumption an important contributor to lc by ed is reported to be a function of amount and rate of salt removed turek 2003 also ro energy consumption also depends on initial salinity as well as flow rate therefore throughput and membrane type which in turn influences pumping pressure lee et al 2011 li 2011 further ro is typically applied to higher salinity feeds and achieves higher desalination depths of course membrane and or electrode replacement costs also significantly affect the lcs of these technologies accurate and more comprehensive determination of lc as a function of operation for cdi motivates further work in developing and applying techno economic tools 5 summary and conclusions we presented a newly developed open source cdi analysis and design program the tool is built as an installable matlab gui program matlab s simulink environment is used to design and build cdi systems and the gui is used to run the simulink model and view results included are tools for physics based modeling of one or more cdi cells and coupled techno economic models to compute economic parameters such as levelized cost of water the program allows for coupling of one or more cdi cells to related systems such as power conversion and disposal costs and the techno economic analysis converts among various dimensional streams of species e g feed desalted water and brine energy and cost the physics based model was validated by quantitative comparison to experimental cdi data from laboratory experiments we demonstrated the program in performing two distinct cdi design and analysis investigations the physics based program was used to simulate cdi dynamics subject to sinusoidal flow rate operation the investigation analyzed the effects of varying flow rate amplitude and phase offset with respect to a sinusoidal current electrical input including independent variation of flow rate sinusoid amplitude and phase on water recovery ratio productivity volumetric energy consumption and volume averaged desalination depth we observed desalination depth is achieved at the expense of the other three figures of merit similar to the case of constant flow rate the model enables analyses of arbitrary flow rate and electric forcing in cdi and may aid in development of new and optimized cdi operation strategies as relevant techno economic analyses we explored electrode lifetime and replacement criteria on levelized cost of produced water the analyses suggest that electrode costs in cdi are currently a greater contributor than operational costs e g electrical energy input to overall levelized cost of produced water the model was also used to study the effects of three plausible electrode aging mechanisms on the levelized cost of water operation time above 0 8 v to account for electrode oxidation versus simple number of cycles operation in the si we presented operational time as a third aging criterion our study highlights the importance of further research toward identifying electrode aging mechanisms and development of operational methods which extend electrode lifetimes of course decreasing of electrode costs remains an important challenge in cdi declaration of competing interest the

17776,human mitochondrial dna provides a promising target for fecal source tracking because it is unique and intrinsic to humans we developed a taqman chemistry assay hcytb484 targeting the cytochrome b gene of the human mitochondrial genome on a droplet digital pcr ddpcr platform and compared the performance of hcytb484 with the hf183 bacr287 assay a widely used assay targeting human associated bacteroides for both assays we defined the analytical limit of detection and analytical lower limit of quantification using frequency of detection and imprecision goals respectively we then established these analytical limits using empirical ddpcr data presenting a novel approach to determining the analytical lower limit of quantification we evaluated assay sensitivity using individual human feces from us bangladesh and mozambique and evaluated assay specificity using cow pig chicken and goat samples collected from the us to compare assay performance across a range of thresholds we utilized receiver operating characteristic curves the hcytb484 marker was detected and quantifiable in 100 of the human feces from the 3 geographical distant regions whereas the hf183 bacr287 marker was detectable and quantifiable in 51 and 31 respectively of human feces samples the hcytb484 marker also was more specific 97 having fewer detections in pig chicken and goat samples than the hf183 bacr287 marker 80 the higher performance of the hcytb484 marker in individual feces from geographically distant regions is desirable in the detection of fecal pollution from sources to which fewer individuals contribute such as the non sewered forms of sanitation e g pit latrines and septic tanks that serve most of earth s population and carry the highest risk of exposure to fecal oral pathogens graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal source tracking human mtdna digital droplet pcr analytical limit of detection analytical lower limit of quantification 1 introduction within the fecal source tracking fst field the development of a human specific culture and library independent marker has been a goal for many research efforts due to its potential to be an ideal rapid and broadly applicable method boehm et al 2013 green et al 2014 stachler et al 2017 u s environmental protection agency epa 2019 the challenge that remains is the development of such a marker that also retains high sensitivity and specificity across geographies as classification methods fst markers are frequently evaluated on sensitivity and specificity performances sensitivity is calculated by the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives specificity is calculated by the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives studies have demonstrated variable specificity for human associated fst markers targeting microbial dna across varying geographies boehm et al 2013 harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 reischer et al 2013 possibly influenced by variations in the human gut microbiome yatsunenko et al 2012 and human animal interactions harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 microbial dna markers have also exhibited variable sensitivity across different scales of fecal pollution around the globe high sensitivity in wastewater collected from sewage networks but lower sensitivity in human fecal samples mayer et al 2018 while much effort has been made towards the development of human specific culture and library independent markers the variable performance of such microbial markers across various settings necessitates their local validation in the intended setting prior to use to ensure that the fecal signal can be unambiguously attributed to a source harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 most of the global human population does not have access to sewered sanitation an estimated 56 of households globally have unsewered sanitation facilities and 12 of households globally have no sanitation facility berendes et al 2018 furthermore disproportionalities in sanitation exist the same geographic regions that contain the lowest rates of sewered households are where most of the human population live and where the most human feces are produced berendes et al 2018 this means that for much of the world s population enteric pathogen exposure risks are related to sludges and other non sewered fecal waste streams that are composites of feces from relatively few individuals this reality underscores the need for markers to serve in situations where exposure to fecal sludge is more relevant than exposure to wastewater collected through a sewerage network in these settings markers that are widely distributed across humans are desired because with fewer individuals contributing to fecal sludges the presence of the marker in each individual is crucial because mtdna methods directly target conserved host dna sequences present in individuals across the species instead of host associated markers the link between host and fecal indicator microbe is not relevant and therefore mtdna methods may not require the same extent of validation as emphasized for host associated microbial dna markers additionally because mtdna is universally distributed across human individuals mtdna methods may offer superior sensitivity in individual feces and in scenarios where relatively fewer individuals contribute to the fecal pollution previously published quantitative pcr qpcr human mtdna based assays for fst have exhibited high specificity in the us caldwell et al 2007 schill and mathes 2008 and in china he et al 2016 however concentrations of mtdna based markers are typically found in lower numbers in sewage samples and in anthropogenically impacted water environments relative to microbial based fst markers he et al 2016 schill and mathes 2008 stea et al 2015 villemur et al 2015 because mtdna based markers are typically found at lower concentrations than microbial based markers we utilized the droplet digital pcr ddpcr platform for its improved reproducibility in lower concentrations as a tool for fst ddpcr has demonstrated several appealing characteristics when compared to qpcr including greater tolerance of pcr inhibitors cao et al 2015 reduced quantification bias when duplexing assays cao et al 2015 and improved reproducibility over qpcr hindson et al 2013 strain et al 2013 in this study we designed a novel assay hcytb484 targeting human mtdna on the ddpcr platform with three design goals 1 specificity to human mtdna 2 optimization for ddpcr conditions and 3 avoidance of identified polymorphisms for a geographical stable assay we then characterized the analytical performance of hcytb484 alongside another fst assay the hf183 bacr287 assay a high performing assay targeting human associated bacteroides in parallel on ddpcr the hf183 bacr287 assay green et al 2014 is an improved version of a widely studied microbial dna assay haugland et al 2010 for both assays we defined detection and quantification goals based on frequency of detection and imprecision respectively using these goals we established the limit above which samples are considered positive for the target referred to as the analytical limit of detection alod and the limit above which samples are considered quantifiable for the target referred to as the analytical lower limit of quantification alloq to investigate the geographic variability of the two assays in situations where few individuals contribute to the fecal pollution we tested the assays on human feces obtained from the us bangladesh and mozambique we then compared sensitivity and specificity performances between the two assays in fecal samples by using receiver operating characteristic roc curves to detail assay performance beyond scalar values of sensitivity and specificity we hypothesized that by targeting a widely conserved host mtdna marker we would develop an assay that is more sensitive in human feces from various geographies than the microbial based hf183 bacr287 assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 assay design we designed our assay within the cytochrome b gene because this region has been used to differentiate between species even in short fragments 358 parson et al 2000 and 148 bp lopez oceja et al 2016 we downloaded complete cytochrome b sequences from genbank clark et al 2016 see supplementary materials for accession numbers and produced a consensus sequence for human pig cow goat chicken dog rat and white tailed deer using jalview version 2 10 3 from the consensus sequences we performed an alignment of the consensus sequences using mafft l ins i algorithm version 7 394 we selected a region with high differentiation between species guided by the species variable regions identified in lopez oceja et al 2016 and then entered that region into the integrated dna technologies inc idt coralville ia us primerquest online tool along with ddpcr conditions specified by bio rad primer concentration at 900 nm probe concentration at 250 nm concentration of divalent cations at 3 8 mm and the concentration of dntps at 0 8 mm to design forward primer reverse primer and probe sequences once primerquest output a set of designed assays we searched the idt designed primer and probe sequences against human and non human mtdna sequences downloaded from genbank to evaluate the in silico specificity of the sequences using the ncbi blast tool camacho et al 2009 when searching against all human mtdna sequences downloaded from ncbi at the time march 2018 we looked for oligonucleotide sequences that had the most returns with 100 identity and full coverage across the oligonucleotide sequence when searching against downloaded non human mtdna sequences we looked for primer sequences that had the fewest returns with the lowest percent identity and emphasized a lack of identity at the 3 end of the primers to maximize specificity to humans wright et al 2014 because mismatches between template and oligonucleotides can result in inefficiencies in pcr letowski et al 2004 stadhouders et al 2010 we identified two frequently described polymorphisms within the region we were designing in the 15301 and 15326 positions ablimit et al 2013 hwa et al 2010 lee et al 2002 relative to the revised cambridge reference sequence rcrs bandelt et al 2014 and avoided these two polymorphisms during the primer and probe design process 2 2 samples to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay we used both human fecal samples and human wastewater samples we obtained feces samples from the us bangladesh and mozambique and obtained municipal wastewater samples from the atlanta ga us metropolitan region including 6 primary influent samples and 1 primary effluent sample from plants ranging in treatment capacity from 16 to 90 million gallons per day 73 410 million liters per day to test specificity against non human sources we collected fecal samples from 22 cows 35 pigs and 22 goats as well as 8 samples of chicken litter from farms located in north georgia to test the environmental application of hcytb484 we collected freshwater samples from the chattahoochee river atlanta ga us at 5 different sampling locations on 3 different days starting approximately 5 km downstream of buford dam and continuing downstream in approximately 25 km increments through the atlanta metropolitan area see fig s4 for a map of sampling locations using vacuum filtration we filtered each wastewater and freshwater sample in duplicate with volumes ranging from 25 to 50 ml for wastewater and 500 750 ml for freshwater onto sterilized 0 22 μm pore size 47 mm diameter asymmetrical polyethersulfone membrane filters milliporesigma burlington ma us we then stored all filters and samples at 80 c until nucleic acid extraction see supplementary materials for more details 2 3 nucleic acid extractions we extracted the human feces samples from the us using the qiagen hilden germany powersoil kit according to the manufacturer s protocol and stored eluted dna in buffer c6 at 20 c until analysis we extracted human feces samples from mozambique and bangladesh as well as the chicken litter samples using the qiagen qiaamp 96 powerfecal qiacube ht kit on the qiacube ht platform and stored eluted dna in buffer ate at 80 c in low retention microcentrifuge tubes until analysis we extracted cow pig and goat feces samples using the qiagen powersoil kit according to the human gut microbiome project protocol and stored eluted dna in buffer c6 at 80 c in low retention microcentrifuge tubes until analysis we extracted dna from freshwater and wastewater sample filters using the qiagen powerwater kit according to the manufacturer s protocol and stored eluted dna in buffer eb at 80 c in low retention microcentrifuge tubes until analysis we assayed all extracts with the qubit dsdna hs assay invitrogen carlsbad ca us to quantify dsdna concentration we performed extraction blanks with each set of extraction and tested each extraction blank with the qubit dsdna hs hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 assays 2 4 ddpcr 2 4 1 ddpcr experimental conditions in reporting the methods and materials for this study we referenced the minimum information for publication of quantitative digital pcr experiments guidelines huggett et al 2013 we performed our ddpcr experiments on a bio rad qx200 droplet digital pcr system in our laboratory for each ddpcr well we created a 21 μl pcr mixture containing 1x bio rad ddpcr supermix for probes primer table 1 250 nm of probe table 1 and 2 μl of template for any sample outside of the dynamic range of the qx200 system we made tenfold dilutions until we could obtain a result within the dynamic range we did not use additives in the reaction mixture or enzymatic digestion on samples we performed droplet generation using 20 μl of reaction mixture and 70 μl of bio rad droplet generation oil for probes with the bio rad qx200 droplet generator we then transferred the oil emulsion using a multichannel pipettor to a ddpcr 96 well plate after sealing the plate using the bio rad px1 pcr plate sealer with a foil pcr plate heat seal we loaded each plate onto the bio rad c1000 touch thermal cycler for each thermal cycler routine we used 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 c and 60 s at the assay specific annealing temperature annealing temperature of 58 c for hf183 bacr287 and 59 c for hcytb484 followed by a 10 min hold at 98 c with a ramp rate of 2 c s we read plates with the bio rad qx200 droplet reader set to the absolute quantification experiment setting we did not measure our partition volumes košir et al 2017 but utilized the assumed partition volume of 0 85 nl in bio rad quantasoft version 1 7 4 0917 2 4 2 ddpcr positive controls for the hf183 bacr287 assay we constructed plasmids from positive human feces samples cloned using an invitrogen carlsbad ca us topo ta cloning kit with the pcr 4 topo vector and verified the plasmid sequences using sanger sequencing genewiz south plainfield nj us prior to use in ddpcr we digested plasmids using ecori invitrogen anza restriction enzyme for the hcytb484 assay we ordered custom manufactured sequence verified synthesized dna gblock products manufactured by idt coralville ia us sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in table 1 we used the hf183 bacr287 internal amplification control iac as a gblock to assess pcr inhibition in each undiluted sample as described green et al 2014 we also monitored each no template control uv treated molecular grade water and extraction control if amplification did occur in a no template control we re ran the samples until we obtained a plate with zero positive partitions if any sample exceeded the ddpcr dynamic range we reran it with increasing ten fold dilutions until the well had a ddpcr λ mean copies per partition under 6 and was above the alloq 2 4 3 ddpcr signal the ddpcr platform discretizes a 20 μl pcr reaction into nanoliter scale reactions referred to here as partitions by emulsifying the pcr reaction within oil droplets each ddpcr well contains tens of thousands of such partitions after thermal cycling the wells the ddpcr platform reads a presence absence signal from each partition in a ddpcr well and calculates a concentration from the ratio of the number of positive partitions to the number accepted partitions the formula quantasoft version 1 7 4 0917 used to estimate the concentration of target in the original sample can be written as d d p c r c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n a w e l l l n 1 p o s i t i v e p a r t i t i o n s i n a w e l l a c c e p t e d p a r t i t i o n s i n a w e l l 1 0 85 n l 1000 n l 1 μ l from the above equation the number of positive partitions and accepted partitions represent the raw signal of the ddpcr platform the ddpcr concentration in a well represents the number of copies of the target found in the 20 μl pcr reaction we will refer to copies per ddpcr well which is the ddpcr concentration in a well described above multiplied by 20 μl due to previous experience with partitions of intermediate fluorescence on the ddpcr platform specifically in situations where primer and template were mismatched by one or two base pairs we chose to adopt a moderate approach to distinguishing between positive and negative partitions by setting the threshold midway between the peaks of the negative partitions and the positive partitions to improve discrimination against similar but not exact sequences we only accepted ddpcr results from wells with more than 10 000 accepted partitions fig s1 our mean copies per partition within each well was 2 19 we normalized marker counts in feces to ng of dsdna as measured by the qubit hs dsdna assay invitrogen carlsbad ca us to account for variability between feces consistencies kelty et al 2012 2 5 analytical limits 2 5 1 analytical limit of detection we assumed that the number of positive partitions per ddpcr well can be modeled using the poisson distribution karlin neumann and bizouarn 2018 assuming that the conditions under which each ddpcr well was prepared thermal cycled and quantified were equal such that partitions from the same template can be considered to be from the same population we modeled a poisson distribution from our observed data using maximum likelihood estimation mle because the poisson distribution originates from the exponential family it can be shown that the mle is the sample mean to assess false positive rates from known analytical blanks we assayed uv treated for 15 min molecular grade water in 94 replicates with both assays hf183 bacr287 and hcytb484 we chose to define the limit of detection as the minimum level of the analyte in a sample that will be reported as detected with 95 probability using a known positive control we used the poisson distribution to model the number of positive partitions in a ddpcr well with λ representing the mean number of positive partitions in a well needed to observe k positive partitions in a well to determine the level of analyte λ that would be detected 95 of the time in a poisson process we set the poisson probability mass function equal to a probability of 0 05 for observing no positive partitions in a well k 0 p k positive partitions in a well e λ λ k k p 0 positive partitions in a well e λ λ 0 0 0 05 e λ 0 05 ln e λ ln 0 05 λ 3 for both assays we serial diluted positive controls to approximately 3 positive partitions per well and then assayed the dilution for 46 ddpcr replicates 2 5 2 analytical lower limit of quantification we chose to define the analytical lower limit of quantification as the minimum level of analyte in a sample that will result in a coefficient of variation cv of 25 using a known positive control the target cv of 25 or less is a commonly used alloq goal for ddpcr platforms bogožalec košir et al 2019 milosevic et al 2018 the cv also referred to as the relative standard deviation rsd is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation σ to the mean μ cv σ μ because repeated assaying of various target concentrations may be required to meet a specific cv target we sought to understand how the assay imprecision changes with level of concentration to allow us to interpolate estimates of the level of concentrations needed to meet our target cv we assayed a variety of concentration levels calculated cv values and fitted linear regressions to log10 transformed values of cv and copies per ddpcr well copies per 20 μl well the regressions fitted for each assay used in this study incorporate some intraassay variability as the 4 estimates of the cv for each assay are from 3 separate serial dilutions created on different days 2 6 statistical analyses we completed all statistical analyses simulations and graphs in r version 3 6 1 3 results 3 1 analytical limit of detection while approximately 95 of analyzed blanks lacked any amplification for both assays our results showed that false positive partitions occurred at low concentrations and low rates for both assays table s1 prior to performing experiments to validate the alod we used the poisson distribution to calculate an expected value of 3 positive partitions per ddpcr well as the level of concentration within the ddpcr well that would enable us to observe at least 1 positive partition in 95 of ddpcr wells in our experiments to validate an alod of 3 positive partitions per well we achieved mean positive partitions per well of 4 54 hcytb484 and 4 83 hf183 bacr287 we compared sampling distributions from our ddpcr alod experiments with corresponding expected poisson distributions using the anderson darling test and obtained p values of 0 89 and 0 99 for the hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 assays respectively fig 1 3 2 analytical lower limit of quantification to determine the analytical lower limit of quantification alloq we defined our alloq goal as the level of concentration that would result in a coefficient of variation cv of the copies per ddpcr well equal to 25 we interpolated the level of concentration that would allow us to achieve a cv of 25 by fitting a linear regression to log10 transformed cv and log10 transformed copies per ddpcr well values fig 2 the linear regressions produced alloqs of 28 2 and 29 6 copies per ddpcr well for hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 respectively table 2 summarizes the results of our analytical limit experiments and demonstrates how we classified samples in this study as positive or negative 3 3 sensitivity and specificity results in feces samples we tested the sensitivity and specificity of hf183 bacr287 and hcytb484 on feces samples from humans cows pigs chickens and goats table 3 for any non target amplification we confirmed the presence of the expected size of pcr product on endpoint pcr with gel electrophoresis we then calculated sensitivity and specificity values for these samples over a range of thresholds table 4 by calculating sensitivity and specificity for a range of thresholds we demonstrate how assay performance can vary based on threshold definition as the threshold or the level of concentration at which a well is declared as positive is increased from alod to the alloq the hcytb484 assay exhibited an increase in specificity from 97 to 100 while sensitivity remained constant at 100 across the same threshold levels the hf183 bacr287 assay exhibited an increase in specificity from 80 to 92 but with a tradeoff in sensitivity decreasing from 51 to 31 we then plotted this dependency as a receiver operating characteristic roc curve fig 3 3 4 wastewater and freshwater samples we quantified the hcytb484 marker at higher levels of concentration than the hf183 bacr287 marker in human feces but found hf183 bacr287 at higher levels of concentration than hcytb484 in municipal wastewater samples fig 3 in freshwater samples we were able to quantify both markers at increasing levels of loading copies per ml normalized to ml per second of discharge with increasing drainage contribution from urban development fig 5 a and b however we typically quantified the hf183 bacr287 marker at higher levels than those of the hcytb484 marker fig 5c 4 discussion 4 1 analytical limit of detection it is possible that the hcytb484 assay exhibited slightly higher rates of false positives because the assay targets human mtdna there are several opportunities for human mtdna to contaminate the reaction mixture due to the series of manipulations required for ddpcr combining the results from the analytical blanks with the false positive rates from non human feces we show that very low concentrations below the alod of false positives occur at low rates when using the hcytb484 assay and consequently we recommend that the threshold be set at or above the alod and care be taken to avoid contamination of human mtdna we have found that uv treatment of tubes reaction wells and ddpcr droplet cartridges as well as the use of a 10 bleach solution to disinfect gloves pipettes and contact surfaces after any potential human contact or contamination have aided in successfully avoiding contamination of human mtdna during sample processing and analysis the sampling distributions of positive partitions per ddpcr well in our alod ddpcr experiments suggest that the poisson distribution may be a representative theoretical model for the number of positive partitions per ddpcr well we note that it is a theoretical stochastic model and does not account for potential biases introduced by external sources of variability karlin neumann and bizouarn 2018 such as the operator or equipment using our findings at the mean positive partitions per well of 4 54 and 4 83 we extrapolated our alod down to a mean of 3 positive partitions per well using the poisson distribution and our detection goal of a theoretical 95 probability in addition to modeling the probability of a detection for an alod it is important to consider the likelihood of an observation if a single ddpcr well contained 3 positive partitions one could calculate the likelihood of this observation for a range of λ values finding that the most likely λ that would produce a well of 3 positive partitions would be a λ of 3 recognition of the likelihood of an observation is key because a single ddpcr well of a sample is just one observation drawn from a distribution that exists for the sample thus an alod that maximizes the likelihood is informative this alod of 3 has been used in both qpcr bustin et al 2009 and ddpcr applications cao et al 2015 4 2 estimation of the coefficient of variation and mean positive partitions per well to better understand how values of the cv change as a function of the level of concentration we sought to estimate the true values of the cv by using a relatively large number of replicates n 46 although the cv of the target concentration is widely used as an imprecision goal when determining the ddpcr alloq there is no consensus on the number of replicates with 5 20 replicates being used bogožalec košir et al 2019 dobnik et al 2015 milosevic et al 2018 in the absence of agreement on the number of replicates we used many replicates in combination with cumulative moving plots to assess our estimation of the mean positive partitions per well and the concentration cv figs s2 and s3 what is of interest is if the cumulative moving parameter converges before the total number of replicates and remains stable fig s3h the cumulative moving mean positive partitions per well and cumulative moving concentration cv converged before the total number of replicates in all cases indicating that the use of 46 replicates may provide useful estimates of the true values 4 3 analytical lower limit of quantification we chose to set our alloq to the level of concentration that would result in a coefficient of variation cv of 25 bogožalec košir et al 2019 milosevic et al 2018 while alloqs are often set using less than or equal to a cv target for example 25 the difficulty in finding the level of concentration that results in a specific cv can result in setting alloqs by satisfying the less than 25 rather than the equal to 25 condition however this can cause variation in alloqs set using the same cv target hypothetically alloqs that have been set using levels of concentrations that resulted in a cv of 23 versus a cv of 13 are both valid for an alloq based on 25 the difficulty in repeatedly trying different levels of concentration to achieve a cv of 25 is a deterrent to attempts to satisfy the equal to condition we attempted to develop a standardized approach by interpolating an alloq using a regression fitted to observed cv and concentration values referred to as a variance function or imprecision profile while variance functions for ddpcr assays have not yet been widely explored various forms of variance functions have been used in diverse fields davidian and carroll 1987 sadler 2016 variance functions can have many forms berweger et al 1998 if the distribution of positive partitions per ddpcr well can be modeled by the poisson distribution the variance of the calculated copies per ddpcr well see section 2 4 3 is dependent on the variance of the number of positive partitions per ddpcr well for a poisson distribution the variance is equal to the expected value thus we expect the cv to monotonically scale with increasing number of positive partitions per ddpcr well because the expected value of the poisson distribution is a scale parameter with this in mind we plotted the cv and mean copies per ddpcr well on a log10 log10 plot observing a linear relationship between data points fig 2 we also plotted this relationship using data published by others bogožalec košir et al 2019 milosevic et al 2018 and observed similar linear relationships despite varying numbers of replicates used to estimate cv values fig 2 overall the imprecision profiles are similar interestingly the imprecision profile for the hf183 bacr287 assay multiplexed with an iac was similar to the hcytb484 simplex assay fig 2 which is supported by the relative absence of a quantification bias when duplexing on the ddpcr platform cao et al 2015 because of the agreement between linear regressions for our data and data published by others we hypothesize that assays implemented on the bio rad qx100 qx200 ddpcr platforms may share similar imprecision profiles this is supported by the fact that ddpcr calculates a concentration from direct counts of many endpoint pcr results eliminating some variability associated with individual assay performance an interpolation approach using an imprecision profile to determining an alloq can be helpful in allowing operators to set alloqs in a more standardized approach by providing a more precise estimation of the level of concentration that satisfies the alloq definition rather than assaying various levels of concentration in attempts to satisfy the condition of less than or equal to target cv the combination of relatively high values of r 2 and low p values fig 2 leads us to believe that a linear regression fitted to log10 transformed cv values and log10 transformed copies per ddpcr well is a potential model for the imprecision profile of a variety of assays on the bio rad qx100 qx200 ddpcr platforms for the range of copies per ddpcr well investigated in this study further research investigating more models assays and levels of concentration across different research groups performing ddpcr is warranted 4 4 comparing marker performance we quantified the hcytb484 marker on ddpcr at greater concentrations copies 100 ml of wastewater in both human feces and wastewater than previously published taqman human mtdna assays on qpcr caldwell et al 2007 schill and mathes 2008 however we still quantified the hcytb484 marker at lower concentrations than those of the hf183 bacr287 marker in wastewater fig 4 in the freshwater samples we observed the expected increasing levels of loading of the hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 markers with increasing drainage contribution from urban development fig 5a and b the two markers also had strong correlation with each other in freshwater samples spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0 85 with the hf183 bacr287 marker typically at higher levels of loadings fig 5c roc curves are a useful method of comparing detailed classifier performance because they communicate the dependency of sensitivity and specificity on threshold fawcett 2006 morrison et al 2003 in some cases different thresholds for declaring a sample as positive can result in dramatically different sensitivity and specificity performances being calculated layton et al 2013 by showing how sensitivity and specificity vary with threshold roc curves communicate detailed performance characteristics crucial to selecting a threshold facilitating standardization of the implementation of assays in our roc curves we show that the hcytb484 specificity dramatically increases when the threshold is moved from no amplification to the alod and has 100 specificity at the alloq fig 3 this communicates that although the hcytb484 assay can exhibit low levels of false positives these false positives can be largely avoided by using the alod or alloq as the threshold with the alloq offering a very high specificity performance compared to the hf183 bacr287 marker the hcytb484 marker maintains higher sensitivity in human feces at all levels of threshold table 4 through the roc curve we demonstrate the hcytb484 marker to be widely distributed in individual human feces in concentrations above the alloq suggesting that the hcytb484 marker is potentially reliable and useful in detecting human fecal sludges and other concentrated fecal waste streams where fewer individuals contribute to the waste such matrices are the most common form of fecal wastes globally where risks of exposure are highest berendes et al 2018 because a marker with all of the ideal fst characteristics hagedorn et al 2011 has proved to be elusive toolbox approaches using multiple methods may be useful recognizing that the strengths of one marker can complement the weaknesses of another marker boehm et al 2013 harwood et al 2014 in this study we developed a human mtdna ddpcr assay hcytb484 and compared its performance characteristics with the hf183 bacr287 marker using roc curves showing how roc curves can be used for detailed comparisons of assay performance considering the recommendations for validation studies of microbial fst markers in unproven settings before their use harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 aspects of mtdna fst methods such as the direct targeting of host dna and the wide distribution of mtdna markers throughout diverse individuals illuminate mtdna methods as a potentially useful set of tools in the fst toolbox 4 5 further considerations indeed the use of human mtdna as a fecal source tracking marker is a departure from the traditional paradigm of using microbial fecal indicators as demonstrated by zimmerman et al 2014 human mtdna was found in each laundry graywater sample at consistent levels of concentration while the human associated bacteroides marker used was not despite the mean concentrations of both markers remaining similar we note that the use of human mtdna as an fst marker will require more studies to enable the interpretation of this marker for example because human mtdna is found in cells not present in fecal matter such assays can amplify human mtdna from non fecal origins human mtdna marker copies in laundry greywater zimmerman et al 2014 was orders of magnitude lower those found in wastewater caldwell et al 2007 schill and mathes 2008 suggesting that the level of concentration in the sample may serve as an indicator for non fecal versus fecal contamination carry over signals resulting from non human animals consuming human fecal matter are also possible as human consumption of beef has resulted in beef mtdna signal in human feces caldwell et al 2007 how carry over human mtdna signal is influenced by ingestion of human fecal matter by non human animals is a concern in areas where domestic animals are routinely exposed to environments contaminated with human feces harris et al 2016 and in unsafe management of human feces disparately prevalent in low income settings berendes et al 2018 human mtdna markers have also been shown to persist in freshwater for relatively longer than hf183 based markers he et al 2015 these aspects of human mtdna may make it a more conservative marker that correlates well with the presence of human activity and acts as a relatively persistent indicator of fecal pollution questions that are pertinent to the use of human mtdna as an fst marker in environmental media need more studies such as typical concentrations in a variety of fecal and nonfecal samples relative persistence in environmental media cellular origins of fecal mtdna relationship with pathogen fate and transport in environmental media and relationship with risk once human mtdna as a marker of human fecal contamination has been better characterized human mtdna as an unambiguous indicator of human influence may complement other microbial based fst markers that have been limited in their source specificity mayer et al 2018 4 6 limitations several limitations qualify the results of this study our specificity testing was limited to cows pigs chickens and goats from the us to test specificity in this study although previous studies have shown human mtdna to be highly specific to human feces caldwell et al 2007 he et al 2016 schill and mathes 2008 further specificity testing including various species of relevance to other geographies such as avian and non cattle ruminant species are useful for further assessment while our alod experiments show agreement between theoretical calculations and observed ddpcr experiments our use of the poisson distribution to calculate our alod represents a theoretical alod that does not account for biases induced by the operator or equipment interpolation approaches to the determination of alloq are helpful in that they may provide a standardized approach however because the imprecision profiles of ddpcr platforms have not been widely studied the selection of a model for imprecision profile is not well guided by the literature our choice of a linear regression on log10 transformed values of both cv and the copies per ddpcr well was guided by the relationship between the expected value and variance for a poisson distribution simulating the positive partitions per ddpcr well 5 conclusions we present a novel taqman chemistry assay for the ddpcr platform targeting human mtdna hcytb484 and compared it with the hf183 bacr287 on ddpcr we defined and established analytical limits for hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 presenting novel empirical evidence to validate the analytical limit of detection and a novel approach to the determination of analytical lower limit of quantification the hcytb484 assay was detected and quantifiable in 100 of human feces samples from the us mozambique and bangladesh whereas hf183 bacr287 was detected in only 51 the hcytb484 displayed higher specificity performance in pig chicken and goat samples but lower specificity in cow samples using a receiver operating characteristic curve can provide valuable comparisons between assays and

17776,human mitochondrial dna provides a promising target for fecal source tracking because it is unique and intrinsic to humans we developed a taqman chemistry assay hcytb484 targeting the cytochrome b gene of the human mitochondrial genome on a droplet digital pcr ddpcr platform and compared the performance of hcytb484 with the hf183 bacr287 assay a widely used assay targeting human associated bacteroides for both assays we defined the analytical limit of detection and analytical lower limit of quantification using frequency of detection and imprecision goals respectively we then established these analytical limits using empirical ddpcr data presenting a novel approach to determining the analytical lower limit of quantification we evaluated assay sensitivity using individual human feces from us bangladesh and mozambique and evaluated assay specificity using cow pig chicken and goat samples collected from the us to compare assay performance across a range of thresholds we utilized receiver operating characteristic curves the hcytb484 marker was detected and quantifiable in 100 of the human feces from the 3 geographical distant regions whereas the hf183 bacr287 marker was detectable and quantifiable in 51 and 31 respectively of human feces samples the hcytb484 marker also was more specific 97 having fewer detections in pig chicken and goat samples than the hf183 bacr287 marker 80 the higher performance of the hcytb484 marker in individual feces from geographically distant regions is desirable in the detection of fecal pollution from sources to which fewer individuals contribute such as the non sewered forms of sanitation e g pit latrines and septic tanks that serve most of earth s population and carry the highest risk of exposure to fecal oral

fecal source tracking fst field the development of a human specific culture and library independent marker has been a goal for many research efforts due to its potential to be an ideal rapid and broadly applicable method boehm et al 2013 green et al 2014 stachler et al 2017 u s environmental protection agency epa 2019 the challenge that remains is the development of such a marker that also retains high sensitivity and specificity across geographies as classification methods fst markers are frequently evaluated on sensitivity and specificity performances sensitivity is calculated by the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives specificity is calculated by the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives studies have demonstrated variable specificity for human associated fst markers targeting microbial dna across varying geographies boehm et al 2013 harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 reischer et al 2013 possibly influenced by variations in the human gut microbiome yatsunenko et al 2012 and human animal interactions harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 microbial dna markers have also exhibited variable sensitivity across different scales of fecal pollution around the globe high sensitivity in wastewater collected from sewage networks but lower sensitivity in human fecal samples mayer et al 2018 while much effort has been made towards the development of human specific culture and library independent markers the variable performance of such microbial markers across various settings necessitates their local validation in the intended setting prior to use to ensure that the fecal signal can be unambiguously attributed to a source harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 most of the global human population does not have access to sewered sanitation an estimated 56 of households globally have unsewered sanitation facilities and 12 of households globally have no sanitation facility berendes et al 2018 furthermore disproportionalities in sanitation exist the same geographic regions that contain the lowest rates of sewered households are where most of the human population live and where the most human feces are produced berendes et al 2018 this means that for much of the world s population enteric pathogen exposure risks are related to sludges and other non sewered fecal waste streams that are composites of feces from relatively few individuals this reality underscores the need for markers to serve in situations where exposure to fecal sludge is more relevant than exposure to wastewater collected through a sewerage network in these settings markers that are widely distributed across humans are desired because with fewer individuals contributing to fecal sludges the presence of the marker in each individual is crucial because mtdna methods directly target conserved host dna sequences present in individuals across the species instead of host associated markers the link between host and fecal indicator microbe is not relevant and therefore mtdna methods may not require the same extent of validation as emphasized for host associated microbial dna markers additionally because mtdna is universally distributed across human individuals mtdna methods may offer superior sensitivity in individual feces and in scenarios where relatively fewer individuals contribute to the fecal pollution previously published quantitative pcr qpcr human mtdna based assays for fst have exhibited high specificity in the us caldwell et al 2007 schill and mathes 2008 and in china he et al 2016 however concentrations of mtdna based markers are typically found in lower numbers in sewage samples and in anthropogenically impacted water environments relative to microbial based fst markers he et al 2016 schill and mathes 2008 stea et al 2015 villemur et al 2015 because mtdna based markers are typically found at lower concentrations than microbial based markers we utilized the droplet digital pcr ddpcr platform for its improved reproducibility in lower concentrations as a tool for fst ddpcr has demonstrated several appealing characteristics when compared to qpcr including greater tolerance of pcr inhibitors cao et al 2015 reduced quantification bias when duplexing assays cao et al 2015 and improved reproducibility over qpcr hindson et al 2013 strain et al 2013 in this study we designed a novel assay hcytb484 targeting human mtdna on the ddpcr platform with three design goals 1 specificity to human mtdna 2 optimization for ddpcr conditions and 3 avoidance of identified polymorphisms for a geographical stable assay we then characterized the analytical performance of hcytb484 alongside another fst assay the hf183 bacr287 assay a high performing assay targeting human associated bacteroides in parallel on ddpcr the hf183 bacr287 assay green et al 2014 is an improved version of a widely studied microbial dna assay haugland et al 2010 for both assays we defined detection and quantification goals based on frequency of detection and imprecision respectively using these goals we established the limit above which samples are considered positive for the target referred to as the analytical limit of detection alod and the limit above which samples are considered quantifiable for the target referred to as the analytical lower limit of quantification alloq to investigate the geographic variability of the two assays in situations where few individuals contribute to the fecal pollution we tested the assays on human feces obtained from the us bangladesh and mozambique we then compared sensitivity and specificity performances between the two assays in fecal samples by using receiver operating characteristic roc curves to detail assay performance beyond scalar values of sensitivity and specificity we hypothesized that by targeting a widely conserved host mtdna marker we would develop an assay that is more sensitive in human feces from various geographies than the microbial based hf183 bacr287 assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 assay design we designed our assay within the cytochrome b gene because this region has been used to differentiate between species even in short fragments 358 parson et al 2000 and 148 bp lopez oceja et al 2016 we downloaded complete cytochrome b sequences from genbank clark et al 2016 see supplementary materials for accession numbers and produced a consensus sequence for human pig cow goat chicken dog rat and white tailed deer using jalview version 2 10 3 from the consensus sequences we performed an alignment of the consensus sequences using mafft l ins i algorithm version 7 394 we selected a region with high differentiation between species guided by the species variable regions identified in lopez oceja et al 2016 and then entered that region into the integrated dna technologies inc idt coralville ia us primerquest online tool along with ddpcr conditions specified by bio rad primer concentration at 900 nm probe concentration at 250 nm concentration of divalent cations at 3 8 mm and the concentration of dntps at 0 8 mm to design forward primer reverse primer and probe sequences once primerquest output a set of designed assays we searched the idt designed primer and probe sequences against human and non human mtdna sequences downloaded from genbank to evaluate the in silico specificity of the sequences using the ncbi blast tool camacho et al 2009 when searching against all human mtdna sequences downloaded from ncbi at the time march 2018 we looked for oligonucleotide sequences that had the most returns with 100 identity and full coverage across the oligonucleotide sequence when searching against downloaded non human mtdna sequences we looked for primer sequences that had the fewest returns with the lowest percent identity and emphasized a lack of identity at the 3 end of the primers to maximize specificity to humans wright et al 2014 because mismatches between template and oligonucleotides can result in inefficiencies in pcr letowski et al 2004 stadhouders et al 2010 we identified two frequently described polymorphisms within the region we were designing in the 15301 and 15326 positions ablimit et al 2013 hwa et al 2010 lee et al 2002 relative to the revised cambridge reference sequence rcrs bandelt et al 2014 and avoided these two polymorphisms during the primer and probe design process 2 2 samples to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay we used both human fecal samples and human wastewater samples we obtained feces samples from the us bangladesh and mozambique and obtained municipal wastewater samples from the atlanta ga us metropolitan region including 6 primary influent samples and 1 primary effluent sample from plants ranging in treatment capacity from 16 to 90 million gallons per day 73 410 million liters per day to test specificity against non human sources we collected fecal samples from 22 cows 35 pigs and 22 goats as well as 8 samples of chicken litter from farms located in north georgia to test the environmental application of hcytb484 we collected freshwater samples from the chattahoochee river atlanta ga us at 5 different sampling locations on 3 different days starting approximately 5 km downstream of buford dam and continuing downstream in approximately 25 km increments through the atlanta metropolitan area see fig s4 for a map of sampling locations using vacuum filtration we filtered each wastewater and freshwater sample in duplicate with volumes ranging from 25 to 50 ml for wastewater and 500 750 ml for freshwater onto sterilized 0 22 μm pore size 47 mm diameter asymmetrical polyethersulfone membrane filters milliporesigma burlington ma us we then stored all filters and samples at 80 c until nucleic acid extraction see supplementary materials for more details 2 3 nucleic acid extractions we extracted the human feces samples from the us using the qiagen hilden germany powersoil kit according to the manufacturer s protocol and stored eluted dna in buffer c6 at 20 c until analysis we extracted human feces samples from mozambique and bangladesh as well as the chicken litter samples using the qiagen qiaamp 96 powerfecal qiacube ht kit on the qiacube ht platform and stored eluted dna in buffer ate at 80 c in low retention microcentrifuge tubes until analysis we extracted cow pig and goat feces samples using the qiagen powersoil kit according to the human gut microbiome project protocol and stored eluted dna in buffer c6 at 80 c in low retention microcentrifuge tubes until analysis we extracted dna from freshwater and wastewater sample filters using the qiagen powerwater kit according to the manufacturer s protocol and stored eluted dna in buffer eb at 80 c in low retention microcentrifuge tubes until analysis we assayed all extracts with the qubit dsdna hs assay invitrogen carlsbad ca us to quantify dsdna concentration we performed extraction blanks with each set of extraction and tested each extraction blank with the qubit dsdna hs hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 assays 2 4 ddpcr 2 4 1 ddpcr experimental conditions in reporting the methods and materials for this study we referenced the minimum information for publication of quantitative digital pcr experiments guidelines huggett et al 2013 we performed our ddpcr experiments on a bio rad qx200 droplet digital pcr system in our laboratory for each ddpcr well we created a 21 μl pcr mixture containing 1x bio rad ddpcr supermix for probes primer table 1 250 nm of probe table 1 and 2 μl of template for any sample outside of the dynamic range of the qx200 system we made tenfold dilutions until we could obtain a result within the dynamic range we did not use additives in the reaction mixture or enzymatic digestion on samples we performed droplet generation using 20 μl of reaction mixture and 70 μl of bio rad droplet generation oil for probes with the bio rad qx200 droplet generator we then transferred the oil emulsion using a multichannel pipettor to a ddpcr 96 well plate after sealing the plate using the bio rad px1 pcr plate sealer with a foil pcr plate heat seal we loaded each plate onto the bio rad c1000 touch thermal cycler for each thermal cycler routine we used 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 c and 60 s at the assay specific annealing temperature annealing temperature of 58 c for hf183 bacr287 and 59 c for hcytb484 followed by a 10 min hold at 98 c with a ramp rate of 2 c s we read plates with the bio rad qx200 droplet reader set to the absolute quantification experiment setting we did not measure our partition volumes košir et al 2017 but utilized the assumed partition volume of 0 85 nl in bio rad quantasoft version 1 7 4 0917 2 4 2 ddpcr positive controls for the hf183 bacr287 assay we constructed plasmids from positive human feces samples cloned using an invitrogen carlsbad ca us topo ta cloning kit with the pcr 4 topo vector and verified the plasmid sequences using sanger sequencing genewiz south plainfield nj us prior to use in ddpcr we digested plasmids using ecori invitrogen anza restriction enzyme for the hcytb484 assay we ordered custom manufactured sequence verified synthesized dna gblock products manufactured by idt coralville ia us sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in table 1 we used the hf183 bacr287 internal amplification control iac as a gblock to assess pcr inhibition in each undiluted sample as described green et al 2014 we also monitored each no template control uv treated molecular grade water and extraction control if amplification did occur in a no template control we re ran the samples until we obtained a plate with zero positive partitions if any sample exceeded the ddpcr dynamic range we reran it with increasing ten fold dilutions until the well had a ddpcr λ mean copies per partition under 6 and was above the alloq 2 4 3 ddpcr signal the ddpcr platform discretizes a 20 μl pcr reaction into nanoliter scale reactions referred to here as partitions by emulsifying the pcr reaction within oil droplets each ddpcr well contains tens of thousands of such partitions after thermal cycling the wells the ddpcr platform reads a presence absence signal from each partition in a ddpcr well and calculates a concentration from the ratio of the number of positive partitions to the number accepted partitions the formula quantasoft version 1 7 4 0917 used to estimate the concentration of target in the original sample can be written as d d p c r c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n a w e l l l n 1 p o s i t i v e p a r t i t i o n s i n a w e l l a c c e p t e d p a r t i t i o n s i n a w e l l 1 0 85 n l 1000 n l 1 μ l from the above equation the number of positive partitions and accepted partitions represent the raw signal of the ddpcr platform the ddpcr concentration in a well represents the number of copies of the target found in the 20 μl pcr reaction we will refer to copies per ddpcr well which is the ddpcr concentration in a well described above multiplied by 20 μl due to previous experience with partitions of intermediate fluorescence on the ddpcr platform specifically in situations where primer and template were mismatched by one or two base pairs we chose to adopt a moderate approach to distinguishing between positive and negative partitions by setting the threshold midway between the peaks of the negative partitions and the positive partitions to improve discrimination against similar but not exact sequences we only accepted ddpcr results from wells with more than 10 000 accepted partitions fig s1 our mean copies per partition within each well was 2 19 we normalized marker counts in feces to ng of dsdna as measured by the qubit hs dsdna assay invitrogen carlsbad ca us to account for variability between feces consistencies kelty et al 2012 2 5 analytical limits 2 5 1 analytical limit of detection we assumed that the number of positive partitions per ddpcr well can be modeled using the poisson distribution karlin neumann and bizouarn 2018 assuming that the conditions under which each ddpcr well was prepared thermal cycled and quantified were equal such that partitions from the same template can be considered to be from the same population we modeled a poisson distribution from our observed data using maximum likelihood estimation mle because the poisson distribution originates from the exponential family it can be shown that the mle is the sample mean to assess false positive rates from known analytical blanks we assayed uv treated for 15 min molecular grade water in 94 replicates with both assays hf183 bacr287 and hcytb484 we chose to define the limit of detection as the minimum level of the analyte in a sample that will be reported as detected with 95 probability using a known positive control we used the poisson distribution to model the number of positive partitions in a ddpcr well with λ representing the mean number of positive partitions in a well needed to observe k positive partitions in a well to determine the level of analyte λ that would be detected 95 of the time in a poisson process we set the poisson probability mass function equal to a probability of 0 05 for observing no positive partitions in a well k 0 p k positive partitions in a well e λ λ k k p 0 positive partitions in a well e λ λ 0 0 0 05 e λ 0 05 ln e λ ln 0 05 λ 3 for both assays we serial diluted positive controls to approximately 3 positive partitions per well and then assayed the dilution for 46 ddpcr replicates 2 5 2 analytical lower limit of quantification we chose to define the analytical lower limit of quantification as the minimum level of analyte in a sample that will result in a coefficient of variation cv of 25 using a known positive control the target cv of 25 or less is a commonly used alloq goal for ddpcr platforms bogožalec košir et al 2019 milosevic et al 2018 the cv also referred to as the relative standard deviation rsd is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation σ to the mean μ cv σ μ because repeated assaying of various target concentrations may be required to meet a specific cv target we sought to understand how the assay imprecision changes with level of concentration to allow us to interpolate estimates of the level of concentrations needed to meet our target cv we assayed a variety of concentration levels calculated cv values and fitted linear regressions to log10 transformed values of cv and copies per ddpcr well copies per 20 μl well the regressions fitted for each assay used in this study incorporate some intraassay variability as the 4 estimates of the cv for each assay are from 3 separate serial dilutions created on different days 2 6 statistical analyses we completed all statistical analyses simulations and graphs in r version 3 6 1 3 results 3 1 analytical limit of detection while approximately 95 of analyzed blanks lacked any amplification for both assays our results showed that false positive partitions occurred at low concentrations and low rates for both assays table s1 prior to performing experiments to validate the alod we used the poisson distribution to calculate an expected value of 3 positive partitions per ddpcr well as the level of concentration within the ddpcr well that would enable us to observe at least 1 positive partition in 95 of ddpcr wells in our experiments to validate an alod of 3 positive partitions per well we achieved mean positive partitions per well of 4 54 hcytb484 and 4 83 hf183 bacr287 we compared sampling distributions from our ddpcr alod experiments with corresponding expected poisson distributions using the anderson darling test and obtained p values of 0 89 and 0 99 for the hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 assays respectively fig 1 3 2 analytical lower limit of quantification to determine the analytical lower limit of quantification alloq we defined our alloq goal as the level of concentration that would result in a coefficient of variation cv of the copies per ddpcr well equal to 25 we interpolated the level of concentration that would allow us to achieve a cv of 25 by fitting a linear regression to log10 transformed cv and log10 transformed copies per ddpcr well values fig 2 the linear regressions produced alloqs of 28 2 and 29 6 copies per ddpcr well for hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 respectively table 2 summarizes the results of our analytical limit experiments and demonstrates how we classified samples in this study as positive or negative 3 3 sensitivity and specificity results in feces samples we tested the sensitivity and specificity of hf183 bacr287 and hcytb484 on feces samples from humans cows pigs chickens and goats table 3 for any non target amplification we confirmed the presence of the expected size of pcr product on endpoint pcr with gel electrophoresis we then calculated sensitivity and specificity values for these samples over a range of thresholds table 4 by calculating sensitivity and specificity for a range of thresholds we demonstrate how assay performance can vary based on threshold definition as the threshold or the level of concentration at which a well is declared as positive is increased from alod to the alloq the hcytb484 assay exhibited an increase in specificity from 97 to 100 while sensitivity remained constant at 100 across the same threshold levels the hf183 bacr287 assay exhibited an increase in specificity from 80 to 92 but with a tradeoff in sensitivity decreasing from 51 to 31 we then plotted this dependency as a receiver operating characteristic roc curve fig 3 3 4 wastewater and freshwater samples we quantified the hcytb484 marker at higher levels of concentration than the hf183 bacr287 marker in human feces but found hf183 bacr287 at higher levels of concentration than hcytb484 in municipal wastewater samples fig 3 in freshwater samples we were able to quantify both markers at increasing levels of loading copies per ml normalized to ml per second of discharge with increasing drainage contribution from urban development fig 5 a and b however we typically quantified the hf183 bacr287 marker at higher levels than those of the hcytb484 marker fig 5c 4 discussion 4 1 analytical limit of detection it is possible that the hcytb484 assay exhibited slightly higher rates of false positives because the assay targets human mtdna there are several opportunities for human mtdna to contaminate the reaction mixture due to the series of manipulations required for ddpcr combining the results from the analytical blanks with the false positive rates from non human feces we show that very low concentrations below the alod of false positives occur at low rates when using the hcytb484 assay and consequently we recommend that the threshold be set at or above the alod and care be taken to avoid contamination of human mtdna we have found that uv treatment of tubes reaction wells and ddpcr droplet cartridges as well as the use of a 10 bleach solution to disinfect gloves pipettes and contact surfaces after any potential human contact or contamination have aided in successfully avoiding contamination of human mtdna during sample processing and analysis the sampling distributions of positive partitions per ddpcr well in our alod ddpcr experiments suggest that the poisson distribution may be a representative theoretical model for the number of positive partitions per ddpcr well we note that it is a theoretical stochastic model and does not account for potential biases introduced by external sources of variability karlin neumann and bizouarn 2018 such as the operator or equipment using our findings at the mean positive partitions per well of 4 54 and 4 83 we extrapolated our alod down to a mean of 3 positive partitions per well using the poisson distribution and our detection goal of a theoretical 95 probability in addition to modeling the probability of a detection for an alod it is important to consider the likelihood of an observation if a single ddpcr well contained 3 positive partitions one could calculate the likelihood of this observation for a range of λ values finding that the most likely λ that would produce a well of 3 positive partitions would be a λ of 3 recognition of the likelihood of an observation is key because a single ddpcr well of a sample is just one observation drawn from a distribution that exists for the sample thus an alod that maximizes the likelihood is informative this alod of 3 has been used in both qpcr bustin et al 2009 and ddpcr applications cao et al 2015 4 2 estimation of the coefficient of variation and mean positive partitions per well to better understand how values of the cv change as a function of the level of concentration we sought to estimate the true values of the cv by using a relatively large number of replicates n 46 although the cv of the target concentration is widely used as an imprecision goal when determining the ddpcr alloq there is no consensus on the number of replicates with 5 20 replicates being used bogožalec košir et al 2019 dobnik et al 2015 milosevic et al 2018 in the absence of agreement on the number of replicates we used many replicates in combination with cumulative moving plots to assess our estimation of the mean positive partitions per well and the concentration cv figs s2 and s3 what is of interest is if the cumulative moving parameter converges before the total number of replicates and remains stable fig s3h the cumulative moving mean positive partitions per well and cumulative moving concentration cv converged before the total number of replicates in all cases indicating that the use of 46 replicates may provide useful estimates of the true values 4 3 analytical lower limit of quantification we chose to set our alloq to the level of concentration that would result in a coefficient of variation cv of 25 bogožalec košir et al 2019 milosevic et al 2018 while alloqs are often set using less than or equal to a cv target for example 25 the difficulty in finding the level of concentration that results in a specific cv can result in setting alloqs by satisfying the less than 25 rather than the equal to 25 condition however this can cause variation in alloqs set using the same cv target hypothetically alloqs that have been set using levels of concentrations that resulted in a cv of 23 versus a cv of 13 are both valid for an alloq based on 25 the difficulty in repeatedly trying different levels of concentration to achieve a cv of 25 is a deterrent to attempts to satisfy the equal to condition we attempted to develop a standardized approach by interpolating an alloq using a regression fitted to observed cv and concentration values referred to as a variance function or imprecision profile while variance functions for ddpcr assays have not yet been widely explored various forms of variance functions have been used in diverse fields davidian and carroll 1987 sadler 2016 variance functions can have many forms berweger et al 1998 if the distribution of positive partitions per ddpcr well can be modeled by the poisson distribution the variance of the calculated copies per ddpcr well see section 2 4 3 is dependent on the variance of the number of positive partitions per ddpcr well for a poisson distribution the variance is equal to the expected value thus we expect the cv to monotonically scale with increasing number of positive partitions per ddpcr well because the expected value of the poisson distribution is a scale parameter with this in mind we plotted the cv and mean copies per ddpcr well on a log10 log10 plot observing a linear relationship between data points fig 2 we also plotted this relationship using data published by others bogožalec košir et al 2019 milosevic et al 2018 and observed similar linear relationships despite varying numbers of replicates used to estimate cv values fig 2 overall the imprecision profiles are similar interestingly the imprecision profile for the hf183 bacr287 assay multiplexed with an iac was similar to the hcytb484 simplex assay fig 2 which is supported by the relative absence of a quantification bias when duplexing on the ddpcr platform cao et al 2015 because of the agreement between linear regressions for our data and data published by others we hypothesize that assays implemented on the bio rad qx100 qx200 ddpcr platforms may share similar imprecision profiles this is supported by the fact that ddpcr calculates a concentration from direct counts of many endpoint pcr results eliminating some variability associated with individual assay performance an interpolation approach using an imprecision profile to determining an alloq can be helpful in allowing operators to set alloqs in a more standardized approach by providing a more precise estimation of the level of concentration that satisfies the alloq definition rather than assaying various levels of concentration in attempts to satisfy the condition of less than or equal to target cv the combination of relatively high values of r 2 and low p values fig 2 leads us to believe that a linear regression fitted to log10 transformed cv values and log10 transformed copies per ddpcr well is a potential model for the imprecision profile of a variety of assays on the bio rad qx100 qx200 ddpcr platforms for the range of copies per ddpcr well investigated in this study further research investigating more models assays and levels of concentration across different research groups performing ddpcr is warranted 4 4 comparing marker performance we quantified the hcytb484 marker on ddpcr at greater concentrations copies 100 ml of wastewater in both human feces and wastewater than previously published taqman human mtdna assays on qpcr caldwell et al 2007 schill and mathes 2008 however we still quantified the hcytb484 marker at lower concentrations than those of the hf183 bacr287 marker in wastewater fig 4 in the freshwater samples we observed the expected increasing levels of loading of the hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 markers with increasing drainage contribution from urban development fig 5a and b the two markers also had strong correlation with each other in freshwater samples spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0 85 with the hf183 bacr287 marker typically at higher levels of loadings fig 5c roc curves are a useful method of comparing detailed classifier performance because they communicate the dependency of sensitivity and specificity on threshold fawcett 2006 morrison et al 2003 in some cases different thresholds for declaring a sample as positive can result in dramatically different sensitivity and specificity performances being calculated layton et al 2013 by showing how sensitivity and specificity vary with threshold roc curves communicate detailed performance characteristics crucial to selecting a threshold facilitating standardization of the implementation of assays in our roc curves we show that the hcytb484 specificity dramatically increases when the threshold is moved from no amplification to the alod and has 100 specificity at the alloq fig 3 this communicates that although the hcytb484 assay can exhibit low levels of false positives these false positives can be largely avoided by using the alod or alloq as the threshold with the alloq offering a very high specificity performance compared to the hf183 bacr287 marker the hcytb484 marker maintains higher sensitivity in human feces at all levels of threshold table 4 through the roc curve we demonstrate the hcytb484 marker to be widely distributed in individual human feces in concentrations above the alloq suggesting that the hcytb484 marker is potentially reliable and useful in detecting human fecal sludges and other concentrated fecal waste streams where fewer individuals contribute to the waste such matrices are the most common form of fecal wastes globally where risks of exposure are highest berendes et al 2018 because a marker with all of the ideal fst characteristics hagedorn et al 2011 has proved to be elusive toolbox approaches using multiple methods may be useful recognizing that the strengths of one marker can complement the weaknesses of another marker boehm et al 2013 harwood et al 2014 in this study we developed a human mtdna ddpcr assay hcytb484 and compared its performance characteristics with the hf183 bacr287 marker using roc curves showing how roc curves can be used for detailed comparisons of assay performance considering the recommendations for validation studies of microbial fst markers in unproven settings before their use harris et al 2016 nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 aspects of mtdna fst methods such as the direct targeting of host dna and the wide distribution of mtdna markers throughout diverse individuals illuminate mtdna methods as a potentially useful set of tools in the fst toolbox 4 5 further considerations indeed the use of human mtdna as a fecal source tracking marker is a departure from the traditional paradigm of using microbial fecal indicators as demonstrated by zimmerman et al 2014 human mtdna was found in each laundry graywater sample at consistent levels of concentration while the human associated bacteroides marker used was not despite the mean concentrations of both markers remaining similar we note that the use of human mtdna as an fst marker will require more studies to enable the interpretation of this marker for example because human mtdna is found in cells not present in fecal matter such assays can amplify human mtdna from non fecal origins human mtdna marker copies in laundry greywater zimmerman et al 2014 was orders of magnitude lower those found in wastewater caldwell et al 2007 schill and mathes 2008 suggesting that the level of concentration in the sample may serve as an indicator for non fecal versus fecal contamination carry over signals resulting from non human animals consuming human fecal matter are also possible as human consumption of beef has resulted in beef mtdna signal in human feces caldwell et al 2007 how carry over human mtdna signal is influenced by ingestion of human fecal matter by non human animals is a concern in areas where domestic animals are routinely exposed to environments contaminated with human feces harris et al 2016 and in unsafe management of human feces disparately prevalent in low income settings berendes et al 2018 human mtdna markers have also been shown to persist in freshwater for relatively longer than hf183 based markers he et al 2015 these aspects of human mtdna may make it a more conservative marker that correlates well with the presence of human activity and acts as a relatively persistent indicator of fecal pollution questions that are pertinent to the use of human mtdna as an fst marker in environmental media need more studies such as typical concentrations in a variety of fecal and nonfecal samples relative persistence in environmental media cellular origins of fecal mtdna relationship with pathogen fate and transport in environmental media and relationship with risk once human mtdna as a marker of human fecal contamination has been better characterized human mtdna as an unambiguous indicator of human influence may complement other microbial based fst markers that have been limited in their source specificity mayer et al 2018 4 6 limitations several limitations qualify the results of this study our specificity testing was limited to cows pigs chickens and goats from the us to test specificity in this study although previous studies have shown human mtdna to be highly specific to human feces caldwell et al 2007 he et al 2016 schill and mathes 2008 further specificity testing including various species of relevance to other geographies such as avian and non cattle ruminant species are useful for further assessment while our alod experiments show agreement between theoretical calculations and observed ddpcr experiments our use of the poisson distribution to calculate our alod represents a theoretical alod that does not account for biases induced by the operator or equipment interpolation approaches to the determination of alloq are helpful in that they may provide a standardized approach however because the imprecision profiles of ddpcr platforms have not been widely studied the selection of a model for imprecision profile is not well guided by the literature our choice of a linear regression on log10 transformed values of both cv and the copies per ddpcr well was guided by the relationship between the expected value and variance for a poisson distribution simulating the positive partitions per ddpcr well 5 conclusions we present a novel taqman chemistry assay for the ddpcr platform targeting human mtdna hcytb484 and compared it with the hf183 bacr287 on ddpcr we defined and established analytical limits for hcytb484 and hf183 bacr287 presenting novel empirical evidence to validate the analytical limit of detection and a novel approach to the determination of analytical lower limit of quantification the hcytb484 assay was detected and quantifiable in 100 of human feces samples from the us mozambique and bangladesh whereas hf183 bacr287 was detected in only 51 the hcytb484 displayed higher specificity performance in pig chicken and goat samples but lower specificity in cow samples using a receiver operating characteristic curve can provide valuable comparisons between assays and

17777,engineered black carbon biochar can be introduced into groundwater through its extensive engineered applications e g in situ remediation of groundwater soils which can participate in geochemical processes that may alter the fate of trace contaminants such as arsenic as iii here we examined the impacts of the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced biochar hereafter denoted as rubc and rdbc respectively on the as iii immobilization in the absence presence of ca2 50 mm at ph 11 5 under anoxic conditions while neither rubc nor rdbc alone was capable of immobilizing as iii the apparent as iii immobilization by rubc and rdbc synergistically occurred in the presence of ca2 with an efficiency of 73 1 and 89 6 within 24 h respectively in the rubc ca2 as iii system rubc enabled full oxidation of as iii to as v by its residual redox active moieties such as quinoid co and persistent free radicals thereby facilitating precipitation of the newly generated as v with ca2 adsorbed onto the rubc s surface in contrast rdbc induced in situ local enrichment of ca2 in the nascent rdbc derived flocs with predominant non oxidative and slight oxidative precipitation of as iii via ternary rdbc ca as complexation this ternary complex was created by ca2 bridging interactions between as species and oxygen containing functional groups of rdbc as evidenced by the ftir results and the ca2 impeded as iii oxidation the generation of the flocs physically trapped a small amount of as species particularly as iii both the increases in ca2 concentration 0 100 mm and solution ph 10 0 12 5 enhanced the apparent as iii immobilization this study provides new insights into the environmental impacts of two reduced biochar fractions released into typical ca2 rich aquifers on the fate and transport of as species graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic contamination synergistic immobilization abiotic mechanisms undissolved and dissolved biochar calcium rich aquifer 1 introduction high arsenic as contamination in groundwater is a recognized global environmental problem smedley and kinniburgh 2002 ingesting high as groundwater can pose severe threats to public health such as skin lesions and even cancer karim 2000 a previous study suggested that approximately 19 6 million residents in china might be exposed to unsafe as levels i e above the world health organization who guideline of 10 μg l rodríguez lado et al 2013 it is widely recognized that as concentration in groundwater is intimately governed by its interactions with major co existing minerals e g iron fe oxyhydroxides via geochemical processes including precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption therefore it is paramount to identify and understand the geochemical processes that control the fate of as in aquifers to date numerous studies have well revealed that elevated as concentration in groundwater is predominantly triggered by both reductive dissolution of as rich fe oxyhydroxides and alkaline ph induced desorption michael 2013 such phenomenon commonly occurs in as contaminated aquifers with abundant concomitant fe oxyhydroxides of south and southeast asia fendorf et al 2010 michael 2013 podgorski et al 2017 nevertheless anomalous as concentration is frequently observed in some calcium ca rich aquifers e g calcareous aquifers winkel et al 2013 particularly under highly alkaline conditions ph value up to 10 13 as a result of natural processes and or anthropogenic activities barnes et al 1982 mariner et al 1996 sadergaski et al 2019 the fate and transport of as in the aquifers is more profoundly affected by co existing ca if the ca is sufficiently high concentration even up to tens of mmol l in cases where 1 the average fe concentration is low below 0 002 mmol l or 2 its minerals have lost adsorption efficacy guo et al 2014 martínez villegas et al 2013 winkel et al 2013 for example zhang and yang 2013 proposed that as in underground sediment of the calcareous regions was correlated with ca in both water bodies and sediments it was also claimed that as in the calcareous regions was detected to be highly enriched in natural ca containing minerals up to two orders of magnitude over the normal crustal as abundances costagliola et al 2013 besides qian et al 2015 demonstrated that the presence of ca2 could significantly promote as iii oxidation precipitation in addition to ca2 natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in natural engineered waters and plays a critical role in the bio geochemical cycling of trace as lawson et al 2013 mak et al 2009 reza et al 2010 for instance the presence of nom can hinder the increased role of ca2 in as removal from nom rich groundwater by competing with as for binding sites mak et al 2009 moreover the co presence of nom and ca2 has been reported to trigger the aggregation liu et al 2008 which may thereby facilitate as removal in contrast to many investigations on nom to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report the impacts of engineered constituents e g engineered black carbon on the fate and transport of as in the anoxic ca2 rich groundwater e g calcareous groundwater biochar as a representative of engineered black carbon has attracted increasing interest in environmental and agricultural applications due to its favorable physical chemical and biocompatibility properties in recent years cao et al 2011 wei et al 2018 yang et al 2019 yao et al 2013 the extensive engineered applications of biochar including in situ remediation of groundwater soils bortone et al 2013 mackenzie et al 2012 wei et al 2018 and managed aquifer recharge which carries biochar rauch williams et al 2010 have resulted in its introduction into subsurface environments this has been shown by the presence of in the range of ca 1 40 biochar derived organic carbon that has been detected in soils and sediments jin et al 2017 lian and xing 2017 zimmerman 2010 the introduced biochar can be found as both undissolved and dissolved fractions hereafter denoted as ubc and dbc respectively in wet and anoxic environments especially for shallow groundwater analogous to nom roden et al 2010 scott et al 1998 they can be chemically or microbially reduced in the environments to a certain extent furthermore they can potentially participate in bio geochemical processes that alter the fate and transport of the co existing contaminants such as as beiyuan et al 2017 niazi et al 2018a vithanage et al 2017 yang et al 2018b it has been well recognized that both ubc and dbc have significant differences in structural configuration and chemical composition e g element contents and types thus endowing their contrasting physicochemical properties e g surface charge complexation and redox properties qu et al 2016 yang et al 2018a therefore it can be rationally hypothesized that the two reduced ubc and dbc play different even contrasting roles in the fate of as in groundwater ubc constitutes active components in bulk biochar and often plays a primary role in the immobilization and redox transformation of as via various interaction mechanisms niazi et al 2018a qiao et al 2018 vithanage et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 for example both perilla leaf and japanese oak wood derived biochar particles immobilized as species with capacities of 3 85 11 01 mg g via both surface complexation and precipitation niazi et al 2018a niazi et al 2018b further as iii oxidation was found on the two ubcs in our recent study rice husk derived biochar particles negligibly immobilized as species in the ph range of 3 0 9 5 while as iii oxidation occurred zhong et al 2019 these studies however failed to examine the impacts of other naturally existing constituents such as ca2 on these processes in the co presence of ubc especially under anoxic conditions on one hand ubc can oxidize as iii to as v due to the presence of redox active moieties rams in spite of anoxic conditions zhong et al 2019 on the other hand ca2 can be readily adsorbed onto negatively charged ubc which may improve redox interactions between ubc and the negatively charged as anions by neutralizing ubc s surface negative charge marshall et al 2017 taken together the presence of ca2 play a significant role in enhancing as iii oxidation and subsequent immobilization by ubc in groundwater in contrast to numerous studies on ubc the effect of dbc on the im mobilization and redox transformation of as is often underestimated and poorly understood dong et al 2014 vithanage et al 2017 presumably the presence impact of dbc that has been neglected by many researchers dbc possesses more oxygen containing functional groups ofgs lower aromaticity and smaller fused aromatic clusters than ubc qu et al 2016 yang et al 2018a the abundant ofgs of dbc may compete with as iii for binding sites and complex as iii to generate dissolved as complex consequently promoting as mobility however ca2 can elevate the ionic strength of solution and decrease the negative charge of dbc both of which can trigger the aggregation and precipitation of dbc xu et al 2017 as a result ca2 is anticipated to be highly enriched in the aggregates and may subsequently stimulate chemical precipitation with as despite the redox inertness of ca2 it may protect semiquinone free radicals within dbc by ca2 bridging interactions and inducing intramolecular aggregation to reduce as iii oxidation similar to the effect of ca2 on the properties of nom palmer and von wandruszka 2001 yates and von wandruszka 1999 thus the presence of ca2 would complicate the oxidation and immobilization of as iii despite the significant understanding of the fate and transport of as in groundwater to date we still lack knowledge regarding the effects of the reduced ubc and dbc on the oxidation and immobilization of as iii in anoxic ca2 rich groundwater herein we prepared the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced rice husk derived biochar to explore their respective effects on the oxidation and immobilization of as iii in simulated alkaline ca2 rich groundwater we integrated wet chemistry experiments and multiple spectroscopic characterizations to elucidate the mechanisms of as iii immobilization in the co presence of biochar and ca2 in addition the effect of water chemistry including ca2 concentration 0 100 mm and solution ph 10 0 12 5 was examined the knowledge of this study can advance our understanding of the environmental effects and implications of rubc and rdbc released into alkaline ca2 rich groundwater on the fate and transport of as iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in this study are described in text s1 of supporting information si 2 2 preparation of rubc and rdbc and characterization biochar was typically produced by oxygen limited pyrolysis of rice husk and more details were provided in our previous study zhong et al 2019 in brief each 30 g of rice husk was placed in a silicon carbide vessel with cap and subsequently pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace under oxygen limited conditions at 400 c for 1 h afterwards the biochar sample was cooled to room temperature for collection to simulate the reduced state of biochar released into anoxic groundwater we performed the reduction experiment using the biochar suspension and a typically chemical reduction method in the dark according to a previous report roden et al 2010 after the reduction the biochar suspension was filtered using a 0 22 μm nylon membrane which is similar to a previous study yang et al 2018a the reduced rubc and rdbc are the retentate and permeate respectively more details involving the reduction and fractionation procedures are presented in text s2 of si the resulting reduced biochar fractions were hereby referred to as rubc and rdbc respectively and stored at 4 c in the dark before use the characterizations including the morphologies surface chemical properties crystalline structures and elemental compositions are provided in detail in text s3 of si 2 3 as iii immobilization experiments unless otherwise specified all batch experiments were conducted in a 250 ml magnetically stirred reactor filled and equilibrated with a 100 n2 under a standard atmosphere pressure at room temperature in the dark before the as iii immobilization experiments all solutions e g rdbc solution were sparged with ultrapure nitrogen for at least 2 h and all materials e g rubc and cacl2 2h2o were deoxygenated in a vacuum for at least 2 h for the rubc systems 0 2 g of rubc was added into 100 ml of 100 μm as iii solution to create 2 g l rubc suspension then adjusted to ph 11 5 0 1 with 0 01 and 0 1 m naoh solution afterwards the concurrent introductions of 0 735 g of cacl2 2h2o powder equal to 50 mm ca2 in the resulting solution and a desired amount of the naoh solution into the suspension were performed to initiate the as iii immobilization reaction for 24 h naoh solution was added again because the introduction of cacl2 2h2o powder would result in a serious decrease in the suspension ph desired reaction suspensions were filtrated with a 0 22 μm nylon membrane the dissolved as species was the permeate a 1 m hcl digestion was used to measure the total as species as tot in the unfiltered samples the immobilization fraction of each as species was calculated by subtracting the concentration of each as species in the aqueous phase from that of the corresponding as tot species in the unfiltered samples for the rdbc as iii immobilization tests a 156 5 mg rdbc as carbon l mg c l stock solution was used and the tests were conducted in the same manner as those used for the scenarios described above meanwhile we performed control experiments in the absence of either biochar i e rubc and rdbc or ca2 under the same experimental conditions all the experiments were performed in triplicate in addition the effects of ca2 concentration 0 100 mm and solution ph 10 0 12 5 on the as iii immobilization were investigated 2 4 analytical methods the as iii and as v concentrations were measured by using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 100plus shanghai wufeng scientific instrument co ltd coupled to a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer hg afs sa7800 beijing bohui innovation optoelectronic technology co ltd more details on the analysis of as species were described in our recent document zhong et al 2019 there were no organic as species consequently we assumed that as tot was equal to the sum of as iii and as v for both rubc and rdbc 3 results and discussion 3 1 apparent as iii immobilization associated with the presence of rubc and rdbc fig 1 a below shows that in the ca2 as iii system no observable immobilization of as iii by 50 mm of ca2 occurred at ph 11 5 under anoxic conditions which was consistent with no formation of ca as iii precipitates as predicted by mineql 4 6 model that is based on equilibrium chemical precipitation reactions fig 1b this observation demonstrates that as iii remained stable in the ca2 rich solution at ph 11 5 that is 50 mm of ca2 was not capable of immobilizing as iii upon the introduction of rubc into the ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization i e the sum of as iii and as v immobilization increased gradually from 0 to 73 1 μm within 24 h fig 1a in contrast our control experiment in the absence of ca2 revealed that rubc could not immobilize as iii which was ascribed to the following facts 1 the strong electrostatic repulsion between as anions predominant forms of haso3 2 h2aso3 haso4 and aso4 3 fig s1 and the negatively charged surface of rubc 38 1 mv fig s2 he et al 2018 van vinh et al 2015 2 the strong competitive adsorption between as anions and oh goh and lim 2004 3 the limited bet surface area of rubc 37 3 m2 g the results indicate that both rubc and ca2 synergistically enabled the apparent as iii immobilization unlike the immobilization in the rubc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization sharply jumped from 0 to 65 1 μm within 0 5 h and gradually increased to 89 6 μm afterwards in the rdbc ca2 as iii system fig 1a the details are further discussed later in section 3 3 no apparent as iii immobilization by rdbc occurred in the ca2 free solution and this was probably due to the formation of water soluble mixture and or complex which could pass through 0 22 μm nylon membrane although both rubc and rdbc participated in the apparent as iii immobilization in the presence of ca2 they might play different roles in the immobilization processes as highlighted by the significant discrepancies in the aforementioned immobilization behavior fig 1a 3 2 rubc induced oxidative precipitation of as iii with ca2 biochar particles as predominant reactive sinks have been reported to participate in redox reactions with some pollutants such as as and cr niazi et al 2018a wongrod et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 2019 in combination with our experimental observations fig 1a we hypothesize that rubc might interact with as iii e g redox reaction and increase the apparent as iii immobilization with ca2 it is important to note that neither rubc nor ca2 alone is capable of immobilizing as iii to verify this hypothesis we first explored the potential interactions of rubc alone with as iii in the absence of ca2 as iii in the solution was found to be completely oxidized by rubc within 8 h and the newly generated as v concentration in the solution increased significantly from 0 to 100 μm fig 2 a in contrast our control experiment without rubc revealed that as iii could not be oxidized to as v under the same conditions data not shown these findings suggest that rubc could fully oxidize as iii to as v at ph 11 5 as further supported by recent studies niazi et al 2018a niazi et al 2018b zhong et al 2019 this as iii oxidation could be a result of the presence of residual redox active moieties rams particularly quinoid co 1705 cm 1 and persistent free radicals pfrs on rubc fig s3 dong et al 2014 wan et al 2020 zhong et al 2019 as v has been well documented to have a higher binding affinity for ca2 than as iii tokunaga 1999 consequently the oxidation of as iii by rubc to generate as v would benefit the formation of ca as v precipitates and apparent as iii immobilization at ph 11 5 wang et al 2019 when ca2 was introduced into the rubc as iii system this was further evidenced by the model prediction which showed that as v completely precipitates as ca3 aso4 2 at ph 11 5 i e the concentrations of ca2 and as v were 50 mm and 100 μm respectively fig 1b it is worth noting that the model prediction 100 0 is far higher than that 73 1 in the rubc ca2 as iii system presumably due to the presence of rubc while this proposed hypothesis is plausible solid evidence favoring it is further invoked we therefore scrutinized the oxidation and solid liquid partitioning of as iii in the rubc ca2 as iii system in the aqueous phase we observed the accelerated and complete removal of as iii more precisely the accelerated as iii oxidation in the aqueous phase see below as compared with that in the absence of ca2 fig 2b ca2 is a redox inert component and not capable of oxidizing as iii as further confirmed by no production of as v in the ca2 as iii system fig s4 hence we attribute the positive effect of ca2 to the enhanced interactions between as iii anions and rams e g quinoid co and pfrs on rubc by neutralizing the negative charge on surface of rubc with the ca2 adsorption precipitation fig s2 and fig s5 furthermore the newly generated as v concentration in the solution increased significantly from 0 to 71 0 μm within 3 h but decreased to 27 0 μm afterwards this trend implies that as v was first generated from as iii oxidation by rubc and was gradually immobilized thereafter this was corroborated by the observation that the as v concentration in the solid phase significantly increased to 72 2 μm within 24 h fig 2b however no detectable as iii was found in the solid phase fig 2b which was approximately due to the complete as iii oxidation and or its considerably low affinity for both ca2 and rubc at ph 11 5 based on all the experimental observations and analyses we suggest that as iii was oxidized to as v by rubc and then the newly generated as v in the solution primarily precipitated with the adsorbed precipitated ca2 onto the surface of rubc we further performed several selected spectroscopic characterizations including sem eds ftir xps and xrd to prove that the proposed as iii oxidative immobilization occurs using sem eds characterization we first visualized the morphologies of rubc samples collected at the selected reaction stages hereafter denoted as rubc 0 5 rubc 8 and rubc 24 respectively as shown in fig 3 a rubc as the control sample had a smooth surface with no deposition of precipitates on its surface the corresponding eds elemental mappings analysis revealed that major elements were c and o and no ca and as only elements of interest were on the pristine rubc fig 3b e a small amount of the microparticles deposited on the surface of rubc 0 5 was observed when the reaction time was increased to 0 5 h though its surface seemed smooth fig 3f the abundant element ca was uniformly distributed in rubc 0 5 whereas negligible as was detected probably due to a considerably low concentration of as immobilized in rubc 0 5 fig 3i and j both the surfaces of rubc 8 and rubc 24 became far rougher meanwhile an increasing number of microparticles with larger size were visualized on rubc 8 and rubc 24 when the reaction time was further prolonged to 8 or 24 h fig 3k and p both the elements ca and as were further enriched on rubc 8 and rubc 24 fig 3n o s and t and the distribution of as was closely collocated with that of ca these results further confirm that ca2 was adsorbed onto the surface of rubc and followed by precipitation with as on its surface ftir was employed to examine changes in chemical properties of these samples during the as iii immobilization fig 4 a demonstrates no detectable changes in peaks at 1613 cm 1 aromatic cc 1384 cm 1 aliphatic ch3 1100 cm 1 aliphatic c o c c oh and c o and 800 cm 1 aromatic c h the ftir results suggest that these functional groups were not involved in the as iii immobilization however we found a significant decrease in relative peak intensity of quinoid co at 1705 cm 1 suggesting that quinoid co participated in the as iii oxidation zhong et al 2019 this is supported by the similar observation that benzoquinone could oxidize as iii to as v under slightly alkaline conditions qin et al 2016 in comparison with rubc three new peaks at 700 1500 cm 1 gradually appeared and their relative peak intensities presented the elevated trends when the reaction time was extended from 0 5 to 24 h specifically a new characteristic peak at 875 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of ca o asv and ca o indicating the formation of ca as v precipitates zhang et al 2015 meanwhile a small peak was detected at 712 cm 1 and was assigned to the asv o h stretching vibration of ca as v precipitates zhang et al 2015 in addition another characteristic peak was detected at 1482 cm 1 corresponding to the c o c stretching vibration of caco3 which was presumably due to interaction of atmospheric co2 with ca2 under alkaline conditions hu et al 2014 from the as 3d5 2 xps spectra in fig 4b only a peak appeared at 44 2 ev assigned to as v and its relative peak intensity exhibited an elevating trend with reaction time indicating the increasing generation of ca as v precipitates on the surfaces of these samples further xrd examination revealed that the ca as v precipitates were attributed to amorphous mineral because they did not have characteristic xrd peaks of ca as v components fig 4c overall all spectroscopic characterization observations and analyses were in good agreement with the aforementioned wet chemistry results supporting the proposed oxidative as iii immobilization by rubc via the generation of ca as v precipitates on the surface of rubc 3 3 in situ creation of highly enriched ca2 flocs with rdbc drives multiple as iii immobilization similar to ubc dbc has been reported to oxidize as iii under alkaline conditions dong et al 2014 this motivates us to examine the oxidation of as iii and partitioning of as iii produced as v by rdbc in the absence of ca2 as shown in fig 5 a all of the as species were present in the aqueous phase furthermore only a small amount 19 3 μm of as iii in this phase was oxidized to as v by rdbc due to the presence of quinoid co and pfrs fig s3 only the newly generated as v could be fully immobilized by chemical precipitation with 50 mm of ca2 in the rdbc free solution at ph 11 5 fig s6 these results suggest that in the rdbc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization might not be predominantly governed by the aforementioned oxidative as iii precipitation with ca2 as implied by our previous observations fig 1a as shown in fig 5b after the introduction of ca2 into the rdbc as iii system the oxidation and partitioning of as iii became different from those in the rubc ca2 as iii system in particular the as iii concentration in the solution dropped dramatically down from 100 to 26 4 μm within 0 5 h but the as v concentration increased slightly from 0 to 8 6 μm afterwards they maintained a slightly decreasing trend meanwhile in the solid phase the as iii concentration increased significantly from 0 to 60 6 μm within 0 5 h whereas the as v concentration rose slightly to 4 4 μm unlike the positive effect of ca2 on the as iii oxidation by rubc we found that the presence of ca2 could impede the oxidation of as iii to as v by rdbc fig 5 recently a similar phenomenon was observed for the negative effect of ca2 on the ferrous oxidation by nom jiang et al 2017 this impediment might be because the redox inert ca2 adsorbed precipitated on the surface inhibited electron transfers between as iii and rdbc and this reduced as iii oxidation overall these results clarify that most of as iii was non oxidatively immobilized by both rdbc and ca2 also these findings highlight that the as iii oxidative immobilization was not a major pathway in the rdbc ca2 as iii system and other possible mechanisms were likely to be involved unlike the absence of visible precipitates in our control systems i e the ca2 as iii and the dbc as iii systems we noticed an extraordinary phenomenon that plenty of light brown flocs in situ were generated upon the introduction of ca2 into the rdbc as iii system fig s7 a similar observation was found in the study of ca2 on the aggregation behavior of dissolved biochar at circumneutral ph xu et al 2017 this generation resulted from the significant aggregation of intramolecular within rdbc via two successive interactions 1 ca2 neutralized some of the negative surface charge of rdbc to weaken electrostatic repulsion between intramolecular within rdbc figs s2 and s5 xu et al 2017 2 ca2 subsequently bridged rdbc to promote the intimate contact each other yang et al 2018a the resulting flocs enabled the collective precipitation of as ca2 and rdbc as indicated by sem eds analysis below fig 6 there are three possible pathways accounting for the apparent as iii immobilization in the rdbc ca2 as iii system 1 complexation of as with rdbc derived oxygen containing functional groups ofgs in the flocs 2 physical enmeshment of as by the nascent rdbc ca flocs 3 chemical precipitation of as with highly enriched ca2 in the flocs since ofgs generally possess a lower affinity for as than ca2 particularly under highly alkaline conditions we can rule out the complexation pathway that causes the apparent as iii immobilization subsequently we checked physical enmeshment by delicately creating the rdbc ca flocs in situ for the as iii immobilization i e both rdbc and ca2 were first allowed to generate the flocs for 0 5 h then the resulting flocs was employed to immobilize as iii for another 24 h and were denoted as rdbc ca2 as iii as shown in fig s8 the physical enmeshment was estimated to approximately contribute to 21 8 of the apparent as iii immobilization fig 5b here the physical enmeshment was considered to work within the first 0 5 h because of the significant generation of the flocs also the results indicate that the resulting flocs could create a great number of active binding sites for as species resulting in about 78 2 of the apparent as iii immobilization for the active binding sites the most likely candidate is suggested to be ca within the flocs this is because ca possesses a higher affinity for as than other components including ofgs in rdbc particularly under highly alkaline conditions based on all the results and analyses we thus assert that in situ creation of the highly enriched ca in the nascent flocs predominantly drove the non oxidative precipitation of as iii and the oxidative precipitation of as iii had only slight immobilization effect also the physical enmeshment partially accounted for the apparent as iii immobilization to further confirm our proposed mechanisms we performed sem eds analysis on the flocs samples hereafter denoted as rdbc 0 5 rdbc 8 and rdbc 24 respectively collected from the rdbc ca2 as iii system at different stages as well as rdbc as shown in fig 6a e rdbc had a relatively smooth surface and predominant contained c and o elements and a slight amount of ca but no as whilst there was a slight amount of ca in rdbc it failed to immobilize the apparent as iii fig 5a because the ca concentration was far too low in contrast rdbc 0 5 had fine the stacked particle like flocs with a rougher surface which differed significantly from the pristine rdbc sample fig 6f furthermore the corresponding eds elemental mapping analysis elucidated that at the micron scale the element ca was highly enriched in the flocs and its elemental distribution was intimately correlated with the elemental distribution of as fig 6i and j however there was an insignificant correlation between the elemental distributions of c and as as well as ca these results suggest that rdbc could greatly facilitate the enrichment of ca and the resulting ca was capable of precipitating as the c containing components like aromatic structure in rdbc were not directly associated with the apparent as iii immobilization which was confirmed by no apparent as iii immobilization by rdbc fig 5a even after a prolonged reaction time we still observed almost the same phenomena on the rdbc 8 and rdbc 24 samples fig 6k t the negligible changes in morphologies and chemical compositions of the flocs indicated nearly complete precipitation of ca with as at the initial stage corresponding to 0 0 5 h and it was relatively independent of the reaction time ranging from 0 5 to 24 h ftir analysis was employed to identify the apparent as iii immobilization interactions in contrast to rubc rdbc possessed more ofgs including oh cooh and co and c o c and c oh as evidenced by the stronger intensities of characteristic peaks at 3400 3500 1500 1700 and 1000 1300 cm 1 respectively fig s3a and this is similar to previous findings qu et al 2016 furthermore this was supported by a higher ratio of o c in rdbc than that in rubc table s1 after the reaction the characteristic peaks at 1000 1700 cm 1 mainly corresponding to ofgs underwent either peak shift i e from 1656 to 1644 cm 1 and from 1106 to 1039 cm 1 or new peak were created at 1410 1490 cm 1 the ftir spectral changes indicate that ofgs interplayed with ca2 rather than as likely via complexation and or ca2 bridging modes xu et al 2017 since they possess a higher affinity for ca2 than as under highly alkaline conditions in addition the new peak at 871 cm 1 was smaller than that 875 cm 1 of ca o asv and ca o which could be assigned to ca o asiii and ca o other new characteristic peaks occurred at 568 604 cm 1 which were attributed to ca o h myneni 1998 this suggests the formation of ca as iii precipitates as well as ca containing components like ca oh 2 after the 0 5 h of reaction time the relative intensities of these characteristic peaks remained stable indicating the almost complete formation of ca as iii precipitates as well as ca containing components at the initial stage the as 3d5 2 xps spectra analysis revealed that as iii mainly prevailed in the resulting ca as precipitates and agreed with the observed fraction of as species fig 7 b a comparison of ca 2p3 2 xps spectra was performed to identify interactions of ca with as species for the selected rdbc samples i e rdbc 0 5 rdbc 8 and rdbc 24 the peaks of ca 2p3 2 xps spectra were located at 347 2 ev 0 4 ev lower than that 347 6 ev of the corresponding rubc samples i e rubc 0 5 rubc 8 and rubc 24 fig s9 this difference was close to that 0 5 ev of as 3d5 2 xps spectra 43 7 ev for the rdbc samples vs 44 2 ev for the rubc samples this implies that the interactions of the enriched ca with as should be assigned to chemical precipitation which is analogous to those in the rubc ca2 as iii system the resulting ca as iii v precipitates predominant ca as iii precipitates were identified to be amorphous minerals as confirmed by the absence of characteristic xrd patterns fig 7c which was presumably due to the presence of rdbc and or the short ageing time in summary all the characterizations and analyses have confirmed the proposed as iii immobilization mechanisms 3 4 effect of water chemistry on apparent as iii immobilization 3 4 1 effect of ca2 concentration ca2 is essential to the apparent as iii immobilization by both rubc and rdbc consequently we further investigated the effect of ca2 concentration on the immobilization 0 100 mm notably in the rubc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization increased from 4 8 to 18 7 to 73 1 and to 74 4 μm within 24 h when ca2 concentration rose from 0 to 10 to 50 and to 100 mm respectively fig 8 a this was because a higher concentration of ca2 was able to precipitate a larger amount of the newly generated as v from as iii oxidation by rubc into the solid phase as confirmed by our prediction results fig 1b moreover the increase in apparent as iii immobilization rate could be seen with the increasing ca2 concentration the increase in ca2 concentration could substantially neutralize the negative surface charge of rubc fig s2 thus facilitating as v generation by weakening the electrostatic repulsion between rubc and as iii anions fig 8b this could increase the precipitation of subsequent as v with ca2 these results indicate that the increase in ca2 concentration favored the as iii oxidative immobilization similarly we observed that increasing ca2 concentration significantly promoted the apparent as iii immobilization in the rdbc ca2 as iii system fig 8c however we found that further increasing ca2 concentration impeded the as iii oxidation by rdbc as verified by a lower as v concentration fig 8d this was because a higher ca concentration within the flocs exerted a stronger inhibition for electron transfers between as iii and rdbc considering our previous ftir analysis fig 7a this inhibition further revealed that the ca as iii precipitates occurred within the flocs via a ternary rdbc ca as iii complexation by ca2 bridging interactions between as iii and the ofgs of rdbc furthermore a higher apparent as iii immobilization but a lower as v generation concentration suggested that elevating ca2 concentration enhanced the apparent as iii immobilization via direct precipitation of as iii with ca2 it is worthy to note that for both the ternary systems increasing ca2 concentration beyond 50 mm has a negligible effect on the apparent as iii immobilization fig 8a and c this might be due to that available amounts of the active binding sites for as species have reached saturation when ca2 concentration was increased to about 50 mm in the presence of rubc and rdbc 3 4 2 effect of solution ph similar to ca2 increasing solution ph favored the apparent as iii immobilization in the rubc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization increased significantly from 29 9 to 73 1 and to 89 9 μm with the ph increasing from 10 0 to 11 5 and to 12 5 respectively fig 9 a this could be explained by increased chemical precipitation of as v with ca2 and or adsorption of as v onto the newly generated ca oh 2 at a higher ph value figs 1b and s5 also we observed the accelerated apparent as iii immobilization rate with the increasing solution ph this was because the increase in as v generation rate facilitated subsequent as v precipitation with ca2 at a higher ph value fig 9a and b with respect to the accelerated oxidation of as iii to as v by rubc it might be due to a larger redox potential gap between redox couples on rubc and as v as iii couples at a higher ph value zhong et al 2019 these results indicate that elevating solution ph could stimulate as iii oxidation and subsequent precipitation of as v with ca2 further corroborating the proposed as iii oxidative immobilization in the rdbc ca2 as iii systems the apparent as iii immobilization increased markedly from 30 3 to 89 6 and then to 100 μm respectively as solution ph elevated from 10 0 to 11 5 and then to 12 5 fig 9c these observations indicate that a higher solution ph encouraged the apparent as iii immobilization a possible explanation involved a greater extent of chemical precipitation of as with ca2 and or adsorption of as species onto solid ca oh 2 at a higher solution ph figs 1b and s5 meantime the newly generated as v concentration increased from 8 3 to 9 6 and to 22 7 μm respectively fig 9d indicating that the increasing solution ph improved the as iii oxidation extent the enhanced oxidation of as iii to as v was possibly attributed to the increasing redox potential gap between redox couples on rdbc and as v as iii couples with the elevating solution ph which is similar to the eh ph diagrams for reduced nom as system jiang et al 2009 in conclusion the increase in the solution ph promoted the apparent as iii immobilization in both the rubc ca2 as iii and the rdbc ca2 as iii systems 3 5 environmental significance high as groundwater is widely distributed worldwide e g calcareous regions and poses a great threat to public health the geochemical processes determining the fate of as are often affected by both natural and engineered components our work describes the positive effects of the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced biochar on the abiotic oxidation and immobilization of as iii in simulated anoxic groundwater of calcareous regions largely relieving the as environmental risk our investigation further confirms that both rubc and rdbc can remove 72 4 and 72 1 of as tot from real groundwater collected from a local village in hunan province spiked with 100 μm as iii respectively table s2 to the best of our knowledge the large r ubc particles often have difficulty in entering into subsurface environments thus only a small amount of rubc may be present in natural subsurface environments furthermore rubc has a lower as iii immobilization capacity than rdbc in anoxic ca2 rich groundwater fig s10 consequently rubc may have a lower impact on the oxidation and immobilization of as iii in natural subsurface environments particularly under long term and strongly reducing conditions in contrast a massive amount of rdbc can be readily introduced into the subsurface environment and govern the apparent as iii immobilization via the non oxidative as iii precipitation as a consequence rdbc may deserve more attention on the fate of as iii in typical calcareous regions we acknowledge that natural subsurface environment is more complicated than the currently studied systems and thus further investigations e g effect of co existing anions including phosphate and carbonate need to be examined to advance our understanding of engineered black carbon such as biochar on the fate of as iii in the subsurface environment close to real calcareous aquifers 4 conclusions this study reports that as iii in anoxic ca2 rich groundwater can be efficiently immobilized by both the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced biochar via contrasting interaction mechanisms under alkaline conditions our results reveal that rubc completely oxidized as iii to as v and subsequently precipitated with ca2 adsorbed precipitated on its surface in contrast rdbc underwent a flocculation process induced by ca2 thus forming the extremely enriched ca2 in the flocs that predominantly drives precipitation with as iii meanwhile both physical enmeshment of as iii by the nascent flocs and as iii oxidative precipitation slightly account for the apparent as iii immobilization the apparent as iii immobilization depends strongly on water chemistry including ca2 concentration and solution ph both the increases in ca2 concentration and solution ph can significantly promote the apparent as iii immobilization our findings elucidate the unintended environmental effects of undissolved and dissolved fractions of biochar on the fate and transport of as iii in aquifers of calcareous regions this study may suggest an alternative strategy candidate for remediation of high as groundwater of calcareous regions by injecting

17777,engineered black carbon biochar can be introduced into groundwater through its extensive engineered applications e g in situ remediation of groundwater soils which can participate in geochemical processes that may alter the fate of trace contaminants such as arsenic as iii here we examined the impacts of the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced biochar hereafter denoted as rubc and rdbc respectively on the as iii immobilization in the absence presence of ca2 50 mm at ph 11 5 under anoxic conditions while neither rubc nor rdbc alone was capable of immobilizing as iii the apparent as iii immobilization by rubc and rdbc synergistically occurred in the presence of ca2 with an efficiency of 73 1 and 89 6 within 24 h respectively in the rubc ca2 as iii system rubc enabled full oxidation of as iii to as v by its residual redox active moieties such as quinoid co and persistent free radicals thereby facilitating precipitation of the newly generated as v with ca2 adsorbed onto the rubc s surface in contrast rdbc induced in situ local enrichment of ca2 in the nascent rdbc derived flocs with predominant non oxidative and slight oxidative precipitation of as iii via ternary rdbc ca as complexation this ternary complex was created by ca2 bridging interactions between as species and oxygen containing functional groups of rdbc as evidenced by the ftir results and the ca2 impeded as iii oxidation the generation of the flocs physically trapped a small amount of as species particularly as iii both the increases in ca2 concentration 0 100 mm and solution ph 10 0 12 5 enhanced the apparent as iii immobilization this study provides new insights into the environmental impacts of two reduced biochar fractions released into typical ca2 rich aquifers on the fate and transport of as species graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic contamination synergistic immobilization abiotic mechanisms undissolved and dissolved biochar calcium rich aquifer 1 introduction high arsenic as contamination in groundwater is a recognized global environmental problem smedley and kinniburgh 2002 ingesting high as groundwater can pose severe threats to public health such as skin lesions and even cancer karim 2000 a previous study suggested that approximately 19 6 million residents in china might be exposed to unsafe as levels i e above the world health organization who guideline of 10 μg l rodríguez lado et al 2013 it is widely recognized that as concentration in groundwater is intimately governed by its interactions with major co existing minerals e g iron fe oxyhydroxides via geochemical processes including precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption therefore it is paramount to identify and understand the geochemical processes that control the fate of as in aquifers to date numerous studies have well revealed that elevated as concentration in groundwater is predominantly triggered by both reductive dissolution of as rich fe oxyhydroxides and alkaline ph induced desorption michael 2013 such phenomenon commonly occurs in as contaminated aquifers with abundant concomitant fe oxyhydroxides of south and southeast asia fendorf et al 2010 michael 2013 podgorski et al 2017 nevertheless anomalous as concentration is frequently observed in some calcium ca rich aquifers e g calcareous aquifers winkel et al 2013 particularly under highly alkaline conditions ph value up to 10 13 as a result of natural processes and or anthropogenic activities barnes et al 1982 mariner et al 1996 sadergaski et al 2019 the fate and transport of as in the aquifers is more profoundly affected by co existing ca if the ca is sufficiently high concentration even up to tens of mmol l in cases where 1 the average fe concentration is low below 0 002 mmol l or 2 its minerals have lost adsorption efficacy guo et al 2014 martínez villegas et al 2013 winkel et al 2013 for example zhang and yang 2013 proposed that as in underground sediment of the calcareous regions was correlated with ca in both water bodies and sediments it was also claimed that as in the calcareous regions was detected to be highly enriched in natural ca containing minerals up to two orders of magnitude over the normal crustal as abundances costagliola et al 2013 besides qian et al 2015 demonstrated that the presence of ca2 could significantly promote as iii oxidation precipitation in addition to ca2 natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in natural engineered waters and plays a critical role in the bio geochemical cycling of trace as lawson et al 2013 mak et al 2009 reza et al 2010 for instance the presence of nom can hinder the increased role of ca2 in as removal from nom rich groundwater by competing with as for binding sites mak et al 2009 moreover the co presence of nom and ca2 has been reported to trigger the aggregation liu et al 2008 which may thereby facilitate as removal in contrast to many investigations on nom to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report the impacts of engineered constituents e g engineered black carbon on the fate and transport of as in the anoxic ca2 rich groundwater e g calcareous groundwater biochar as a representative of engineered black carbon has attracted increasing interest in environmental and agricultural applications due to its favorable physical chemical and biocompatibility properties in recent years cao et al 2011 wei et al 2018 yang et al 2019 yao et al 2013 the extensive engineered applications of biochar including in situ remediation of groundwater soils bortone et al 2013 mackenzie et al 2012 wei et al 2018 and managed aquifer recharge which carries biochar rauch williams et al 2010 have resulted in its introduction into subsurface environments this has been shown by the presence of in the range of ca 1 40 biochar derived organic carbon that has been detected in soils and sediments jin et al 2017 lian and xing 2017 zimmerman 2010 the introduced biochar can be found as both undissolved and dissolved fractions hereafter denoted as ubc and dbc respectively in wet and anoxic environments especially for shallow groundwater analogous to nom roden et al 2010 scott et al 1998 they can be chemically or microbially reduced in the environments to a certain extent furthermore they can potentially participate in bio geochemical processes that alter the fate and transport of the co existing contaminants such as as beiyuan et al 2017 niazi et al 2018a vithanage et al 2017 yang et al 2018b it has been well recognized that both ubc and dbc have significant differences in structural configuration and chemical composition e g element contents and types thus endowing their contrasting physicochemical properties e g surface charge complexation and redox properties qu et al 2016 yang et al 2018a therefore it can be rationally hypothesized that the two reduced ubc and dbc play different even contrasting roles in the fate of as in groundwater ubc constitutes active components in bulk biochar and often plays a primary role in the immobilization and redox transformation of as via various interaction mechanisms niazi et al 2018a qiao et al 2018 vithanage et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 for example both perilla leaf and japanese oak wood derived biochar particles immobilized as species with capacities of 3 85 11 01 mg g via both surface complexation and precipitation niazi et al 2018a niazi et al 2018b further as iii oxidation was found on the two ubcs in our recent study rice husk derived biochar particles negligibly immobilized as species in the ph range of 3 0 9 5 while as iii oxidation occurred zhong et al 2019 these studies however failed to examine the impacts of other naturally existing constituents such as ca2 on these processes in the co presence of ubc especially under anoxic conditions on one hand ubc can oxidize as iii to as v due to the presence of redox active moieties rams in spite of anoxic conditions zhong et al 2019 on the other hand ca2 can be readily adsorbed onto negatively charged ubc which may improve redox interactions between ubc and the negatively charged as anions by neutralizing ubc s surface negative charge marshall et al 2017 taken together the presence of ca2 play a significant role in enhancing as iii oxidation and subsequent immobilization by ubc in groundwater in contrast to numerous studies on ubc the effect of dbc on the im mobilization and redox transformation of as is often underestimated and poorly understood dong et al 2014 vithanage et al 2017 presumably the presence impact of dbc that has been neglected by many researchers dbc possesses more oxygen containing functional groups ofgs lower aromaticity and smaller fused aromatic clusters than ubc qu et al 2016 yang et al 2018a the abundant ofgs of dbc may compete with as iii for binding sites and complex as iii to generate dissolved as complex consequently promoting as mobility however ca2 can elevate the ionic strength of solution and decrease the negative charge of dbc both of which can trigger the aggregation and precipitation of dbc xu et al 2017 as a result ca2 is anticipated to be highly enriched in the aggregates and may subsequently stimulate chemical precipitation with as despite the redox inertness of ca2 it may protect semiquinone free radicals within dbc by ca2 bridging interactions and inducing intramolecular aggregation to reduce as iii oxidation similar to the effect of ca2 on the properties of nom palmer and von wandruszka 2001 yates and von wandruszka 1999 thus the presence of ca2 would complicate the oxidation and immobilization of as iii despite the significant understanding of the fate and transport of as in groundwater to date we still lack knowledge regarding the effects of the reduced ubc and dbc on the oxidation and immobilization of as iii in anoxic ca2 rich groundwater herein we prepared the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced rice husk derived biochar to explore their respective effects on the oxidation and immobilization of as iii in simulated alkaline ca2 rich groundwater we integrated wet chemistry experiments and multiple spectroscopic characterizations to elucidate the mechanisms of as iii immobilization in the co presence of biochar and ca2 in addition the effect of water chemistry including ca2 concentration 0 100 mm and solution ph 10 0 12 5 was examined the knowledge of this study can advance our understanding of the environmental effects and implications of rubc and rdbc released into alkaline ca2 rich groundwater on the fate and transport of as iii 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in this study are described in text s1 of supporting information si 2 2 preparation of rubc and rdbc and characterization biochar was typically produced by oxygen limited pyrolysis of rice husk and more details were provided in our previous study zhong et al 2019 in brief each 30 g of rice husk was placed in a silicon carbide vessel with cap and subsequently pyrolyzed in a muffle furnace under oxygen limited conditions at 400 c for 1 h afterwards the biochar sample was cooled to room temperature for collection to simulate the reduced state of biochar released into anoxic groundwater we performed the reduction experiment using the biochar suspension and a typically chemical reduction method in the dark according to a previous report roden et al 2010 after the reduction the biochar suspension was filtered using a 0 22 μm nylon membrane which is similar to a previous study yang et al 2018a the reduced rubc and rdbc are the retentate and permeate respectively more details involving the reduction and fractionation procedures are presented in text s2 of si the resulting reduced biochar fractions were hereby referred to as rubc and rdbc respectively and stored at 4 c in the dark before use the characterizations including the morphologies surface chemical properties crystalline structures and elemental compositions are provided in detail in text s3 of si 2 3 as iii immobilization experiments unless otherwise specified all batch experiments were conducted in a 250 ml magnetically stirred reactor filled and equilibrated with a 100 n2 under a standard atmosphere pressure at room temperature in the dark before the as iii immobilization experiments all solutions e g rdbc solution were sparged with ultrapure nitrogen for at least 2 h and all materials e g rubc and cacl2 2h2o were deoxygenated in a vacuum for at least 2 h for the rubc systems 0 2 g of rubc was added into 100 ml of 100 μm as iii solution to create 2 g l rubc suspension then adjusted to ph 11 5 0 1 with 0 01 and 0 1 m naoh solution afterwards the concurrent introductions of 0 735 g of cacl2 2h2o powder equal to 50 mm ca2 in the resulting solution and a desired amount of the naoh solution into the suspension were performed to initiate the as iii immobilization reaction for 24 h naoh solution was added again because the introduction of cacl2 2h2o powder would result in a serious decrease in the suspension ph desired reaction suspensions were filtrated with a 0 22 μm nylon membrane the dissolved as species was the permeate a 1 m hcl digestion was used to measure the total as species as tot in the unfiltered samples the immobilization fraction of each as species was calculated by subtracting the concentration of each as species in the aqueous phase from that of the corresponding as tot species in the unfiltered samples for the rdbc as iii immobilization tests a 156 5 mg rdbc as carbon l mg c l stock solution was used and the tests were conducted in the same manner as those used for the scenarios described above meanwhile we performed control experiments in the absence of either biochar i e rubc and rdbc or ca2 under the same experimental conditions all the experiments were performed in triplicate in addition the effects of ca2 concentration 0 100 mm and solution ph 10 0 12 5 on the as iii immobilization were investigated 2 4 analytical methods the as iii and as v concentrations were measured by using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 100plus shanghai wufeng scientific instrument co ltd coupled to a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer hg afs sa7800 beijing bohui innovation optoelectronic technology co ltd more details on the analysis of as species were described in our recent document zhong et al 2019 there were no organic as species consequently we assumed that as tot was equal to the sum of as iii and as v for both rubc and rdbc 3 results and discussion 3 1 apparent as iii immobilization associated with the presence of rubc and rdbc fig 1 a below shows that in the ca2 as iii system no observable immobilization of as iii by 50 mm of ca2 occurred at ph 11 5 under anoxic conditions which was consistent with no formation of ca as iii precipitates as predicted by mineql 4 6 model that is based on equilibrium chemical precipitation reactions fig 1b this observation demonstrates that as iii remained stable in the ca2 rich solution at ph 11 5 that is 50 mm of ca2 was not capable of immobilizing as iii upon the introduction of rubc into the ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization i e the sum of as iii and as v immobilization increased gradually from 0 to 73 1 μm within 24 h fig 1a in contrast our control experiment in the absence of ca2 revealed that rubc could not immobilize as iii which was ascribed to the following facts 1 the strong electrostatic repulsion between as anions predominant forms of haso3 2 h2aso3 haso4 and aso4 3 fig s1 and the negatively charged surface of rubc 38 1 mv fig s2 he et al 2018 van vinh et al 2015 2 the strong competitive adsorption between as anions and oh goh and lim 2004 3 the limited bet surface area of rubc 37 3 m2 g the results indicate that both rubc and ca2 synergistically enabled the apparent as iii immobilization unlike the immobilization in the rubc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization sharply jumped from 0 to 65 1 μm within 0 5 h and gradually increased to 89 6 μm afterwards in the rdbc ca2 as iii system fig 1a the details are further discussed later in section 3 3 no apparent as iii immobilization by rdbc occurred in the ca2 free solution and this was probably due to the formation of water soluble mixture and or complex which could pass through 0 22 μm nylon membrane although both rubc and rdbc participated in the apparent as iii immobilization in the presence of ca2 they might play different roles in the immobilization processes as highlighted by the significant discrepancies in the aforementioned immobilization behavior fig 1a 3 2 rubc induced oxidative precipitation of as iii with ca2 biochar particles as predominant reactive sinks have been reported to participate in redox reactions with some pollutants such as as and cr niazi et al 2018a wongrod et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 2019 in combination with our experimental observations fig 1a we hypothesize that rubc might interact with as iii e g redox reaction and increase the apparent as iii immobilization with ca2 it is important to note that neither rubc nor ca2 alone is capable of immobilizing as iii to verify this hypothesis we first explored the potential interactions of rubc alone with as iii in the absence of ca2 as iii in the solution was found to be completely oxidized by rubc within 8 h and the newly generated as v concentration in the solution increased significantly from 0 to 100 μm fig 2 a in contrast our control experiment without rubc revealed that as iii could not be oxidized to as v under the same conditions data not shown these findings suggest that rubc could fully oxidize as iii to as v at ph 11 5 as further supported by recent studies niazi et al 2018a niazi et al 2018b zhong et al 2019 this as iii oxidation could be a result of the presence of residual redox active moieties rams particularly quinoid co 1705 cm 1 and persistent free radicals pfrs on rubc fig s3 dong et al 2014 wan et al 2020 zhong et al 2019 as v has been well documented to have a higher binding affinity for ca2 than as iii tokunaga 1999 consequently the oxidation of as iii by rubc to generate as v would benefit the formation of ca as v precipitates and apparent as iii immobilization at ph 11 5 wang et al 2019 when ca2 was introduced into the rubc as iii system this was further evidenced by the model prediction which showed that as v completely precipitates as ca3 aso4 2 at ph 11 5 i e the concentrations of ca2 and as v were 50 mm and 100 μm respectively fig 1b it is worth noting that the model prediction 100 0 is far higher than that 73 1 in the rubc ca2 as iii system presumably due to the presence of rubc while this proposed hypothesis is plausible solid evidence favoring it is further invoked we therefore scrutinized the oxidation and solid liquid partitioning of as iii in the rubc ca2 as iii system in the aqueous phase we observed the accelerated and complete removal of as iii more precisely the accelerated as iii oxidation in the aqueous phase see below as compared with that in the absence of ca2 fig 2b ca2 is a redox inert component and not capable of oxidizing as iii as further confirmed by no production of as v in the ca2 as iii system fig s4 hence we attribute the positive effect of ca2 to the enhanced interactions between as iii anions and rams e g quinoid co and pfrs on rubc by neutralizing the negative charge on surface of rubc with the ca2 adsorption precipitation fig s2 and fig s5 furthermore the newly generated as v concentration in the solution increased significantly from 0 to 71 0 μm within 3 h but decreased to 27 0 μm afterwards this trend implies that as v was first generated from as iii oxidation by rubc and was gradually immobilized thereafter this was corroborated by the observation that the as v concentration in the solid phase significantly increased to 72 2 μm within 24 h fig 2b however no detectable as iii was found in the solid phase fig 2b which was approximately due to the complete as iii oxidation and or its considerably low affinity for both ca2 and rubc at ph 11 5 based on all the experimental observations and analyses we suggest that as iii was oxidized to as v by rubc and then the newly generated as v in the solution primarily precipitated with the adsorbed precipitated ca2 onto the surface of rubc we further performed several selected spectroscopic characterizations including sem eds ftir xps and xrd to prove that the proposed as iii oxidative immobilization occurs using sem eds characterization we first visualized the morphologies of rubc samples collected at the selected reaction stages hereafter denoted as rubc 0 5 rubc 8 and rubc 24 respectively as shown in fig 3 a rubc as the control sample had a smooth surface with no deposition of precipitates on its surface the corresponding eds elemental mappings analysis revealed that major elements were c and o and no ca and as only elements of interest were on the pristine rubc fig 3b e a small amount of the microparticles deposited on the surface of rubc 0 5 was observed when the reaction time was increased to 0 5 h though its surface seemed smooth fig 3f the abundant element ca was uniformly distributed in rubc 0 5 whereas negligible as was detected probably due to a considerably low concentration of as immobilized in rubc 0 5 fig 3i and j both the surfaces of rubc 8 and rubc 24 became far rougher meanwhile an increasing number of microparticles with larger size were visualized on rubc 8 and rubc 24 when the reaction time was further prolonged to 8 or 24 h fig 3k and p both the elements ca and as were further enriched on rubc 8 and rubc 24 fig 3n o s and t and the distribution of as was closely collocated with that of ca these results further confirm that ca2 was adsorbed onto the surface of rubc and followed by precipitation with as on its surface ftir was employed to examine changes in chemical properties of these samples during the as iii immobilization fig 4 a demonstrates no detectable changes in peaks at 1613 cm 1 aromatic cc 1384 cm 1 aliphatic ch3 1100 cm 1 aliphatic c o c c oh and c o and 800 cm 1 aromatic c h the ftir results suggest that these functional groups were not involved in the as iii immobilization however we found a significant decrease in relative peak intensity of quinoid co at 1705 cm 1 suggesting that quinoid co participated in the as iii oxidation zhong et al 2019 this is supported by the similar observation that benzoquinone could oxidize as iii to as v under slightly alkaline conditions qin et al 2016 in comparison with rubc three new peaks at 700 1500 cm 1 gradually appeared and their relative peak intensities presented the elevated trends when the reaction time was extended from 0 5 to 24 h specifically a new characteristic peak at 875 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of ca o asv and ca o indicating the formation of ca as v precipitates zhang et al 2015 meanwhile a small peak was detected at 712 cm 1 and was assigned to the asv o h stretching vibration of ca as v precipitates zhang et al 2015 in addition another characteristic peak was detected at 1482 cm 1 corresponding to the c o c stretching vibration of caco3 which was presumably due to interaction of atmospheric co2 with ca2 under alkaline conditions hu et al 2014 from the as 3d5 2 xps spectra in fig 4b only a peak appeared at 44 2 ev assigned to as v and its relative peak intensity exhibited an elevating trend with reaction time indicating the increasing generation of ca as v precipitates on the surfaces of these samples further xrd examination revealed that the ca as v precipitates were attributed to amorphous mineral because they did not have characteristic xrd peaks of ca as v components fig 4c overall all spectroscopic characterization observations and analyses were in good agreement with the aforementioned wet chemistry results supporting the proposed oxidative as iii immobilization by rubc via the generation of ca as v precipitates on the surface of rubc 3 3 in situ creation of highly enriched ca2 flocs with rdbc drives multiple as iii immobilization similar to ubc dbc has been reported to oxidize as iii under alkaline conditions dong et al 2014 this motivates us to examine the oxidation of as iii and partitioning of as iii produced as v by rdbc in the absence of ca2 as shown in fig 5 a all of the as species were present in the aqueous phase furthermore only a small amount 19 3 μm of as iii in this phase was oxidized to as v by rdbc due to the presence of quinoid co and pfrs fig s3 only the newly generated as v could be fully immobilized by chemical precipitation with 50 mm of ca2 in the rdbc free solution at ph 11 5 fig s6 these results suggest that in the rdbc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization might not be predominantly governed by the aforementioned oxidative as iii precipitation with ca2 as implied by our previous observations fig 1a as shown in fig 5b after the introduction of ca2 into the rdbc as iii system the oxidation and partitioning of as iii became different from those in the rubc ca2 as iii system in particular the as iii concentration in the solution dropped dramatically down from 100 to 26 4 μm within 0 5 h but the as v concentration increased slightly from 0 to 8 6 μm afterwards they maintained a slightly decreasing trend meanwhile in the solid phase the as iii concentration increased significantly from 0 to 60 6 μm within 0 5 h whereas the as v concentration rose slightly to 4 4 μm unlike the positive effect of ca2 on the as iii oxidation by rubc we found that the presence of ca2 could impede the oxidation of as iii to as v by rdbc fig 5 recently a similar phenomenon was observed for the negative effect of ca2 on the ferrous oxidation by nom jiang et al 2017 this impediment might be because the redox inert ca2 adsorbed precipitated on the surface inhibited electron transfers between as iii and rdbc and this reduced as iii oxidation overall these results clarify that most of as iii was non oxidatively immobilized by both rdbc and ca2 also these findings highlight that the as iii oxidative immobilization was not a major pathway in the rdbc ca2 as iii system and other possible mechanisms were likely to be involved unlike the absence of visible precipitates in our control systems i e the ca2 as iii and the dbc as iii systems we noticed an extraordinary phenomenon that plenty of light brown flocs in situ were generated upon the introduction of ca2 into the rdbc as iii system fig s7 a similar observation was found in the study of ca2 on the aggregation behavior of dissolved biochar at circumneutral ph xu et al 2017 this generation resulted from the significant aggregation of intramolecular within rdbc via two successive interactions 1 ca2 neutralized some of the negative surface charge of rdbc to weaken electrostatic repulsion between intramolecular within rdbc figs s2 and s5 xu et al 2017 2 ca2 subsequently bridged rdbc to promote the intimate contact each other yang et al 2018a the resulting flocs enabled the collective precipitation of as ca2 and rdbc as indicated by sem eds analysis below fig 6 there are three possible pathways accounting for the apparent as iii immobilization in the rdbc ca2 as iii system 1 complexation of as with rdbc derived oxygen containing functional groups ofgs in the flocs 2 physical enmeshment of as by the nascent rdbc ca flocs 3 chemical precipitation of as with highly enriched ca2 in the flocs since ofgs generally possess a lower affinity for as than ca2 particularly under highly alkaline conditions we can rule out the complexation pathway that causes the apparent as iii immobilization subsequently we checked physical enmeshment by delicately creating the rdbc ca flocs in situ for the as iii immobilization i e both rdbc and ca2 were first allowed to generate the flocs for 0 5 h then the resulting flocs was employed to immobilize as iii for another 24 h and were denoted as rdbc ca2 as iii as shown in fig s8 the physical enmeshment was estimated to approximately contribute to 21 8 of the apparent as iii immobilization fig 5b here the physical enmeshment was considered to work within the first 0 5 h because of the significant generation of the flocs also the results indicate that the resulting flocs could create a great number of active binding sites for as species resulting in about 78 2 of the apparent as iii immobilization for the active binding sites the most likely candidate is suggested to be ca within the flocs this is because ca possesses a higher affinity for as than other components including ofgs in rdbc particularly under highly alkaline conditions based on all the results and analyses we thus assert that in situ creation of the highly enriched ca in the nascent flocs predominantly drove the non oxidative precipitation of as iii and the oxidative precipitation of as iii had only slight immobilization effect also the physical enmeshment partially accounted for the apparent as iii immobilization to further confirm our proposed mechanisms we performed sem eds analysis on the flocs samples hereafter denoted as rdbc 0 5 rdbc 8 and rdbc 24 respectively collected from the rdbc ca2 as iii system at different stages as well as rdbc as shown in fig 6a e rdbc had a relatively smooth surface and predominant contained c and o elements and a slight amount of ca but no as whilst there was a slight amount of ca in rdbc it failed to immobilize the apparent as iii fig 5a because the ca concentration was far too low in contrast rdbc 0 5 had fine the stacked particle like flocs with a rougher surface which differed significantly from the pristine rdbc sample fig 6f furthermore the corresponding eds elemental mapping analysis elucidated that at the micron scale the element ca was highly enriched in the flocs and its elemental distribution was intimately correlated with the elemental distribution of as fig 6i and j however there was an insignificant correlation between the elemental distributions of c and as as well as ca these results suggest that rdbc could greatly facilitate the enrichment of ca and the resulting ca was capable of precipitating as the c containing components like aromatic structure in rdbc were not directly associated with the apparent as iii immobilization which was confirmed by no apparent as iii immobilization by rdbc fig 5a even after a prolonged reaction time we still observed almost the same phenomena on the rdbc 8 and rdbc 24 samples fig 6k t the negligible changes in morphologies and chemical compositions of the flocs indicated nearly complete precipitation of ca with as at the initial stage corresponding to 0 0 5 h and it was relatively independent of the reaction time ranging from 0 5 to 24 h ftir analysis was employed to identify the apparent as iii immobilization interactions in contrast to rubc rdbc possessed more ofgs including oh cooh and co and c o c and c oh as evidenced by the stronger intensities of characteristic peaks at 3400 3500 1500 1700 and 1000 1300 cm 1 respectively fig s3a and this is similar to previous findings qu et al 2016 furthermore this was supported by a higher ratio of o c in rdbc than that in rubc table s1 after the reaction the characteristic peaks at 1000 1700 cm 1 mainly corresponding to ofgs underwent either peak shift i e from 1656 to 1644 cm 1 and from 1106 to 1039 cm 1 or new peak were created at 1410 1490 cm 1 the ftir spectral changes indicate that ofgs interplayed with ca2 rather than as likely via complexation and or ca2 bridging modes xu et al 2017 since they possess a higher affinity for ca2 than as under highly alkaline conditions in addition the new peak at 871 cm 1 was smaller than that 875 cm 1 of ca o asv and ca o which could be assigned to ca o asiii and ca o other new characteristic peaks occurred at 568 604 cm 1 which were attributed to ca o h myneni 1998 this suggests the formation of ca as iii precipitates as well as ca containing components like ca oh 2 after the 0 5 h of reaction time the relative intensities of these characteristic peaks remained stable indicating the almost complete formation of ca as iii precipitates as well as ca containing components at the initial stage the as 3d5 2 xps spectra analysis revealed that as iii mainly prevailed in the resulting ca as precipitates and agreed with the observed fraction of as species fig 7 b a comparison of ca 2p3 2 xps spectra was performed to identify interactions of ca with as species for the selected rdbc samples i e rdbc 0 5 rdbc 8 and rdbc 24 the peaks of ca 2p3 2 xps spectra were located at 347 2 ev 0 4 ev lower than that 347 6 ev of the corresponding rubc samples i e rubc 0 5 rubc 8 and rubc 24 fig s9 this difference was close to that 0 5 ev of as 3d5 2 xps spectra 43 7 ev for the rdbc samples vs 44 2 ev for the rubc samples this implies that the interactions of the enriched ca with as should be assigned to chemical precipitation which is analogous to those in the rubc ca2 as iii system the resulting ca as iii v precipitates predominant ca as iii precipitates were identified to be amorphous minerals as confirmed by the absence of characteristic xrd patterns fig 7c which was presumably due to the presence of rdbc and or the short ageing time in summary all the characterizations and analyses have confirmed the proposed as iii immobilization mechanisms 3 4 effect of water chemistry on apparent as iii immobilization 3 4 1 effect of ca2 concentration ca2 is essential to the apparent as iii immobilization by both rubc and rdbc consequently we further investigated the effect of ca2 concentration on the immobilization 0 100 mm notably in the rubc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization increased from 4 8 to 18 7 to 73 1 and to 74 4 μm within 24 h when ca2 concentration rose from 0 to 10 to 50 and to 100 mm respectively fig 8 a this was because a higher concentration of ca2 was able to precipitate a larger amount of the newly generated as v from as iii oxidation by rubc into the solid phase as confirmed by our prediction results fig 1b moreover the increase in apparent as iii immobilization rate could be seen with the increasing ca2 concentration the increase in ca2 concentration could substantially neutralize the negative surface charge of rubc fig s2 thus facilitating as v generation by weakening the electrostatic repulsion between rubc and as iii anions fig 8b this could increase the precipitation of subsequent as v with ca2 these results indicate that the increase in ca2 concentration favored the as iii oxidative immobilization similarly we observed that increasing ca2 concentration significantly promoted the apparent as iii immobilization in the rdbc ca2 as iii system fig 8c however we found that further increasing ca2 concentration impeded the as iii oxidation by rdbc as verified by a lower as v concentration fig 8d this was because a higher ca concentration within the flocs exerted a stronger inhibition for electron transfers between as iii and rdbc considering our previous ftir analysis fig 7a this inhibition further revealed that the ca as iii precipitates occurred within the flocs via a ternary rdbc ca as iii complexation by ca2 bridging interactions between as iii and the ofgs of rdbc furthermore a higher apparent as iii immobilization but a lower as v generation concentration suggested that elevating ca2 concentration enhanced the apparent as iii immobilization via direct precipitation of as iii with ca2 it is worthy to note that for both the ternary systems increasing ca2 concentration beyond 50 mm has a negligible effect on the apparent as iii immobilization fig 8a and c this might be due to that available amounts of the active binding sites for as species have reached saturation when ca2 concentration was increased to about 50 mm in the presence of rubc and rdbc 3 4 2 effect of solution ph similar to ca2 increasing solution ph favored the apparent as iii immobilization in the rubc ca2 as iii system the apparent as iii immobilization increased significantly from 29 9 to 73 1 and to 89 9 μm with the ph increasing from 10 0 to 11 5 and to 12 5 respectively fig 9 a this could be explained by increased chemical precipitation of as v with ca2 and or adsorption of as v onto the newly generated ca oh 2 at a higher ph value figs 1b and s5 also we observed the accelerated apparent as iii immobilization rate with the increasing solution ph this was because the increase in as v generation rate facilitated subsequent as v precipitation with ca2 at a higher ph value fig 9a and b with respect to the accelerated oxidation of as iii to as v by rubc it might be due to a larger redox potential gap between redox couples on rubc and as v as iii couples at a higher ph value zhong et al 2019 these results indicate that elevating solution ph could stimulate as iii oxidation and subsequent precipitation of as v with ca2 further corroborating the proposed as iii oxidative immobilization in the rdbc ca2 as iii systems the apparent as iii immobilization increased markedly from 30 3 to 89 6 and then to 100 μm respectively as solution ph elevated from 10 0 to 11 5 and then to 12 5 fig 9c these observations indicate that a higher solution ph encouraged the apparent as iii immobilization a possible explanation involved a greater extent of chemical precipitation of as with ca2 and or adsorption of as species onto solid ca oh 2 at a higher solution ph figs 1b and s5 meantime the newly generated as v concentration increased from 8 3 to 9 6 and to 22 7 μm respectively fig 9d indicating that the increasing solution ph improved the as iii oxidation extent the enhanced oxidation of as iii to as v was possibly attributed to the increasing redox potential gap between redox couples on rdbc and as v as iii couples with the elevating solution ph which is similar to the eh ph diagrams for reduced nom as system jiang et al 2009 in conclusion the increase in the solution ph promoted the apparent as iii immobilization in both the rubc ca2 as iii and the rdbc ca2 as iii systems 3 5 environmental significance high as groundwater is widely distributed worldwide e g calcareous regions and poses a great threat to public health the geochemical processes determining the fate of as are often affected by both natural and engineered components our work describes the positive effects of the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced biochar on the abiotic oxidation and immobilization of as iii in simulated anoxic groundwater of calcareous regions largely relieving the as environmental risk our investigation further confirms that both rubc and rdbc can remove 72 4 and 72 1 of as tot from real groundwater collected from a local village in hunan province spiked with 100 μm as iii respectively table s2 to the best of our knowledge the large r ubc particles often have difficulty in entering into subsurface environments thus only a small amount of rubc may be present in natural subsurface environments furthermore rubc has a lower as iii immobilization capacity than rdbc in anoxic ca2 rich groundwater fig s10 consequently rubc may have a lower impact on the oxidation and immobilization of as iii in natural subsurface environments particularly under long term and strongly reducing conditions in contrast a massive amount of rdbc can be readily introduced into the subsurface environment and govern the apparent as iii immobilization via the non oxidative as iii precipitation as a consequence rdbc may deserve more attention on the fate of as iii in typical calcareous regions we acknowledge that natural subsurface environment is more complicated than the currently studied systems and thus further investigations e g effect of co existing anions including phosphate and carbonate need to be examined to advance our understanding of engineered black carbon such as biochar on the fate of as iii in the subsurface environment close to real calcareous aquifers 4 conclusions this study reports that as iii in anoxic ca2 rich groundwater can be efficiently immobilized by both the undissolved and dissolved fractions of reduced biochar via contrasting interaction mechanisms under alkaline conditions our results reveal that rubc completely oxidized as iii to as v and subsequently precipitated with ca2 adsorbed precipitated on its surface in contrast rdbc underwent a flocculation process induced by ca2 thus forming the extremely enriched ca2 in the flocs that predominantly drives precipitation with as iii meanwhile both physical enmeshment of as iii by the nascent flocs and as iii oxidative precipitation slightly account for the apparent as iii immobilization the apparent as iii immobilization depends strongly on water chemistry including ca2 concentration and solution ph both the increases in ca2 concentration and solution ph can significantly promote the apparent as iii immobilization our findings elucidate the unintended environmental effects of undissolved and dissolved fractions of biochar on the fate and transport of as iii in aquifers of calcareous regions this study may suggest an alternative strategy candidate for remediation of high as groundwater of calcareous regions by injecting

17778,this study aims to extend and demonstrate the application of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the water quality of three differently operated full scale drinking water treatment plants located in the shenzhen city china a ratio of fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom which describes relative changes in humic like to protein like fluorescence was used to explain mechanisms behind the physicochemical processes the fluorescence components obtained through individual and combined parallel factor analysis parafac modeling revealed the presence of humic like c1 and protein like c2 structures in the dom the c1 c2 ratio provided a direct relationship between the seasonal variations and dom composition wet season generated dom enriched with humic like fluorescence while dry season caused a higher release of protein like fluorescence the fluorescence ratio presented unique patterns of dom in treatment trains the chemical pretreatment and disinfection unit processes showed a higher tendency to remove the humic like fluorescence however the c1 c2 ratio increased during physical treatment processes such as coagulation precipitation and sand filtration indicating preferential removal of protein like fluorescence the dom composition in influent directly r2 0 77 influenced the relative intensities of fluorescence components in the treated water compared to the dry season the wet season caused significant changes in dom composition and produced treated water enriched with humic like fluorescence this fluorescence ratio offers an approach to explore the role of different treatment units and determine the factors affecting the composition of dom in the surface water and drinking water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water dissolved organic matter eem parafac fluorescence ratio seasonal changes 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom are ubiquitous in surface water bodies and widely recognized to pose concerns related to the relevance and effectiveness of water treatment processes the dom are the fractions of organic matter that passes through a 0 45 μm filter zsolnay 2003 in drinking water treatment plants the dom could induce membrane fouling during membrane filtration shorten the lifespan of the adsorption media increase the coagulant dose and reduce the efficacy of the oxidation processes baghoth et al 2011 ersan et al 2016 together with an unpleasant taste odor and color issues dom could be considered as a reservoir of the carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps formed during chlorination and chloramination hua and reckhow 2007 yang et al 2008 therefore effective removal and monitoring the dom composition are essential to warrant the success of a water treatment plant and to achieve the desired quality for intended water use chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometry have been the conventional means of detecting and quantifying dom in water and wastewater li et al 2020 these parameters are incapable of reflecting the chemical composition of dom that are complex and have a wide range of molecular structure size distribution hydrophobicity and aromaticity lavonen et al 2015 li et al 2017 recently fluorescence spectroscopy has emerged as a most compelling real time tool to track and assess the fate of dom in the natural and engineered systems li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 this is because it offers several advantages including high sensitivity small sample volume robustness and rapidity carstea et al 2016 some fluorescence based indices have been developed to represent the changes in dom composition ding et al 2018 peleato et al 2017 for example fluorescence based humification hix and biological bix indices have commonly been used to assess the relative distribution of allochthonous and autochthonous dom sources in surface water bodies hansen et al 2016 ohno 2002 technological advances have allowed us to further observe fluorophores in three dimensional excitation emission matrices 3d eem several fluorescence peaks could be observed in surface water bodies these peaks represent typical fluorophores including humic like i e peak a c1 c2 m tyrosine like i e peak b and tryptophan like i e peak t baghoth et al 2011 henderson et al 2009 the significance of these fluorescence peaks is evident from the available literature as they could be easily linked with other parameters such as doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don gu et al 2020 hu and ren 2016 hua et al 2018 despite the popularity of fluorescent indices and 3d eem these approaches merely estimate the qualitative information about fluorophore changes due to the overlapping of fluorescent peaks to address this limitation the concept of excitation emission matrix coupled parallel factor analysis eem parafac which was introduced by stedmon et al 2003 can be used this mathematical approach helps decompose the bulk fluorescent f dom into several individual components based on their unique characteristics and structure it can also facilitate to gain in depth insights on the dynamics of each fluorescent component in a semi quantitative manner ishii and boyer 2012 yang et al 2015 in this context the fate of fdom components has effectively been tracked during lab scale experiments for example peleato et al 2017 reported higher removal of the humic like fdom than protein like following the treatment of raw wastewater using two advanced oxidation processes aops namely o3 and h2o2 in another study coagulants showed higher affinity towards the humic like component with higher molecular weight and higher aromaticity in dominant terrestrial resources aftab and hur 2017 by contrast in the case of autochthonous resources the protein like component was readily removed as compared to the humic like component ly et al 2019a the sequence and removal of different fdom have also been investigated during adsorption using different types of adsorbents lee et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the fdom components have been reported to correlate with membrane fouling propensity liu et al 2011 ly et al 2019b application of the eem parafac based approach in full scale water wastewater treatment plants has been reported previously baghoth et al 2011 sanchez et al 2013 shutova et al 2014 vera et al 2017 yang et al 2017 for example sanchez et al 2013 employed eem parafac to determine the long term impacts of coagulation on fdom at full scale also this approach was implemented to probe the removal of fdom in five different drinking water treatment plants located in australia shutova et al 2014 importantly the relationship between fdom and conventional parameters e g doc has also been assessed in different treatment units shutova et al 2014 vera et al 2017 in a study by baghoth et al 2011 tryptophan like and tyrosine like components could be correlated with the sub fractions of the biopolymers algal blooms and humification are the two main phenomena responsible for causing change in the composition of dom besides anthropogenic sources also constitute a part of these wang et al 2019 in a study by li et al 2018 the fdom concentration in one of the northern watersheds of china was monitored and reported to contain a relatively high concentration of the protein like component than the humic like component in another study the land use practices were linked with the distribution of fdom in drinking water reservoirs shi et al 2020 the concentration and composition of dom in the influent and effluent can facilitate in determining the efficacy of the operational units li et al 2017 although application of the eem parafac in the full scale drinking water treatment of australia and netherland has already been reported it is noteworthy that the ambient climate largely governs the relative chemical composition of dom in addition the geological and hydrological conditions such as flow rate rainfall pattern and temperature of the given aquatic system as well as treatment practices could also affect the dom composition ejarque et al 2017 quang et al 2015 shi et al 2020 indeed the norwegian freshwater was reported to contain a higher concentration of humic substances than that in australian freshwater fabris et al 2008 this study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical application of fluorescence spectroscopy particularly eem parafac to assess the water quality of full scale drinking water treatment plants surface water is the primary source of drinking water in shenzhen china and the quality of raw water may be affected by seasonal variations in the context of the discussion mentioned above related to the significance of dom as well as application of the fluorescence spectroscopy specific objectives of this study include i assessing the effect of seasonal variations on the dynamics of fdom ratio in the influent of the three drinking water treatment plants in the shenzhen ii implementing the eem parafac model for elucidating the relative changes in fdom composition in different physicochemical processes of drinking water treatment plants and iii investigating the relationship between the fdom composition in influent and treated water using the fluorescence ratio based indicators 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the samples from three different water treatment plants were collected monthly for a period of one year i e from july 2018 to july 2019 all these three plants are in the shenzhen city of china due to its subtropical climate weather of the city is mild with plenty of sunshine and the summer in the city usually lasts for six months the climate rainfall and temperature of the city during the sampling period is presented in fig s1 the monthly rainfall data of the shenzhen city was obtained from an online platform https en tutiempo net climate according to the rainfall mm data the city can be characterized into two seasons dry season october to march and wet season april to september liang et al 2019 this city has become an exclusive economic zone and is growing rapidly with increasing urban sprawls and agricultural lands converted to industrial and commercial zones wu et al 2020 all the three drinking water treatment plants receive raw water from different reservoirs the characteristics of the reservoir catchment areas are presented in table s1 in addition to the runoff from the catchment these reservoirs receive recharge water from the dongjiang river after physical and chemical treatments this river supplies fresh water to southern cities of china dongguan and shenzhen and hong kong the samples were collected monthly from the inlet and the outlet of each unit process the samples were collected in 5 l mild cleaned plastic bottles and were immediately transferred to the laboratory in the tsinghua shenzhen international graduate school shenzhen china all the samples were stored at 4 c before further treatment and analysis pretreatment of the samples includes filtration through pre washed 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter advantec japan aftab and hur 2017 phong and hur 2015 all the analytical characterizations were performed within 24 h of sample collection 2 2 configuration of drinking water treatment plants the layout of each drinking water treatment plant is shown in fig 1 these plants are categorized as follows i plant a has a peroxidation unit followed by coagulation precipitation sand filtration and disinfection ii plant b has the same treatment processes as plant a with the addition of carbon filtration before disinfection and iii pant c has a coagulation flocculation unit followed by membrane based filtration and disinfection according to the treatment plant management plant a plant b and plant c have a design capacity of 5 0 105 2 0 105 and 4 0 104 m3 day respectively the influent of each plant originates from a different reservoir plant a and plant c use polyaluminum chloride pacl while plant b uses basic aluminum chloride for coagulation and the typical coagulant dose was around 1 8 mg l at all treatment plants pre oxidation of raw water using kmno4 0 1 0 5 mg l and o3 around 0 5 mg l is carried out before the physical treatment processes in the plants a and b respectively the carbon filter is used as an adsorption media in the plant b disinfection is performed using naocl in all drinking water treatment plants a continuously operated ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane is installed in the plant c according to the supplier dow chemical company it is a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane with a pore size of 0 03 μm 2 3 analytical characterization turbidity electrical conductivity ec and the ph of the samples were measured on site using portable meters 2100q and hq40d hach japan filtered samples were used to measure total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn using a toc tn analyzer toc v shimadzu japan the nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations were determined using the ultra violet uv spectroscopy method outlined in the standard examination methods for drinking water nonmetal parameters china gb t 5750 5 2006 a detailed methodology of the determination of n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential ndma fp is presented in supporting information 2 4 uv vis fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular weight distribution the filtered samples were used to collect the fluorescence and uv vis spectra using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan and uv vis spectroscopy uv 2600 shimadzu japan respectively the 1 cm four sided quartz cell was used to collect broad uv vis spectra 200 800 nm with 1 nm step of all water samples and the same cuvette was used for obtaining the fluorescence spectra higher concentration of dom in the water samples can cause inner filter effects which would lead to the incorrect estimation of fluorescence spectra to avoid this the filtered samples were diluted ensuring uv absorbance at 254 nm of less than 0 05 cm 1 for each sample quang et al 2016 three dimensional eems were collected with following adjusted parameters the excitation ex and emission em ranges were set from 220 to 450 nm and 280 600 nm with scan steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively the eems were obtained with a scan speed of 30 000 nm min while keeping both the ex and em slits fixed at 5 nm each the instrument used was found to be stable at different scan speeds the eems of milli q water 18 ωm as blank was subtracted from the eems of all samples using built in software to remove raman scatterings the humification index hix and biological index bix were calculated from the eems of the analyzed samples the calculation of hix was based on the emission spectrum areas under the wavelengths of 435 480 nm to 300 345 nm at ex of 255 nm hansen et al 2016 ohno 2002 on the other hand bix was estimated using a ratio of em intensity at 380 430 nm at an ex of 310 nm hansen et al 2016 the molecular weight distribution of dom in the influent was measured using a high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec its methodology and procedure can be found elsewhere lin et al 2015 2 5 parafac modeling the parafac modeling was applied on eem datasets obtained for samples from each water treatment plant in addition it was applied to the combined eems of the water treatment plants total samples used for the combined modeling are 209 with 72 82 and 55 samples collected from the plant a plant b and plant c respectively the plant c was only monitored for 11 months while two of the samples from the plant b were lost during transportation to the laboratory the parafac modeling was performed based on the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 which uses the domflour toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc usa the parafac analysis comprises the following steps i initial processing to remove scattering by cutting a few wavelengths ii applying non negativity constraints iii estimating the loading leverage iv identification and removal of an outlier if any and v split half analysis and validation for a suitable number of components in this analysis fmax was used as the representative of maximum fluorescence intensity for an individual component which represents a specific fluorescence dom e g humic like and protein like fmax was normalized by using the raman integration method as explained previously lawaetz and stedmon 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 water chemistry of influent and treated water regardless of water treatment plants the influent characteristics e g doc tn turbidity are largely governed by seasonal variations table 1 for example the doc concentrations of plants a b and c in the influent varied from 2 94 to 7 92 1 32 to 3 90 and 1 76 to 9 18 mgc l respectively our results demonstrate that a significant difference in basic water quality parameters of the three water treatment plants exists influent water quality of the plants a and c were comparable but significantly different than that of the plant b for example the doc concentration in the influent of the plants a and c was significantly p 0 001 one way anova higher to that of plant b fig s2 this could be attributed to the difference in the land use pattern of catchment areas cunha et al 2016 notably the treatment processes imposed a profound impact on the water quality e g doc of the treated water and the difference in the basic water quality parameters following treatment was insignificant p 0 05 anova the average doc concentration at the outlet of the plants a b and c was 1 81 1 02 1 93 0 53 and 1 87 0 71 mgc l respectively similar observations were reported previously in several studies that compared the performance of water treatment plants with different treatment processes gibert et al 2015 marais et al 2018 such analysis merely provides the estimation of the bulk concentration and cannot facilitate in elucidating the composition of dom the focus of the current study is to assess the relative changes in fdom due to seasonal variations and understand the impacts of different treatment processes on the composition of fdom which could help in determining the fate of dom during different treatment processes commonly employed at full scale 3 2 eem parafac modeling fluorescence components obtained after eem parafac modeling both individual and combined are shown in fig 2 firstly the model was applied to the eem datasets obtained for each treatment plant it provided different numbers of validated components in dom three fdom components described the features of eems in the plant a while only two were found in the plants b and c when peak positions of the fluorescence components among three different individual models were compared the component c3 appears to be unique to the plant a in the second approach the combined eems of water treatment plants were validated by eem parafac modeling which provided two fdom components c1 and c2 in this study reasonable numbers of fdom components were selected using the split half validation approach as reported previously lee et al 2015 shutova et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the combined eem parafac was developed using eems obtained from 209 samples collected from the water treatment plants the peaks positions of these components along with their assignments as well as the relevant literature are presented in table s2 both the individual and combined approaches were used for bias estimation in the spectrum of the parafac models previous studies have reported potential bias in the combined model applied to the eems of the water samples collected from different sources yu et al 2015 according to previous studies c1 and c2 c3 represent the humic like and protein like fdom respectively cory and mcknight 2005 vera et al 2017 specifically the component c1 located beyond the emission of 380 nm are assigned to humic like fluorescence and they are believed to originate from microbial humification and or terrestrial humic substances li et al 2014 yamashita and jaffé 2008 on the other hand c2 and c3 with the peaks located at 380 nm are assigned to different protein like fluorescence moieties tryptophan and tyrosine like amino acids are the primary sources of such fluorescence signatures with the former located at longer emission than the later baghoth et al 2011 the rationale behind using the combined parafac model for understanding the dynamics of fdom in all three water treatment plants is evident from the strong correlation between the sums of protein like components c2 c3 in the individual model of the plant a vs c2 concentration obtained from the combined modeling of the respective water samples this strong correlation r2 0 83 p 0 001 depicts the mutual dynamics of these components as presented in fig 3 the odd number of components between individual and combined eem parafac models were also reported in a few previous studies shutova et al 2014 yu et al 2015 for instance shutova et al 2014 obtained the datasets of different eems by combining the spectra of the similar treatment units from five different treatment facilities such as raw water model coagulation model and filtration separation model they observed that few components were common in all these models since the parafac model make neither assumptions about the spectral shapes nor the structure of parameters similar spectral shapes obtained from two completely independent models derived from a different set of samples represent the underlying chemical phenomenon coble et al 2014 in this study the two common components in all water treatment plants indicated that hydrological activities in reservoirs of the shenzhen city are possibly identical therefore following discussion is mainly focused on the exploration of the dynamics of these two components humic like c1 and protein like c2 validated through the combined eems dataset 3 3 impacts of seasonal variations on fdom the dynamics of humification and biological associated organic matter in the influent from three reservoirs were determined and compared using two approaches viz the conventional fluorescence indices like hix and bix fig s3 and eem parafac fig 4 in general the hix and bix of the influents ranged from 28 to 41 and 14 36 respectively these values were significantly lower than that obtained for the fluorescence ratio c1 c2 depending on the seasonal variations i e dry or wet season c1 c2 values were observed to range between 72 and 91 fig 4 here the eem parafac based fluorescence ratio was compared with these traditional indices and found to be more robust in explaining the dom composition in different seasons and treatment processes influence of seasonal variations on fdom dynamics has not been reported yet in any southern city of china and this is reported for the first time in this study as illustrated in fig 4 and fig s1 during the period from july to september 2018 305 534 mm of rainfall was recorded representing a wet season on the other hand during the dry season i e from october 2018 to february 2019 rainfall of only 4 8 57 6 mm was recorded the results of this study showed that the relative abundances of fluorescence components had a direct relation with seasonal variations during the wet season relatively more humic like fluorescence was recorded which was possibly due to the washout of various soil leaf derived organic substances from the catchment into water supplies mostly rivers and lakes quang et al 2015 by contrast the enhanced presence of protein like fluorescence during the dry season could be due to the stimulated microbial activity particularly in stagnant flow regimes such as freshwater reservoirs ly et al 2017 the average fmax r u values of both components in the source which was calculated considering season variations are presented in fig s4 which demonstrated an increase of humic like c1 in the plants a and c during the wet season and an increase of protein like component in the source water of plant b in the dry season the fluorescence ratio obtained from all three reservoirs correlated p 0 05 well with monthly total rainfall data and or the average temperature fig 4 our study was in good agreement with several field studies that have reported an increase in humic like or humic substances intensity than that of protein like during the wet season and vice versa recorded during the dry season with lower temperatures shi et al 2020 yang et al 2019 for instance shi et al 2020 found a positive correlation between the terrestrial humic like fluorescence and flood seasons in lake tianmu and yangtze river land activities within the area could be another factor that may have an impact on the quality of the influent as reported previously herzsprung et al 2012 hur et al 2014b the runoff from the intensive agriculture contains abundant nutrients such as n p together with temperature it provides the ideal environment for microbial growth which could cause a change in the relative ratio of protein like vs humic substances thus affecting dom composition williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 in a previous study the link between the anthropogenic activities in urban areas and croplands with the higher generation of humic like components was reported shi et al 2020 this fluorescence ratio can be indirectly linked with the molecular weight distribution of the aquatic dom previous studies have determined this relation by combining fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography brezinski and gorczyca 2019 chon et al 2017 in this study the presence of biopolymers in influents was confirmed from the results obtained following the analysis of samples for molecular weight distribution fig s5 the contribution of large size molecules 3k da was found to be 23 3 9 9 30 9 for plant a plant b and plant c respectively a direct relation was observed between the fluorescence ratio of the influent and treated water at all water treatment plants fig 5 it is interesting to note that seasonal variations not only impacted the influent quality but also appeared to govern the dom composition in treated water this indicates that the selected water treatment plants showed a proportionate treatability during season variations as explained in the next section unlike the conventional parameters the eem parafac based ratio could help in determining the temporal impacts on the dom composition in raw water i e influent the above discussion infers that the composition of the dom in the influent could change with seasonal variations and the ratio of humic like to protein like is an appropriate index for studying such dynamics 3 4 fluorescence ratio in different treatment units the relative changes of humic and protein like fluorescence throughout the treatment units of water treatment plants with different treatment processes are shown in fig 6 the overall layouts of three water treatment plants can be divided into physical and chemical unit operations pretreatment using kmno4 and o3 in plants a and b respectively as well as disinfection by naocl in all three plants have been classified as chemical treatment while the rest of the treatment units are collectively called as physical treatment units pre oxidation is the first unit operation in the treatment train of two of the facilities plants a and b fig 6 presents the change in the c1 c2 throughout the physicochemical treatment units mainly chemical pretreatments caused a decrease in fluorescence ratio showing preferential removal of humic like fluorescence than the protein like component the chemistry behind the results supports the dynamic of such changes in c1 c2 i e humic like aromatic structures are more prone to chemical degradation than the large molecular weight biopolymers including protein like baghoth et al 2011 bose and reckhow 2007 to understand the changes in the fluorescence ratio during physicochemical processes as a function of seasonal variations few sets of complete treatment trains covering the wet and dry seasons were selected fig 6 the kmno4 based pre oxidation in plant a proactively removed the humic like fluorescence than the o3 based oxidation in plant b the relative change in c1 c2 values of the influent at plant a vs plant b was found to be 51 vs 25 9 6 vs 56 and 47 vs 23 during the wet season in 2018 dry season and wet season in 2019 respectively the extent of treatability such as contact time or oxidant concentration in these different plants could be a reason for such results the impacts of pretreatments on dom have also been discussed in literature and were reported to achieve better removal of humic like fluorescence among the fluorescence moieties use of o3 4 mg l was demonstrated to achieve preferential removal of microbial and terrestrial humic like fluorescence by up to 79 from surface water as compared to protein like fluorescence around 68 cheng et al 2016 coagulation is the next unit process in two plants a and b and the first in plant c different pretreatment kmno4 vs o3 in plants a and b influenced the coagulation differently plants a and c showed an increase in fluorescence while a decrease was observed in plant b according to the available literature the performance of kmno4 for dom oxidation has been compared to that achieved by o3 change in functional groups and charge on dom could be the reason for such contrasting results xie et al 2016 another factor could be the type of coagulants used in plant b aluminum chloride was used as the coagulant in plant b while plant a and c used poly aluminum chloride as the coagulant kabsch korbutowicz 2005 based on the fluorescence ratio and intensities presented in fig 6 and fig s6 the highest removal of c1 was 20 88 56 89 and 9 69 in plant a plant b and plant c respectively removal of c2 by coagulation process ranged between 37 0 plant b and 55 21 plant c during physical processes from coagulation to sand filter the fluorescence ratio was found to increase which indicates the efficient removal of protein like rather than humic like component results of this study are in line with previous studies that used fluorescence spectroscopy to track the changes in dom during drinking water treatment for example ly et al 2018 reported a 20 and 40 removal of humic like and protein like respectively in the coagulation unit using alum in another study vera et al 2017 reported up to 60 removal of protein like components by granular activated carbon and lavonen et al 2015 reported only 6 and 15 removal of humic like and protein like respectively during sand filtration in this study relatively stable fluorescence ratio was observed in the physical treatment units of the water treatment plants during the dry season this could be due to the lower availability of the humic like substances in the influent with a proportionate change in protein like fluorescence the decrease in the fluorescence ratio after the membrane based separation in plant c indicated the addition of protein like components from the membrane foulants it could also be ascribed to the long term operation which promotes the development of biofilm on the membrane surface hörsch et al 2005 previous studies suggest that the biofilm could utilize the substances within the aqueous solution and can release extracellular polymeric substances during respiration neubrand et al 2010 vrouwenvelder et al 1998 increased fluorescence intensities after filtration have also been reported especially in warmer seasons regions in addition filtration media and membrane surface may host microbial communities capable of contributing to dom concentration in a study by bridgeman et al 2014 carbon isotopic characterization of dom during water treatment indicated the presence of a few indigenous sources of organic contents these sources may include abrasion of adsorption media biofilm development and filtration further studies should be carried out to confirm these sources in a previous study on dom removal in a full scale treatment plant ultrafiltration did not show any removal of dom however reverse osmosis was reported to effectively retain around 90 of dom vera et al 2017 the disinfection of the treated water with naocl influenced the composition of dom likewise the action of chemical disinfection also preferred the removal of the humic like component than that of protein like meanwhile disinfection has proved to be effective toward removing the dom in drinking water up to some extent a few previous studies have reported findings of destruction and deactivation of microorganisms along with substantial changes in the composition of the dom gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 few previous studies have also employed the fdom ratio contribution approach to study aquatic systems with a range of objectives for example lee et al 2018 developed a fluorescence ratio using eem parafac modeling and determined the relationship of dom composition with dbps formation during a simulated rainfall experiment on biochar in another study by hur et al 2014a phenanthrene showed a positive correlation with humic like component and a negative correlation with protein like component of dom extracted from sediment similarly in this study c1 c2 was also found to be associated with ndma fp results are presented in fig s7 the dry season with a lower c1 c2 ratio led to a higher ndma fp in treated water and vice verse was observed for the wet season similar to the previous studies by shutova et al 2014 and vera et al 2017 this research comprehensively discusses the changes in dom composition at the influent and the effluent i e treated water of multiple drinking water treatment plants this research is unique because it explores the relationship between the changes in dom composition and seasonal varaitions in a sub tropical region the dom composition is ascribed to the enormous difference in rainfall between the wet and dry seasons rainfall and temperature control the microbial activities and release of terrestrial contents impacts of rainfall and temperature on fdom composition in treated water could be linked with source water quality and activities in the reservoir catchment area the obtained results from the physicochemical processes of treatment facilities showed selectivity of these treatment units toward the different organic fractions in terms of the eem parafac components moreover based on spectroscopy measurements this study found that influent water quality fluctuates with seasonal variations this is an important findings of this study suggesting regular adjustments in operational parameters e g coagulant dose and adsorbent replenishment to achieve a stable effluent quality not only in terms of basic water quality parameters but also for dom composition this study is a way forward for the development of fluorescence indices for engineered systems compared to the previously employed and recommended indices hix and bix for limnology and oceanography in the future a suitable range of fluorescence ratio should be proposed for monitoring the operating conditions for quality control assurance after each treatment unit the fluorescence approach could also help in determining the nature of dom released from treatment facilities this would help to assess the bioavailability of these organic contents and to estimate the microbial biofilm formation potential of treated water in water distribution networks 4 conclusions in this study fluorescence based ratio was employed to explore the relative changes in the protein and humic like components of dom during water treatment at full scale the sensitivity of fdom effectively explained the mechanisms involved in differently operated drinking water plants and the role of physicochemical unit processes in changing the dom composition from influent to treated water was studied the following are the conclusions drawn from the results individual and combined eem parafac models provided the different numbers of components broadly divided into humic like and protein like fluorescence two of the components with similar peak positions were found to be common in all three drinking water plants fluorescence ratio humic like protein like c1 c2 presented the impacts of seasonal variations on the composition of dom in the influent of drinking water treatment plants originating from the different reservoirs of the shenzhen city the rainfall and temperature directly correlated with the change in the fluorescence ratio the wet season and high temperature accelerated the production of the dom with a high intensity of humic like fluorescence while the dry season supported the accumulation of protein like components in the reservoir relative changes in humic like and protein like provided the mechanism of removal of dom in chemical treatment units including pretreatment and disinfection as well as the removal through the physical processes including coagulation precipitation filtration through sand filter and membrane filtration units fluorescence ratio provided more susceptibility of removal for the humic like component in chemical treatment units including pretreatment and disinfection on the other hand it presented a less abundance of protein like fluorescence during physical treatment units declaration of competing interest the authors

17778,this study aims to extend and demonstrate the application of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the water quality of three differently operated full scale drinking water treatment plants located in the shenzhen city china a ratio of fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom which describes relative changes in humic like to protein like fluorescence was used to explain mechanisms behind the physicochemical processes the fluorescence components obtained through individual and combined parallel factor analysis parafac modeling revealed the presence of humic like c1 and protein like c2 structures in the dom the c1 c2 ratio provided a direct relationship between the seasonal variations and dom composition wet season generated dom enriched with humic like fluorescence while dry season caused a higher release of protein like fluorescence the fluorescence ratio presented unique patterns of dom in treatment trains the chemical pretreatment and disinfection unit processes showed a higher tendency to remove the humic like fluorescence however the c1 c2 ratio increased during physical treatment processes such as coagulation precipitation and sand filtration indicating preferential removal of protein like fluorescence the dom composition in influent directly r2 0 77 influenced the relative intensities of fluorescence components in the treated water compared to the dry season the wet season caused significant changes in dom composition and produced treated water enriched with humic like fluorescence this fluorescence ratio offers an approach to explore the role of different treatment units and determine the factors affecting the composition of dom in the surface water and drinking water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water dissolved organic matter eem parafac fluorescence ratio seasonal changes 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom are ubiquitous in surface water bodies and widely recognized to pose concerns related to the relevance and effectiveness of water treatment processes the dom are the fractions of organic matter that passes through a 0 45 μm filter zsolnay 2003 in drinking water treatment plants the dom could induce membrane fouling during membrane filtration shorten the lifespan of the adsorption media increase the coagulant dose and reduce the efficacy of the oxidation processes baghoth et al 2011 ersan et al 2016 together with an unpleasant taste odor and color issues dom could be considered as a reservoir of the carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps formed during chlorination and chloramination hua and reckhow 2007 yang et al 2008 therefore effective removal and monitoring the dom composition are essential to warrant the success of a water treatment plant and to achieve the desired quality for intended water use chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrometry have been the conventional means of detecting and quantifying dom in water and wastewater li et al 2020 these parameters are incapable of reflecting the chemical composition of dom that are complex and have a wide range of molecular structure size distribution hydrophobicity and aromaticity lavonen et al 2015 li et al 2017 recently fluorescence spectroscopy has emerged as a most compelling real time tool to track and assess the fate of dom in the natural and engineered systems li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 this is because it offers several advantages including high sensitivity small sample volume robustness and rapidity carstea et al 2016 some fluorescence based indices have been developed to represent the changes in dom composition ding et al 2018 peleato et al 2017 for example fluorescence based humification hix and biological bix indices have commonly been used to assess the relative distribution of allochthonous and autochthonous dom sources in surface water bodies hansen et al 2016 ohno 2002 technological advances have allowed us to further observe fluorophores in three dimensional excitation emission matrices 3d eem several fluorescence peaks could be observed in surface water bodies these peaks represent typical fluorophores including humic like i e peak a c1 c2 m tyrosine like i e peak b and tryptophan like i e peak t baghoth et al 2011 henderson et al 2009 the significance of these fluorescence peaks is evident from the available literature as they could be easily linked with other parameters such as doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don gu et al 2020 hu and ren 2016 hua et al 2018 despite the popularity of fluorescent indices and 3d eem these approaches merely estimate the qualitative information about fluorophore changes due to the overlapping of fluorescent peaks to address this limitation the concept of excitation emission matrix coupled parallel factor analysis eem parafac which was introduced by stedmon et al 2003 can be used this mathematical approach helps decompose the bulk fluorescent f dom into several individual components based on their unique characteristics and structure it can also facilitate to gain in depth insights on the dynamics of each fluorescent component in a semi quantitative manner ishii and boyer 2012 yang et al 2015 in this context the fate of fdom components has effectively been tracked during lab scale experiments for example peleato et al 2017 reported higher removal of the humic like fdom than protein like following the treatment of raw wastewater using two advanced oxidation processes aops namely o3 and h2o2 in another study coagulants showed higher affinity towards the humic like component with higher molecular weight and higher aromaticity in dominant terrestrial resources aftab and hur 2017 by contrast in the case of autochthonous resources the protein like component was readily removed as compared to the humic like component ly et al 2019a the sequence and removal of different fdom have also been investigated during adsorption using different types of adsorbents lee et al 2015 yang et al 2018 the fdom components have been reported to correlate with membrane fouling propensity liu et al 2011 ly et al 2019b application of the eem parafac based approach in full scale water wastewater treatment plants has been reported previously baghoth et al 2011 sanchez et al 2013 shutova et al 2014 vera et al 2017 yang et al 2017 for example sanchez et al 2013 employed eem parafac to determine the long term impacts of coagulation on fdom at full scale also this approach was implemented to probe the removal of fdom in five different drinking water treatment plants located in australia shutova et al 2014 importantly the relationship between fdom and conventional parameters e g doc has also been assessed in different treatment units shutova et al 2014 vera et al 2017 in a study by baghoth et al 2011 tryptophan like and tyrosine like components could be correlated with the sub fractions of the biopolymers algal blooms and humification are the two main phenomena responsible for causing change in the composition of dom besides anthropogenic sources also constitute a part of these wang et al 2019 in a study by li et al 2018 the fdom concentration in one of the northern watersheds of china was monitored and reported to contain a relatively high concentration of the protein like component than the humic like component in another study the land use practices were linked with the distribution of fdom in drinking water reservoirs shi et al 2020 the concentration and composition of dom in the influent and effluent can facilitate in determining the efficacy of the operational units li et al 2017 although application of the eem parafac in the full scale drinking water treatment of australia and netherland has already been reported it is noteworthy that the ambient climate largely governs the relative chemical composition of dom in addition the geological and hydrological conditions such as flow rate rainfall pattern and temperature of the given aquatic system as well as treatment practices could also affect the dom composition ejarque et al 2017 quang et al 2015 shi et al 2020 indeed the norwegian freshwater was reported to contain a higher concentration of humic substances than that in australian freshwater fabris et al 2008 this study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and practical application of fluorescence spectroscopy particularly eem parafac to assess the water quality of full scale drinking water treatment plants surface water is the primary source of drinking water in shenzhen china and the quality of raw water may be affected by seasonal variations in the context of the discussion mentioned above related to the significance of dom as well as application of the fluorescence spectroscopy specific objectives of this study include i assessing the effect of seasonal variations on the dynamics of fdom ratio in the influent of the three drinking water treatment plants in the shenzhen ii implementing the eem parafac model for elucidating the relative changes in fdom composition in different physicochemical processes of drinking water treatment plants and iii investigating the relationship between the fdom composition in influent and treated water using the fluorescence ratio based indicators 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the samples from three different water treatment plants were collected monthly for a period of one year i e from july 2018 to july 2019 all these three plants are in the shenzhen city of china due to its subtropical climate weather of the city is mild with plenty of sunshine and the summer in the city usually lasts for six months the climate rainfall and temperature of the city during the sampling period is presented in fig s1 the monthly rainfall data of the shenzhen city was obtained from an online platform https en tutiempo net climate according to the rainfall mm data the city can be characterized into two seasons dry season october to march and wet season april to september liang et al 2019 this city has become an exclusive economic zone and is growing rapidly with increasing urban sprawls and agricultural lands converted to industrial and commercial zones wu et al 2020 all the three drinking water treatment plants receive raw water from different reservoirs the characteristics of the reservoir catchment areas are presented in table s1 in addition to the runoff from the catchment these reservoirs receive recharge water from the dongjiang river after physical and chemical treatments this river supplies fresh water to southern cities of china dongguan and shenzhen and hong kong the samples were collected monthly from the inlet and the outlet of each unit process the samples were collected in 5 l mild cleaned plastic bottles and were immediately transferred to the laboratory in the tsinghua shenzhen international graduate school shenzhen china all the samples were stored at 4 c before further treatment and analysis pretreatment of the samples includes filtration through pre washed 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter advantec japan aftab and hur 2017 phong and hur 2015 all the analytical characterizations were performed within 24 h of sample collection 2 2 configuration of drinking water treatment plants the layout of each drinking water treatment plant is shown in fig 1 these plants are categorized as follows i plant a has a peroxidation unit followed by coagulation precipitation sand filtration and disinfection ii plant b has the same treatment processes as plant a with the addition of carbon filtration before disinfection and iii pant c has a coagulation flocculation unit followed by membrane based filtration and disinfection according to the treatment plant management plant a plant b and plant c have a design capacity of 5 0 105 2 0 105 and 4 0 104 m3 day respectively the influent of each plant originates from a different reservoir plant a and plant c use polyaluminum chloride pacl while plant b uses basic aluminum chloride for coagulation and the typical coagulant dose was around 1 8 mg l at all treatment plants pre oxidation of raw water using kmno4 0 1 0 5 mg l and o3 around 0 5 mg l is carried out before the physical treatment processes in the plants a and b respectively the carbon filter is used as an adsorption media in the plant b disinfection is performed using naocl in all drinking water treatment plants a continuously operated ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane is installed in the plant c according to the supplier dow chemical company it is a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane with a pore size of 0 03 μm 2 3 analytical characterization turbidity electrical conductivity ec and the ph of the samples were measured on site using portable meters 2100q and hq40d hach japan filtered samples were used to measure total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn using a toc tn analyzer toc v shimadzu japan the nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations were determined using the ultra violet uv spectroscopy method outlined in the standard examination methods for drinking water nonmetal parameters china gb t 5750 5 2006 a detailed methodology of the determination of n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential ndma fp is presented in supporting information 2 4 uv vis fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular weight distribution the filtered samples were used to collect the fluorescence and uv vis spectra using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan and uv vis spectroscopy uv 2600 shimadzu japan respectively the 1 cm four sided quartz cell was used to collect broad uv vis spectra 200 800 nm with 1 nm step of all water samples and the same cuvette was used for obtaining the fluorescence spectra higher concentration of dom in the water samples can cause inner filter effects which would lead to the incorrect estimation of fluorescence spectra to avoid this the filtered samples were diluted ensuring uv absorbance at 254 nm of less than 0 05 cm 1 for each sample quang et al 2016 three dimensional eems were collected with following adjusted parameters the excitation ex and emission em ranges were set from 220 to 450 nm and 280 600 nm with scan steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively the eems were obtained with a scan speed of 30 000 nm min while keeping both the ex and em slits fixed at 5 nm each the instrument used was found to be stable at different scan speeds the eems of milli q water 18 ωm as blank was subtracted from the eems of all samples using built in software to remove raman scatterings the humification index hix and biological index bix were calculated from the eems of the analyzed samples the calculation of hix was based on the emission spectrum areas under the wavelengths of 435 480 nm to 300 345 nm at ex of 255 nm hansen et al 2016 ohno 2002 on the other hand bix was estimated using a ratio of em intensity at 380 430 nm at an ex of 310 nm hansen et al 2016 the molecular weight distribution of dom in the influent was measured using a high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec its methodology and procedure can be found elsewhere lin et al 2015 2 5 parafac modeling the parafac modeling was applied on eem datasets obtained for samples from each water treatment plant in addition it was applied to the combined eems of the water treatment plants total samples used for the combined modeling are 209 with 72 82 and 55 samples collected from the plant a plant b and plant c respectively the plant c was only monitored for 11 months while two of the samples from the plant b were lost during transportation to the laboratory the parafac modeling was performed based on the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 which uses the domflour toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc usa the parafac analysis comprises the following steps i initial processing to remove scattering by cutting a few wavelengths ii applying non negativity constraints iii estimating the loading leverage iv identification and removal of an outlier if any and v split half analysis and validation for a suitable number of components in this analysis fmax was used as the representative of maximum fluorescence intensity for an individual component which represents a specific fluorescence dom e g humic like and protein like fmax was normalized by using the raman integration method as explained previously lawaetz and stedmon 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 water chemistry of influent and treated water regardless of water treatment plants the influent characteristics e g doc tn turbidity are largely governed by seasonal variations table 1 for example the doc concentrations of plants a b and c in the influent varied from 2 94 to 7 92 1 32 to 3 90 and 1 76 to 9 18 mgc l respectively our results demonstrate that a significant difference in basic water quality parameters of the three water treatment plants exists influent water quality of the plants a and c were comparable but significantly different than that of the plant b for example the doc concentration in the influent of the plants a and c was significantly p 0 001 one way anova higher to that of plant b fig s2 this could be attributed to the difference in the land use pattern of catchment areas cunha et al 2016 notably the treatment processes imposed a profound impact on the water quality e g doc of the treated water and the difference in the basic water quality parameters following treatment was insignificant p 0 05 anova the average doc concentration at the outlet of the plants a b and c was 1 81 1 02 1 93 0 53 and 1 87 0 71 mgc l respectively similar observations were reported previously in several studies that compared the performance of water treatment plants with different treatment processes gibert et al 2015 marais et al 2018 such analysis merely provides the estimation of the bulk concentration and cannot facilitate in elucidating the composition of dom the focus of the current study is to assess the relative changes in fdom due to seasonal variations and understand the impacts of different treatment processes on the composition of fdom which could help in determining the fate of dom during different treatment processes commonly employed at full scale 3 2 eem parafac modeling fluorescence components obtained after eem parafac modeling both individual and combined are shown in fig 2 firstly the model was applied to the eem datasets obtained for each treatment plant it provided different numbers of validated components in dom three fdom components described the features of eems in the plant a while only two were found in the plants b and c when peak positions of the fluorescence components among three different individual models were compared the component c3 appears to be unique to the plant a in the second approach the combined eems of water treatment plants were validated by eem parafac modeling which provided two fdom components c1 and c2 in this study reasonable numbers of fdom components were selected using the split half validation approach as reported previously lee et al 2015 shutova et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the combined eem parafac was developed using eems obtained from 209 samples collected from the water treatment plants the peaks positions of these components along with their assignments as well as the relevant literature are presented in table s2 both the individual and combined approaches were used for bias estimation in the spectrum of the parafac models previous studies have reported potential bias in the combined model applied to the eems of the water samples collected from different sources yu et al 2015 according to previous studies c1 and c2 c3 represent the humic like and protein like fdom respectively cory and mcknight 2005 vera et al 2017 specifically the component c1 located beyond the emission of 380 nm are assigned to humic like fluorescence and they are believed to originate from microbial humification and or terrestrial humic substances li et al 2014 yamashita and jaffé 2008 on the other hand c2 and c3 with the peaks located at 380 nm are assigned to different protein like fluorescence moieties tryptophan and tyrosine like amino acids are the primary sources of such fluorescence signatures with the former located at longer emission than the later baghoth et al 2011 the rationale behind using the combined parafac model for understanding the dynamics of fdom in all three water treatment plants is evident from the strong correlation between the sums of protein like components c2 c3 in the individual model of the plant a vs c2 concentration obtained from the combined modeling of the respective water samples this strong correlation r2 0 83 p 0 001 depicts the mutual dynamics of these components as presented in fig 3 the odd number of components between individual and combined eem parafac models were also reported in a few previous studies shutova et al 2014 yu et al 2015 for instance shutova et al 2014 obtained the datasets of different eems by combining the spectra of the similar treatment units from five different treatment facilities such as raw water model coagulation model and filtration separation model they observed that few components were common in all these models since the parafac model make neither assumptions about the spectral shapes nor the structure of parameters similar spectral shapes obtained from two completely independent models derived from a different set of samples represent the underlying chemical phenomenon coble et al 2014 in this study the two common components in all water treatment plants indicated that hydrological activities in reservoirs of the shenzhen city are possibly identical therefore following discussion is mainly focused on the exploration of the dynamics of these two components humic like c1 and protein like c2 validated through the combined eems dataset 3 3 impacts of seasonal variations on fdom the dynamics of humification and biological associated organic matter in the influent from three reservoirs were determined and compared using two approaches viz the conventional fluorescence indices like hix and bix fig s3 and eem parafac fig 4 in general the hix and bix of the influents ranged from 28 to 41 and 14 36 respectively these values were significantly lower than that obtained for the fluorescence ratio c1 c2 depending on the seasonal variations i e dry or wet season c1 c2 values were observed to range between 72 and 91 fig 4 here the eem parafac based fluorescence ratio was compared with these traditional indices and found to be more robust in explaining the dom composition in different seasons and treatment processes influence of seasonal variations on fdom dynamics has not been reported yet in any southern city of china and this is reported for the first time in this study as illustrated in fig 4 and fig s1 during the period from july to september 2018 305 534 mm of rainfall was recorded representing a wet season on the other hand during the dry season i e from october 2018 to february 2019 rainfall of only 4 8 57 6 mm was recorded the results of this study showed that the relative abundances of fluorescence components had a direct relation with seasonal variations during the wet season relatively more humic like fluorescence was recorded which was possibly due to the washout of various soil leaf derived organic substances from the catchment into water supplies mostly rivers and lakes quang et al 2015 by contrast the enhanced presence of protein like fluorescence during the dry season could be due to the stimulated microbial activity particularly in stagnant flow regimes such as freshwater reservoirs ly et al 2017 the average fmax r u values of both components in the source which was calculated considering season variations are presented in fig s4 which demonstrated an increase of humic like c1 in the plants a and c during the wet season and an increase of protein like component in the source water of plant b in the dry season the fluorescence ratio obtained from all three reservoirs correlated p 0 05 well with monthly total rainfall data and or the average temperature fig 4 our study was in good agreement with several field studies that have reported an increase in humic like or humic substances intensity than that of protein like during the wet season and vice versa recorded during the dry season with lower temperatures shi et al 2020 yang et al 2019 for instance shi et al 2020 found a positive correlation between the terrestrial humic like fluorescence and flood seasons in lake tianmu and yangtze river land activities within the area could be another factor that may have an impact on the quality of the influent as reported previously herzsprung et al 2012 hur et al 2014b the runoff from the intensive agriculture contains abundant nutrients such as n p together with temperature it provides the ideal environment for microbial growth which could cause a change in the relative ratio of protein like vs humic substances thus affecting dom composition williams et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 in a previous study the link between the anthropogenic activities in urban areas and croplands with the higher generation of humic like components was reported shi et al 2020 this fluorescence ratio can be indirectly linked with the molecular weight distribution of the aquatic dom previous studies have determined this relation by combining fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography brezinski and gorczyca 2019 chon et al 2017 in this study the presence of biopolymers in influents was confirmed from the results obtained following the analysis of samples for molecular weight distribution fig s5 the contribution of large size molecules 3k da was found to be 23 3 9 9 30 9 for plant a plant b and plant c respectively a direct relation was observed between the fluorescence ratio of the influent and treated water at all water treatment plants fig 5 it is interesting to note that seasonal variations not only impacted the influent quality but also appeared to govern the dom composition in treated water this indicates that the selected water treatment plants showed a proportionate treatability during season variations as explained in the next section unlike the conventional parameters the eem parafac based ratio could help in determining the temporal impacts on the dom composition in raw water i e influent the above discussion infers that the composition of the dom in the influent could change with seasonal variations and the ratio of humic like to protein like is an appropriate index for studying such dynamics 3 4 fluorescence ratio in different treatment units the relative changes of humic and protein like fluorescence throughout the treatment units of water treatment plants with different treatment processes are shown in fig 6 the overall layouts of three water treatment plants can be divided into physical and chemical unit operations pretreatment using kmno4 and o3 in plants a and b respectively as well as disinfection by naocl in all three plants have been classified as chemical treatment while the rest of the treatment units are collectively called as physical treatment units pre oxidation is the first unit operation in the treatment train of two of the facilities plants a and b fig 6 presents the change in the c1 c2 throughout the physicochemical treatment units mainly chemical pretreatments caused a decrease in fluorescence ratio showing preferential removal of humic like fluorescence than the protein like component the chemistry behind the results supports the dynamic of such changes in c1 c2 i e humic like aromatic structures are more prone to chemical degradation than the large molecular weight biopolymers including protein like baghoth et al 2011 bose and reckhow 2007 to understand the changes in the fluorescence ratio during physicochemical processes as a function of seasonal variations few sets of complete treatment trains covering the wet and dry seasons were selected fig 6 the kmno4 based pre oxidation in plant a proactively removed the humic like fluorescence than the o3 based oxidation in plant b the relative change in c1 c2 values of the influent at plant a vs plant b was found to be 51 vs 25 9 6 vs 56 and 47 vs 23 during the wet season in 2018 dry season and wet season in 2019 respectively the extent of treatability such as contact time or oxidant concentration in these different plants could be a reason for such results the impacts of pretreatments on dom have also been discussed in literature and were reported to achieve better removal of humic like fluorescence among the fluorescence moieties use of o3 4 mg l was demonstrated to achieve preferential removal of microbial and terrestrial humic like fluorescence by up to 79 from surface water as compared to protein like fluorescence around 68 cheng et al 2016 coagulation is the next unit process in two plants a and b and the first in plant c different pretreatment kmno4 vs o3 in plants a and b influenced the coagulation differently plants a and c showed an increase in fluorescence while a decrease was observed in plant b according to the available literature the performance of kmno4 for dom oxidation has been compared to that achieved by o3 change in functional groups and charge on dom could be the reason for such contrasting results xie et al 2016 another factor could be the type of coagulants used in plant b aluminum chloride was used as the coagulant in plant b while plant a and c used poly aluminum chloride as the coagulant kabsch korbutowicz 2005 based on the fluorescence ratio and intensities presented in fig 6 and fig s6 the highest removal of c1 was 20 88 56 89 and 9 69 in plant a plant b and plant c respectively removal of c2 by coagulation process ranged between 37 0 plant b and 55 21 plant c during physical processes from coagulation to sand filter the fluorescence ratio was found to increase which indicates the efficient removal of protein like rather than humic like component results of this study are in line with previous studies that used fluorescence spectroscopy to track the changes in dom during drinking water treatment for example ly et al 2018 reported a 20 and 40 removal of humic like and protein like respectively in the coagulation unit using alum in another study vera et al 2017 reported up to 60 removal of protein like components by granular activated carbon and lavonen et al 2015 reported only 6 and 15 removal of humic like and protein like respectively during sand filtration in this study relatively stable fluorescence ratio was observed in the physical treatment units of the water treatment plants during the dry season this could be due to the lower availability of the humic like substances in the influent with a proportionate change in protein like fluorescence the decrease in the fluorescence ratio after the membrane based separation in plant c indicated the addition of protein like components from the membrane foulants it could also be ascribed to the long term operation which promotes the development of biofilm on the membrane surface hörsch et al 2005 previous studies suggest that the biofilm could utilize the substances within the aqueous solution and can release extracellular polymeric substances during respiration neubrand et al 2010 vrouwenvelder et al 1998 increased fluorescence intensities after filtration have also been reported especially in warmer seasons regions in addition filtration media and membrane surface may host microbial communities capable of contributing to dom concentration in a study by bridgeman et al 2014 carbon isotopic characterization of dom during water treatment indicated the presence of a few indigenous sources of organic contents these sources may include abrasion of adsorption media biofilm development and filtration further studies should be carried out to confirm these sources in a previous study on dom removal in a full scale treatment plant ultrafiltration did not show any removal of dom however reverse osmosis was reported to effectively retain around 90 of dom vera et al 2017 the disinfection of the treated water with naocl influenced the composition of dom likewise the action of chemical disinfection also preferred the removal of the humic like component than that of protein like meanwhile disinfection has proved to be effective toward removing the dom in drinking water up to some extent a few previous studies have reported findings of destruction and deactivation of microorganisms along with substantial changes in the composition of the dom gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2015 few previous studies have also employed the fdom ratio contribution approach to study aquatic systems with a range of objectives for example lee et al 2018 developed a fluorescence ratio using eem parafac modeling and determined the relationship of dom composition with dbps formation during a simulated rainfall experiment on biochar in another study by hur et al 2014a phenanthrene showed a positive correlation with humic like component and a negative correlation with protein like component of dom extracted from sediment similarly in this study c1 c2 was also found to be associated with ndma fp results are presented in fig s7 the dry season with a lower c1 c2 ratio led to a higher ndma fp in treated water and vice verse was observed for the wet season similar to the previous studies by shutova et al 2014 and vera et al 2017 this research comprehensively discusses the changes in dom composition at the influent and the effluent i e treated water of multiple drinking water treatment plants this research is unique because it explores the relationship between the changes in dom composition and seasonal varaitions in a sub tropical region the dom composition is ascribed to the enormous difference in rainfall between the wet and dry seasons rainfall and temperature control the microbial activities and release of terrestrial contents impacts of rainfall and temperature on fdom composition in treated water could be linked with source water quality and activities in the reservoir catchment area the obtained results from the physicochemical processes of treatment facilities showed selectivity of these treatment units toward the different organic fractions in terms of the eem parafac components moreover based on spectroscopy measurements this study found that influent water quality fluctuates with seasonal variations this is an important findings of this study suggesting regular adjustments in operational parameters e g coagulant dose and adsorbent replenishment to achieve a stable effluent quality not only in terms of basic water quality parameters but also for dom composition this study is a way forward for the development of fluorescence indices for engineered systems compared to the previously employed and recommended indices hix and bix for limnology and oceanography in the future a suitable range of fluorescence ratio should be proposed for monitoring the operating conditions for quality control assurance after each treatment unit the fluorescence approach could also help in determining the nature of dom released from treatment facilities this would help to assess the bioavailability of these organic contents and to estimate the microbial biofilm formation potential of treated water in water distribution networks 4 conclusions in this study fluorescence based ratio was employed to explore the relative changes in the protein and humic like components of dom during water treatment at full scale the sensitivity of fdom effectively explained the mechanisms involved in differently operated drinking water plants and the role of physicochemical unit processes in changing the dom composition from influent to treated water was studied the following are the conclusions drawn from the results individual and combined eem parafac models provided the different numbers of components broadly divided into humic like and protein like fluorescence two of the components with similar peak positions were found to be common in all three drinking water plants fluorescence ratio humic like protein like c1 c2 presented the impacts of seasonal variations on the composition of dom in the influent of drinking water treatment plants originating from the different reservoirs of the shenzhen city the rainfall and temperature directly correlated with the change in the fluorescence ratio the wet season and high temperature accelerated the production of the dom with a high intensity of humic like fluorescence while the dry season supported the accumulation of protein like components in the reservoir relative changes in humic like and protein like provided the mechanism of removal of dom in chemical treatment units including pretreatment and disinfection as well as the removal through the physical processes including coagulation precipitation filtration through sand filter and membrane filtration units fluorescence ratio provided more susceptibility of removal for the humic like component in chemical treatment units including pretreatment and disinfection on the other hand it presented a less abundance of protein like fluorescence during physical treatment units declaration of competing interest the authors

17779, effective enzyme activity or simply effective activity is proposed as a biofiltration monitoring tool which combines enzyme activity with empty bed contact time ebct to quantify biodegradation potential the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the effective activity concept for predicting water quality in biofiltration systems this pilot scale study evaluated eight different biofilter configurations in order to quantify impacts associated with filter media anthracite sand or granular activated carbon pre treatment settled water with or without ozonation and operating conditions 15 and 30 min ebct and backwash with or without chlorine microbial characterization included biomass concentration as measured by adenosine triphosphate atp in addition to

systems which incorporate pre ozonation as such this study showed that effective activity may be appropriate for relating biomass characterization to treated water quality and highlights the importance of quantifying biomass activity in addition to quantity graphical abstract image 1 keywords enzyme activity effective enzyme activity drinking water biofiltration ozone biofiltration disinfection by products biological monitoring 1 introduction biological drinking water treatment specifically biologically active filtration or biofiltration has increased in popularity due to its ability to concurrently degrade many organic and inorganic substances without dramatically increasing treatment costs or requiring large capital expenditures biofiltration has recently been shown to effectively reduce organic carbon terry and summers 2018 disinfection by product dbp formation potential fp sharma et al 2018 taste and odour compounds including methylisoborneol mib or geosmin beniwal et al 2018 as well as inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus fu et al 2017 unlike chemical and physical treatment processes biofiltration introduces a greater degree of uncertainty in treated water quality due to limitations associated with the control of biological processes liao et al 2015 as such design and operations personnel have been reluctant to rely on biological treatment of regulatory parameters instead viewing it as a value added benefit which may improve treatment beyond the use of chemical or physical processes due to the complexity of the processes which underlie biological treatment many studies have been conducted to identify reliable surrogate parameters indicative of biofilter treatment performance stoddart and gagnon 2014 pharand et al 2014 peleato et al 2016 biomass density estimated by phospholipid or adenosine triphosphate concentration has been proposed as an indicator of biological performance however no study has been identified as showing a quantitative relationship between these surrogates for biomass concentration and treated water quality previous studies have demonstrated that estimation of microorganism quantity alone does not provide an indication of treated water quality as not all organisms provide a quantifiable benefit boon et al 2011 gerrity et al 2018 metagenomic analyses of biofilter bacteria communities have been conducted to identify which species are present and suggest those that may contribute to degrading contaminants of interest lautenschlager et al 2014 oh et al 2018 although this represents a major technological breakthrough the industry has been unable to widely apply the results of this research and as such utilization of this technology to optimize in plant performance is unlikely to occur in the near future nemani et al 2018 enzyme activity is readily measurable and has shown promise for biofilter monitoring and control it is generally superior to evaluating biomass density due to its ability to quantify biodegradation potential for specific contaminants or indicate the presence of specific bacteria lautenschlager et al 2014 stadler et al 2016 keithley and kirisits 2019 recent studies have utilized enzyme activity as a monitoring parameter to characterize biofiltration treatment performance by applying the concept of effective activity mckie et al 2019 effective activity combines enzyme activity with empty bed contact time ebct to provide an indication of biodegradation potential based on metabolic activity where contact time and substrate availability are key parameters the effective activity concept was originally developed by examining biofilters which followed membrane filtration a unique process train not representative of typical biofiltration systems due to the omission of coagulation or ozone prior to filtration and extended filter run times 2 months due to upstream particle removal mckie et al 2019 as such the objective of this study was the application of effective activity as an indicator of doc and dbp fp reduction by a more typical treatment train including anthracite or gac biofilters treating post coagulation water with or without ozone oxidation 2 methodology 2 1 source water this pilot study was conducted at a water treatment plant in southern ontario canada which uses the otonabee river as source water during the study raw water doc was 4 95 0 05 mg l temperature ranged from 4 to 24 c pre chlorination 0 5 mg l cl2 l at the intake was applied for mussel control typical of facilities in the great lakes region low concentrations of chlorine 0 05 mg cl2 l thms 5 μg l haas 5 μg l and hans 1 μg l were observed following pre chlorination which served as influent to the full scale plant settled water following coagulation alum dose 40 mg l piped directly from the full scale plant served as the influent to the pilot filters and pilot ozone system settled water turbidity was 0 5 ntu while ph and doc ranged from 6 6 to 7 0 and 2 8 3 2 mg l respectively 2 2 description of pilot filter design and operation the pilot consisted of eight parallel filters dia 7 6 cm all of which were operated with an ebct of either 15 or 30 1 min table 1 fig 1 they contained either single media exhausted gac calgon carbon filtrasorb 300 obtained from full scale filters after 15 years of operation or were dual media filters containing 50 cm of anthracite effective size d10 0 85 uniformity coefficient uc 1 8 over 50 cm of sand d10 0 5 uc 1 8 the adsorptive capacity of the biologically active gac was deemed to be exhausted following 15 years of full scale operation and from observations of limited doc adsorption 0 3 mg l when compared to virgin gac 2 mg l at the same location each of the four gac filters were equipped with sampling ports at depths of 5 25 45 75 and 95 cm from the top of the media to allow media and water quality depth profile samples to be collected anthracite dual media biofilters were operated at the conditions in table 1 for a period of eight months prior to the tests reported herein all filters were operated in constant flow mode and were backwashed three times per week whenever unchlorinated backwash was used it was obtained from each individual filter effluent whereas chlorinated backwash water 1 5 mg cl2 l residual was obtained from the full scale plant the backwash procedure was consistent for all filters and included 2 min of low flow backwash 30 expansion 8 min of high flow backwash 50 expansion and 4 min of low flow backwash 30 expansion to ensure proper media separation air scour was implemented when media fluidization could not be achieved using backwash alone previous studies conducted at this location indicated that physical processes associated with backwash had no significant impact α 0 05 on filter media biomass as estimated by atp measurements azzeh et al 2014 2 3 description of pilot scale ozone system four of the biofilters received pre ozonated water settled water was ozonated using an intuitech salt lake city ut pilot scale ozone system which consisted of parallel ozone contactors each with a residence time of 12 1 min fig 1 ozone trains were operated independently to achieve nominal residuals of 0 1 0 05 and 0 5 0 1 mg l ozone demand typically ranged from 2 1 to 2 2 mg l following 12 min of contact time ozone dosages of 2 3 0 1 and 2 7 0 1 mg l were applied where average transfer efficiencies exceeded 95 prior to biofiltration the train that targeted a 0 5 mg l ozone residual was quenched with calcium thiosulphate cts at a stoichiometric ratio of 2 1 cts o3 the parallel train with a 0 1 mg l o3 residual was not quenched in an effort to examine potential full scale operating conditions 2 4 sampling details sampling was performed over a six month period on three separate occasions where raw water temperature ranged from 4 to 24 c media samples were obtained from the top 5 cm of each filter as well as from sampling ports throughout their depth where available and analyzed for biomass density using atp and enzyme activity based on a preliminary survey of seven enzymes esterase phosphatase α and β glucosidase cellobiohydrolase xylosidase and chitinase esterase and phosphatase were selected as measures of metaboloic activity and were quantifiable 0 01 μm min data not shown atp was analyzed on site within 2 h of sample collection while biofilm was extracted for enzyme activity assays within 24 h of media storage at 4 c in the lab for water quality sampling the multiple sampling ports of gac filters were sampled from the bottom to the top to eliminate potential impacts to the biofilm associated with any reduction of flow to depths below the sampling port to ensure that the desired ebct was maintained for all sampling depths all other sampling ports were closed when taking samples from a given port flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder prior to the collection of each sample ebct was maintained at desired values 1 min throughout sample collection 2 5 analytical methods biomass concentration was estimated by way of atp measurements using the luminultra deposit surface analysis kit fredricton new brunswick canada as per the manufacturer s instructions briefly 1 g of filter media was lysed using a proprietary solution biomass extract was mixed with luciferase enzyme and analyzed for relative light units rlu using a luminometer the rlu of the sample was converted to an atp concentration using a calibration solution provided by the manufacturer esterase and phosphatase were measured using a method similar to that presented by lautenschlager et al 2014 and previously described in mckie et al 2019 briefly 10 ml of tris buffer ph 8

adding 1 6 ml of media extract to 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 methylumbelliferone acetate 4 mub acetate sigma aldrich mississauga on while phosphatase activity was measured using 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 mub phosphate substrate the fluorescence of the sample was measured every 5 min for 30 min using an excitation and emission wavelength of 370 nm and 445 nm respectively fluorescence response was converted

as a check following every ten samples in accordance with standard method 1020 apha 2012 2 6 statistical analyses a paired student t test with a significance level of 95 was used to compare treatments all analyses e g comparisons between filters or impacts of o3 were conducted using two tailed tests mckie et al 2015 pairing results such that data collected at the same time were compared allowed for variability associated with temperature to be normalized as such significance implied that one of the treatments was superior for every sample collection period representative of the range of water temperatures experienced annually 4 c 24 c reported p values indicate the level of significance for a given relationship statistical significance testing was also conducted on linear correlations using the following equation walpole et al 2007 2 t r n 2 1 r 2 where t is the t test statistic n is the number of relationships evaluated typically 12 r is the correlation coefficient and r2 is the coefficient of variation for example evaluating 10 degrees of freedom e g three sampling events for four biofilters treating ozonated water and a significance level of 5 α 0 05 a statistically significant relationship is defined when r2 0 37 t 1 812 these statistical analyses indicate that the resulting water quality differences can be attributed to variation in treatment conditions or filter operation and are not random as a result identification of significant relationships may support predictions of water quality being based on biological parameters or pre treatment conditions 3 results 3 1 biomass characterization atp concentration is indicative of total active biomass present on a filter media sample previous studies have suggested 100 ng cm3 media as a threshold for defining biological activity pharand et al 2014 which translates to 70 ng g of gac atp concentration at a depth of 5 1 cm from the top of each filter was analyzed for all three sampling events fig 2 the atp results confirm a number of previously established trends and provide additional confidence in overall results namely filters operated with ozone upstream on post settled water had higher atp values when compared to settled water alone e g o3 gac 15 compared to gac 15 eliminating chlorinated backwash or utilizing gac media also resulted in increased atp these results were anticipated based on previous studies including emelko et al 2006 walpole et al 2007 and miltner et al 1995 among others significant increases in atp using paired t tests α 0 05 were observed when eliminating chlorinated backwash utilizing gac media instead of anthracite and implementing pre ozonation with gac filters table 2 these initial observations also suggest that increasing ebct from 15 to 30 min had little impact on atp in addition to atp of samples taken near the top of the filters 5 cm atp measured through the filter depth was also similar between filters with the same pre treatment fig 3 as such it is evident that atp is not an effective biofilter monitoring parameter as high variability is observed between sampling events and only limited information may be obtained consistent with previous literature pharand et al 2014 mckie et al 2019 esterase enzymes hydrolyze compounds that contain ester amide and thioester bonds within the context of biological characterization the esterase activity is associated with metabolic function in the present study esterase activity was generally elevated near the surface of gac filters operated with an ebct of 15 min compared to 30 min as observed in previous studies fig 4 mckie et al 2019 esterase activity throughout the filter bed measured at 5 25 45 75 and 95 cm was significantly higher α 0 05 in gac filters treating settled water with an ebct of 15 min gac 15 when compared to 30 min gac 30 fig s1 table 2 it is anticipated that the increase in activity is a function of elevated metabolic rate due to substrate loading the shorter ebct is associated with twice the flowrate which doubles the loading of organics and other nutrients to the biofilter and induces enzyme transcription and or enzyme activity degerman et al 2013 when treating pre ozonated water a direct impact of ebct was not observed α 0 05 potentially reflecting an increase in easily biodegradable organics fig s1 simply the loading rate of biodegradable substrate was similar when considering 15 and 30 min ebct filters treating ozonated water as a greater proportion of organics was degradable with an increased reaction time e g 30 min vs 15 min when considering the impact of ozonation a significant difference α 0 05 was observed between filters operated with a 30 min ebct i e gac 30 vs o3 gac 30 but not at 15 min i e gac 15 vs o3 gac 15 ozonation followed by 30 min ebct filtration resulted in elevated activity throughout the filter depth when compared to a filter treating settled water without ozonation implying increased availability of biodegradable substrate similar increases in activity were not observed when comparing filters operated with a 15 min ebct ozonation increased activity at 5 cm filter depth by 28 over the duration of the study it is hypothesized that ozonation increased concentrations of easily degradable organics which were rapidly consumed e g within the top 5 cm but did not impact substrate concentrations to significantly increase the activity throughout the filter depth when operated at an increased loading rate e g 15 vs 30 min phosphatase activity plays a central role in cell signalling and provides a unique measure of cellular activity typically low phosphatase activity was observed 1 μm min in gac filters treating settled water or filters comprised of anthracite media fig 5 gac filters treating pre ozonated water had significantly increased phosphatase activity α 0 05 likely attributable to higher concentrations of biomass due to the increase in available organic carbon and phosphate in the pre ozonated 0 5 mg l residual influent 2 4 0 75 mg l when compared to settled water 0 11 0 09 mg l pre ozonation significantly increased phosphate and biodegradable organics which in turn increased cellular activity as reflected by a significant increase in phosphatase activity α 0 05 in the upper regions of the filter 0 75 cm filter depth when compared to filters treating settled water with the same ebct similar phosphatase activity was observed near the bottom of all filters fig s2 variations between sampling events result in relatively large standard deviations and reflect a decrease and or increase in cellular activity potentially associated with different temperatures and phosphate availability phosphatase activity generally increased with decreasing temperature for four filters treating settled water 0 23 0 39 and 0 48 μm min when operated at temperatures of 24 14 and 4 c respectively and ozonated water 1 26 1 50 and 2 05 μm min when operated at temperatures of 24 14 and 4 c respectively potentially indicative of temperature induced stress baltar et al 2016 however phosphatase activity was consistently elevated in filters treating ozonated water when compared to those treating settled water the increase in phosphatase coincides with an increase in phosphate concentration following ozonation 2 4 0 75 mg l vs 0 11 0 09 mg l for settled water and subsequent utilization by the biofilm effluent phosphate concentrations were similar for filters treating settled water 0 12 0 07 mg l and ozonated water 0 14 0 08 mg l increased nutrient concentration may play a factor in substrate utilization following ozonation however the causal mechanism associated with the observed treatment has yet to be elucidated measurement of phosphatase activity may serve as an ozone optimization strategy whereby ozone residual could be increased until phosphorus breakthrough is observed based on the cellular activity data as reflected by phosphatase the ideal operating ozone residual may be 0 5 mg l as phosphatase activity at the lower depths of the filters was very low 0 1 μm min when examining the impact of chlorinated backwash on enzyme activity a reduction of esterase activity ranged from 40 to 75 whereas phosphatase activity reduction ranged from 50 to 85 as would be expected atp concentration reductions ranged from 25 to 65 this may suggest that enzyme activity is more indicative of cellular activity than bulk atp with respect to biofiltration performance and biomass characterization 3 2 relationship between enzyme activity and biofilter effluent water quality a primary objective of this study was to identify novel methods of measuring and monitoring active biomass in order to interpret and ultimately predict treated water quality the concept of effective activity has been defined as the product of ebct and enzyme activity in the top 5 cm of the filter media where the top 5 cm represents the area of highest biological activity figs s1 and s2 and is most easily sampled when evaluating full scale filters mckie et al 2019 when esterase specific effective activity effective esterase activity eea was measured in each of the eight pilot filters relationships to organics reduction were observed to be impacted by temperature fig 6 and ozone pre treatment fig s3 results presented in fig 6 show potential for strong linear relationships r2 up to 0 93 to exist between effective esterase activity and doc removal suggesting that eea may serve as a good predictor of doc removal to normalize variations in influent water quality i e full scale settled water removal was considered this interpretation of filter performance allowed for the removal of contaminants to be compared to the influent concentration e g doc or dbp fp and to not be impacted by the relative abundance of various organic components however limitations are also evident the relationship was observed to be the strongest during warm water conditions 24 c with an r2 0 93 and to a lesser extent 14 c with an r2 0 67 the strength of the relationship decreased with temperature where sampling performed at 4 c show a weaker relationship r2 0 5 cold temperature impacts were expected as cellular activity is known to decrease at low temperatures this is also evident by commonly used sample storage protocols at 4 c to suspend biological activity prior to microbial analysis furthermore the slopes of best fit lines representing the rate of doc reduction per unit effective activity varied more than two fold from 0 05 to 0 12 which suggests that application of this concept on a year round basis would produce variable doc removal rates however a re interpretation of the data presented in fig 6 to quantify the relationship between doc removal and eea based on the application or absence of ozone fig s3 showed that temperature did not affect all relationships with eea even with the 4 c data included statistically significant α 0 01 relationships were observed between doc removal and effective esterase activity when comparing filters that treated settled water with or without ozone furthermore the slopes of best fit lines are indicative of organic biodegradability with filters treating ozonated organics performing slightly more efficiently higher slope of 0 07 when compared to those treating non ozonated influent 0 06 slope similar results were also observed when considering thm fp and effective esterase activity fig s4 generally poor relationships r2 0 5 were observed between effective esterase activity and haa fp or han fp indicating that other carbon degrading enzymes may be more representative of their removal figs s5 and s6 in addition to utilizing enzyme activity to estimate effluent water quality it may also be possible to infer the organic character an estimate of the relative mass fraction of organics that may be degraded within the filter can be obtained by normalizing the mass of organics removed mg relative to eea μm where enzyme activity can be used as a surrogate for the metabolic rate this calculation provides an estimate of the mass of organics biodegraded within each filter relative to the esterase enzyme activity pre ozonation was shown to increase the relative mass of biodegraded organics by 20 2 1 when compared to filters treating settled water which has been shown in the literature with increased aoc and bdoc as such adjusting ozone dose can improve organics removal efficiency until a point of diminishing return is achieved atp in the top 5 cm of the filter and effective atp defined as the product of the atp concentration measured at 5 cm filter depth and filter ebct were also compared to doc thm fp haa fp and han fp in the same manner as effective activity poor relationships r2 0 4 were observed both seasonally and when based on pre treatment type settled water vs ozonated settled water for all organic parameters indicating that atp is not a suitable parameter for predicting the overall biodegradation rate figs s7 s10 although phosphatase activity is not mechanistically related to phosphate uptake a strong relationship r2 0 77 independent of filter operation pre treatment or media type was observed fig 7 when phosphate levels are lower than 0 5 mg l it is difficult to infer the rate of removal based on the ea however at higher concentrations and ea of 20um this relationship between nutrient utilization and cellular function may provide guidance and inform biofilter operation by allowing maximum nutrient removal to be estimated ea could one day serve as a valuable source water monitoring tool 3 3 treatment of dbp precursors in addition to doc thm haa han and iodo dbp precursors were represented using formation potential fp tests to determine the reduction of organics associated with various pre treatments and filter operating strategies coagulation achieved 40 4 2 mg l 35 9 63 μg l 28 16 32 μg l and 23 22 2 7 μg l reductions of doc thm fp haa fp and han fp respectively from raw water fig s11 coagulation 40 mg alum l was able to achieve similar doc removals throughout the year as evidenced by the relatively small standard deviation observed 4 0 05 mg l although targeting a consistent doc concentration is an easily implemented control parameter it was evident that post coagulation doc reductions were not necessarily indicative of dbp control coagulation removed a greater percentage of doc when compared to the formation potential of any specific group of dbps as such alternative coagulant dosing strategies may be required to achieve control of specific dbps to satisfy more stringent regulatory requirements selection of an appropriate ozone dose is critical for water providers from both a water quality and operational costs perspective two ozone dosages 2 3 and 2 7 mg l were applied in order to obtain post contactor residuals of 0 1 0 05 and 0 5 0 05 mg l dosing to achieve a target ozone residual of 0 5 mg l provided better organics control post coagulation than a residual of 0 1 mg l when considering doc 6 vs 3 thm fp 31 vs 23 haa fp 35 vs 24 and han fp 49 vs 40 although increasing the applied ozone dose did not statistically improve treatment likely due to seasonal temperature variations impacting ozone efficiency increased ozone residuals provided improved doc and dbp fp reduction lower levels going onto the biofilters for each sampling event table 2 in general biofiltration provided improved organics reduction utilizing gac media when increasing ebct 15 vs 30 min and with the application of pre ozonation fig 8 anthracite filters backwashed with chlorinated water anth 15 cl were unable to develop sufficient biomass to operate biologically based on a 70 ng atp g media threshold as expected for conventionally operated filters as a result these filters were unable to significantly reduce α 0 05 doc or han fp from settled water with or without ozonation when compared to filters backwashed with their own effluent anth 15 o3 anth 15 filters backwashed with chlorinated water anth 15 cl o3 anth 15 cl provided significantly less α 0 05 doc 5 0 15 mg l and thm fp 15 15 μg l control when combined with pre ozonation increasing ebct from 15 to 30 min did not significantly improve organics control although small 10 positive benefits were observed fig s12 based on recent studies at other locations this result confirms previous hypotheses that much of the biodegradation occurs near the surface of the biofilter and the readily assimilable carbon can be consumed in the first 5 cm but the remaining carbon has a constant rate of removal through the filter mckie et al 2019 degerman et al 2013 figure s12 illustrates the removal of thm precursors i e the reduction of thm fp with increasing filter depth more than 50 of the precursors removed by biofiltration could be deemed as easily biodegradable with removal in the top 5 cm of the filter similar results were observed for doc haa fp and han fp figs s13 s15 the relatively high removal of organics in the upper 5 cm of the filter can be explained by its high concentration of enzyme activity and associated active biomass concentration 4 discussion adoption of biofiltration presents a low cost means to improve treated water quality without significant infrastructure changes for many facilities despite improvements in the practical understanding of biofilter operation full scale monitoring has not developed in the same way whereby turbidity headloss and filter run time typically serve as the predominant indicators of optimized performance identification of a means to characterize monitor and promote bioactivity within a biofilter is vital to its implementation and long term success studies examining biological activity serve to change the narrative from one which views biological treatment as a value added benefit to one that emphasizes biological treatment as a primary driver for implementation beniwal et al 2018 mckie et al 2016 zearley and summers 2012 this research aims to provide engineers and operators with information to reliably operate biofilters by illustrating development and implementation of new tools much research has been conducted in an effort to model biofiltration processes and subsequent substrate removal saez and rittmann 1992 zhang and huck 1996 holzalski and bouwer 2001 qiongqiong et al 2008 terry et al 2019 however many of these studies were limited by the need to account for parameters not easily measured at full scale facilities including diffusion dispersion substrate utilization rates cell concentrations substrate flux fitting constants and other site specific parameters as a result the implementation of these models to guide full scale operation has been very limited results of this study have demonstrated the importance and practical value of quantifying biological activity via enzyme activity assays in contrast to simply measuring biomass density via atp effective activity which combines enzyme activity and ebct to estimate substrate removal μm has been utilized to provide a better understanding of biofilter operation and treated water quality for two different sources waters incorporating a wide range of treatment conditions coagulation ozone ultrafiltration uv disinfection media gac anthracite over sand and operating conditions with or without routine backwash or daily shutdown mckie et al 2019 these results suggest that effective enzyme activity monitoring may provide valuable insight regarding biofiltration process design and operation this work is of particular importance as it simplifies monitoring and interpretation by eliminating the need to consider the impact of temperature emelko et al 2006 moll et al 1999 ebct zhang et al 2017 backwash basu et al 2015 miltner et al 1995 and pre ozonation selbes et al 2017 black and bérubé 2014 whereby biofilm naturally adapts to all of these factors as represented by changes in enzyme activity the increasingly widespread implementation of biological treatment demonstrates the need to better understand and apply biological monitoring effective activity represents a tool that can improve utilization of monitoring data and in doing so provide more effective treatment future research should be conducted to evaluate the use of enzyme activity as a parameter to optimize operation strategies such as routine filter shut down in order to apply principles commonly utilized in wastewater treatment to stimulate metabolic activity and select for healthy microbiomes additionally alternative enzymes should be examined to identify which ones best represent the degradation potential for dbp precursors or specific contaminants this research should precede the evaluation of mechanistic degradation pathways such that the link between enzyme activity and substrate degradation may be better understood 5 conclusions this study examined the bioactivity and dbp precursor removal potential of pilot scale biofilters consisting of various filter media gac and anthracite over sand with or without pre ozonation and chlorinated backwash at 15 and 30 min ebcts anthracite filters backwashed with chlorinated water had lower concentrations of active biomass as measured by atp which were also associated with lower enzyme activity gac filters overall had higher atp concentrations especially in the top 5 cm those operated with 15 min ebcts were more biological than those operated with a 30 min ebct in all gac filters atp decreased through filter depth likely as a response to lower concentrations of available biodegradable substrate as it passes through the biofilm enzyme activity can react to changes in biofilter operation such as the presence of chlorine in the backwash water when compared to measurement of biomass density alone esterase and phosphatase activity which have been presented as surrogates for cellular function and relate to organics and nutrient utilization showed very similar trends to atp higher enzyme activities were observed for gac filters when compared to anthracite ozone increased activity when compared to filters receiving settled water without ozone increasing ozone residual from 0 1 to 0 5 mg l significantly improved the removal of thm fp and increased reduction of other organic compounds suggesting that ozone optimization is necessary to ensure that treatment objectives are achieved effective activity defined as the product of enzyme activity measured at a depth of 5 cm and ebct was shown to be indicative of filter performance effective esterase and phosphatase activity demonstrated good relationships with organic and nutrient

17779, effective enzyme activity or simply effective activity is proposed as a biofiltration monitoring tool which combines enzyme activity with empty bed contact time ebct to quantify biodegradation potential the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the effective activity concept for predicting water quality in biofiltration systems this pilot scale study evaluated eight different biofilter configurations in order to quantify impacts associated with filter media anthracite sand or granular activated carbon pre treatment settled water with or without ozonation

disinfection by products biological monitoring 1 introduction biological drinking water treatment specifically biologically active filtration or biofiltration has increased in popularity due to its ability to concurrently degrade many organic and inorganic substances without dramatically increasing treatment costs or requiring large capital expenditures biofiltration has recently been shown to effectively reduce organic carbon terry and summers 2018 disinfection by product dbp formation potential fp sharma et al 2018 taste and odour compounds including methylisoborneol mib or geosmin beniwal et al 2018 as well as inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus fu et al 2017 unlike chemical and physical treatment processes biofiltration introduces a greater degree of uncertainty in treated water quality due to limitations associated with the control of biological processes liao et al 2015 as such design and operations personnel have been reluctant to rely on biological treatment of regulatory parameters instead viewing it as a value added benefit which may improve treatment beyond the use of chemical or physical processes due to the complexity of the processes which underlie biological treatment many studies have been conducted to identify reliable surrogate parameters indicative of biofilter treatment performance stoddart and gagnon 2014 pharand et al 2014 peleato et al 2016 biomass density estimated by phospholipid or adenosine triphosphate concentration has been proposed as an indicator of biological performance however no study has been identified as showing a quantitative relationship between these surrogates for biomass concentration and treated water quality previous studies have demonstrated that estimation of microorganism quantity alone does not provide an indication of treated water quality as not all organisms provide a quantifiable benefit boon et al 2011 gerrity et al 2018 metagenomic analyses of biofilter bacteria communities have been conducted to identify which species are present and suggest those that may contribute to degrading contaminants of interest lautenschlager et al 2014 oh et al 2018 although this represents a major technological breakthrough the industry has been unable to widely apply the results of this research and as such utilization of this technology to optimize in plant performance is unlikely to occur in the near future nemani et al 2018 enzyme activity is readily measurable and has shown promise for biofilter monitoring and control it is generally superior to evaluating biomass density due to its ability to quantify biodegradation potential for specific contaminants or indicate the presence of specific bacteria lautenschlager et al 2014 stadler et al 2016 keithley and kirisits 2019 recent studies have utilized enzyme activity as a monitoring parameter to characterize biofiltration treatment performance by applying the concept of effective activity mckie et al 2019 effective activity combines enzyme activity with empty bed contact time ebct to provide an indication of biodegradation potential based on metabolic activity where contact time and substrate availability are key parameters the effective activity concept was originally developed by examining biofilters which followed membrane filtration a unique process train not representative of typical biofiltration systems due to the omission of coagulation or ozone prior to filtration and extended filter run times 2 months due to upstream particle removal mckie et al 2019 as such the objective of this study was the application of effective activity as an indicator of doc and dbp fp reduction by a more typical treatment train including anthracite or gac biofilters treating post coagulation water with or without ozone oxidation 2 methodology 2 1 source water this pilot study was conducted at a water treatment plant in southern ontario canada which uses the otonabee river as source water during the study raw water doc was 4 95 0 05 mg l temperature ranged from 4 to 24 c pre chlorination 0 5 mg l cl2 l at the intake was applied for mussel control typical of facilities in the great lakes region low concentrations of chlorine 0 05 mg cl2 l thms 5 μg l haas 5 μg l and hans 1 μg l were observed following pre chlorination which served as influent to the full scale plant settled water following coagulation alum dose 40 mg l piped directly from the full scale plant served as the influent to the pilot filters and pilot ozone system settled water turbidity was 0 5 ntu while ph and doc ranged from 6 6 to 7 0 and 2 8 3 2 mg l respectively 2 2 description of pilot filter design and operation the pilot consisted of eight parallel filters dia 7 6 cm all of which were operated with an ebct of either 15 or 30 1 min table 1 fig 1 they contained either single media exhausted gac calgon carbon filtrasorb 300 obtained from full scale filters after 15 years of operation or were dual media filters containing 50 cm of anthracite effective size d10 0 85 uniformity coefficient uc 1 8 over 50 cm of sand d10 0 5 uc 1 8 the adsorptive capacity of the biologically active gac was deemed to be exhausted following 15 years of full scale operation and from observations of limited doc adsorption 0 3 mg l when compared to virgin gac 2 mg l at the same location each of the four gac filters were equipped with sampling ports at depths of 5 25 45 75 and 95 cm from the top of the media to allow media and water quality depth profile samples to be collected anthracite dual media biofilters were operated at the conditions in table 1 for a period of eight months prior to the tests reported herein all filters were operated in constant flow mode and were backwashed three times per week whenever unchlorinated backwash was used it was obtained from each individual filter effluent whereas chlorinated backwash water 1 5 mg cl2 l residual was obtained from the full scale plant the backwash procedure was consistent for all filters and included 2 min of low flow backwash 30 expansion 8 min of high flow backwash 50 expansion and 4 min of low flow backwash 30 expansion to ensure proper media separation air scour was implemented when media fluidization could not be achieved using backwash alone previous studies conducted at this location indicated that physical processes associated with backwash had no significant impact α 0 05 on filter media biomass as estimated by atp measurements azzeh et al 2014 2 3 description of pilot scale ozone system four of the biofilters received pre ozonated water settled water was ozonated using an intuitech salt lake city ut pilot scale ozone system which consisted of parallel ozone contactors each with a residence time of 12 1 min fig 1 ozone trains were operated independently to achieve nominal residuals of 0 1 0 05 and 0 5 0 1 mg l ozone demand typically ranged from 2 1 to 2 2 mg l following 12 min of contact time ozone dosages of 2 3 0 1 and 2 7 0 1 mg l were applied where average transfer efficiencies exceeded 95 prior to biofiltration the train that targeted a 0 5 mg l ozone residual was quenched with calcium thiosulphate cts at a stoichiometric ratio of 2 1 cts o3 the parallel train with a 0 1 mg l o3 residual was not quenched in an effort to examine potential full scale operating conditions 2 4 sampling details sampling was performed over a six month period on three separate occasions where raw water temperature ranged from 4 to 24 c media samples were obtained from the top 5 cm of each filter as well as from sampling ports throughout their depth where available and analyzed for biomass density using atp and enzyme activity based on a preliminary survey of seven enzymes esterase phosphatase α and β glucosidase cellobiohydrolase xylosidase and chitinase esterase and phosphatase were selected as measures of metaboloic activity and were quantifiable 0 01 μm min data not shown atp was analyzed on site within 2 h of sample collection while biofilm was extracted for enzyme activity assays within 24 h of media storage at 4 c in the lab for water quality sampling the multiple sampling ports of gac filters were sampled from the bottom to the top to eliminate potential impacts to the biofilm associated with any reduction of flow to depths below the sampling port to ensure that the desired ebct was maintained for all sampling depths all other sampling ports were closed when taking samples from a given port flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder prior to the collection of each sample ebct was maintained at desired values 1 min throughout sample collection 2 5 analytical methods biomass concentration was estimated by way of atp measurements using the luminultra deposit surface analysis kit fredricton new brunswick canada as per the manufacturer s instructions briefly 1 g of filter media was lysed using a proprietary solution biomass extract was mixed with luciferase enzyme and analyzed for relative light units rlu using a luminometer the rlu of the sample was converted to an atp concentration using a calibration solution provided by the manufacturer esterase and phosphatase were measured using a method similar to that presented by lautenschlager et al 2014 and previously described in mckie et al 2019 briefly 10 ml of tris buffer ph 8

adding 1 6 ml of media extract to 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 methylumbelliferone acetate 4 mub acetate sigma aldrich mississauga on while phosphatase activity was measured using 0 4 ml of 200 μm 4 mub phosphate substrate the fluorescence of the sample was measured every 5 min for 30 min using an excitation and emission wavelength of 370 nm and 445 nm respectively fluorescence response was converted to a concentration of 4 mub using a calibration curve 0 100 μm to correct for absorbance effects sample absorbance was also measured at both 370 nm and 445 nm the following equation was applied

as a check following every ten samples in accordance with standard method 1020 apha 2012 2 6 statistical analyses a paired student t test with a significance level of 95 was used to compare treatments all analyses e g comparisons between filters or impacts of o3 were conducted using two tailed tests mckie et al 2015 pairing results such that data collected at the same time were compared allowed for variability associated with temperature to be normalized as such significance implied that one of the treatments was superior for every sample collection period representative of the range of water temperatures experienced annually 4 c 24 c reported p values indicate the level of significance for a given relationship statistical significance testing was also conducted on linear correlations using the following equation walpole et al 2007 2 t r n 2 1 r 2 where t is the t test statistic n is the number of relationships evaluated typically 12 r is the correlation coefficient and r2 is the coefficient of variation for example evaluating 10 degrees of freedom e g three sampling events for four biofilters treating ozonated water and a significance level of 5 α 0 05 a statistically significant relationship is defined when r2 0 37 t 1 812 these statistical analyses indicate that the resulting water quality differences can be attributed to variation in treatment conditions or filter operation and are not random as a result identification of significant relationships may support predictions of water quality being based on biological parameters or pre treatment conditions 3 results 3 1 biomass characterization atp concentration is indicative of total active biomass present on a filter media sample previous studies have suggested 100 ng cm3 media as a threshold for defining biological activity pharand et al 2014 which translates to 70 ng g of gac atp concentration at a depth of 5 1 cm from the top of each filter was analyzed for all three sampling events fig 2 the atp results confirm a number of previously established trends and provide additional confidence in overall results namely filters operated with ozone upstream on post settled water had higher atp values when compared to settled water alone e g o3 gac 15 compared to gac 15 eliminating chlorinated backwash or utilizing gac media also resulted in increased atp these results were anticipated based on previous studies including emelko et al 2006 walpole et al 2007 and miltner et al 1995 among others significant increases in atp using paired t tests α 0 05 were observed when eliminating chlorinated backwash utilizing gac media instead of anthracite and implementing pre ozonation with gac filters table 2 these initial observations also suggest that increasing ebct from 15 to 30 min had little impact on atp in addition to atp of samples taken near the top of the filters 5 cm atp measured through the filter depth was also similar between filters with the same pre treatment fig 3 as such it is evident that atp is not an effective biofilter monitoring parameter as high variability is observed between sampling events and only limited information may be obtained consistent with previous literature pharand et al 2014 mckie et al 2019 esterase enzymes hydrolyze compounds that contain ester amide and thioester bonds within the context of biological characterization the esterase activity is associated with metabolic function in the present study esterase activity was generally elevated near the surface of gac filters operated with an ebct of 15 min compared to 30 min as observed in previous studies fig 4 mckie et al 2019 esterase activity throughout the filter bed measured at 5 25 45 75 and 95 cm was significantly higher α 0 05 in gac filters treating settled water with an ebct of 15 min gac 15 when compared to 30 min gac 30 fig s1 table 2 it is anticipated that the increase in activity is a function of elevated metabolic rate due to substrate loading the shorter ebct is associated with twice the flowrate which doubles the loading of organics and other nutrients to the biofilter and induces enzyme transcription and or enzyme activity degerman et al 2013 when treating pre ozonated water a direct impact of ebct was not observed α 0 05 potentially reflecting an increase in easily biodegradable organics fig s1 simply the loading rate of biodegradable substrate was similar when considering 15 and 30 min ebct filters treating ozonated water as a greater proportion of organics was degradable with an increased reaction time e g 30 min vs 15 min when considering the impact of ozonation a significant difference α 0 05 was observed between filters operated with a 30 min ebct i e gac 30 vs o3 gac 30 but not at 15 min i e gac 15 vs o3 gac 15 ozonation followed by 30 min ebct filtration resulted in elevated activity throughout the filter depth when compared to a filter treating settled water without ozonation implying increased availability of biodegradable substrate similar increases in activity were not observed when comparing filters operated with a 15 min ebct ozonation increased activity at 5 cm filter depth by 28 over the duration of the study it is hypothesized that ozonation increased concentrations of easily degradable organics which were rapidly consumed e g within the top 5 cm but did not impact substrate concentrations to significantly increase the activity throughout the filter depth when operated at an increased loading rate e g 15 vs 30 min phosphatase activity plays a central role in cell signalling and provides a unique measure of cellular activity typically low phosphatase activity was observed 1 μm min in gac filters treating settled water or filters comprised of anthracite media fig 5 gac filters treating pre ozonated water had significantly increased phosphatase activity α 0 05 likely attributable to higher concentrations of biomass due to the increase in available organic carbon and phosphate in the pre ozonated 0 5 mg l residual influent 2 4 0 75 mg l when compared to settled water 0 11 0 09 mg l pre ozonation significantly increased phosphate and biodegradable organics which in turn increased cellular activity as reflected by a significant increase in phosphatase activity α 0 05 in the upper regions of the filter 0 75 cm filter depth when compared to filters treating settled water with the same ebct similar phosphatase activity was observed near the bottom of all filters fig s2 variations between sampling events result in relatively large standard deviations and reflect a decrease and or increase in cellular activity potentially associated with different temperatures and phosphate availability phosphatase activity generally increased with decreasing temperature for four filters treating settled water 0 23 0 39 and 0 48 μm min when operated at temperatures of 24 14 and 4 c respectively and ozonated water 1 26 1 50 and 2 05 μm min when operated at temperatures of 24 14 and 4 c respectively potentially indicative of temperature induced stress baltar et al 2016 however phosphatase activity was consistently elevated in filters treating ozonated water when compared to those treating settled water the increase in phosphatase coincides with an increase in phosphate concentration following ozonation 2 4 0 75 mg l vs 0 11 0 09 mg l for settled water and subsequent utilization by the biofilm effluent phosphate concentrations were similar for filters treating settled water 0 12 0 07 mg l and ozonated water 0 14 0 08 mg l increased nutrient concentration may play a factor in substrate utilization following ozonation however the causal mechanism associated with the observed treatment has yet to be elucidated measurement of phosphatase activity may serve as an ozone optimization strategy whereby ozone residual could be increased until phosphorus breakthrough is observed based on the cellular activity data as reflected by phosphatase the ideal operating ozone residual may be 0 5 mg l as phosphatase activity at the lower depths of the filters was very low 0 1 μm min when examining the impact of chlorinated backwash on enzyme activity a reduction of esterase activity ranged from 40 to 75 whereas phosphatase activity reduction ranged from 50 to 85 as would be expected atp concentration reductions ranged from 25 to 65 this may suggest that enzyme activity is more indicative of cellular activity than bulk atp with respect to biofiltration performance and biomass characterization 3 2 relationship between enzyme activity and biofilter effluent water quality a primary objective of this study was to identify novel methods of measuring and monitoring active biomass in order to interpret and ultimately predict treated water quality the concept of effective activity has been defined as the product of ebct and enzyme activity in the top 5 cm of the filter media where the top 5 cm represents the area of highest biological activity figs s1 and s2 and is most easily sampled when evaluating full scale filters mckie et al 2019 when esterase specific effective activity effective esterase activity eea was measured in each of the eight pilot filters relationships to organics reduction were observed to be impacted by temperature fig 6 and ozone pre treatment fig s3 results presented in fig 6 show potential for strong linear relationships r2 up to 0 93 to exist between effective esterase activity and doc removal suggesting that eea may serve as a good predictor of doc removal to normalize variations in influent water quality i e full scale settled water removal was considered this interpretation of filter performance allowed for the removal of contaminants to be compared to the influent concentration e g doc or dbp fp and to not be impacted by the relative abundance of various organic components however limitations are also evident the relationship was observed to be the strongest during warm water conditions 24 c with an r2 0 93 and to a lesser extent 14 c with an r2 0 67 the strength of the relationship decreased with temperature where sampling performed at 4 c show a weaker relationship r2 0 5 cold temperature impacts were expected as cellular activity is known to decrease at low temperatures this is also evident by commonly used sample storage protocols at 4 c to suspend biological activity prior to microbial analysis furthermore the slopes of best fit lines representing the rate of doc reduction per unit effective activity varied more than two fold from 0 05 to 0 12 which suggests that application of this concept on a year round basis would produce variable doc removal rates however a re interpretation of the data presented in fig 6 to quantify the relationship between doc removal and eea based on the application or absence of ozone fig s3 showed that temperature did not affect all relationships with eea even with the 4 c data included statistically significant α 0 01 relationships were observed between doc removal and effective esterase activity when comparing filters that treated settled water with or without ozone furthermore the slopes of best fit lines are indicative of organic biodegradability with filters treating ozonated organics performing slightly more efficiently higher slope of 0 07 when compared to those treating non ozonated influent 0 06 slope similar results were also observed when considering thm fp and effective esterase activity fig s4 generally poor relationships r2 0 5 were observed between effective esterase activity and haa fp or han fp indicating that other carbon degrading enzymes may be more representative of their removal figs s5 and s6 in addition to utilizing enzyme activity to estimate effluent water quality it may also be possible to infer the organic character an estimate of the relative mass fraction of organics that may be degraded within the filter can be obtained by normalizing the mass of organics removed mg relative to eea μm where enzyme activity can be used as a surrogate for the metabolic rate this calculation provides an estimate of the mass of organics biodegraded within each filter relative to the esterase enzyme activity pre ozonation was shown to increase the relative mass of biodegraded organics by 20 2 1 when compared to filters treating settled water which has been shown in the literature with increased aoc and bdoc as such adjusting ozone dose can improve organics removal efficiency until a point of diminishing return is achieved atp in the top 5 cm of the filter and effective atp defined as the product of the atp concentration measured at 5 cm filter depth and filter ebct were also compared to doc thm fp haa fp and han fp in the same manner as effective activity poor relationships r2 0 4 were observed both seasonally and when based on pre treatment type settled water vs ozonated settled water for all organic parameters indicating that atp is not a suitable parameter for predicting the overall biodegradation rate figs s7 s10 although phosphatase activity is not mechanistically related to phosphate uptake a strong relationship r2 0 77 independent of filter operation pre treatment or media type was observed fig 7 when phosphate levels are lower than 0 5 mg l it is difficult to infer the rate of removal based on the ea however at higher concentrations and ea of 20um this relationship between nutrient utilization and cellular function may provide guidance and inform biofilter operation by allowing maximum nutrient removal to be estimated ea could one day serve as a valuable source water monitoring tool 3 3 treatment of dbp precursors in addition to doc thm haa han and iodo dbp precursors were represented using formation potential fp tests to determine the reduction of organics associated with various pre treatments and filter operating strategies coagulation achieved 40 4 2 mg l 35 9 63 μg l 28 16 32 μg l and 23 22 2 7 μg l reductions of doc thm fp haa fp and han fp respectively from raw water fig s11 coagulation 40 mg alum l was able to achieve similar doc removals throughout the year as evidenced by the relatively small standard deviation observed 4 0 05 mg l although targeting a consistent doc concentration is an easily implemented control parameter it was evident that post coagulation doc reductions were not necessarily indicative of dbp control coagulation removed a greater percentage of doc when compared to the formation potential of any specific group of dbps as such alternative coagulant dosing strategies may be required to achieve control of specific dbps to satisfy more stringent regulatory requirements selection of an appropriate ozone dose is critical for water providers from both a water quality and operational costs perspective two ozone dosages 2 3 and 2 7 mg l were applied in order to obtain post contactor residuals of 0 1 0 05 and 0 5 0 05 mg l dosing to achieve a target ozone residual of 0 5 mg l provided better organics control post coagulation than a residual of 0 1 mg l when considering doc 6 vs 3 thm fp 31 vs 23 haa fp 35 vs 24 and han fp 49 vs 40 although increasing the applied ozone dose did not statistically improve treatment likely due to seasonal temperature variations impacting ozone efficiency increased ozone residuals provided improved doc and dbp fp reduction lower levels going onto the biofilters for each sampling event table 2 in general biofiltration provided improved organics reduction utilizing gac media when increasing ebct 15 vs 30 min and with the application of pre ozonation fig 8 anthracite filters backwashed with chlorinated water anth 15 cl were unable to develop sufficient biomass to operate biologically based on a 70 ng atp g media threshold as expected for conventionally operated filters as a result these filters were unable to significantly reduce α 0 05 doc or han fp from settled water with or without ozonation when compared to filters backwashed with their own effluent anth 15 o3 anth 15 filters backwashed with chlorinated water anth 15 cl o3 anth 15 cl provided significantly less α 0 05 doc 5 0 15 mg l and thm fp 15 15 μg l control when combined with pre ozonation increasing ebct from 15 to 30 min did not significantly improve organics control although small 10 positive benefits were observed fig s12 based on recent studies at other locations this result confirms previous hypotheses that much of the biodegradation occurs near the surface of the biofilter and the readily assimilable carbon can be consumed in the first 5 cm but the remaining carbon has a constant rate of removal through the filter mckie et al 2019 degerman et al 2013 figure s12 illustrates the removal of thm precursors i e the reduction of thm fp with increasing filter depth more than 50 of the precursors removed by biofiltration could be deemed as easily biodegradable with removal in the top 5 cm of the filter similar results were observed for doc haa fp and han fp figs s13 s15 the relatively high removal of organics in the upper 5 cm of the filter can be explained by its high concentration of enzyme activity and associated active biomass concentration 4 discussion adoption of biofiltration presents a low cost means to improve treated water quality without significant infrastructure changes for many facilities despite improvements in the practical understanding of biofilter operation full scale monitoring has not developed in the same way whereby turbidity headloss and filter run time typically serve as the predominant indicators of optimized performance identification of a means to characterize monitor and promote bioactivity within a biofilter is vital to its implementation and long term success studies examining biological activity serve to change the narrative from one which views biological treatment as a value added benefit to one that emphasizes biological treatment as a primary driver for implementation beniwal et al 2018 mckie et al 2016 zearley and summers 2012 this research aims to provide engineers and operators with information to reliably operate biofilters by illustrating development and implementation of new tools much research has been conducted in an effort to model biofiltration processes and subsequent substrate removal saez and rittmann 1992 zhang and huck 1996 holzalski and bouwer 2001 qiongqiong et al 2008 terry et al 2019 however many of these studies were limited by the need to account for parameters not easily measured at full scale facilities including diffusion dispersion substrate utilization rates cell concentrations substrate flux fitting constants and other site specific parameters as a result the implementation of these models to guide full scale operation has been very limited results of this study have demonstrated the importance and practical value of quantifying biological activity via enzyme activity assays in contrast to simply measuring biomass density via atp effective activity which combines enzyme activity and ebct to estimate substrate removal μm has been utilized to provide a better understanding of biofilter operation and treated water quality for two different sources waters incorporating a wide range of treatment conditions coagulation ozone ultrafiltration uv disinfection media gac anthracite over sand and operating conditions with or without routine backwash or daily shutdown mckie et al 2019 these results suggest that effective enzyme activity monitoring may provide valuable insight regarding biofiltration process design and operation this work is of particular importance as it simplifies monitoring and interpretation by eliminating the need to consider the impact of temperature emelko et al 2006 moll et al 1999 ebct zhang et al 2017 backwash basu et al 2015 miltner et al 1995 and pre ozonation selbes et al 2017 black and bérubé 2014 whereby biofilm naturally adapts to all of these factors as represented by changes in enzyme activity the increasingly widespread implementation of biological treatment demonstrates the need to better understand and apply biological monitoring effective activity represents a tool that can improve utilization of monitoring data and in doing so provide more effective treatment future research should be conducted to evaluate the use of enzyme activity as a parameter to optimize operation strategies such as routine filter shut down in order to apply principles commonly utilized in wastewater treatment to stimulate metabolic activity and select for healthy microbiomes additionally alternative enzymes should be examined to identify which ones best represent the degradation potential for dbp precursors or specific contaminants this research should precede the evaluation of mechanistic degradation pathways such that the link between enzyme activity and substrate degradation may be better understood 5 conclusions this study examined the bioactivity and dbp precursor removal potential of pilot scale biofilters consisting of various filter media gac and anthracite over sand with or without pre ozonation and chlorinated backwash at 15 and 30 min ebcts anthracite filters backwashed with chlorinated water had lower concentrations of active biomass as measured by atp which were also associated with lower enzyme activity gac filters overall had higher atp concentrations especially in the top 5 cm those operated with 15 min ebcts were more biological than those operated with a 30 min ebct in all gac filters atp decreased through filter depth likely as a response to lower concentrations of available biodegradable substrate as it passes through the biofilm enzyme activity can react to changes in biofilter operation such as the presence of chlorine in the backwash water when compared to measurement of biomass density alone esterase and phosphatase activity which have been presented as surrogates for cellular function and relate to organics and nutrient utilization showed very similar trends to atp higher enzyme activities were observed for gac filters when compared to anthracite ozone increased activity when compared to filters receiving settled water without ozone increasing ozone residual from 0 1 to 0 5 mg l significantly improved the removal of thm fp and increased reduction of other organic compounds suggesting that ozone optimization is necessary to ensure that treatment objectives are achieved effective activity defined as the product of enzyme activity measured at a depth of 5 cm and ebct was shown to be indicative of filter performance effective esterase and phosphatase activity demonstrated good relationships with organic and nutrient
