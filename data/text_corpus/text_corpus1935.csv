9675,declining water levels of the ogallala aquifer challenge economic availability of the groundwater and necessitate adoption of advanced irrigation systems with efficient irrigation strategies irrigation methods and application levels affect water productivity and farm profitability this study evaluated the synergy between water conservation through a deficit irrigation strategy and economic profitability of agricultural production the economic feasibility of cotton production was compared using field data for mid and low elevation spray application mesa and lesa respectively low energy precision application lepa and subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems in the texas high plains thp region treatments included irrigated cotton with water application at 25 50 75 and 100 evapotranspiration et replacement levels and near dryland cotton production both field level data and well calibrated model simulation data were used to assess cotton profitability at varying risk attitudes of producers results showed that more irrigation water consistently increased average net return of cotton production for all irrigation systems except for sdi which produced a similar net return at both 75 and 100 et replacement levels a larger chance of getting a net return greater than 380 ha 1 was observed for mesa lesa and lepa systems with the full irrigation at the 100 et replacement level as well as for sdi with 75 et replacement economic risk analysis showed that lepa had a higher net return than other systems at each of the four irrigation levels and it would be preferred by risk neutral somewhat risk averse and rather risk averse cotton producers for each irrigation system full irrigation was most preferred by risk neutral producers and only minor differences were observed in the expected returns between 75 and 100 et replacements as the producers became somewhat or more risk averse groundwater conservation can be achieved with sdi without compromising crop yield or farm income while government policies and financial incentives can help motivate producers to save irrigation water and maintain a high farm profit under spray and lepa systems keywords cotton irrigation system profitability water conservation certainty equivalent risk premium ogallala aquifer 1 introduction producers in the texas high plains thp region are facing challenges to sustain irrigated agriculture due to declining groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer and increasing climate variability chaudhuri and ale 2014 modala et al 2017 continued water availability in the southern portion of the ogallala aquifer is vital to the economy of the thp region where approximately 95 of the pumped groundwater is used for irrigation kukal and irmak 2020 lu et al 2020 twbd 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a major irrigated cash crop in texas with planted acreage of about 2 85 million hectares about 52 of the total crop acreage in the thp region and production value of approximately 2 14 billion nass 2021 usda ers 2019 and in this respect it leads all other states in the united states full irrigation to meet crop water demands is not guaranteed in this region and crop production needs to be strategized to meet regional water conservation goals ale et al 2020 hpwd 2015 previous studies have focused on crop water productivity cwp which refers to crop production per unit of water use and its increase is a good indicator of improved production efficiency in irrigated agriculture araya et al 2019 fan et al 2018 nair et al 2013 zou et al 2020 field experiments have been conducted to increase cwp by strategically applying less water than the maximum that crops would use i e regulated deficit irrigation strategies these strategies have been proposed to maximize yield or net return for a certain amount of water use rather than maximizing the total yield or gross return baumhardt et al 2009 garibay et al 2019 greaves and wang 2017 himanshu et al 2019 hunsaker et al 2015 shareef et al 2018 in the thp region cwp can be enhanced by either achieving the same crop yield profit from less water a higher yield profit from the same water application comas et al 2019 pabuayon et al 2019 or some level of reduced water use that does not greatly decrease crop yield additionally efficient irrigation systems can promote enhancement of water producitivity and economic profitability gathala et al 2020 levidow et al 2014 the commonly adopted irrigation systems in the thp region include mid and low elevation spray application mesa and lesa respectively low energy precision application lepa and subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems 1 1 these systems are typically used for farm irrigation in the u s great plains mesa and lesa are conventional systems while lepa is the most widely adopted irrigation system in this region combined with center pivots or linear move machines sprinklers discharge water at different pressures and water application efficiency is lower under mesa as compared to lesa and lepa bordovsky 2019 peters et al 2016 sdi irrigates crops through burried tubes with emitters at regular spacings this irrigation system is typically used for row crops and its application has rapidly increased in past decades barnes et al 2020 bordovsky and porter 2003 using different irrigation systems along with various irrigation levels have been one focus of farm irrigation management studies bordovsky 2019 rudnick et al 2019 several field studies evaluated agronomic performance of cotton under different irrigation systems and irrigation levels colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 many other recent modeling and experimental studies also examined crop yield and cwp also known as water use efficiency as affected by different irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation garibay et al 2019 witt et al 2020 variable rate irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2020b yari et al 2017 et based irrigation marek et al 2016 irrigation rate and timing bordovsky et al 2015 thorp et al 2020 irrigation scheduling via information communication technologies vellidis et al 2016 or a combination of these strategies himanshu et al 2019 mahan et al 2012 o shaughnessy et al 2020a 2020b an economic analysis is needed to better understand profits from producers investments in improved irrigation systems and more effective irrigation management strategies amosson et al 2011 guerrero et al 2016 reynolds et al 2020 partial budget and enterprise budget approaches are mostly used by researchers to calculate the gross margin or net return from different irrigation scenarios delaune et al 2020 enciso et al 2005 mauget et al 2013 segarra et al 1999 for instance bordovsky et al 2000 found that compared to sdi a higher net return could be achieved with the lepa irrigation system when irrigation capacity was more than 2 5 mm d 1 however the sdi could be a better irrigation option in the thp region if physical and legal constraints limit lepa application or sdi installation costs become lower based on a field experiment conducted in chillicothe tx from 2008 to 2010 delaune et al 2012 analyzed the impacts of different irrigation levels 0 33 66 100 and 133 et replacement on cotton yield and profits and they found a maximum net return at the 100 et level additionally mitchell mccallister et al 2020 compared profits under 27 irrigation treatments using a lepa irrigation system and found that as compared to lower irrigation levels a higher gross margin could be achieved at a high irrigation level 6 4 mm d 1 during the maturation stage when growing degree days are greater than 750 c baseline temperature of 15 6 c nevertheless these studies were mostly focused on the comparison of profits without any consideration to uncertainties associated with irrigation amount timing rainfall variability spatial farmland productivity and input output price fluctuations that substantially influence crop production producers farming decisions and farm income the economic risk analysis approach could be used to incorporate these uncertainties anderson and hardaker 2003 hardaker et al 2015 while the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf approach could be used to assess the economic feasibility lien et al 2007 williams et al 2012 producers may have different degrees of risk attitudes towards alternative irrigation systems and water application levels relevant research by bhattarai et al 2020 examined the profits for two irrigation scheduling methods in georgia cotton production and they found risk premiums for smart irrigation app and calendar based checkbook method were 301 341 ha 1 and 306 314 ha 1 respectively relative to dryland production the authors concluded that the smart irrigation app was the most risk efficient scheduling method which increased the risk adjusted profits for cotton producers in addition serf has been widely used to compare advanced and innovative farm practices with conventional operations archer and reicosky 2009 watkins et al 2008 in particular boyer et al 2018 investigated the profits of cotton production with no till and winter cover crops in tennessee and they found risk averse farmers would prefer no till production without cover crops similar studies in texas concluded that no till without a cover crop was the most preferred practice by risk neutral and rather risk averse growers in dryland cotton production fan et al 2020b and that no till with mixed cover crops was most preferred by very risk averse producers in irrigated cotton systems fan et al 2020a therefore the risk adjusted profitability analysis can incorporate producers risk preference and help us better understand their adoption of advanced production systems to the best of the authors knowledge however no previous study has documented the risk adjusted farm profitability associated with irrigation strategies in the present study an economic risk analysis was carried out to evaluate the profitability of four irrigation systems mesa lesa lepa and sdi at four alternative irrigation levels 25 50 75 and 100 et replacement in thp cotton production yield data were simulated with and tested against a four year field experiment using a multivariate empirical distribution approach the net returns were estimated for dryland and irrigated cotton production scenarios using simulated cotton yields and prices further the net return distributions were compared using the serf procedure which ranks risky outcomes associated with different irrigation systems and irrigation levels at various risk aversion levels of cotton growers 2 methods and data 2 1 field experiment cotton yield simulations and validations were carried out based on the observations from a field experiment at the usda conservation and production research laboratory in bushland texas 35 19 n 102 06 w colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 this research site is in a typical semi arid region of the texas high plains the climate is characterized by low precipitation with an average annual amount of 415 mm a high class a pan evaporation of 2690 mm per year noaa 2020 and on average 65 of the evaporative demand and 70 of the precipitation occur from may to october which represents the growing season of cotton usda ars conservation production research laboratory records 1993 2012 fig s1 in the appendix a shows the precipitation during cotton growing and non growing seasons at a nearby weather station the predominant soil series at the location is a pullman clay loam fine superactive mixed thermic torrertic paleustoll usda nrcs 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l paymaster 2280 bg rr was planted during 2003 2004 2006 and 2007 growing seasons 2 2 in 2005 cotton crop was destroyed by hail and the field was replanted with soybeans colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 the experiment was conducted in a split block design and the plot design was shown in fig s2 of the appendix a irrigation was applied using a three span lateral move system outfitted with zones of three irrigation application methods mesa lesa and lepa and zones that were not irrigated by the lateral move system but by an sdi system with drip lines laid in the same direction of travel for the mesa lesa and lepa treatments irrigation rates were varied in the direction of travel by varying the speed of the lateral move and irrigation duration was identical for each irrigation method and was typically 4 h further irrigations by the lateral move were applied only during morning hours to avoid smaller nighttime or larger afternoon wind and evaporative losses i e when atmospheric demand was average howell and evett 2005 for sdi irrigation rates were varied by emitter flow and spacing along the drip lateral irrigation events for sdi were initiated at the same time as the lateral move but the duration was typically 24 h which is similar to sdi management used by commercial cotton producers in the region as observed by the authors the irrigation methods were randomized within a block and each block consisted of a span of the linear move system with three replications each plot was 25 m long and 9 m wide with 12 rows each irrigation rate strip was separated by 5 m planted borders furrow dikes were installed after crop establishment to control run on and runoff schneider and howell 2000 the experiment included a near dryland treatment i0 which corresponded to 0 et replacement and four irrigated treatments i25 i50 i75 and i100 which corresponded to 25 50 75 and 100 et replacement respectively in each growing season the i100 irrigation rate was determined by soil water content readings using a field calibrated neutron probe at depths from 0 10 m to 2 3 m in 0 20 m increments evett et al 2008 irrigation was applied when soil water depletion reached 25 mm in the i100 mesa treatment and all other irrigation treatments received proportionally less water according to their et replacement levels colaizzi et al 2005 irrigations were metered using propeller type totalizing flow meters mccrometer inc hemet calif usa rainfall was recorded using a tipping bucket rain gauge model te525 texas electronics inc dallas texas usa at a micrometeorological station 50 m south of the experimental field porter et al 2005 in the i0 treatment sufficient pre plant irrigation was applied only for crop emergence using mesa during the four years of the experiment the average irrigation water applied was 22 67 111 156 and 201 mm for i0 i25 i50 i75 and i100 treatments respectively colaizzi et al 2010 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by the soil water balance as irrigation in season rainfall volumetric soil water at planting volumetric soil water at harvest run on and run off were assumed negligible because furrow dikes were installed and the field had a slope of 0 0025 m m 1 schneider and howell 2000 deep percolation was controlled by irrigation scheduling based on the neutron probe that avoided overfilling the soil water profile which was confirmed by the lack of increases in measured volumetric water contents at lower depths 2 1 2 3 m evett et al 2008 similar amounts of pre plant fertilizer containing nitrogen n and phosphorous p were applied to the raised beds based on a soil fertility analysis each year colaizzi et al 2005 additional n was applied with the irrigation water compared with the full irrigation treatment the fertilizer amount was adjusted proportionately in the deficit irrigation treatments additional field measurements included plant growth and development final plant biomass and lint yield and fiber quality plants were measured biweekly and included height width number of nodes and number and location of reproductive organs i e branch number and position at crop maturity destructive plant samples were obtained from 10 m2 areas in the center of each plot samples were weighed ginned and analyzed for micronaire strength color grade and uniformity at the international textile center lubbock texas and cotton loan values were determined based on these four fiber quality measurements additional details about this field experiment can be found in colaizzi et al 2010 2 2 simulation procedures crop yields and prices were simulated based on the multivariate empirical mve distribution the mve distribution follows the monte carlo simulation protocols to account for correlation among the stochastic variables richardson et al 2000 the cotton yields at different irrigation levels may be correlated due to the same soil and climatic conditions and they can be non normally distributed because of limited field observations cotton yields may be highly variable due to variable weather conditions in the study area himanshu et al 2021 and high variability of cotton prices can also expected due to global supply and demand fluctuations the mve simulation therefore can capture the variability of variables and provide consistent estimation for farm level analysis richardson et al 2008 the mve simulations were carried out for cotton lint yields at multiple irrigation levels field level data from the four year experiment colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 described in the previous section were used to run mve simulations for lint yields and the simulations for lint and cottonseed prices were conducted based on the annual prices for texas upland cotton during 2003 2019 nass 2021 each mve simulation was carried out to generate 500 iterations of data points richardson et al 2008 combining with input use data these simulated variables were then used to conduct the economic estimation and risk analysis as a step wise process the mve model conducts stochastic simulations of random variables i e yield and price fig 1 shows the following simulation procedures adopted in this study as suggested by richardson et al 2008 1 estimation of yield range given the lint yield data colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 the mean yield values for all the irrigation treatments were combined with a common variation 3 3 to be consistent with relevant literature delaune et al 2020 a coefficient of variation equal to 0 25 was used for all irrigation treatments to determine the range of yield the upper and lower bounds of the range were determined using eq 1 1 y ˆ u y z σ n y ˆ l y z σ n where y ˆ u l represents the estimated upper and lower bounds y is the mean yield in each treatment z refers to the z value of a normal distribution σ is the standard deviation and n is the number of field observations the z value can be specified to generate a certain confidence interval i e 95 standard deviation was calculated from the mean and the hypothetical coefficient of variation c v following σ c v y 2 estimation of yield distribution the gray richardson klose schumann grks model richardson et al 2008 was used to estimate yield distributions from the above estimated ranges the grks approach can generate random variables when little data are available richardson et al 2008 this approach is also preferred for assessing uncertainty because it is flexible to generate distributions for alternative probabilities the grks model can be specified as 2 φ grks min middle max where φ refers to the simulated distribution which follows a grks function with specified minimum middle and maximum values the minimum and maximum values do not necessarily have an equal distance from the middle and the middle value can be mean median or mode richardson 2010 we trimmed the simulated data by removing the values less than the minimum and greater than the maximum because the grks model defines the minimum and maximum as the values that have a probability of 0 02275 and 0 97725 greater than the rest of the distribution respectively this gives us the simulated data in a 95 confidence interval i e the distribution with 2 standard deviations which is consistent with the yield range and variation specified in the above step 3 estimation of the correlation matrix a linear correlation matrix can be specified for the crop yields at a certain irrigation level as well as for the prices of lint and cottonseed for example at an irrigation level i i 25 50 75 and 100 et the lint yields for the four irrigation methods j j mesa lesa lepa and sdi have a correlation matrix r with correlation r between each pair of the yields 3 r i j 1 r i 12 r i 21 1 r i 13 r i 14 r i 23 r i 24 r i 31 r i 32 r i 41 r i 42 1 r i 34 r i 43 1 the correlation matrix for the lint and seed prices can be represented by 4 r lint seed 1 r lint seed r lint seed 1 therefore the price correlation matrix is a 2 2 matrix and the yield matrix is a 4 4 matrix 4 4 the near dryland i0 yield was combined with the yields at i25 to estimate the correlation matrix thus the correlation matrix for i0 and i25 is a 5 5 matrix the stochastic prices and yields at alternative irrigation levels were simulated using the correlation matrix approach 4 estimation of the correlated uniform standard deviates cusds as model parameters cusds specify the relationship of the random variables using the correlation matrix and retain the observed stochastic dependency among the variables i e yield and price in the stochastic simulation first we estimated the correlated standard normal deviates by taking the square root of the correlation matrix and multiplying a vector of independent standard normal deviates then the cusds were obtained by converting the standard normal deviates with an inverse transformation of a standard normal distribution richardson et al 2008 incorporating the cusds in the stochastic simulation avoids under or over estimating the mean and variance of yields under different irrigation systems if they are correlated given the dimensions of the yields under different irrigation systems and historical prices specified above the model estimated 19 correlated yield data series and 17 price data series 5 generation of random variables the random variables were estimated using the mve model an empirical distribution function emp was employed using cusds in an inverse transformation of the empirical distribution 5 y i j f y i j σ i j cusd i j for j 1 2 3 4 at a certain irrigation level i 6 p lint seed f p lint seed σ lint seed cusd lint seed where tilde denotes a stochastic variable f represents a multivariate empirical function that follows a normal distribution dash denotes the variable mean of the estimated yield data or historical price data prices and lint yields at alternative et replacement levels were simulated for 500 iterations to generate stochastic variables using the latin hypercube procedure richardson et al 2008 the generated variables followed a uniform distribution with n 500 intervals and each interval has randomly selected at least one value this ensured that the simulation considered all corresponding areas of the probability distributions 6 model evaluation the simulated stochastic variables were compared with the model input data students t test determined whether the correlation coefficients of the historical and simulated matrices were statistically different at the 95 confidence level the two sample hotelling t2 test determined whether the mean vectors of the historical and simulated data were equal the box s m test determined whether the covariance matrices of the historical and simulated data were equivalent the complete homogeneity test determines whether the mean vectors and covariance matrices are equivalent simultaneously after the evaluation of the random variables these simulated data were used to conduct economic analysis the mve approach was also employed in previous empirical studies that investigated the economic feasibility of soil and water conservation practices in multiple cropping systems adusumilli et al 2020 kadigi et al 2020 2 3 cost and profit estimation the profitability of using different irrigation systems and applying varying amounts of irrigation water was evaluated by an enterprise budget developed by texas a m agrilife extension 2020 the production cost was estimated using data on field operations and input use colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 input prices were updated to reflect the actual production payment in the region the total cost for each irrigation system j at a certain irrigation level i was calculated using 7 tc i j vc i j fc i j where tc vc and fc refer to the total cost variable cost and fixed cost respectively variable costs included expenses on seed fertilizer pesticide herbicide energy and labor associated with tillage and irrigation insurance machinery repairs and maintenance interest and harvest costs 5 5 land rental was not included in the budget the application rates of fertilizer pesticide and herbicide were assumed the same for the full irrigation level in all four years the chemical and energy prices and labor payment were assumed same fixed costs included machinery depreciation for tractors planter sprayer irrigation system etc these costs were estimated for the texas panhandle extension district 1 and necessary modifications were made for the input and output prices total revenue was estimated using the simulated yield and price data the cottonseed yield was estimated using a conversion ratio of 1 412 units of seed per unit of lint cotton incorporated 2018 8 tr i j y i j lint p lint y i j seed p seed where tr refers to total revenue y i j lint is the simulated lint yield in eq 5 and y i j seed is the estimated seed yield and y i j seed 1 412 y i j lint p lint and p seed are the simulated lint and seed price in eq 6 the net return was finally calculated using eq 9 9 π i j tr i j tc i j where π i j is the estimated net return for cotton production under each irrigation system j at a certain irrigation level i 2 4 economic risk analysis income variation can result from the uncertainties associated with input use and crop yield farmers decisions regarding irrigation systems and irrigation levels can greatly influence the sustainability of water resources and agricultural production and these decisions are further affected by producers risk attitudes and expected profit ribera et al 2004 farmers with varying attitudes toward risks may have different preferences for irrigation systems and irrigation levels fan et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 risk averse producers are more likely to choose the irrigation system and irrigation level that result in a smaller variation in farm profit therefore this study examined cotton farmers production decisions regarding four irrigation systems and four irrigation levels as mutually exclusive choices to identify the most risk efficient practices for crop production and groundwater conservation following anderson and dillon 1992 the absolute risk aversion coefficient arac r a was used to measure producers risk attitudes the arac can be expressed by 10 r a w r r w w where r r w is the relative risk aversion coefficient rrac for a certain amount of farm income w hardaker et al 2004 according to anderson and hardaker 2003 the rrac levels include risk neutral r r 0 somewhat risk averse r r 1 rather risk averse r r 2 very risk averse r r 3 and extremely risk averse r r 4 the average farm profit is equal to 161 ha 1 which determines the upper bound of arac therefore this study utilized various risk levels including 0 for risk neutral 0 0062 for somewhat risk averse 0 0124 for rather risk averse 0 0186 for very risk averse and 0 0248 for extremely risk averse the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf approach ranks a set of risky choices based on their certainty equivalents ces across various risk aversion levels the ce of a risky choice is defined as the guaranteed amount of payment at which a decision maker would be willing to accept instead of taking the risky action 11 ce w r w u 1 w r w as determined by the utility function u and risk aversion level r in eq 11 a producer is assumed to prefer a risky outcome with a higher ce value lien et al 2007 a specific form of the utility function is required to estimate the ce values a negative exponential utility function can more efficiently estimate ce with constant absolute risk aversion hardaker et al 2015 schumann et al 2004 and this function has been commonly adopted in previous empirical studies fan et al 2020a williams et al 2014 subsequently a utility weighted risk premium rp is calculated at a certain risk aversion level of cotton producers a rp value is the difference in the ces of adopting a specific irrigation system and an irrigation level relative to a baseline scenario i e near dryland production the rp at a certain risk aversion level can be represented by 12 rp ij dryland ce ij ce dryland the value of rp represents the minimum amount of payment that a producer will have to receive before he she is willing to shift from dryland to irrigated production at a certain risk aversion level r a the value of rp is also considered as the risk adjusted profit gain from adopting irrigation in crop production a positive rp suggests a farmer would prefer irrigated production over the dryland production on the contrary a negative rp means dryland production is preferred and the negative value is the expected loss if a producer adopts any irrigation method with a certain irrigation level the stochastic simulations and economic risk analysis were conducted by the simulation and econometrics to analyze risk simetar software developed by richardson et al 2008 the serf analysis was performed for the net return distributions of cotton production under each of the four irrigation systems and at alternative irrigation levels the ces and rps as well as their rankings are discussed for a range of aracs representing producers risk attitudes from risk neutral to extremely risk averse 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation simulated lint yields were evaluated for both individual series and joint distributions at each irrigation level table 1 the average lint yield under near dryland production was 396 kg ha 1 similarly average lint yields for 25 et replacement irrigation level i25 treatment were 462 494 550 and 641 kg ha 1 under mesa lesa lepa and sdi irrigation methods respectively these mean simulated yields were not statistically different from those of the experimental data i e p 0 05 as indicated by the f test the variance of each simulated yield distribution was not statistically different from that of the field data i e p 0 05 for the joint distribution of yields at the i25 level the two sample hotelling t2 test showed an insignificant result i e p 0 05 which indicated that the mean vectors of the simulated and experimental lint yields are equal the complete homogeneity test also showed that the variances of the simulated and experimental yields were not significantly different at the i50 level the lint yields for mesa lesa lepa and sdi systems were 557 560 739 and 800 kg ha 1 respectively table 1 as the irrigation water increased to the 75 et level the lint yields increased to 781 754 870 and 1020 kg ha 1 for mesa lesa lepa and sdi respectively under the full irrigation application the lint yields were 871 885 992 and 1065 kg ha 1 for mesa lesa lepa and sdi respectively all the yield values were consistent with the experimental data colaizzi et al 2010 and validated by the statistical tests specifically at each irrigation level the two sample t test showed that there was not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the means of simulated and experimental data were equal at the 0 05 significance level i e p 0 05 for the individual data series the f tests showed that the equal variances of the simulated and experimental data were not rejected at the 0 05 significance level i e p 0 05 additionally the joint distribution tests showed the mean vectors and the variance covariance matrices were not significantly different between the simulated and experimental data at the i50 i75 and i100 irrigation levels respectively i e p 0 05 table 2 shows the results of the validation tests for price simulations the lint and seed prices considered in this study were 1 344 kg 1 and 0 195 kg 1 respectively which were equal to the means of historical prices during 2003 2019 the joint distribution comparison showed that the simulated means were not statistically different from the historical means i e p 0 05 from the two sample hotelling t2 test and the variances were also not significantly different i e p 0 05 from the box s m test the complete homogeneity test also confirmed that the distributions of the historical and simulated price series were not significantly different furthermore the correlation coefficients test had a t value of 0 44 which was smaller than the critical value of 1 96 at the 95 confidence level and therefore the simulated lint and seed price series were appropriately correlated to the historical data the correlation coefficient of the simulated lint and seed prices was 0 573 which was significantly different from zero p 0 001 whereas the correlation of the historical lint and seed prices was 0 557 and it was also significantly different from zero p 0 001 these results of statistical tests confirmed the validity of using simulated yield and price data in the economic analysis 3 2 water use and production costs fig 2 shows the average water use for all the treatments associated with different irrigation systems and irrigation levels over the four years of the experiment irrigation water applications under different irrigation systems were very close at a specific et replacement level for example at the full irrigation level i100 the seasonal water use sum of irrigation precipitation and soil water use was 589 588 592 and 579 mm under mesa lesa lepa and sdi system respectively the average seasonal water use of the four irrigation systems was 425 485 537 and 587 mm for i25 i50 i75 and i100 treatments respectively the seasonal water use was 368 mm for i0 production 6 6 this included minimum irrigation of 22 mm mean value for four years to ensure plant emergence only the estimated total costs are presented in table 3 among the four irrigation systems the total costs were similar for mesa lesa and lepa while the total cost associated with sdi was approximately 25 higher for example with full irrigation i100 the total costs were 1101 1075 1095 and 1339 ha 1 on average for mesa lesa lepa and sdi respectively the high cost for sdi was primarily due to the more expensive subsurface irrigation system and higher harvest cost associated with higher yield the average cost for the near dryland cotton was 553 ha 1 which was about 33 less than the costs under mesa lesa 820 ha 1 for both and lepa 827 ha 1 systems and about half of that under sdi system 1053 ha 1 at the i25 level 3 3 crop yield fig 3 compares the simulated lint yields for all the treatments across the treatments the yield range became greater as irrigation water increased at each irrigation level the highest lint yield was found with the sdi system followed by lepa in contrast mesa and lesa systems resulted in a lower cotton yield these results indicated the highest productivity with the use of sdi systems for cotton production and this was also consistent with the highest irrigation efficiency of the sdi system amosson et al 2009 as expected the near dryland production showed the lowest lint yield which was approximately 56 and 98 kg ha 1 less than that under mesa and lesa systems at the i25 level respectively in general an increase in irrigation water use resulted in a higher cotton yield under each irrigation system however the rate of increase in yield slowed down at the higher irrigation levels for example the average lint yield using mesa was 464 kg ha 1 at the i25 level and it increased to 557 kg ha 1 at the i50 level i e an increase of 93 kg ha 1 the yield increase was 224 kg ha 1 from i50 to i75 and 90 kg ha 1 from i75 to i100 similarly the yield increase for sdi was 159 kg ha 1 from i25 to i50 220 kg ha 1 from i50 to i75 and 45 kg ha 1 from i75 to i100 fig 3 and table 1 these results indicated that full irrigation was not always the best strategy to optimize groundwater use in the thp region and that deficit irrigation could provide a higher cwp comas et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 witt et al 2020 3 4 profit distribution fig 4 plots the cumulative distributions of net returns from cotton production at different irrigation levels at the i25 level the profit distribution of lepa system was further to the right of the rest systems and closely matched with the distribution for the near dryland cotton system which indicated that lepa and near dryland production systems could provide higher income at very low or no irrigation application fig 4a in case of i50 and i100 irrigation levels the net return distribution of lepa lay to the right of the others followed by sdi fig 4b d this suggested that lepa could have a higher probability of getting a high income at both full irrigation and half irrigation levels the distributions of lepa and sdi were similar at i75 level and they were to the right of the other two systems except for the levels of net return greater than 700 ha 1 where the distribution for sdi lay to the right of that for lepa and returns less than 200 ha 1 where the distribution for lepa lay to the right of that for sdi fig 4c the net return distributions of mesa and lesa were similar at all irrigation levels the thick tails of sdi distributions in the four panels indicated that sdi had a larger chance of getting both very low and very high income levels in addition a comparison of the four irrigation levels suggested that adopting sdi was as profitable as lepa at a moderate irrigation level the lepa system was most profitable at both half and full irrigation levels which echoed the wide adoption of lepa systems in many of the semi arid areas including the thp region amosson et al 2011 bordovsky 2019 segarra et al 1999 to better understand the net return distributions of simulated irrigation strategies stoplight charts fig 5 were developed which clearly illustrate the probabilities of net returns being less than a lower target value and greater than an upper target value for all risky alternatives richardson 2010 in this study the 25th and 75th percentiles of the net returns were used as the lower and upper cut off values respectively for all the treatments fig 5 presents the probabilities of net returns less than 140 ha 1 and greater than 380 ha 1 for the four irrigation systems and alternative irrigation levels an overall comparison across all the treatments showed that the higher probability of the high income category i e greater than 380 ha 1 was generally associated with application of more irrigation water at the full irrigation level i e i100 lepa system had the highest chance of getting more than 380 ha 1 with a probability of 0 56 followed by sdi and lesa systems with probabilities of 0 45 and 0 43 respectively under the i75 level lepa 0 46 was only slightly better than sdi 0 45 in terms of obtaining a net return of more than 380 ha 1 additionally a comparison from low to high irrigation levels showed that the probability of the high net return category i e greater than 380 ha 1 for mesa lesa and lepa systems increased continuously while higher than i75 irrigation would not increase the net return with the sdi system therefore sdi system could potentially save irrigation water when irrigating at the i75 level and achieve the same profit level as the full irrigation level producers would more likely need to apply full irrigation to achieve a higher profit under other irrigation systems 3 5 comparison of irrigation systems fig 6 shows the ces of cotton production using different irrigation systems at each irrigation level in each panel four irrigation systems were ranked as the risk aversion level goes from risk neutral arac 0 to extremely risk averse arac 0 0248 at each risk aversion level the highest ce value presents the most risk efficient irrigation system for cotton producers table s1 of appendix a shows the numeric values of ces at specific risk aversion levels at each of the four irrigation levels lepa performed best among the four systems at risk neutral somewhat and rather risk aversion levels no difference in ce values of mesa lesa and lepa were observed at the very and extremely risk aversion levels this suggested that risk neutral or slightly risk averse producers would prefer lepa and they are indifferent among mesa lesa and lepa when they became more risk averse under i50 i75 and i100 sdi was the second risk preferred for risk neutral growers while it became the least preferred among the four irrigation systems for somewhat or even more risk averse growers the slope of the curve associated with sdi suggested that sdi was highly sensitive and even a slight increase in the risk aversion level would make it the less preferred system to further find the risk adjusted values for irrigation systems serf analysis calculated the risk premiums relative to mesa at each irrigation level as indicated by rp fig 7 shows the minimum payment amount that a cotton grower has to receive before he she is willing to switch from mesa to another irrigation system a positive value could be seen as the profit obtained by a grower from adopting an alternative system while a negative value could be seen as the loss table s1 also shows the numeric values of rps at specific risk aversion levels compared to mesa all rps of lesa and lepa were positive across the risk aversion levels except for very and extremely risk averse levels under i25 and lesa at the risk neutral level under i75 additionally positive rps associated with sdi were observed at the risk neutral and rps became negative for somewhat and more risk aversion levels this agreed with the findings of ces that lepa was the most risk preferred system and its performance became less prominent as a producer gets more risk averse bordovsky et al 2000 also confirmed that lepa resulted in higher net returns to risks compared to sdi system in cotton production 3 6 comparison of irrigation levels the serf analysis ranks irrigation scenarios across various risk aversion levels the ces in fig 8 suggested that i100 and i75 were the first and second most preferred irrigation levels for risk neutral producers while near dryland production was most preferred as the producers became somewhat or even more risk averse 7 7 fig s3 shows the stoplight charts of net returns at different irrigation levels the risk premium results showed that i75 and i100 had positive rps for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse growers and all rp values were negative if producers get more risk averse this indicated that full irrigation may not provide the highest farm income in particular for at least somewhat risk averse individuals and that cotton producers would rather choose irrigation level close to i75 in the thp region in addition fig 9 shows the ces of different irrigation levels for each irrigation system 8 8 fig s4 shows the cumulative distribution functions of different irrigation levels under each irrigation system consistent findings were observed in the three panels associated with mesa lesa and lepa where full irrigation i e i100 was the most preferred irrigation level for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse producers in each of the three systems the differences in ce values were minor as producers became even slightly risk averse 9 9 fig s5 shows the risk premiums of different irrigation levels under each irrigation system regarding sdi the ce values of i75 and i100 were almost the same for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse producers respectively nevertheless near dryland production was most preferred if a producer becomes more than somewhat risk averse regardless of irrigation system 4 implications and conclusions this study examined economic profits and their distributions for cotton production with different irrigation applications under mesa lesa lepa and sdi systems cotton yield simulations were based on a four year field experiment and the net returns of alternative irrigation treatments were estimated using an enterprise budget approach economic risk analysis was conducted using the serf procedure to provide insights for groundwater conservation and profitability of irrigated cotton production in the thp region similar to the results of cotton yields more irrigation water 10 10 that is increasing from 25 to 100 et replacement levels i e from i25 to i100 increased net returns of cotton production under mesa lesa and lepa systems while the profit increase was negligible for sdi when applied irrigation water exceeded 75 et replacement level a similar study found no significant difference in cotton yield for 66 and 133 et replacements while 100 et was associated with a higher net return in no till cotton production delaune et al 2012 further more irrigation increased the variability of cotton yields and net returns under each irrigation system fan et al 2020a garibay et al 2019 more irrigation water application was also associated with a larger chance of getting a higher net return that is greater than 380 ha 1 except for sdi therefore full irrigation application was more profitable to producers with mesa lesa and lepa systems while irrigation at the 75 et replacement was more profitable for sdi given that most producers in the region are forced to deficit irrigate by declining water availability evett et al 2020a this result helps explain why producers have installed so much sdi risk analysis results provided unique insights for irrigated cotton production by incorporating growers risk attitude for each of the four irrigation levels lepa showed a higher net return than other systems and would be preferred by risk neutral somewhat and rather risk averse producers the differences in net returns of mesa lesa and lepa were minor for very and extremely risk averse producers at each irrigation level for producers with a more than somewhat risk averse attitude sdi was always the least preferred system this result when combined with the fact that producers had installed 107 356 ha of sdi by 2013 increasing to 175 000 ha by 2016 in the high plains water district alone occupying 6 6 of the irrigated area by 2018 evett et al 2020a 2020b would indicate that producers in the region are willing to take on some risk in expectation of the greater yields associated with sdi additional analysis of different irrigation levels showed that full irrigation should be most preferred by risk neutral producers and there was only a minor difference in the expected returns of 75 and 100 et replacement as the producers became somewhat risk averse a further analysis associated with different irrigation levels under four systems confirmed that full irrigation should be most preferred for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse growers under mesa lesa and lepa systems while no difference was observed for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse growers under sdi this research provides economic evidence for et based irrigation decisions that fundamentally affect and are affected by specific irrigation systems both irrigation systems and irrigation levels are of great significance for the sustainable groundwater utilization in the thp region ale et al 2020 chaudhuri and ale 2014 without undermining the importance of advanced irrigation systems in water conservation this study comparatively evaluated the economic performance of alternative spray sprinkler and subsurface irrigation systems their relative performance can be influenced by input and output prices fan et al 2020a additionally farm level decisions on irrigation system adoption and water application are greatly influenced by input use investment decisions and government policies fan et al 2014 himanshu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 this study is also limited by the yield bounds observed in the field experiment future research can evaluate the economic performance of different cultivars and incorporate cultivar improvement over time future research should also incorporate the effects of advanced irrigation decision support system which are shown to produce improved cwp with regulated deficit irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2011 2015 o shaughnessy and

9675,declining water levels of the ogallala aquifer challenge economic availability of the groundwater and necessitate adoption of advanced irrigation systems with efficient irrigation strategies irrigation methods and application levels affect water productivity and farm profitability this study evaluated the synergy between water conservation through a deficit irrigation strategy and economic profitability of agricultural production the economic feasibility of cotton production was compared using field data for mid and low elevation spray application mesa and lesa respectively low energy precision application lepa and subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems in the texas high plains thp region treatments included irrigated cotton with water application at 25 50 75 and 100 evapotranspiration et replacement levels and near dryland cotton production both field level data and well calibrated model simulation data were used to assess cotton profitability at varying risk attitudes of producers results showed that more irrigation water consistently increased average net return of cotton production for all irrigation systems except for sdi which produced a similar net return at both 75 and 100 et replacement levels a larger chance of getting a net return greater than 380 ha 1 was observed for mesa lesa and lepa systems with the full irrigation at the 100 et replacement level as well as for sdi with 75 et replacement economic risk analysis showed that lepa had a higher net return than other systems at each of the four irrigation levels and it would be preferred by risk neutral somewhat risk averse and rather risk averse cotton producers for each irrigation system full irrigation was most preferred by risk neutral producers and only minor differences were observed in the expected returns between 75 and 100 et replacements as the producers became somewhat or more risk averse groundwater conservation can be achieved with sdi without compromising crop yield or farm income while government policies and financial incentives can help motivate producers to save irrigation water and maintain a high farm profit under spray and lepa systems keywords cotton irrigation system profitability water conservation certainty equivalent risk premium ogallala aquifer 1 introduction producers in the texas high plains thp region are facing challenges to sustain irrigated agriculture due to declining groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer and increasing climate variability chaudhuri and ale 2014 modala et al 2017 continued water availability in the southern portion of the ogallala aquifer is vital to the economy of the thp region where approximately 95 of the pumped groundwater is used for irrigation kukal and irmak 2020 lu et al 2020 twbd 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a major irrigated cash crop in texas with planted acreage of about 2 85 million hectares about 52 of the total crop acreage in the thp region and production value of approximately 2 14 billion nass 2021 usda ers 2019 and in this respect it leads all other states in the united states full irrigation to meet crop water demands is not guaranteed in this region and crop production needs to be strategized to meet regional water conservation goals ale et al 2020 hpwd 2015 previous studies have focused on crop water productivity cwp which refers to crop production per unit of water use and its increase is a good indicator of improved production efficiency in irrigated agriculture araya et al 2019 fan et al 2018 nair et al 2013 zou et al 2020 field experiments have been conducted to increase cwp by strategically applying less water than the maximum that crops would use i e regulated deficit irrigation strategies these strategies have been proposed to maximize yield or net return for a certain amount of water use rather than maximizing the total yield or gross return baumhardt et al 2009 garibay et al 2019 greaves and wang 2017 himanshu et al 2019 hunsaker et al 2015 shareef et al 2018 in the thp region cwp can be enhanced by either achieving the same crop yield profit from less water a higher yield profit from the same water application comas et al 2019 pabuayon et al 2019 or some level of reduced water use that does not greatly decrease crop yield additionally efficient irrigation systems can promote enhancement of water producitivity and economic profitability gathala et al 2020 levidow et al 2014 the commonly adopted irrigation systems in the thp region include mid and low elevation spray application mesa and lesa respectively low energy precision application lepa and subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems 1 1 these systems are typically used for farm irrigation in the u s great plains mesa and lesa are conventional systems while lepa is the most widely adopted irrigation system in this region combined with center pivots or linear move machines sprinklers discharge water at different pressures and water application efficiency is lower under mesa as compared to lesa and lepa bordovsky 2019 peters et al 2016 sdi irrigates crops through burried tubes with emitters at regular spacings this irrigation system is typically used for row crops and its application has rapidly increased in past decades barnes et al 2020 bordovsky and porter 2003 using different irrigation systems along with various irrigation levels have been one focus of farm irrigation management studies bordovsky 2019 rudnick et al 2019 several field studies evaluated agronomic performance of cotton under different irrigation systems and irrigation levels colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 many other recent modeling and experimental studies also examined crop yield and cwp also known as water use efficiency as affected by different irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation garibay et al 2019 witt et al 2020 variable rate irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2020b yari et al 2017 et based irrigation marek et al 2016 irrigation rate and timing bordovsky et al 2015 thorp et al 2020 irrigation scheduling via information communication technologies vellidis et al 2016 or a combination of these strategies himanshu et al 2019 mahan et al 2012 o shaughnessy et al 2020a 2020b an economic analysis is needed to better understand profits from producers investments in improved irrigation systems and more effective irrigation management strategies amosson et al 2011 guerrero et al 2016 reynolds et al 2020 partial budget and enterprise budget approaches are mostly used by researchers to calculate the gross margin or net return from different irrigation scenarios delaune et al 2020 enciso et al 2005 mauget et al 2013 segarra et al 1999 for instance bordovsky et al 2000 found that compared to sdi a higher net return could be achieved with the lepa irrigation system when irrigation capacity was more than 2 5 mm d 1 however the sdi could be a better irrigation option in the thp region if physical and legal constraints limit lepa application or sdi installation costs become lower based on a field experiment conducted in chillicothe tx from 2008 to 2010 delaune et al 2012 analyzed the impacts of different irrigation levels 0 33 66 100 and 133 et replacement on cotton yield and profits and they found a maximum net return at the 100 et level additionally mitchell mccallister et al 2020 compared profits under 27 irrigation treatments using a lepa irrigation system and found that as compared to lower irrigation levels a higher gross margin could be achieved at a high irrigation level 6 4 mm d 1 during the maturation stage when growing degree days are greater than 750 c baseline temperature of 15 6 c nevertheless these studies were mostly focused on the comparison of profits without any consideration to uncertainties associated with irrigation amount timing rainfall variability spatial farmland productivity and input output price fluctuations that substantially influence crop production producers farming decisions and farm income the economic risk analysis approach could be used to incorporate these uncertainties anderson and hardaker 2003 hardaker et al 2015 while the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf approach could be used to assess the economic feasibility lien et al 2007 williams et al 2012 producers may have different degrees of risk attitudes towards alternative irrigation systems and water application levels relevant research by bhattarai et al 2020 examined the profits for two irrigation scheduling methods in georgia cotton production and they found risk premiums for smart irrigation app and calendar based checkbook method were 301 341 ha 1 and 306 314 ha 1 respectively relative to dryland production the authors concluded that the smart irrigation app was the most risk efficient scheduling method which increased the risk adjusted profits for cotton producers in addition serf has been widely used to compare advanced and innovative farm practices with conventional operations archer and reicosky 2009 watkins et al 2008 in particular boyer et al 2018 investigated the profits of cotton production with no till and winter cover crops in tennessee and they found risk averse farmers would prefer no till production without cover crops similar studies in texas concluded that no till without a cover crop was the most preferred practice by risk neutral and rather risk averse growers in dryland cotton production fan et al 2020b and that no till with mixed cover crops was most preferred by very risk averse producers in irrigated cotton systems fan et al 2020a therefore the risk adjusted profitability analysis can incorporate producers risk preference and help us better understand their adoption of advanced production systems to the best of the authors knowledge however no previous study has documented the risk adjusted farm profitability associated with irrigation strategies in the present study an economic risk analysis was carried out to evaluate the profitability of four irrigation systems mesa lesa lepa and sdi at four alternative irrigation levels 25 50 75 and 100 et replacement in thp cotton production yield data were simulated with and tested against a four year field experiment using a multivariate empirical distribution approach the net returns were estimated for dryland and irrigated cotton production scenarios using simulated cotton yields and prices further the net return distributions were compared using the serf procedure which ranks risky outcomes associated with different irrigation systems and irrigation levels at various risk aversion levels of cotton growers 2 methods and data 2 1 field experiment cotton yield simulations and validations were carried out based on the observations from a field experiment at the usda conservation and production research laboratory in bushland texas 35 19 n 102 06 w colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 this research site is in a typical semi arid region of the texas high plains the climate is characterized by low precipitation with an average annual amount of 415 mm a high class a pan evaporation of 2690 mm per year noaa 2020 and on average 65 of the evaporative demand and 70 of the precipitation occur from may to october which represents the growing season of cotton usda ars conservation production research laboratory records 1993 2012 fig s1 in the appendix a shows the precipitation during cotton growing and non growing seasons at a nearby weather station the predominant soil series at the location is a pullman clay loam fine superactive mixed thermic torrertic paleustoll usda nrcs 2020 cotton gossypium hirsutum l paymaster 2280 bg rr was planted during 2003 2004 2006 and 2007 growing seasons 2 2 in 2005 cotton crop was destroyed by hail and the field was replanted with soybeans colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 the experiment was conducted in a split block design and the plot design was shown in fig s2 of the appendix a irrigation was applied using a three span lateral move system outfitted with zones of three irrigation application methods mesa lesa and lepa and zones that were not irrigated by the lateral move system but by an sdi system with drip lines laid in the same direction of travel for the mesa lesa and lepa treatments irrigation rates were varied in the direction of travel by varying the speed of the lateral move and irrigation duration was identical for each irrigation method and was typically 4 h further irrigations by the lateral move were applied only during morning hours to avoid smaller nighttime or larger afternoon wind and evaporative losses i e when atmospheric demand was average howell and evett 2005 for sdi irrigation rates were varied by emitter flow and spacing along the drip lateral irrigation events for sdi were initiated at the same time as the lateral move but the duration was typically 24 h which is similar to sdi management used by commercial cotton producers in the region as observed by the authors the irrigation methods were randomized within a block and each block consisted of a span of the linear move system with three replications each plot was 25 m long and 9 m wide with 12 rows each irrigation rate strip was separated by 5 m planted borders furrow dikes were installed after crop establishment to control run on and runoff schneider and howell 2000 the experiment included a near dryland treatment i0 which corresponded to 0 et replacement and four irrigated treatments i25 i50 i75 and i100 which corresponded to 25 50 75 and 100 et replacement respectively in each growing season the i100 irrigation rate was determined by soil water content readings using a field calibrated neutron probe at depths from 0 10 m to 2 3 m in 0 20 m increments evett et al 2008 irrigation was applied when soil water depletion reached 25 mm in the i100 mesa treatment and all other irrigation treatments received proportionally less water according to their et replacement levels colaizzi et al 2005 irrigations were metered using propeller type totalizing flow meters mccrometer inc hemet calif usa rainfall was recorded using a tipping bucket rain gauge model te525 texas electronics inc dallas texas usa at a micrometeorological station 50 m south of the experimental field porter et al 2005 in the i0 treatment sufficient pre plant irrigation was applied only for crop emergence using mesa during the four years of the experiment the average irrigation water applied was 22 67 111 156 and 201 mm for i0 i25 i50 i75 and i100 treatments respectively colaizzi et al 2010 seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by the soil water balance as irrigation in season rainfall volumetric soil water at planting volumetric soil water at harvest run on and run off were assumed negligible because furrow dikes were installed and the field had a slope of 0 0025 m m 1 schneider and howell 2000 deep percolation was controlled by irrigation scheduling based on the neutron probe that avoided overfilling the soil water profile which was confirmed by the lack of increases in measured volumetric water contents at lower depths 2 1 2 3 m evett et al 2008 similar amounts of pre plant fertilizer containing nitrogen n and phosphorous p were applied to the raised beds based on a soil fertility analysis each year colaizzi et al 2005 additional n was applied with the irrigation water compared with the full irrigation treatment the fertilizer amount was adjusted proportionately in the deficit irrigation treatments additional field measurements included plant growth and development final plant biomass and lint yield and fiber quality plants were measured biweekly and included height width number of nodes and number and location of reproductive organs i e branch number and position at crop maturity destructive plant samples were obtained from 10 m2 areas in the center of each plot samples were weighed ginned and analyzed for micronaire strength color grade and uniformity at the international textile center lubbock texas and cotton loan values were determined based on these four fiber quality measurements additional details about this field experiment can be found in colaizzi et al 2010 2 2 simulation procedures crop yields and prices were simulated based on the multivariate empirical mve distribution the mve distribution follows the monte carlo simulation protocols to account for correlation among the stochastic variables richardson et al 2000 the cotton yields at different irrigation levels may be correlated due to the same soil and climatic conditions and they can be non normally distributed because of limited field observations cotton yields may be highly variable due to variable weather conditions in the study area himanshu et al 2021 and high variability of cotton prices can also expected due to global supply and demand fluctuations the mve simulation therefore can capture the variability of variables and provide consistent estimation for farm level analysis richardson et al 2008 the mve simulations were carried out for cotton lint yields at multiple irrigation levels field level data from the four year experiment colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 described in the previous section were used to run mve simulations for lint yields and the simulations for lint and cottonseed prices were conducted based on the annual prices for texas upland cotton during 2003 2019 nass 2021 each mve simulation was carried out to generate 500 iterations of data points richardson et al 2008 combining with input use data these simulated variables were then used to conduct the economic estimation and risk analysis as a step wise process the mve model conducts stochastic simulations of random variables i e yield and price fig 1 shows the following simulation procedures adopted in this study as suggested by richardson et al 2008 1 estimation of yield range given the lint yield data colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 the mean yield values for all the irrigation treatments were combined with a common variation 3 3 to be consistent with relevant literature delaune et al 2020 a coefficient of variation equal to 0 25 was used for all irrigation treatments to determine the range of yield the upper and lower bounds of the range were determined using eq 1 1 y ˆ u y z σ n y ˆ l y z σ n where y ˆ u l represents the estimated upper and lower bounds y is the mean yield in each treatment z refers to the z value of a normal distribution σ is the standard deviation and n is the number of field observations the z value can be specified to generate a certain confidence interval i e 95 standard deviation was calculated from the mean and the hypothetical coefficient of variation c v following σ c v y 2 estimation of yield distribution the gray richardson klose schumann grks model richardson et al 2008 was used to estimate yield distributions from the above estimated ranges the grks approach can generate random variables when little data are available richardson et al 2008 this approach is also preferred for assessing uncertainty because it is flexible to generate distributions for alternative probabilities the grks model can be specified as 2 φ grks min middle max where φ refers to the simulated distribution which follows a grks function with specified minimum middle and maximum values the minimum and maximum values do not necessarily have an equal distance from the middle and the middle value can be mean median or mode richardson 2010 we trimmed the simulated data by removing the values less than the minimum and greater than the maximum because the grks model defines the minimum and maximum as the values that have a probability of 0 02275 and 0 97725 greater than the rest of the distribution respectively this gives us the simulated data in a 95 confidence interval i e the distribution with 2 standard deviations which is consistent with the yield range and variation specified in the above step 3 estimation of the correlation matrix a linear correlation matrix can be specified for the crop yields at a certain irrigation level as well as for the prices of lint and cottonseed for example at an irrigation level i i 25 50 75 and 100 et the lint yields for the four irrigation methods j j mesa lesa lepa and sdi have a correlation matrix r with correlation r between each pair of the yields 3 r i j 1 r i 12 r i 21 1 r i 13 r i 14 r i 23 r i 24 r i 31 r i 32 r i 41 r i 42 1 r i 34 r i 43 1 the correlation matrix for the lint and seed prices can be represented by 4 r lint seed 1 r lint seed r lint seed 1 therefore the price correlation matrix is a 2 2 matrix and the yield matrix is a 4 4 matrix 4 4 the near dryland i0 yield was combined with the yields at i25 to estimate the correlation matrix thus the correlation matrix for i0 and i25 is a 5 5 matrix the stochastic prices and yields at alternative irrigation levels were simulated using the correlation matrix approach 4 estimation of the correlated uniform standard deviates cusds as model parameters cusds specify the relationship of the random variables using the correlation matrix and retain the observed stochastic dependency among the variables i e yield and price in the stochastic simulation first we estimated the correlated standard normal deviates by taking the square root of the correlation matrix and multiplying a vector of independent standard normal deviates then the cusds were obtained by converting the standard normal deviates with an inverse transformation of a standard normal distribution richardson et al 2008 incorporating the cusds in the stochastic simulation avoids under or over estimating the mean and variance of yields under different irrigation systems if they are correlated given the dimensions of the yields under different irrigation systems and historical prices specified above the model estimated 19 correlated yield data series and 17 price data series 5 generation of random variables the random variables were estimated using the mve model an empirical distribution function emp was employed using cusds in an inverse transformation of the empirical distribution 5 y i j f y i j σ i j cusd i j for j 1 2 3 4 at a certain irrigation level i 6 p lint seed f p lint seed σ lint seed cusd lint seed where tilde denotes a stochastic variable f represents a multivariate empirical function that follows a normal distribution dash denotes the variable mean of the estimated yield data or historical price data prices and lint yields at alternative et replacement levels were simulated for 500 iterations to generate stochastic variables using the latin hypercube procedure richardson et al 2008 the generated variables followed a uniform distribution with n 500 intervals and each interval has randomly selected at least one value this ensured that the simulation considered all corresponding areas of the probability distributions 6 model evaluation the simulated stochastic variables were compared with the model input data students t test determined whether the correlation coefficients of the historical and simulated matrices were statistically different at the 95 confidence level the two sample hotelling t2 test determined whether the mean vectors of the historical and simulated data were equal the box s m test determined whether the covariance matrices of the historical and simulated data were equivalent the complete homogeneity test determines whether the mean vectors and covariance matrices are equivalent simultaneously after the evaluation of the random variables these simulated data were used to conduct economic analysis the mve approach was also employed in previous empirical studies that investigated the economic feasibility of soil and water conservation practices in multiple cropping systems adusumilli et al 2020 kadigi et al 2020 2 3 cost and profit estimation the profitability of using different irrigation systems and applying varying amounts of irrigation water was evaluated by an enterprise budget developed by texas a m agrilife extension 2020 the production cost was estimated using data on field operations and input use colaizzi et al 2004 2005 2010 input prices were updated to reflect the actual production payment in the region the total cost for each irrigation system j at a certain irrigation level i was calculated using 7 tc i j vc i j fc i j where tc vc and fc refer to the total cost variable cost and fixed cost respectively variable costs included expenses on seed fertilizer pesticide herbicide energy and labor associated with tillage and irrigation insurance machinery repairs and maintenance interest and harvest costs 5 5 land rental was not included in the budget the application rates of fertilizer pesticide and herbicide were assumed the same for the full irrigation level in all four years the chemical and energy prices and labor payment were assumed same fixed costs included machinery depreciation for tractors planter sprayer irrigation system etc these costs were estimated for the texas panhandle extension district 1 and necessary modifications were made for the input and output prices total revenue was estimated using the simulated yield and price data the cottonseed yield was estimated using a conversion ratio of 1 412 units of seed per unit of lint cotton incorporated 2018 8 tr i j y i j lint p lint y i j seed p seed where tr refers to total revenue y i j lint is the simulated lint yield in eq 5 and y i j seed is the estimated seed yield and y i j seed 1 412 y i j lint p lint and p seed are the simulated lint and seed price in eq 6 the net return was finally calculated using eq 9 9 π i j tr i j tc i j where π i j is the estimated net return for cotton production under each irrigation system j at a certain irrigation level i 2 4 economic risk analysis income variation can result from the uncertainties associated with input use and crop yield farmers decisions regarding irrigation systems and irrigation levels can greatly influence the sustainability of water resources and agricultural production and these decisions are further affected by producers risk attitudes and expected profit ribera et al 2004 farmers with varying attitudes toward risks may have different preferences for irrigation systems and irrigation levels fan et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 risk averse producers are more likely to choose the irrigation system and irrigation level that result in a smaller variation in farm profit therefore this study examined cotton farmers production decisions regarding four irrigation systems and four irrigation levels as mutually exclusive choices to identify the most risk efficient practices for crop production and groundwater conservation following anderson and dillon 1992 the absolute risk aversion coefficient arac r a was used to measure producers risk attitudes the arac can be expressed by 10 r a w r r w w where r r w is the relative risk aversion coefficient rrac for a certain amount of farm income w hardaker et al 2004 according to anderson and hardaker 2003 the rrac levels include risk neutral r r 0 somewhat risk averse r r 1 rather risk averse r r 2 very risk averse r r 3 and extremely risk averse r r 4 the average farm profit is equal to 161 ha 1 which determines the upper bound of arac therefore this study utilized various risk levels including 0 for risk neutral 0 0062 for somewhat risk averse 0 0124 for rather risk averse 0 0186 for very risk averse and 0 0248 for extremely risk averse the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function serf approach ranks a set of risky choices based on their certainty equivalents ces across various risk aversion levels the ce of a risky choice is defined as the guaranteed amount of payment at which a decision maker would be willing to accept instead of taking the risky action 11 ce w r w u 1 w r w as determined by the utility function u and risk aversion level r in eq 11 a producer is assumed to prefer a risky outcome with a higher ce value lien et al 2007 a specific form of the utility function is required to estimate the ce values a negative exponential utility function can more efficiently estimate ce with constant absolute risk aversion hardaker et al 2015 schumann et al 2004 and this function has been commonly adopted in previous empirical studies fan et al 2020a williams et al 2014 subsequently a utility weighted risk premium rp is calculated at a certain risk aversion level of cotton producers a rp value is the difference in the ces of adopting a specific irrigation system and an irrigation level relative to a baseline scenario i e near dryland production the rp at a certain risk aversion level can be represented by 12 rp ij dryland ce ij ce dryland the value of rp represents the minimum amount of payment that a producer will have to receive before he she is willing to shift from dryland to irrigated production at a certain risk aversion level r a the value of rp is also considered as the risk adjusted profit gain from adopting irrigation in crop production a positive rp suggests a farmer would prefer irrigated production over the dryland production on the contrary a negative rp means dryland production is preferred and the negative value is the expected loss if a producer adopts any irrigation method with a certain irrigation level the stochastic simulations and economic risk analysis were conducted by the simulation and econometrics to analyze risk simetar software developed by richardson et al 2008 the serf analysis was performed for the net return distributions of cotton production under each of the four irrigation systems and at alternative irrigation levels the ces and rps as well as their rankings are discussed for a range of aracs representing producers risk attitudes from risk neutral to extremely risk averse 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation simulated lint yields were evaluated for both individual series and joint distributions at each irrigation level table 1 the average lint yield under near dryland production was 396 kg ha 1 similarly average lint yields for 25 et replacement irrigation level i25 treatment were 462 494 550 and 641 kg ha 1 under mesa lesa lepa and sdi irrigation methods respectively these mean simulated yields were not statistically different from those of the experimental data i e p 0 05 as indicated by the f test the variance of each simulated yield distribution was not statistically different from that of the field data i e p 0 05 for the joint distribution of yields at the i25 level the two sample hotelling t2 test showed an insignificant result i e p 0 05 which indicated that the mean vectors of the simulated and experimental lint yields are equal the complete homogeneity test also showed that the variances of the simulated and experimental yields were not significantly different at the i50 level the lint yields for mesa lesa lepa and sdi systems were 557 560 739 and 800 kg ha 1 respectively table 1 as the irrigation water increased to the 75 et level the lint yields increased to 781 754 870 and 1020 kg ha 1 for mesa lesa lepa and sdi respectively under the full irrigation application the lint yields were 871 885 992 and 1065 kg ha 1 for mesa lesa lepa and sdi respectively all the yield values were consistent with the experimental data colaizzi et al 2010 and validated by the statistical tests specifically at each irrigation level the two sample t test showed that there was not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the means of simulated and experimental data were equal at the 0 05 significance level i e p 0 05 for the individual data series the f tests showed that the equal variances of the simulated and experimental data were not rejected at the 0 05 significance level i e p 0 05 additionally the joint distribution tests showed the mean vectors and the variance covariance matrices were not significantly different between the simulated and experimental data at the i50 i75 and i100 irrigation levels respectively i e p 0 05 table 2 shows the results of the validation tests for price simulations the lint and seed prices considered in this study were 1 344 kg 1 and 0 195 kg 1 respectively which were equal to the means of historical prices during 2003 2019 the joint distribution comparison showed that the simulated means were not statistically different from the historical means i e p 0 05 from the two sample hotelling t2 test and the variances were also not significantly different i e p 0 05 from the box s m test the complete homogeneity test also confirmed that the distributions of the historical and simulated price series were not significantly different furthermore the correlation coefficients test had a t value of 0 44 which was smaller than the critical value of 1 96 at the 95 confidence level and therefore the simulated lint and seed price series were appropriately correlated to the historical data the correlation coefficient of the simulated lint and seed prices was 0 573 which was significantly different from zero p 0 001 whereas the correlation of the historical lint and seed prices was 0 557 and it was also significantly different from zero p 0 001 these results of statistical tests confirmed the validity of using simulated yield and price data in the economic analysis 3 2 water use and production costs fig 2 shows the average water use for all the treatments associated with different irrigation systems and irrigation levels over the four years of the experiment irrigation water applications under different irrigation systems were very close at a specific et replacement level for example at the full irrigation level i100 the seasonal water use sum of irrigation precipitation and soil water use was 589 588 592 and 579 mm under mesa lesa lepa and sdi system respectively the average seasonal water use of the four irrigation systems was 425 485 537 and 587 mm for i25 i50 i75 and i100 treatments respectively the seasonal water use was 368 mm for i0 production 6 6 this included minimum irrigation of 22 mm mean value for four years to ensure plant emergence only the estimated total costs are presented in table 3 among the four irrigation systems the total costs were similar for mesa lesa and lepa while the total cost associated with sdi was approximately 25 higher for example with full irrigation i100 the total costs were 1101 1075 1095 and 1339 ha 1 on average for mesa lesa lepa and sdi respectively the high cost for sdi was primarily due to the more expensive subsurface irrigation system and higher harvest cost associated with higher yield the average cost for the near dryland cotton was 553 ha 1 which was about 33 less than the costs under mesa lesa 820 ha 1 for both and lepa 827 ha 1 systems and about half of that under sdi system 1053 ha 1 at the i25 level 3 3 crop yield fig 3 compares the simulated lint yields for all the treatments across the treatments the yield range became greater as irrigation water increased at each irrigation level the highest lint yield was found with the sdi system followed by lepa in contrast mesa and lesa systems resulted in a lower cotton yield these results indicated the highest productivity with the use of sdi systems for cotton production and this was also consistent with the highest irrigation efficiency of the sdi system amosson et al 2009 as expected the near dryland production showed the lowest lint yield which was approximately 56 and 98 kg ha 1 less than that under mesa and lesa systems at the i25 level respectively in general an increase in irrigation water use resulted in a higher cotton yield under each irrigation system however the rate of increase in yield slowed down at the higher irrigation levels for example the average lint yield using mesa was 464 kg ha 1 at the i25 level and it increased to 557 kg ha 1 at the i50 level i e an increase of 93 kg ha 1 the yield increase was 224 kg ha 1 from i50 to i75 and 90 kg ha 1 from i75 to i100 similarly the yield increase for sdi was 159 kg ha 1 from i25 to i50 220 kg ha 1 from i50 to i75 and 45 kg ha 1 from i75 to i100 fig 3 and table 1 these results indicated that full irrigation was not always the best strategy to optimize groundwater use in the thp region and that deficit irrigation could provide a higher cwp comas et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 witt et al 2020 3 4 profit distribution fig 4 plots the cumulative distributions of net returns from cotton production at different irrigation levels at the i25 level the profit distribution of lepa system was further to the right of the rest systems and closely matched with the distribution for the near dryland cotton system which indicated that lepa and near dryland production systems could provide higher income at very low or no irrigation application fig 4a in case of i50 and i100 irrigation levels the net return distribution of lepa lay to the right of the others followed by sdi fig 4b d this suggested that lepa could have a higher probability of getting a high income at both full irrigation and half irrigation levels the distributions of lepa and sdi were similar at i75 level and they were to the right of the other two systems except for the levels of net return greater than 700 ha 1 where the distribution for sdi lay to the right of that for lepa and returns less than 200 ha 1 where the distribution for lepa lay to the right of that for sdi fig 4c the net return distributions of mesa and lesa were similar at all irrigation levels the thick tails of sdi distributions in the four panels indicated that sdi had a larger chance of getting both very low and very high income levels in addition a comparison of the four irrigation levels suggested that adopting sdi was as profitable as lepa at a moderate irrigation level the lepa system was most profitable at both half and full irrigation levels which echoed the wide adoption of lepa systems in many of the semi arid areas including the thp region amosson et al 2011 bordovsky 2019 segarra et al 1999 to better understand the net return distributions of simulated irrigation strategies stoplight charts fig 5 were developed which clearly illustrate the probabilities of net returns being less than a lower target value and greater than an upper target value for all risky alternatives richardson 2010 in this study the 25th and 75th percentiles of the net returns were used as the lower and upper cut off values respectively for all the treatments fig 5 presents the probabilities of net returns less than 140 ha 1 and greater than 380 ha 1 for the four irrigation systems and alternative irrigation levels an overall comparison across all the treatments showed that the higher probability of the high income category i e greater than 380 ha 1 was generally associated with application of more irrigation water at the full irrigation level i e i100 lepa system had the highest chance of getting more than 380 ha 1 with a probability of 0 56 followed by sdi and lesa systems with probabilities of 0 45 and 0 43 respectively under the i75 level lepa 0 46 was only slightly better than sdi 0 45 in terms of obtaining a net return of more than 380 ha 1 additionally a comparison from low to high irrigation levels showed that the probability of the high net return category i e greater than 380 ha 1 for mesa lesa and lepa systems increased continuously while higher than i75 irrigation would not increase the net return with the sdi system therefore sdi system could potentially save irrigation water when irrigating at the i75 level and achieve the same profit level as the full irrigation level producers would more likely need to apply full irrigation to achieve a higher profit under other irrigation systems 3 5 comparison of irrigation systems fig 6 shows the ces of cotton production using different irrigation systems at each irrigation level in each panel four irrigation systems were ranked as the risk aversion level goes from risk neutral arac 0 to extremely risk averse arac 0 0248 at each risk aversion level the highest ce value presents the most risk efficient irrigation system for cotton producers table s1 of appendix a shows the numeric values of ces at specific risk aversion levels at each of the four irrigation levels lepa performed best among the four systems at risk neutral somewhat and rather risk aversion levels no difference in ce values of mesa lesa and lepa were observed at the very and extremely risk aversion levels this suggested that risk neutral or slightly risk averse producers would prefer lepa and they are indifferent among mesa lesa and lepa when they became more risk averse under i50 i75 and i100 sdi was the second risk preferred for risk neutral growers while it became the least preferred among the four irrigation systems for somewhat or even more risk averse growers the slope of the curve associated with sdi suggested that sdi was highly sensitive and even a slight increase in the risk aversion level would make it the less preferred system to further find the risk adjusted values for irrigation systems serf analysis calculated the risk premiums relative to mesa at each irrigation level as indicated by rp fig 7 shows the minimum payment amount that a cotton grower has to receive before he she is willing to switch from mesa to another irrigation system a positive value could be seen as the profit obtained by a grower from adopting an alternative system while a negative value could be seen as the loss table s1 also shows the numeric values of rps at specific risk aversion levels compared to mesa all rps of lesa and lepa were positive across the risk aversion levels except for very and extremely risk averse levels under i25 and lesa at the risk neutral level under i75 additionally positive rps associated with sdi were observed at the risk neutral and rps became negative for somewhat and more risk aversion levels this agreed with the findings of ces that lepa was the most risk preferred system and its performance became less prominent as a producer gets more risk averse bordovsky et al 2000 also confirmed that lepa resulted in higher net returns to risks compared to sdi system in cotton production 3 6 comparison of irrigation levels the serf analysis ranks irrigation scenarios across various risk aversion levels the ces in fig 8 suggested that i100 and i75 were the first and second most preferred irrigation levels for risk neutral producers while near dryland production was most preferred as the producers became somewhat or even more risk averse 7 7 fig s3 shows the stoplight charts of net returns at different irrigation levels the risk premium results showed that i75 and i100 had positive rps for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse growers and all rp values were negative if producers get more risk averse this indicated that full irrigation may not provide the highest farm income in particular for at least somewhat risk averse individuals and that cotton producers would rather choose irrigation level close to i75 in the thp region in addition fig 9 shows the ces of different irrigation levels for each irrigation system 8 8 fig s4 shows the cumulative distribution functions of different irrigation levels under each irrigation system consistent findings were observed in the three panels associated with mesa lesa and lepa where full irrigation i e i100 was the most preferred irrigation level for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse producers in each of the three systems the differences in ce values were minor as producers became even slightly risk averse 9 9 fig s5 shows the risk premiums of different irrigation levels under each irrigation system regarding sdi the ce values of i75 and i100 were almost the same for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse producers respectively nevertheless near dryland production was most preferred if a producer becomes more than somewhat risk averse regardless of irrigation system 4 implications and conclusions this study examined economic profits and their distributions for cotton production with different irrigation applications under mesa lesa lepa and sdi systems cotton yield simulations were based on a four year field experiment and the net returns of alternative irrigation treatments were estimated using an enterprise budget approach economic risk analysis was conducted using the serf procedure to provide insights for groundwater conservation and profitability of irrigated cotton production in the thp region similar to the results of cotton yields more irrigation water 10 10 that is increasing from 25 to 100 et replacement levels i e from i25 to i100 increased net returns of cotton production under mesa lesa and lepa systems while the profit increase was negligible for sdi when applied irrigation water exceeded 75 et replacement level a similar study found no significant difference in cotton yield for 66 and 133 et replacements while 100 et was associated with a higher net return in no till cotton production delaune et al 2012 further more irrigation increased the variability of cotton yields and net returns under each irrigation system fan et al 2020a garibay et al 2019 more irrigation water application was also associated with a larger chance of getting a higher net return that is greater than 380 ha 1 except for sdi therefore full irrigation application was more profitable to producers with mesa lesa and lepa systems while irrigation at the 75 et replacement was more profitable for sdi given that most producers in the region are forced to deficit irrigate by declining water availability evett et al 2020a this result helps explain why producers have installed so much sdi risk analysis results provided unique insights for irrigated cotton production by incorporating growers risk attitude for each of the four irrigation levels lepa showed a higher net return than other systems and would be preferred by risk neutral somewhat and rather risk averse producers the differences in net returns of mesa lesa and lepa were minor for very and extremely risk averse producers at each irrigation level for producers with a more than somewhat risk averse attitude sdi was always the least preferred system this result when combined with the fact that producers had installed 107 356 ha of sdi by 2013 increasing to 175 000 ha by 2016 in the high plains water district alone occupying 6 6 of the irrigated area by 2018 evett et al 2020a 2020b would indicate that producers in the region are willing to take on some risk in expectation of the greater yields associated with sdi additional analysis of different irrigation levels showed that full irrigation should be most preferred by risk neutral producers and there was only a minor difference in the expected returns of 75 and 100 et replacement as the producers became somewhat risk averse a further analysis associated with different irrigation levels under four systems confirmed that full irrigation should be most preferred for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse growers under mesa lesa and lepa systems while no difference was observed for risk neutral and somewhat risk averse growers under sdi this research provides economic evidence for et based irrigation decisions that fundamentally affect and are affected by specific irrigation systems both irrigation systems and irrigation levels are of great significance for the sustainable groundwater utilization in the thp region ale et al 2020 chaudhuri and ale 2014 without undermining the importance of advanced irrigation systems in water conservation this study comparatively evaluated the economic performance of alternative spray sprinkler and subsurface irrigation systems their relative performance can be influenced by input and output prices fan et al 2020a additionally farm level decisions on irrigation system adoption and water application are greatly influenced by input use investment decisions and government policies fan et al 2014 himanshu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 this study is also limited by the yield bounds observed in the field experiment future research can evaluate the economic performance of different cultivars and incorporate cultivar improvement over time future research should also incorporate the effects of advanced irrigation decision support system which are shown to produce improved cwp with regulated deficit irrigation o shaughnessy et al 2011 2015 o shaughnessy and

9676,hetao irrigation district hid in the upper yellow river basin of china is vulnerable due to the scarcity of water resources and environmental pollution caused by nutrient leaching appropriate irrigation and fertilization management are essential for improving crop productivity and developing sustainable agriculture in the hid a two year field experiment investigated the effects of irrigation and fertilization regimes on soil water nitrogen accumulation and distribution in the soil profile and plant organs nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefits of spring maize zea mays l under film mulched ridge furrow system three irrigation levels i1 high 400 mm i2 medium 300 mm and i3 low 200 mm and two fertilization levels f1 high 300 kg n ha 1 and f2 low 150 kg n ha 1 were designed mean soil no3 n contents did not significantly differ between i2 and i3 and were significantly higher than i1 i1f1 and i1f2 remarkably increased soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil layer at harvest high irrigation increased the risk of n leaching into the deep soil layer i2f2 increased plant nitrogen accumulation and promoted nitrogen transport to grains improved nitrogen harvest index and internal use efficiency under 400 or 300 mm irrigation amount soil moisture and plant growth had little difference grain yields among i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 did not significantly differ in 2017 and 2018 in the relatively poor rainfall year 2017 i2f2 had 13 1 211 8 and 294 1 higher net income than i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 respectively but 24 5 and 33 0 lower net income than i1f1 and i1f2 respectively in 2018 with normal rainfall i2f2 had 38 5 4 8 29 5 114 3 and 96 2 higher net income than i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 respectively therefore the film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system with 300 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 fertilization is a promising approach for reducing water supply and nitrogen leaching and obtaining acceptable grain yield and economic benefits for spring maize production in the upper yellow river basin of china keywords film mulched ridge furrow irrigation nitrogen transport and distribution nitrogen use efficiency economic benefits upper yellow river basin 1 introduction worldwide supply of water and nitrogen are critical to crop yield with multiple interactions which affect water and nitrogen use efficiency kunrath et al 2020 nitrogen loss is an essential issue in the crop production and nitrogen loss of farmland in china is relatively large fu et al 2020 excessive nitrogen application and water shortage are the main obstacles to the sustainable development of agriculture in northwest china the yellow river is the second largest river in china and plays a critical role in the water supply of northern china the upper yellow river basin has an arid semiarid climate and thus requires irrigation for agricultural production ren et al 2016 this region comprises the hetao irrigation district hid the major maize production region the maize planting area accounts for 35 6 of the total cultivated land area in the hid li et al 2020a spring maize production in this region plays an important role in ensuring food security and relieving population pressure in china however it suffers from severe water shortage and salinity stress qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 due to the low rainfall 105 mm y 1 and high evaporative potential 2350 mm y 1 zhou et al 2018 the primary irrigation method for farmland is basin flood irrigation using water from the yellow river li et al 2020a with the declining water availability from the yellow river and increased non agricultural water demand the shortage of agricultural water have restricted the sustainable development of local agriculture zhang et al 2017 in addition local farmers use a flood irrigation strategy combined with high fertilizer rate to improve crop yield li et al 2020a this strategy resulted in irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer losses decreased use efficiencies and increased groundwater and yellow river water supply burden further aggravating local water shortages soil salinization and groundwater pollution and limiting crop productivity therefore water saving and fertilizer regulation are critical for the sustainable development of agriculture and increasing farmers income plastic film mulching is widely used to preserve soil water and increase crop productive potential liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ridge can preserve chemical fertilizer reduce deep percolation and fertilizer leaching and increase water and nitrogen use efficiency benjamin et al 1994 kang et al 2000 furrow irrigation combined with plastic film mulched ridges has been widely used in arid and semiarid areas of northwest china ali et al 2019 hu et al 2014 li and gong 2002 the ridge with loose soil structure can retain water and plastic film mulching can reduce soil water evaporation moreover the partial irrigation characteristics and small irrigation quota of furrow irrigation prevent excessive irrigation by local farmers the plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system is a high efficiency system for enhancing soil water availability nitrogen use efficiency and crop yields gu et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in addition plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system improved water use efficiency and reduced soil salt in the maize root zone dong et al 2018 different irrigation methods and fertilizer rates have varying effects on soil nutrient distribution and plant nitrogen uptake yan et al 2021 while adequate irrigation ensures high crop yields reducing the irrigation water does not significantly decrease maize yield and increases water use efficiency kang et al 2010 wang et al 2017 ali et al 2019 found that a plastic covered ridge furrow system combined with deficit irrigation decreased irrigation water usage and improved crop and irrigation water productivity a high fertilization rate is frequently applied to increase grain yields but it inevitably reduces fertilizer use efficiency the traditional nitrogen fertilizer application is around 300 kg ha 1 in the hid dong et al 2018 li et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 due to the large flood irrigation quota the groundwater table is shallow ranging from 0 5 to 3 0 m during the growing season zhang et al 2017 thus large amounts of chemical fertilizers are inevitably leached into the groundwater due to high fertilization nitrogen fertilizer applied in excess of crop demand combined with over irrigation results in a series of environmental issues li et al 2020a sun et al 2018 zou et al 2020 it is well known that increasing irrigation amount and fertilizer rate enhance crop yield within a certain range but crop yields do not necessarily respond to further increases peña haro et al 2009 further high fertilization may not lead to maximum economic benefits wang et al 2018b and may even reduce crop production zheng et al 2017 therefore proper irrigation and fertilization management is important for the agricultural production in the hid balancing economic benefits and water and nitrogen losses is important for agricultural production and environmental protection liu et al 2010 decreasing no3 n movement to deep soil and maintaining high grain yield can be realized by optimizing nitrogen fertilizer rate zhao et al 2006 implementing an appropriate nitrogen application rate and irrigation amount is essential for reducing no3 n leaching and deep percolation huang et al 2018 however the optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer amount is unknown in a plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system about 60 of the conventional fertilization amount is considered the best fertilization amount for acceptable grain yield and high economic benefits under no water stress mo et al 2017 wang et al 2018b the recommended n fertilizer rate for maize was around 180 kg ha 1 for obtaining high crop yields with low environmental risks in the guanzhong plain of china yang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 recommended 150 kg ha 1 for maize by coupled water and nitrogen management in the huang huai hai plain of china srivastava et al 2018 recommended 125 kg ha 1 for high nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield of maize under irrigated conditions in india according to the study of sun et al 2018 in the north of china when fertilization application amount was 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen uptake and use efficiency was in general higher than that under other fertilization amount through studying the sunflower production in the hid nitrogen application rates of 135 180 kg ha 1 are considered as the best fertilization strategy zeng et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 there have been few researched studying on which fertilization conventional fertilization or limited fertilization was more appropriate in film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system in addition sand layer existed in soil of typical farmland and affected the vertical distribution of soil no3 n in the hid zhou et al 2017 soil with sand layer has a high water permeability which may aggravate the leaching of nitrate nitrogen el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 however soil nitrogen transport and nitrogen utilization in sand layered soil under film mulched ridge furrow irrigation with limited irrigation and fertilization has not been well studied although previous researched have optimized water and fertilizer inputs for increasing crop yield and water nitrogen use efficiencies under flood irrigation or drip irrigation few studies investigated their effects on nitrogen transport and distribution in soil plant system and the effects on economic benefits especially in film mulched ridge furrow irrigation we hypothesized that half of the conventional fertilization rate i e 150 kg n ha 1 rather than 300 kg n ha 1 combined with optimized irrigation amount and scheduling would increase nitrogen use efficiency without significantly reducing maize yield and decrease the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater in the hid meanwhile understanding the productivity of half fertilization with varying irrigation regimes and mastering crop nitrogen uptake and distribution may help to regulate the reasonable irrigation fertilization mode and realize the sustainable agricultural development therefore this study aimed to 1 investigate the impacts of irrigation and fertilization on soil water maize growth and grain yield 2 analyze the interactive effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer on the dynamics of nitrogen accumulation and its distribution in sand layered soil and plant organs of spring maize 3 evaluate nitrogen harvest index nhi internal efficiency of nitrogen use and economic benefits under different irrigation and fertilization practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e

moderate 300 mm and i3 low 200 mm the total n application rate for high fertilizer f1 was 300 kg n ha 1 in both years a basal application rate of 150 kg n ha 1 was applied before planting and mulching

relative humidity radiation wind speed and accumulated rainfall in the two growing seasons are showed in table 3 monthly meteorological factors indicated that climatic condition was different in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons rainfall in may july and august 2018 the relative wet growing season was remarkably higher than that in 2017 the relative dry growing season temperature pan evaporation relative humidity and radiation presented the same trend in 2017 and 2018 monthly temperature increased from may to july and decreased from august to september pan evaporation generally decreased during the growing season which may be related to the radiation and radiation also gradually decreased during the growing season the relative humidity gradually increased from may to july and decreased from august to september relative humidity was much higher in 2018 than that in 2017 especially in july and august which was mainly because more rainfall in 2018 wind speed varied in the two growing seasons and was slightly higher in 2018 than that in 2017 3 2 soil water content and et a during the whole growth period in 2017 swc decreased with decreasing irrigation amount and was generally ranked as follows i1 20 90 in i1f1 and 21 14 in i1f2 i2 18 96 in i2f1 and 19 32 in i2f2 i3 17 27 in i3f1 and 17 16 in i3f2 fig 3a during the whole growth period in 2018 swc did not differ for i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 and were much higher than i3f1 and i3f2 fig 3b during the whole growth period in 2018 the average swc for i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 i2f2 i3f1 and i3f2 were 22 05 21 88 21 38 22 47 18

different irrigation amount had significant difference ranked as i1 i2 i3 in 2017 the relative dry growing season table 4 eta for i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 had no significant difference and were significantly higher than that for i3f1 and i3f2 in 2018 the relative wet growing season 3 3 soil nitrate nitrogen the mean soil no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil profile changed over time and was influenced by irrigation and fertilization fig 5 during the growing season soil no3 n contents gradually decreased after sowing suddenly increased after the third irrigation event due to the addition of fertilizer and then followed a downward trend soil no3 n contents were higher at higher nitrogen fertilizer rates and lower irrigation amounts soil no3 n contents did not significantly differ between i2 and i3 and were significantly higher than i1 in both years especially in 2018 fig 5b mean soil no3 n contents for i2 and i3 were 10 1 and 14 0 higher in 2017 and 18 2 and 16 3 higher in 2018 than i1 respectively the nitrogen fertilizer treatment had a significant effect on soil no3 n contents during growing seasons the f1 treatment had 11 8 and 9 4 higher mean soil no3 n contents than f2 in 2017 and 2018 the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes significantly affected mean soil no3 n contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer in both growing seasons fig 6a and b the mean soil no3 n content for i1f2 was lower than the other treatments in the 0 60 cm soil layers and significantly lower than i2f1 and i3f1 in the 0 40 cm soil layers in 2017 and 2018 the highest soil no3 n content occurred in i2f1 and i3f1 in the 0 100 cm soil layers followed by i1f1 i2f2 i3f2 and i1f2 with no significant difference observed between i1f1 i2f2 and i3f2 in either growing season the 40 100 cm soil layer had significantly lower soil no3 n content than the 0 40 cm soil layer in 2017 i1f1 had significantly higher soil no3 n content in the 80 100 cm soil layer than the other treatments fig 6a as did i1f1 and i2f1 in 2018 fig 6b there are significant differences in soil no3 n accumulation among the irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate treatments fig 7 which increased as nitrogen fertilizer rate increased and decreased as irrigation amount increased the f1 treatments had significantly higher soil no3 n accumulation than the f2 treatment in both years soil no3 n accumulation under i2f2 and i3f2 did not significantly differ but were significantly higher than i1f2 soil no3 n accumulation for f1 significantly differed with different irrigation amounts ranked i3 i2 i1 in both years the no3 n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer was much higher than that in other soil layer high irrigation amount remarkably increased soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil layer compared with i1f1 soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil layer for i1f2 i2f1 i2f2 i3f1 and i3f2 decreased by 12 3 64 74 3 74 7 and 70 7 in 2017 respectively and by 15 5 72 9 73 3 67 1 and 65 7 in 2018 respectively with increasing irrigation amount more no3 n moved downwards into deep soil layers 3 4 plant nitrogen accumulation and distribution plant nitrogen accumulation and distribution in various organs stem leaf ear presented different characteristics at different growth stages of spring maize v12 r1 r3 and r6 in 2017 and 2018 fig 8 plant nitrogen accumulation in stem and leaf gradually decreased with maize phenological development nitrogen accumulation in various organs demonstrated that most of the nitrogen absorbed by maize was transported to ears fig 8g h stem and leaf nitrogen accumulation did not significantly differ among i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 however i3f1 had significantly higher stem and leaf nitrogen accumulation than i3f2 at different growth stages in 2017 and 2018 ears accumulated the most nitrogen under i1f1 at r6 in 2017 followed by i2f2 i1f2 and i2f1 which were significantly higher than i3f1 and i3f2 fig 8g i1f1 i2f1 and i2f2 had significantly higher ear nitrogen accumulation at r6 in 2018 followed by i1f2 i3f1 and i3f2 fig 8h however i2f1 and i2f2 had significantly higher ear nitrogen accumulation at r3 in both years than the other treatments fig 8e f 3 5 lai dry matter accumulation and hi nitrogen fertilizer rate had no significant effects on lai dry matter accumulation dma or harvest index hi fig 9 lai under i1 and i2 did not significantly differ and was significantly higher than i3 in 2017 and 2018 i3f1 had significantly higher lai than i3f2 in 2017 due to the relatively poor rainfall during the growing season dma under i1 and i2 did not significantly differ and was significantly higher than i3 dma did not significantly differ between nitrogen fertilizer rates dma was higher in 2018 than 2017 which was related to the different rainfall in the two growing seasons in 2017 hi did not significantly differ between the different irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate treatments however in 2018 the low nitrogen fertilizer rate f2 combined with moderate and low irrigation amounts i2 and i3 had significantly higher hi than i1f1 3 6 grain n content and nitrogen harvest index nhi the irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate interaction had significant effects on grain yield gy grain nitrogen content gn n yield nhi and internal use efficiency ie of spring maize in both years table 4 under i1 and i2 gy did not significantly differ between f1 and f2 but was significantly greater than i3f1 and i3f2 i3f1 had significantly higher gy than i3f2 in 2017 but no significant difference in 2018 due to the differing rainfall in the two growing seasons the gn contents under i1f1 i2f1 and i2f2 did not significantly differ but were significantly higher than i1f2 i3f1 and i3f2 in 2017 and 2018 the differences in n yield among treatments were consistent with gy but i3f1 had significantly higher n yield than i3f2 in 2018 in 2017 nhi did not significantly differ between i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 and was significantly higher than i3f1 and i3f2 in 2018 nhi was significantly higher for i1f2 and i2f2 than the other treatments i1f1 and i1f2 had significantly higher ie than the other treatments in 2017 but i1f1 had significantly lower ie in 2018 3 7 economic benefits net income ranged from 254 to 1325 usd ha 1 in 2017 and 912 1292 usd ha 1 in 2018 table 5 compared with the minimum value the highest net income increased by 421 7 and 41 7 in 2017 and 2018 respectively at i1 and i2 irrigation level f2 had higher net income and output input values however i3f1 had higher net income and output input values than i3f2 in the two study years with relatively poor rainfall 2017 i2f2 had 13 1 211 8 and 294 1 higher net income than i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 respectively and 24 5 and 33 0 lower income than i1f1 and i1f2 i2f2 had much higher output input than i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 with relatively normal rainfall 2018 i2f2 had 38 5 4 8 29 5 114 3 and 96 2 higher net income than i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 and higher output input than the other treatments therefore i2f2 is the cultivation pattern more likely to increase net income 3 8 correlation between yield net income nitrogen use soil and plant nitrogen accumulation irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate generally grain nitrogen content gn nitrogen harvest index nhi dry matter accumulation dma plant nitrogen accumulation at harvest pna and irrigation amount i were positively correlated with grain yield gy and net income ni fig 10 nhi pna dma and i had strong positive correlations with gy in both study years with the positive correlation coefficients almost reaching 0 86 n rate had weak positive correlation with gy and had negative correlation with ni remarkably soil nitrogen accumulation at harvest sna was negatively correlated with y and ni and positively correlated with n rate in the two study years the positive correlation coefficients between i and gy or ni almost reaching 0 99 in 2017 and the coefficients were 0 82 and 0 71 in 2020 respectively 4 discussion arable land is vulnerable due to the scarcity of water resources and groundwater pollution caused by nutrient leaching in the hid inappropriate irrigation and fertilization practices can pollute groundwater and degrade farmland li et al 2020a the interaction between irrigation and fertilization affected nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield xiao et al 2021 yan et al 2021 as reported by dong et al 2018 li et al 2020a and zhang et al 2021 meteorological data during growing season had great influence on spring maize growth water use and grain yield which may also affect nitrogen use inadequate water and n supply may decrease crop yield whereas excessive water and n supply do not increase grain yield but it increases the risk of n leaching and groundwater pollution chen et al 2020 generally crop growth and grain yield increase with the increasing water and n supply within limits wang et al 2018a yan et al 2021 increasing irrigation can promote maize growth and enhance biomass and lai insufficient irrigation may cause lower biomass and lai thus inhibiting plant nitrogen absorption and utilization fan et al 2020 lai dma and grain yield did not significantly differ between i1 and i2 but was significantly higher than i3 fig 9 and table 3 indicating that moderate irrigation amount didn t limit spring maize growth and development however excessive irrigation remarkably reduced nutrient uptake of maize thus affecting crop growth yan et al 2021 in this study high irrigation did not restrict maize growth as for nitrogen application the lack of nitrogen reduced leaf area and grain yield sung et al 2015 lai and dma under f1 and f2 did not significantly differ between years indicating that the low nitrogen fertilizer rate did not restrict spring maize growth and development in this area the main reason may be that high n fertilizer rate can inhibit maize growth at the early stage due to the higher soil nitrogen concentration consequently limited dry matter accumulation and yield of maize saiz fernández et al 2015 as xu et al 2020 reported maize yields only increased 0 01 0 83 when n application rate increased from 140 to 182 kg n ha 1 the high yield of maize depends not only on the amount of nitrogen or irrigation but also on the combination of irrigation and fertilizer applied xiao et al 2021 conventional irrigation levels and nitrogen fertilization accelerated excessive n fertilizer consumption during early growth but likely reduced water and nutrient availability during later growth decreasing aboveground biomass and grain yield guo et al 2019 irrigation and topdressing at maize grain filling stage in this study increased water and nutrient supply for later growth stage which avoided the yield reduction caused by water and nutrient deficiency the amount of nitrogen fertilizer available for uptake directly affects maize growth and yield srivastava et al 2018 previous studies have shown a negative correlation between nitrogen fertilizer rate and nitrogen use efficiency as nitrogen losses are rapid when nitrogen input exceeds the crop assimilation capacity jin et al 2012 stamatiadis et al 2016 wang et al 2018a reported that plant nitrogen uptake was closely related to nitrogen rate with plant nitrogen uptake initially increasing then decreasing with increasing nitrogen rate yan et al 2021 reported that excessive water and n supply reduced grain nitrogen uptake and grain yield in this study nitrogen fertilizer rate had weak positive correlation with grain yield and had negative correlation with net income single plant nitrogen accumulation among i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 had little difference which was significantly higher than that for i3f1 and i3f2 this was consistent with ballester et al 2021 which showed that n uptake between high and intermediate irrigation treatments had no significant difference n uptake for intermediate irrigation was higher than that for high irrigation in more rainfall year in addition the study demonstrated there were no significant differences in n uptake between the n 309 and n 244 rates ballester et al 2021 this was consistent with our study and f2 had higher values for nhi and ie indicating that f2 did not restrict maize demands and promote nitrogen use and transport to grain similar results was also found in other research n uptake of plant between 315 and 210 nitrogen fertilization had no significant difference under adequate irrigation water condition li et al 2020b under water stress n uptake was reduced and higher nitrogen fertilizer remained in the soil teixeira et al 2014 soil fertility status significantly affects resource use efficiency gang et al 2019 and the low nitrogen fertilizer rate tended to have higher agronomic efficiency irrigation is the major driver affecting water and nitrogen dynamics in the root zone no3 n distribution and accumulation in the soil profile are affected by irrigation amount nitrogen fertilizer rate and plant absorption sun et al 2012 excessive nitrogen fertilizer increases soil no3 n concentration and deep no3 n migration with irrigation woli et al 2016 zou et al 2017 showed that maize root system was more likely to absorb and utilize soil nutrients of surface layer above 60 cm in addition soil nitrogen accumulation was very small at harvest when the nitrogen fertilizer rate met the plant need di and cameron 2000 in this study soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil profile at r6 for i1f1 and i1f2 were significantly higher than that for the other treatments fig 7 these was consistent with yan et al 2021 who found that the deep soil no3 n increased as irrigation and fertilization increased which increased the risk of n leaching and groundwater pollution thus reducing irrigation amount can effectively reduce the risk of nitrogen leaching and reducing nitrogen fertilizer rate can reduce soil no3 n residue woli et al 2016 previous studies showed that ridge furrow system with medium fertilization in normal and drought years in rainfed areas had significantly higher grain yield than that with high fertilizer rate zhang et al 2018 however low fertilization produced significantly higher grain yield than high and medium fertilization in a wet year with insufficient rainfall during the growing season crop yield can enhance through the increase of fertilization amount zhang et al 2018 zhong and shangguan 2014 our study showed the similar results i3f1 had significantly higher yield than i3f2 in 2017 relative dry growing season plants with greater irrigation can absorb more nitrogen and obtain high nitrogen use efficiency gu et al 2021 thus f1 may be more conducive to the nitrogen fertilizer absorption by crops under 200 mm irrigation amount in addition high fertilization can enhance crop drought resistance zhang et al 2007 i3f1 had significantly higher eta than i3f2 in 2017 consequently i3f1 produced significantly higher grain yield in relative dry growing season but the yield difference between i3f1 and i3f2 diminished in relative wet growing season in irrigated areas deficit irrigation may increase nitrogen use efficiency gu et al 2021 showed limited irrigation and fertilization significantly increased yield and n use efficiency by 14 6 17 7 and 16 2 30 5 in wet year i2f2 obtained higher grain yield with no significant difference than i1f1 and significantly higher nhi and ie in both years this indicated irrigation amounts with 300 mm and fertilization with 150 kg n ha 1 were sufficient to form maize yield and may be more valuable when considering net income and environmental benefit under the plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system in the hid irrespective of the normal or poor rainfall 5 conclusions appropriate reduction of irrigation and nitrogen supply should be implemented to decrease nitrogen leaching and achieve acceptable grain yield and economic benefits under intensively cropped spring maize farming practices the traditional irrigation and fertilization regime i1f1 400 mm irrigation and 300 kg n ha 1 did not positively improve yield and economic benefits i1f1 resulted in greater no3 n leaching into 80 100 cm soil layer decreased nitrogen use efficiency and increased the risk of groundwater pollution 300 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 fertilization i2f2 increased plant nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen transport from shoots and leaves to grain and subsequently improved ie nhi and grain yield compared with i1f1 i2f2 decreased net income by 24 5 in drought year and increased net income by 38 5 in normal rainfall year moreover i2f2 saved 25 irrigation and 50 n fertilizer and reduced the risk of groundwater pollution thus the film mulched ridge furrow irrigation with 300 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 fertilization is a promising approach for reducing water and nitrogen supply and nitrogen leaching and obtaining

9676,hetao irrigation district hid in the upper yellow river basin of china is vulnerable due to the scarcity of water resources and environmental pollution caused by nutrient leaching appropriate irrigation and fertilization management are essential for improving crop productivity and developing sustainable agriculture in the hid a two year field experiment investigated the effects of irrigation and fertilization regimes on soil water nitrogen accumulation and distribution in the soil profile and plant organs nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefits of spring maize zea mays l under film mulched ridge furrow system three irrigation levels i1 high 400 mm i2 medium 300 mm and i3 low 200 mm and two fertilization levels f1 high 300 kg n ha 1 and f2 low 150 kg n ha 1 were designed mean soil no3 n contents did not significantly differ between i2 and i3 and were significantly higher than i1 i1f1 and i1f2 remarkably increased soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil layer at harvest high irrigation increased the risk of n leaching into the deep soil layer i2f2 increased plant nitrogen accumulation and promoted nitrogen transport to grains improved nitrogen harvest index and internal use efficiency under 400 or 300 mm irrigation amount soil moisture and plant growth had little difference grain yields among i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 did not significantly differ in 2017 and 2018 in the relatively poor rainfall year 2017 i2f2 had 13 1 211 8 and 294 1 higher net income than i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 respectively but 24 5 and 33 0 lower net income than i1f1 and i1f2 respectively in 2018 with normal rainfall i2f2 had 38 5 4 8 29 5 114 3 and 96 2 higher net income than i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 respectively therefore the film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system with 300 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 fertilization is a promising approach for reducing water supply and nitrogen leaching and obtaining acceptable grain yield and economic benefits for spring maize production in the upper yellow river basin of china keywords film mulched ridge furrow irrigation nitrogen transport and distribution nitrogen use efficiency economic benefits upper yellow river basin 1 introduction worldwide supply of water and nitrogen are critical to crop yield with multiple interactions which affect water and nitrogen use efficiency kunrath et al 2020 nitrogen loss is an essential issue in the crop production and nitrogen loss of farmland in china is relatively large fu et al 2020 excessive nitrogen application and water shortage are the main obstacles to the sustainable development of agriculture in northwest china the yellow river is the second largest river in china and plays a critical role in the water supply of northern china the upper yellow river basin has an arid semiarid climate and thus requires irrigation for agricultural production ren et al 2016 this region comprises the hetao irrigation district hid the major maize production region the maize planting area accounts for 35 6 of the total cultivated land area in the hid li et al 2020a spring maize production in this region plays an important role in ensuring food security and relieving population pressure in china however it suffers from severe water shortage and salinity stress qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 due to the low rainfall 105 mm y 1 and high evaporative potential 2350 mm y 1 zhou et al 2018 the primary irrigation method for farmland is basin flood irrigation using water from the yellow river li et al 2020a with the declining water availability from the yellow river and increased non agricultural water demand the shortage of agricultural water have restricted the sustainable development of local agriculture zhang et al 2017 in addition local farmers use a flood irrigation strategy combined with high fertilizer rate to improve crop yield li et al 2020a this strategy resulted in irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer losses decreased use efficiencies and increased groundwater and yellow river water supply burden further aggravating local water shortages soil salinization and groundwater pollution and limiting crop productivity therefore water saving and fertilizer regulation are critical for the sustainable development of agriculture and increasing farmers income plastic film mulching is widely used to preserve soil water and increase crop productive potential liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 ridge can preserve chemical fertilizer reduce deep percolation and fertilizer leaching and increase water and nitrogen use efficiency benjamin et al 1994 kang et al 2000 furrow irrigation combined with plastic film mulched ridges has been widely used in arid and semiarid areas of northwest china ali et al 2019 hu et al 2014 li and gong 2002 the ridge with loose soil structure can retain water and plastic film mulching can reduce soil water evaporation moreover the partial irrigation characteristics and small irrigation quota of furrow irrigation prevent excessive irrigation by local farmers the plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system is a high efficiency system for enhancing soil water availability nitrogen use efficiency and crop yields gu et al 2018 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in addition plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system improved water use efficiency and reduced soil salt in the maize root zone dong et al 2018 different irrigation methods and fertilizer rates have varying effects on soil nutrient distribution and plant nitrogen uptake yan et al 2021 while adequate irrigation ensures high crop yields reducing the irrigation water does not significantly decrease maize yield and increases water use efficiency kang et al 2010 wang et al 2017 ali et al 2019 found that a plastic covered ridge furrow system combined with deficit irrigation decreased irrigation water usage and improved crop and irrigation water productivity a high fertilization rate is frequently applied to increase grain yields but it inevitably reduces fertilizer use efficiency the traditional nitrogen fertilizer application is around 300 kg ha 1 in the hid dong et al 2018 li et al 2020a zhang et al 2021 due to the large flood irrigation quota the groundwater table is shallow ranging from 0 5 to 3 0 m during the growing season zhang et al 2017 thus large amounts of chemical fertilizers are inevitably leached into the groundwater due to high fertilization nitrogen fertilizer applied in excess of crop demand combined with over irrigation results in a series of environmental issues li et al 2020a sun et al 2018 zou et al 2020 it is well known that increasing irrigation amount and fertilizer rate enhance crop yield within a certain range but crop yields do not necessarily respond to further increases peña haro et al 2009 further high fertilization may not lead to maximum economic benefits wang et al 2018b and may even reduce crop production zheng et al 2017 therefore proper irrigation and fertilization management is important for the agricultural production in the hid balancing economic benefits and water and nitrogen losses is important for agricultural production and environmental protection liu et al 2010 decreasing no3 n movement to deep soil and maintaining high grain yield can be realized by optimizing nitrogen fertilizer rate zhao et al 2006 implementing an appropriate nitrogen application rate and irrigation amount is essential for reducing no3 n leaching and deep percolation huang et al 2018 however the optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer amount is unknown in a plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system about 60 of the conventional fertilization amount is considered the best fertilization amount for acceptable grain yield and high economic benefits under no water stress mo et al 2017 wang et al 2018b the recommended n fertilizer rate for maize was around 180 kg ha 1 for obtaining high crop yields with low environmental risks in the guanzhong plain of china yang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 recommended 150 kg ha 1 for maize by coupled water and nitrogen management in the huang huai hai plain of china srivastava et al 2018 recommended 125 kg ha 1 for high nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield of maize under irrigated conditions in india according to the study of sun et al 2018 in the north of china when fertilization application amount was 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen uptake and use efficiency was in general higher than that under other fertilization amount through studying the sunflower production in the hid nitrogen application rates of 135 180 kg ha 1 are considered as the best fertilization strategy zeng et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 there have been few researched studying on which fertilization conventional fertilization or limited fertilization was more appropriate in film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system in addition sand layer existed in soil of typical farmland and affected the vertical distribution of soil no3 n in the hid zhou et al 2017 soil with sand layer has a high water permeability which may aggravate the leaching of nitrate nitrogen el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 however soil nitrogen transport and nitrogen utilization in sand layered soil under film mulched ridge furrow irrigation with limited irrigation and fertilization has not been well studied although previous researched have optimized water and fertilizer inputs for increasing crop yield and water nitrogen use efficiencies under flood irrigation or drip irrigation few studies investigated their effects on nitrogen transport and distribution in soil plant system and the effects on economic benefits especially in film mulched ridge furrow irrigation we hypothesized that half of the conventional fertilization rate i e 150 kg n ha 1 rather than 300 kg n ha 1 combined with optimized irrigation amount and scheduling would increase nitrogen use efficiency without significantly reducing maize yield and decrease the risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater in the hid meanwhile understanding the productivity of half fertilization with varying irrigation regimes and mastering crop nitrogen uptake and distribution may help to regulate the reasonable irrigation fertilization mode and realize the sustainable agricultural development therefore this study aimed to 1 investigate the impacts of irrigation and fertilization on soil water maize growth and grain yield 2 analyze the interactive effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer on the dynamics of nitrogen accumulation and its distribution in sand layered soil and plant organs of spring maize 3 evaluate nitrogen harvest index nhi internal efficiency of nitrogen use and economic benefits under different irrigation and fertilization practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 at the shuguang experimental station 40 46 n 107 24 e

relative humidity radiation wind speed and accumulated rainfall in the two growing seasons are showed in table 3 monthly meteorological factors indicated that climatic condition was different in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons rainfall in may july and august 2018 the relative wet growing season was remarkably higher than that in 2017 the relative dry growing season temperature pan evaporation relative humidity and radiation presented the same trend in 2017 and 2018 monthly temperature increased from may to july and decreased from august to september pan evaporation generally decreased during the growing season which may be related to the radiation and radiation also gradually decreased during the growing season the relative humidity gradually increased from may to july and decreased from august to september relative humidity was much higher in 2018 than that in 2017 especially in july and august which was mainly because more rainfall in 2018 wind speed varied in the two growing seasons and was slightly higher in 2018 than that in 2017 3 2 soil water content and et a during the whole growth period in 2017 swc decreased with decreasing irrigation amount and was generally ranked as follows i1 20 90 in i1f1 and 21 14 in i1f2 i2 18 96 in i2f1 and 19 32 in i2f2 i3 17 27 in i3f1 and 17 16 in i3f2 fig 3a during the whole growth period in 2018 swc did not differ for i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 and were much higher than i3f1 and i3f2 fig 3b during the whole growth period in 2018 the average swc for i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 i2f2 i3f1 and i3f2 were 22 05 21 88 21 38 22 47 18 56 and 19 26 respectively soil water content was mainly affected by irrigation amount f2 had slightly higher swc than f1 in both years with the higher rainfall in 2018 swc was higher than in 2017 we calculated eta at different growth stages in the two study years actual crop evapotranspiration eta reached the highest value during v6 v12 in both years and was generally ranked as follows v6 v12 r3 r6 v12 r3 v0 v6 fig 4 eta was generally increased with the increasing irrigation amounts eta under 400 mm irrigation amount was remarkably higher than that under 300 mm at different growth stages in 2017 the relative dry growing season that had little difference in 2018 the relative wet growing season the total eta for different nitrogen fertilizer amounts had no significant difference eta for different irrigation amount had significant difference ranked as i1 i2 i3 in 2017 the relative dry growing season table 4 eta for i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 had no significant difference and were significantly higher than that for i3f1 and i3f2 in 2018 the relative wet growing season 3 3 soil nitrate nitrogen the mean soil no3 n content in the 0 100 cm soil profile changed over time and was influenced by irrigation and fertilization fig 5 during the growing season soil no3 n contents gradually decreased after sowing suddenly increased after the third irrigation event due to the addition of fertilizer and then followed a downward trend soil no3 n contents were higher at higher nitrogen fertilizer rates and lower irrigation amounts soil no3 n contents did not significantly differ between i2 and i3 and were significantly higher than i1 in both years especially in 2018 fig 5b mean soil no3 n contents for i2 and i3 were 10 1 and 14 0 higher in 2017 and 18 2 and 16 3 higher in 2018 than i1 respectively the nitrogen fertilizer treatment had a significant effect on soil no3 n contents during growing seasons the f1 treatment had 11 8 and 9 4 higher mean soil no3 n contents than f2 in 2017 and 2018 the various irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer regimes significantly affected mean soil no3 n contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer in both growing seasons fig 6a and b the mean soil no3 n content for i1f2 was lower than the other treatments in the 0 60 cm soil layers and significantly lower than i2f1 and i3f1 in the 0 40 cm soil layers in 2017 and 2018 the highest soil no3 n content occurred in i2f1 and i3f1 in the 0 100 cm soil layers followed by i1f1 i2f2 i3f2 and i1f2 with no significant difference observed between i1f1 i2f2 and i3f2 in either growing season the 40 100 cm soil layer had significantly lower soil no3 n content than the 0 40 cm soil layer in 2017 i1f1 had significantly higher soil no3 n content in the 80 100 cm soil layer than the other treatments fig 6a as did i1f1 and i2f1 in 2018 fig 6b there are significant differences in soil no3 n accumulation among the irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate treatments fig 7 which increased as nitrogen fertilizer rate increased and decreased as irrigation amount increased the f1 treatments had significantly higher soil no3 n accumulation than the f2 treatment in both years soil no3 n accumulation under i2f2 and i3f2 did not significantly differ but were significantly higher than i1f2 soil no3 n accumulation for f1 significantly differed with different irrigation amounts ranked i3 i2 i1 in both years the no3 n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer was much higher than that in other soil layer high irrigation amount remarkably increased soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil layer compared with i1f1 soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil layer for i1f2 i2f1 i2f2 i3f1 and i3f2 decreased by 12 3 64 74 3 74 7 and 70 7 in 2017 respectively and by 15 5 72 9 73 3 67 1 and 65 7 in 2018 respectively with increasing irrigation amount more no3 n moved downwards into deep soil layers 3 4 plant nitrogen accumulation and distribution plant nitrogen accumulation and distribution in various organs stem leaf ear presented different characteristics at different growth stages of spring maize v12 r1 r3 and r6 in 2017 and 2018 fig 8 plant nitrogen accumulation in stem and leaf gradually decreased with maize phenological development nitrogen accumulation in various organs demonstrated that most of the nitrogen absorbed by maize was transported to ears fig 8g h stem and leaf nitrogen accumulation did not significantly differ among i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 however i3f1 had significantly higher stem and leaf nitrogen accumulation than i3f2 at different growth stages in 2017 and 2018 ears accumulated the most nitrogen under i1f1 at r6 in 2017 followed by i2f2 i1f2 and i2f1 which were significantly higher than i3f1 and i3f2 fig 8g i1f1 i2f1 and i2f2 had significantly higher ear nitrogen accumulation at r6 in 2018 followed by i1f2 i3f1 and i3f2 fig 8h however i2f1 and i2f2 had significantly higher ear nitrogen accumulation at r3 in both years than the other treatments fig 8e f 3 5 lai dry matter accumulation and hi nitrogen fertilizer rate had no significant effects on lai dry matter accumulation dma or harvest index hi fig 9 lai under i1 and i2 did not significantly differ and was significantly higher than i3 in 2017 and 2018 i3f1 had significantly higher lai than i3f2 in 2017 due to the relatively poor rainfall during the growing season dma under i1 and i2 did not significantly differ and was significantly higher than i3 dma did not significantly differ between nitrogen fertilizer rates dma was higher in 2018 than 2017 which was related to the different rainfall in the two growing seasons in 2017 hi did not significantly differ between the different irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate treatments however in 2018 the low nitrogen fertilizer rate f2 combined with moderate and low irrigation amounts i2 and i3 had significantly higher hi than i1f1 3 6 grain n content and nitrogen harvest index nhi the irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate interaction had significant effects on grain yield gy grain nitrogen content gn n yield nhi and internal use efficiency ie of spring maize in both years table 4 under i1 and i2 gy did not significantly differ between f1 and f2 but was significantly greater than i3f1 and i3f2 i3f1 had significantly higher gy than i3f2 in 2017 but no significant difference in 2018 due to the differing rainfall in the two growing seasons the gn contents under i1f1 i2f1 and i2f2 did not significantly differ but were significantly higher than i1f2 i3f1 and i3f2 in 2017 and 2018 the differences in n yield among treatments were consistent with gy but i3f1 had significantly higher n yield than i3f2 in 2018 in 2017 nhi did not significantly differ between i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 and was significantly higher than i3f1 and i3f2 in 2018 nhi was significantly higher for i1f2 and i2f2 than the other treatments i1f1 and i1f2 had significantly higher ie than the other treatments in 2017 but i1f1 had significantly lower ie in 2018 3 7 economic benefits net income ranged from 254 to 1325 usd ha 1 in 2017 and 912 1292 usd ha 1 in 2018 table 5 compared with the minimum value the highest net income increased by 421 7 and 41 7 in 2017 and 2018 respectively at i1 and i2 irrigation level f2 had higher net income and output input values however i3f1 had higher net income and output input values than i3f2 in the two study years with relatively poor rainfall 2017 i2f2 had 13 1 211 8 and 294 1 higher net income than i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 respectively and 24 5 and 33 0 lower income than i1f1 and i1f2 i2f2 had much higher output input than i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 with relatively normal rainfall 2018 i2f2 had 38 5 4 8 29 5 114 3 and 96 2 higher net income than i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 i3f1 and i3f2 and higher output input than the other treatments therefore i2f2 is the cultivation pattern more likely to increase net income 3 8 correlation between yield net income nitrogen use soil and plant nitrogen accumulation irrigation amount and nitrogen fertilizer rate generally grain nitrogen content gn nitrogen harvest index nhi dry matter accumulation dma plant nitrogen accumulation at harvest pna and irrigation amount i were positively correlated with grain yield gy and net income ni fig 10 nhi pna dma and i had strong positive correlations with gy in both study years with the positive correlation coefficients almost reaching 0 86 n rate had weak positive correlation with gy and had negative correlation with ni remarkably soil nitrogen accumulation at harvest sna was negatively correlated with y and ni and positively correlated with n rate in the two study years the positive correlation coefficients between i and gy or ni almost reaching 0 99 in 2017 and the coefficients were 0 82 and 0 71 in 2020 respectively 4 discussion arable land is vulnerable due to the scarcity of water resources and groundwater pollution caused by nutrient leaching in the hid inappropriate irrigation and fertilization practices can pollute groundwater and degrade farmland li et al 2020a the interaction between irrigation and fertilization affected nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield xiao et al 2021 yan et al 2021 as reported by dong et al 2018 li et al 2020a and zhang et al 2021 meteorological data during growing season had great influence on spring maize growth water use and grain yield which may also affect nitrogen use inadequate water and n supply may decrease crop yield whereas excessive water and n supply do not increase grain yield but it increases the risk of n leaching and groundwater pollution chen et al 2020 generally crop growth and grain yield increase with the increasing water and n supply within limits wang et al 2018a yan et al 2021 increasing irrigation can promote maize growth and enhance biomass and lai insufficient irrigation may cause lower biomass and lai thus inhibiting plant nitrogen absorption and utilization fan et al 2020 lai dma and grain yield did not significantly differ between i1 and i2 but was significantly higher than i3 fig 9 and table 3 indicating that moderate irrigation amount didn t limit spring maize growth and development however excessive irrigation remarkably reduced nutrient uptake of maize thus affecting crop growth yan et al 2021 in this study high irrigation did not restrict maize growth as for nitrogen application the lack of nitrogen reduced leaf area and grain yield sung et al 2015 lai and dma under f1 and f2 did not significantly differ between years indicating that the low nitrogen fertilizer rate did not restrict spring maize growth and development in this area the main reason may be that high n fertilizer rate can inhibit maize growth at the early stage due to the higher soil nitrogen concentration consequently limited dry matter accumulation and yield of maize saiz fernández et al 2015 as xu et al 2020 reported maize yields only increased 0 01 0 83 when n application rate increased from 140 to 182 kg n ha 1 the high yield of maize depends not only on the amount of nitrogen or irrigation but also on the combination of irrigation and fertilizer applied xiao et al 2021 conventional irrigation levels and nitrogen fertilization accelerated excessive n fertilizer consumption during early growth but likely reduced water and nutrient availability during later growth decreasing aboveground biomass and grain yield guo et al 2019 irrigation and topdressing at maize grain filling stage in this study increased water and nutrient supply for later growth stage which avoided the yield reduction caused by water and nutrient deficiency the amount of nitrogen fertilizer available for uptake directly affects maize growth and yield srivastava et al 2018 previous studies have shown a negative correlation between nitrogen fertilizer rate and nitrogen use efficiency as nitrogen losses are rapid when nitrogen input exceeds the crop assimilation capacity jin et al 2012 stamatiadis et al 2016 wang et al 2018a reported that plant nitrogen uptake was closely related to nitrogen rate with plant nitrogen uptake initially increasing then decreasing with increasing nitrogen rate yan et al 2021 reported that excessive water and n supply reduced grain nitrogen uptake and grain yield in this study nitrogen fertilizer rate had weak positive correlation with grain yield and had negative correlation with net income single plant nitrogen accumulation among i1f1 i1f2 i2f1 and i2f2 had little difference which was significantly higher than that for i3f1 and i3f2 this was consistent with ballester et al 2021 which showed that n uptake between high and intermediate irrigation treatments had no significant difference n uptake for intermediate irrigation was higher than that for high irrigation in more rainfall year in addition the study demonstrated there were no significant differences in n uptake between the n 309 and n 244 rates ballester et al 2021 this was consistent with our study and f2 had higher values for nhi and ie indicating that f2 did not restrict maize demands and promote nitrogen use and transport to grain similar results was also found in other research n uptake of plant between 315 and 210 nitrogen fertilization had no significant difference under adequate irrigation water condition li et al 2020b under water stress n uptake was reduced and higher nitrogen fertilizer remained in the soil teixeira et al 2014 soil fertility status significantly affects resource use efficiency gang et al 2019 and the low nitrogen fertilizer rate tended to have higher agronomic efficiency irrigation is the major driver affecting water and nitrogen dynamics in the root zone no3 n distribution and accumulation in the soil profile are affected by irrigation amount nitrogen fertilizer rate and plant absorption sun et al 2012 excessive nitrogen fertilizer increases soil no3 n concentration and deep no3 n migration with irrigation woli et al 2016 zou et al 2017 showed that maize root system was more likely to absorb and utilize soil nutrients of surface layer above 60 cm in addition soil nitrogen accumulation was very small at harvest when the nitrogen fertilizer rate met the plant need di and cameron 2000 in this study soil no3 n accumulation in the 80 100 cm soil profile at r6 for i1f1 and i1f2 were significantly higher than that for the other treatments fig 7 these was consistent with yan et al 2021 who found that the deep soil no3 n increased as irrigation and fertilization increased which increased the risk of n leaching and groundwater pollution thus reducing irrigation amount can effectively reduce the risk of nitrogen leaching and reducing nitrogen fertilizer rate can reduce soil no3 n residue woli et al 2016 previous studies showed that ridge furrow system with medium fertilization in normal and drought years in rainfed areas had significantly higher grain yield than that with high fertilizer rate zhang et al 2018 however low fertilization produced significantly higher grain yield than high and medium fertilization in a wet year with insufficient rainfall during the growing season crop yield can enhance through the increase of fertilization amount zhang et al 2018 zhong and shangguan 2014 our study showed the similar results i3f1 had significantly higher yield than i3f2 in 2017 relative dry growing season plants with greater irrigation can absorb more nitrogen and obtain high nitrogen use efficiency gu et al 2021 thus f1 may be more conducive to the nitrogen fertilizer absorption by crops under 200 mm irrigation amount in addition high fertilization can enhance crop drought resistance zhang et al 2007 i3f1 had significantly higher eta than i3f2 in 2017 consequently i3f1 produced significantly higher grain yield in relative dry growing season but the yield difference between i3f1 and i3f2 diminished in relative wet growing season in irrigated areas deficit irrigation may increase nitrogen use efficiency gu et al 2021 showed limited irrigation and fertilization significantly increased yield and n use efficiency by 14 6 17 7 and 16 2 30 5 in wet year i2f2 obtained higher grain yield with no significant difference than i1f1 and significantly higher nhi and ie in both years this indicated irrigation amounts with 300 mm and fertilization with 150 kg n ha 1 were sufficient to form maize yield and may be more valuable when considering net income and environmental benefit under the plastic film mulched ridge furrow irrigation system in the hid irrespective of the normal or poor rainfall 5 conclusions appropriate reduction of irrigation and nitrogen supply should be implemented to decrease nitrogen leaching and achieve acceptable grain yield and economic benefits under intensively cropped spring maize farming practices the traditional irrigation and fertilization regime i1f1 400 mm irrigation and 300 kg n ha 1 did not positively improve yield and economic benefits i1f1 resulted in greater no3 n leaching into 80 100 cm soil layer decreased nitrogen use efficiency and increased the risk of groundwater pollution 300 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 fertilization i2f2 increased plant nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen transport from shoots and leaves to grain and subsequently improved ie nhi and grain yield compared with i1f1 i2f2 decreased net income by 24 5 in drought year and increased net income by 38 5 in normal rainfall year moreover i2f2 saved 25 irrigation and 50 n fertilizer and reduced the risk of groundwater pollution thus the film mulched ridge furrow irrigation with 300 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 fertilization is a promising approach for reducing water and nitrogen supply and nitrogen leaching and obtaining

9677,numerous studies have reported effects of straws with microbial decaying agents on greenhouse gas emissions from rice fields however studies regarding the effects of microbial decaying agents on carbon footprint and economic profit under diverse water regimes remained unclear a two factor field experiment was adopted to assess effects of different straw treatments straw returning alone abbreviated as s and straw returning with microbial decaying agent abbreviated as smd on ch4 and n2o emissions rice yield carbon footprint economic profit and net ecosystem economic profit neep from paddy field under different water regimes continuous flooding abbreviated as f and alternation of wetting and drying abbreviated as awd in central china compared with s treatment smd treatment significantly enhanced the crop water productivity by 7 9 8 4 and the rice yield by 7 3 7 7 though smd treatment increased the economic profit by 9 9 18 5 and the neep by 9 6 18 0 relative to s treatment it also resulted in higher the ch4 emissions by 12 7 32 4 and global warming potential by 11 2 21 5 regardless of water regimes water regimes had significant effects on the crop water productivity rice yield ch4 and n2o emissions global warming potential economic profit neep and carbon footprint compared with f treatment awd treatment improved the crop water productivity by 51 7 79 4 maintained rice yield increased n2o emissions by 17 7 40 0 and mitigated ch4 emissions by 33 2 75 1 which therefore resulted in lower global warming potential by 31 5 69 8 and carbon footprint by 32 7 66 0 moreover awd treatment significantly increased the economic profit by 25 4 41 9 and the neep by 28 8 46 6 relative to f treatment overall the straw incorporated with microbial decaying agents is not an environmental friendly practice for the tradeoff of mitigation of ch4 emissions and increase in economic profit it is necessary to further optimize straw treatment for mitigating ch4 emissions in order to develop rice sustainable production keywords agricultural input alternation of wetting and drying carbon footprint microbial decomposing agent net ecosystem economic profit availability of data and materials the data and materials were provided upon personal request 1 introduction paddy fields are important contributors to ch4 and n2o emissions in the world fangueiro et al 2017 the two greenhouse gases ghgs are important components of atmospheric ghgs soares et al 2020 about 20 40 tg yr 1 of ch4 are emitted from rice paddies globally which account for 10 20 of the total anthropogenic ch4 emissions xu et al 2015 approximately 88 0 98 1 gg n2o are emitted during rice season every year in china yao et al 2013 hence it is urgent to advocate reliable measures for alleviating ghg emissions ghge from paddy fields continuous flooding f is the traditional irrigation regime in rice cultivation of china wang et al 2017 with the increasing shortage of water resources and the improve of people s environmental awareness water saving irrigation measures are considered as effective methods to lower water use liu et al 2020b wang et al 2021 lampayan et al 2015 proposed that the water saving measures e g alternate wet and dry awd irrigation can reduce ghge numerous studies reported that awd irrigation can improve soil aerobic condition and inhibit methanogen activity thereby mitigating ch4 emissions conrad 2002 snyder et al 2009 cai et al 2016 research also demonstrated significant positive correlation between the ch4 emissions with dissolved organic carbon doc content awd irrigation can reduce the soil doc content thus leading to a reduction in the ch4 emissions wang et al 2020a 2020b feng et al 2021 moreover some research showed that the n2o emissions were greatly lowered by the improvement of soil aeration under awd irrigation ravishankara et al 2009 china produces about 700 million tons of straw each year most of the straw are burned thus inducing large amounts of ghge romasanta et al 2017 yin et al 2018 therefore straw returning to the fields is mandatory in china straw returning can release large amounts of nutrients and improve soil fertility charles et al 2017 yan et al 2019 however crop sowing and emergence are negatively affected by the slow straw degradation in the field ma et al 2019 in order to solve the problems microbial decomposing agents liu et al 2015 are used to accelerate straw decomposition the degradation of crop straw induced by the decaying agents inevitably impacts ch4 and n2o release through influencing contents of carbon c and nitrogen n substrates wang et al 2020b liu et al 2015 indicated that smd enhanced ch4 emissions relative to s however wang et al 2020b thought that smd did not affect the ch4 emissions for n2o emissions no unanimous conclusion about the effect the decomposing materials was observed wang et al 2020b proposed that smd had no effect on the n2o emissions against s by two year test however ma et al 2019 reported lower n2o emissions under smd therefore further studies about the effects of straw with the decaying agents on ch4 and n2o emissions are needed for developing sustainable straw management for specific agro ecological regions of rice cultivation life cycle assessment lca of rice production is widely used to evaluate c footprint cf of crop production zhou et al 2017 yadav et al 2018 analyzing the cf can help us seek optimized agricultural management to mitigate ghge yan et al 2015 li et al 2021 sriphirom et al 2019 proposed that awd irrigation resulted in lower the cf due to higher rice yield gains and lower ghge compared with f irrigation similar views have been reported by nalley et al 2015 and sriphirom et al 2020 li et al 2021 found that straw returning greatly improved the cf relative to straw removal however few studies discussed the effects of straw incorporated with the decaying agents under different water regimes on the cf and ep from paddy fields though the decaying agents can boost straw decomposition thus providing reactive substrates for methanogens the improvement in soil aeration under awd may inhibit the activity of methanogens which may lead to in no significant change in ch4 emissions induced by straws with the decaying agents under awd we hypothesized that straw incorporated with the decaying agents under awd can reduce ghge and cf while increasing the ep 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment design a two year field trial with a rice wheat rotation was conducted at zhongxing farm located in zaoyang city

the soil is sandy loam classified as fluvisols fao classification the initial ph water saturation capacity bulk density organic matter total n content total p content and total k content of the topsoil 0 20 cm are 6 52 35 1 18 g cm 3 23 22 g kg 1 1 44 g kg 1 0 64 g kg 1 and 10 93 g kg 1 respectively the field trial was carried out from june 2019 to november 2020 using a two factor split plot design in which the straw treatment was the main factor and the water regime was the sub factor straw treatments contained s and smd and the water regime included f and awd irrigation each treatment was repeated three times each plot area was 40 0 m2 5 0 m 8 0 m which was separated by ridges with a width of 0 5 m and a height of 0 3 m mulched by black plastic films inserted into a depth of 40 cm to avoid the interflow of fertilizer and water for s treatment the preceding wheat straw about 6000 kg ha 1 was crushed into 5 7 cm and then mixed with the soil on june 12th in 2019 and june 1th in 2020 for sd treatment the wheat straw pulverized at 5 7 cm mixed with the decomposing agent at 30 kg ha 1 and then the mixture was then incorporated into the soil on june 15 2019 and june 3 2020 the decomposing agents containing bacillus laterosporus 3 2 109 cell g 1 bacillus brevis 1 6 109 cell g 1 and saccharomyces 5 2 109 cell g 1 were purchased from henan wobao biotechnology co ltd hebi city henan province for f treatments the drainage was only carried out at the full tillering stage and about two weeks before harvest and the water table was maintained at 1 10 cm at other rice growing stages according to the local recommended cultivation method fig 1 for awd treatment when the soil water potential 15 cm deep layer was about 20 kpa the paddy field was re irrigated at 1 3 cm tran et al 2018 the water potential was measured by a soil tensiometer tuopu yunnong technology co ltd hangzhou installed at the center of each plot the rice variety 7y370 oryza sativa l was sown directly at 30 kg ha 1 manually on june 18 2019 and june 6 2020 and harvested on october 29 2019 and october 17 2020 in both rice seasons 180 kg n ha 1 was provided by urea 90 p2o5 ha 1 by superphosphate and 180 kg k2o ha 1 of potassium by potassium chloride fifty percent of n and k fertilizers and 100 of p fertilizers were used at the base fertilizer while the other 50 of n fertilizers were applied at the tiller and filler 20 stages and the remaining k fertilizers 50 were applied at the heading stage pesticide and weed management were in accordance with local practice five eh meter electrodes sx712 yidian scientific instrument co ltd shanghai were installed at 5 cm below the soil surface in each plot water table and soil eh were measured every week from seeding to harvest the water table was measured by pvc pipes 2 m long with a diameter of 5 cm the pipes were installed at 1 5 m soil depth in each plot the lower circular surface 120 cm of the pipe was perforated with 0 5 cm holes at 2 cm intervals before installation 2 2 soil sampling and measurement a composite soil sample from 0 to 20 cm depth in eight points of each plot at rice harvesting was collected by a soil sampler with 7 cm in inter diameter the stone and crop residue of the soil sample were removed the soil was mixed together passed through a 2 mm sieve and divided into two parts with one part used for measurement of soil chemical indices dissolved organic c doc nh4 n and no3 n and the other part for microbial indices soil doc was determined according to jiang et al 2006 soil nh4 n and no3 n were extracted and measured following the method of lu 2000 the measurement of abundance of mcra pmoa genes aoa amoa aob amoa nirs nirk and nosz was described by wang et al 2020b the mcra and pmoa genes can be used to reflect the changes in ch4 emissions controlled by methanogens and methanotrophs and the ammonia monoxygenase genes aoa amoa and aob amoa and nitrite reductase genes nirs nirk and nosz can be implemented to assess changes in nitrification and denitrification respectively in brief soil microbial dna was extracted by a dna kit wang et al 2020b these abundance of these genes were determined by the qpcr system wang et al 2020b the specific primers were described in table s1 related functional gene fragments were amplified by bio rad iq5 rt pcr instrument and matching 96 well plate bio rad usa besides each pcr reaction was repeated three times the qpcr results were evaluated based on peasy t5 zero cloning kit transgen biotech china the amplification rate was controlled between 97 3 and 100 7 and r2 values were ranged from 0 996 to 1 000 2 3 ch4 and n2o measurements according to the method of li et al 2013 the ch4 and n2o fluxes were determined using the static steel closed gas chamber in brief four electric fans at the top of each chamber were used to fully stir the gas and then the air temperature in the chambers was monitored a 25 ml gas sample from the chambers was collected four samples were gathered with an interval of 10 min from 8 00 11 00 each time the samplings were conducted at 7 10 day internals from basal fertilizer application to rice harvest the ch4

n2o concentrations remained linear throughout the sampling period the ghg fluxes and cumulative seasonal ghge were computed following the method described by li et al 2013 2 4 measurement of rice grain yield and crop water productivity cwp the rice grains were harvested from an area of 5 m2 in the center of each plot at the rice mature stage sun dried and weighed the cwp was computed as

meteorological station of agriculture faculty s was determined with a neutron scattering moisture meter in 0 90 cm soil layer because the irrigation water amount was controlled the runoff was assumed to be zero drainage was measured by a water meter 2 5 determination of gwp ep and neep we calculated the gwp kg co2 eq ha 1 by the following eq 3 3 gwp 28 ch4 265 n2o in this equation the 28 and 265 are the gwp values relative to that of co2 ipcc 2013 respectively the neep cny ha 1 was measured by the eq 4 4 neep ep gwp cost 5 ep grain profit agricultural production cost in this equation the

treatment awd treatment greatly reduced the total irrigation by 33 7 43 3 table 2 awd treatment led to lower water table and soil water potential than f treatment figs 4 and 5 the soil eh under awd treatment was greatly improved by 25 7 52 9 compared with that under f treatment the soil eh was affected by water regime and straw treatment fig 6 3 2 soil mineral n and doc contents straw treatment

with s treatment the no3 n contents under awd treatment were greatly increased by 17 5 25 0 relative to those under f treatment moreover the interaction of water regime and study year on the mineral n content was significant table 4 straw treatment water regime and study year had significant impacts on the doc content table 4 smd treatment remarkably improved the doc content by 16 6 18 3 compared with s treatment f treatment greatly reduced the doc content by 23 8 27 9 relative to awd treatment 3 3 abundance of ghg emissions related microbial functional genes in general the abundance of mcra aoa amoa aob amoa nirk nirs and nosz were influenced by straw treatment and study year and water regime and study year significantly impacted the abundance of pmoa table 5 smd treatment resulted in higher the abundance of mcra by 11 9 21 2 aoa amoa by 26 5 34 9 and nirk by 14 7 26 5 relative to s treatment moreover awd treatment greatly elevated the pmoa abundance by 19 0 37 3 the aoa amoa abundance by 61 8 72 5 and the aob amoa abundance by 45 7 65 0 relative to those under f treatment compared with f treatment awd treatment significantly reduced the abundance of mcra nirk nirs and nosz by 18 5 28 1 21 4 31 6 19 2 25 5 and 27 6 31 9 respectively 3 4 rice yields and cwp straw treatment significantly affected the rice yield while the yield was not affected by water regime and study year table 3 smd treatment improved the yield by 7 8 8 4 compared with s treatment the cwp was greatly affected by straw treatment water regime and study year table 2 sd treatment remarkably increased the cwp by 7 9 8 4 compared with s treatment besides awd treatment remarkably improved the cwp by 51 7 79 4 relative to f treatment moreover the interaction of water regime and study year significantly affected the cwp table 2 3 5 ch4 and n2o emissions the mid season drainage induced obvious reduction in ch4 fluxes fig 7 the soil ch4 fluxes were the range of 0 04 83 01 mg m 2 h 1 in 2019 and of 0 41 83 13 mg m 2 h 1 in 2020 across all treatments the n2o fluxes were 7 52 855 25 μg m 2 h 1 in 2019 and 23 54 794 45 μg m 2 h 1 in 2020 fig 8 straw treatment water regime and study year all significantly impacted cumulative seasonal ch4 emissions table 3 smd treatment resulted in higher ch4 emissions by 12 7 32 4 relative to s treatment regardless of water regimes awd treatment remarkably reduced the ch4 emissions by 71 5 75 7 in 2019 and by 33 2 35 5 in 2020 compared with f treatment in addition water regime and study year had significant interactive impacts on the ch4 emissions table 3 the cumulative seasonal n2o emissions were greatly influenced by water regime while straw treatment and study year did not affect the n2o emissions table 3 awd treatment significantly elevated the n2o emissions by 58 9 66 6 in 2019 and by 21 5 21 6 in 2020 relative to f treatment 3 6 gwp aigs tghg ep neep and cf straw treatment water regime and study year significantly affected the gwp table 7 smd treatment resulted in higher gwp by 12 7 27 4 than s treatment compared with f treatment awd treatment significantly reduced the gwp by 31 5 69 8 the aigs ranged from 1 35 to 2 04 t co2 eq ha 1 in 2019 and from 1 26 to 1 91 t co2 eq ha 1 in 2020 chemical fertilizers including n p and k fertilizers were the first contributor to the total aigs and the chemical fertilizers caused 26 4 39 8 in 2019 and 28 3 42 7 in 2020 of the total table 6 among chemical fertilizers n fertilizer was the largest contributor 13 5 20 3 in 2019 and 14 4 21 8 in 2020 the ghg emissions induced by diesel combustion was the second largest contributor to the total aigs 4 0 21 4 of the total the ghg emissions from pesticide consumption insecticides herbs fungicides and rice seeds were the least contributors to the total accounting for 6 0 9 6 and 2 7 4 4 respectively the results of the two year study showed that straw treatment water regime and study year remarkably influenced the tghg table 7 the interaction between water regime and study year markedly impacted the tghg compared with s treatment smd treatment significantly stimulated the tghg the tghg under f treatment was 31 2 63 9 higher than that under awd treatment the ch4 was the main contributor to the tghg accounting for 61 1 93 0 of the tghg the cf among treatments was 0 80 3 54 kg co2 eq ha 1 table 7 higher cf was observed in 2020 than in 2019 straw treatment water regime and study year had significant effects on the ep and neep table 7 compared with s treatment smd treatment significantly increased the ep by 10 9 22 8 and the neep by 10 6 22 0 on average irrespective of water regimes compared with f treatment awd treatment significantly increased the ep by 38 1 72 1 and the neep by 40 5 87 4 on average water regime and study year had significant effects on the cf while straw treatment did not affect the cf table 7 compared with f treatment awd treatment resulted in lower cf 4 discussion 4 1 ch4 and n2o emissions under straw treatment with different water regimes we observed higher ch4 emissions under smd treatment than under s treatment irrespective of water regimes table 3 liu et al 2015 pointed out that straw incorporated with decomposing inoculant could increase the number and activity of microorganisms related to ch4 production high mcra abundance under smd treatment table 4 supports the viewpoint in addition previous studies indicated that doc was linked to soil ch4 emissions due to providing substrate for methanogens bu et al 2020 young et al 2021 the higher doc content under smd treatment than under s treatment table 4 therefore promotes the ch4 emissions under awd irrigation the soil aeration can be improved but accelerated degradation of straws induced by the decomposing agents boosts o2 consumption liu et al 2015 which may weaken awd effects on soil aeration therefore the higher doc content under smd treatment than that under s treatment table 3 increased the ch4 emissions regardless of water regimes awd treatment caused lower ch4 emissions in rice growing seasons than f treatment table 3 xu et al 2015 and janz et al 2019 reported similar findings soil anaerobic conditions induced by flooding irrigation can stimulate the activity of methanogens pandey et al 2014 tirol padre et al 2017 which therefore favors ch4 emissions lower mcra abundance and higher pmoa abundance under awd treatment than under f treatment partly support this viewpoint wang et al 2020b claimed that soil doc content was positively related to ch4 emissions higher soil doc content under awd treatment than under f treatment table 4 might result in higher ch4 emissions under awd treatment in this work significant effect of study year on ch4 emissions table 3 coincides with change in rainfall during the two year experiment fig 2 more rainfall may result in more soil anaerobic conditions and thus induce more ch4 production no difference in n2o emissions was observed between s and smd treatments regardless of water regimes table 3 which coincides with the findings of jiang et al 2018 and wang et al 2020b although the decomposing agent application can accelerate the straw decomposition liu et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 especially under awd and increased nh4 n and no3 n contents due to improved abundance of aoa amoa table 5 the flooding under f irrigation may block the diffusion of produced n2o from the soil to the atmosphere which results in no difference in n2o emissions between the two treatments under awd irrigation higher nh4 n content and the improvement of soil aeration may boost nitrification janz et al 2019 but the accelerating straw decomposition may result in o2 consumption and promote denitrification moreover higher doc content under smd treatment table 2 can stimulate the reduction of n2o to n2 during denitrification hu et al 2016 these processes may result in a balance between the production and reduction of n2o resulting in similar n2o emissions between straw treatments irrespective of water regimes increased aoa amoa and nirk abundance under smd treatment relative to s treatment supports the viewpoint in this work awd treatment significantly increased n2o emissions relative to f treatment table 3 the n2o is emitted from soil nitrification and denitrification peng et al 2011 under f treatment the soil anaerobic condition can promote the conversion of n2o to n2 moreover the water layer can hamper the n2o exchange between the soil and the atmosphere thereby less n2o is emitted from f treatment yang et al 2012 wu et al 2018 however awd treatment could induce large amounts of n2o emissions by enhancing the soil nitrification and incomplete denitrification janz et al 2019 wang et al 2020a feng et al 2021 the view can be supported by increased abundance of aoa amoa and aob amoa and decreased abundance of nirk nirs and nosz under awd treatment table 5 4 2 rice yield and cwp under different straw treatments with different water regimes in this work the rice yield under smd treatment was higher than s treatment irrespective of water regimes table 3 possibly due to improvement of soil fertility under smd treatment table 4 similarly wang et al 2020b pointed out that smd treatment improved rice yield compared with s treatment by improving soil fertility in two year research liu et al 2015 also found higher the rice yield under smd treatment relative to that under s treatment similar rice yield between f and awd treatment were observed in this work table 3 some reports have proposed that awd irrigation can maintain and even increase the rice yield belder et al 2004 dong et al 2011 yang et al 2017 setyanto et al 2018 maneepitak et al 2019 which was similar to our results wang et al 2018 indicated that awd irrigation re irrigation with the soil water potential reaching 15 kpa at 15 20 cm depth could result in higher rice yield relative to flooding irrigation also carrijo 2017 and feng et al 2021 indicated that soil water potential of awd treatment with 20 kpa could result in yield losses of 11 6 22 6 relative to cf treatment hence the soil water potential with 20 kpa under awd treatment might cause similar rice yield compared with cf treatment in the present study smd treatment induced higher cwp than s treatment table 2 this may be ascribed to higher rice yield under smd treatment and similar amounts of water irrigation between straw treatments tables 2 and 3 in this work awd treatment reduced total irrigation by 33 7 43 3 compared with f treatment while maintained the rice yield table 3 which therefore improved the cwp under awd treatment table 2 feng et al 2021 also reported similar results in this experimental region in this work significant interactions between water regime and study year on the cwp were observed table 2 the result coincides with the changes in rainfall fig 2 irrigation and rice yield during the two year study tables 2 and 3 in this study we did not determine frequently ghg fluxes due to labor shortage which may ignore some ghg flux peaks and lead to outcome uncertainties nevertheless the present findings provide an insight into the effects of the agronomic practices on ghg emissions from rice fields 4 3 the aigs tghg and cf under different straw treatments with different water regimes chemical fertilizers contributed the most to the aigs table 6 accounting for 26 4 42 7 liu et al 2020a and xue et al 2016 reported similar results the result indicates that it is vital for mitigating ghg emissions from rice production through reducing chemical fertilizer use by improved fertilizer use efficiency xiang et al 2020 the diesel combustion contributed the second largest to the aigs table 6 which differs from li et al 2021 who reported a dominant role of the diesel combustion induced ghg emissions to the aigs more machinery operation used for rice cultivation liu et al 2020a can cause more diesel consumption ghg emissions from the electricity of irrigation accounted for 4 0 21 4 of the aigs table 6 the ratio is similar to the contribution of irrigation to the aigs reported in the most regions of china zhang et al 2018 in this work soil ch4 emissions were dominant in the tghg table 7 accounting for 61 1 93 0 of the total ghge li et al 2021 and liu et al 2020a found similar standpoints high soil ch4 emissions suggest that effective measurements for mitigating ch4 emissions from rice paddies should be encouraged for rice sustainable production li et al 2021 compared with s treatment smd treatment increased ch4 emissions table 7 which implies that other straw treatment should be promoted to mitigate ch4 emissions it has been reported that straw compost can effectively reduce ch4 emissions with increases in soil fertility and rice yield khosa et al 2010 moreover compared with f treatment awd treatment induced lower soil ch4 emissions table 7 suggesting that the awd irrigation is an effective agronomic regime for mitigating ch4 emissions the cf was the range of 0 80 3 58 kg co2 eq kg 1 in this work table 7 which is similar to the results of previous reports dhaliwal et al 2020 in our study similar cfs between straw treatments table 7 are due to higher ch4 emissions and rice yield under smd treatment than under s treatment awd irrigation reduced the cf relative to f irrigation table 7 compared with f irrigation awd irrigation can reduce ch4 emissions table 3 thus lowering the tghg and the cf subsequently 4 4 the ep and neep under straw treatment with different water regimes in this experiment smd treatment exhibited higher ep and neep than s treatment table 7 which lies on higher rice yield under smd treatment than s treatment however although smd treatment resulted in the largest ep neep and cwp relative to s treatment smd treatment induced more ch4 emissions suggesting that a more effective method of straw treatment should be advocated to achieve a win win benefit of mitigating ch4 emissions and enhancing economic profit awd treatment showed higher ep and neep than f treatment which agrees with xu et al 2015 and maneepitak et al 2019 high ep and neep under awd treatment are ascribed to low cost of agricultural production and gwp table 7 suggesting that the agronomic measure is an economic and environment friendly water regime in summary the smd treatment under awd is not an environment friendly straw strategy for mitigating ghg emissions and increasing economic benefit synchronously in the present study significant effects of study year on gwp aigs tghg ep neep and cf were observed table 7 in 2020 the higher ch4 emissions resulted in higher gwp tghg and cf and more rainfall led to less irrigation table 2 which reduced the agricultural production cost the above reasons contributed to the higher ep in 2020 relative to that in 2019 moreover the relatively higher ep and lower gwp cost table 7 in 2020 finally resulted in a higher neep than that in 2019 5 conclusions although compared with s treatments smd treatments maintained the cf improved the cwp increased rice yield ep and neep sd treatments increased ch4 emissions regardless of water regimes suggesting that a more effective method of straw returning should be developed to reduce ch4 emissions compared with f treatments awd treatments significantly increased the n2o emissions but reduced the ch4 emissions and maintained rice yield consequently awd treatments resulted in lower gwp ghgi and cf and higher cwp ep and neep relative to f treatments the results suggest that the awd regime is an economic and environment friendly measure for rice cleaner production while the smd treatment is not an environment friendly straw strategy for mitigating ghg emissions and increasing economic benefit synchronously other optimized treatment of crop straw is needed for mitigating ch4 emissions while improving economic benefit in order to develop rice sustainable production funding

9677,numerous studies have reported effects of straws with microbial decaying agents on greenhouse gas emissions from rice fields however studies regarding the effects of microbial decaying agents on carbon footprint and economic profit under diverse water regimes remained unclear a two factor field experiment was adopted to assess effects of different straw treatments straw returning alone abbreviated as s and straw returning with microbial decaying agent abbreviated as smd on ch4 and n2o emissions rice yield carbon footprint economic profit and net ecosystem economic profit neep from paddy field under different water regimes continuous flooding abbreviated as f and alternation of wetting and drying abbreviated as awd in central china compared with s treatment smd treatment significantly enhanced the crop water productivity by 7 9 8 4 and the rice yield by 7 3 7 7 though smd treatment increased the economic profit by 9 9 18 5 and the neep by 9 6 18 0 relative to s treatment it also resulted in higher the ch4 emissions by 12 7 32 4 and global warming potential by 11 2 21 5 regardless of water regimes water regimes had significant effects on the crop water productivity rice yield ch4 and n2o emissions global warming potential economic profit neep and carbon footprint compared with f treatment awd treatment improved the crop water productivity by 51 7 79 4 maintained rice yield increased n2o emissions by 17 7 40 0 and mitigated ch4 emissions by 33 2 75 1 which therefore resulted in lower global warming potential by 31 5 69 8 and carbon footprint by 32 7 66 0 moreover awd treatment significantly increased the economic profit by 25 4 41 9 and the neep by 28 8 46 6 relative to f treatment overall the straw incorporated with microbial decaying agents is not an environmental friendly practice for the tradeoff of mitigation of ch4 emissions and increase in economic profit it is necessary to further optimize straw treatment for mitigating ch4

availability of data and materials the data and materials were provided upon personal request 1 introduction paddy fields are important contributors to ch4 and n2o emissions in the world fangueiro et al 2017 the two greenhouse gases ghgs are important components of atmospheric ghgs soares et al 2020 about 20 40 tg yr 1 of ch4 are emitted from rice paddies globally which account for 10 20 of the total anthropogenic ch4 emissions xu et al 2015 approximately 88 0 98 1 gg n2o are emitted during rice season every year in china yao et al 2013 hence it is urgent to advocate reliable measures for alleviating ghg emissions ghge from paddy fields continuous flooding f is the traditional irrigation regime in rice cultivation of china wang et al 2017 with the increasing shortage of water resources and the improve of people s environmental awareness water saving irrigation measures are considered as effective methods to lower water use liu et al 2020b wang et al 2021 lampayan et al 2015 proposed that the water saving measures e g alternate wet and dry awd irrigation can reduce ghge numerous studies reported that awd irrigation can improve soil aerobic condition and inhibit methanogen activity thereby mitigating ch4 emissions conrad 2002 snyder et al 2009 cai et al 2016 research also demonstrated significant positive correlation between the ch4 emissions with dissolved organic carbon doc content awd irrigation can reduce the soil doc content thus leading to a reduction in the ch4 emissions wang et al 2020a 2020b feng et al 2021 moreover some research showed that the n2o emissions were greatly lowered by the improvement of soil aeration under awd irrigation ravishankara et al 2009 china produces about 700 million tons of straw each year most of the straw are burned thus inducing large amounts of ghge romasanta et al 2017 yin et al 2018 therefore straw returning to the fields is mandatory in china straw returning can release large amounts of nutrients and improve soil fertility charles et al 2017 yan et al 2019 however crop sowing and emergence are negatively affected by the slow straw degradation in the field ma et al 2019 in order to solve the problems microbial decomposing agents liu et al 2015 are used to accelerate straw decomposition the degradation of crop straw induced by the decaying agents inevitably impacts ch4 and n2o release through influencing contents of carbon c and nitrogen n substrates wang et al 2020b liu et al 2015 indicated that smd enhanced ch4 emissions relative to s however wang et al 2020b thought that smd did not affect the ch4 emissions for n2o emissions no unanimous conclusion about the effect the decomposing materials was observed wang et al 2020b proposed that smd had no effect on the n2o emissions against s by two year test however ma et al 2019 reported lower n2o emissions under smd therefore further studies about the effects of straw with the decaying agents on ch4 and n2o emissions are needed for developing sustainable straw management for specific agro ecological regions of rice cultivation life cycle assessment lca of rice production is widely used to evaluate c footprint cf of crop production zhou et al 2017 yadav et al 2018 analyzing the cf can help us seek optimized agricultural management to mitigate ghge yan et al 2015 li et al 2021 sriphirom et al 2019 proposed that awd irrigation resulted in lower the cf due to higher rice yield gains and lower ghge compared with f irrigation similar views have been reported by nalley et al 2015 and sriphirom et al 2020 li et al 2021 found that straw returning greatly improved the cf relative to straw removal however few studies discussed the effects of straw incorporated with the decaying agents under different water regimes on the cf and ep from paddy fields though the decaying agents can boost straw decomposition thus providing reactive substrates for methanogens the improvement in soil aeration under awd may inhibit the activity of methanogens which may lead to in no significant change in ch4 emissions induced by straws with the decaying agents under awd we hypothesized that straw incorporated with the decaying agents under awd can reduce ghge and cf while increasing the ep 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment design a two year field trial with a rice wheat rotation was conducted at zhongxing farm located in zaoyang city china 31 98 n 112 73 e the topographical and climatic information of the site was described by feng et al 2021 the precipitation and air temperature during the experimental periods are shown in fig 1 the soil is sandy loam classified as fluvisols fao classification the initial ph water saturation capacity bulk density organic matter total n content total p content and total k content of the topsoil 0 20 cm are 6 52 35 1 18 g cm 3 23 22 g kg 1 1 44 g kg 1 0 64 g kg 1 and 10 93 g kg 1 respectively the field trial was carried out from june 2019 to november 2020 using a two factor split plot design in which the straw treatment was the main factor and the water regime was the sub factor straw treatments contained s and smd and the water regime included f and awd irrigation each treatment was repeated three times each plot area was 40 0 m2 5 0 m 8 0 m which was separated by ridges with a width of 0 5 m and a height of 0 3 m mulched by black plastic films inserted into a depth of 40 cm to avoid the interflow of fertilizer and water for s treatment the preceding wheat straw about 6000 kg ha 1 was crushed into 5 7 cm and then mixed with the soil on june 12th in 2019 and june 1th in 2020 for sd treatment the wheat straw pulverized at 5 7 cm mixed with the decomposing agent at 30 kg ha 1 and then the mixture was then incorporated into the soil on june 15 2019 and june 3 2020 the decomposing agents containing bacillus laterosporus 3 2 109 cell g 1 bacillus brevis 1 6 109 cell g 1 and saccharomyces 5 2 109 cell g 1 were purchased from henan wobao biotechnology co ltd hebi city henan province for f treatments the drainage was only carried out at the full tillering stage and about two weeks before harvest and the water table was maintained at 1 10 cm at other rice growing stages according to the local recommended cultivation method fig 1 for awd treatment when the soil water potential 15 cm deep layer was about 20 kpa the paddy field was re irrigated at 1 3 cm tran et al 2018 the water potential was measured by a soil tensiometer tuopu yunnong technology co ltd hangzhou installed at the center of each plot the rice variety 7y370 oryza sativa l was sown directly at 30 kg ha 1 manually on june 18 2019 and june 6 2020 and harvested on october 29 2019 and october 17 2020 in both rice seasons 180 kg n ha 1 was provided by urea 90 p2o5 ha 1 by superphosphate and 180 kg k2o ha 1 of potassium by potassium chloride fifty percent of n and k fertilizers and 100 of p fertilizers were used at the base fertilizer while the other 50 of n fertilizers were applied at the tiller and filler 20 stages and the remaining k fertilizers 50 were applied at the heading stage pesticide and weed management were in accordance with local practice five eh meter electrodes sx712 yidian scientific instrument co ltd shanghai were installed at 5 cm below the soil surface in each plot water table and soil eh were measured every week from seeding to harvest the water table was measured by pvc pipes 2 m long with a diameter of 5 cm the pipes were installed at 1 5 m soil depth in each plot the lower circular surface 120 cm of the pipe was perforated with 0 5 cm holes at 2 cm intervals before installation 2 2 soil sampling and measurement a composite soil sample from 0 to 20 cm depth in eight points of each plot at rice harvesting was collected by a soil sampler with 7 cm in inter diameter the stone and crop residue of the soil sample were removed the soil was mixed together passed through a 2 mm sieve and divided into two parts with one part used for measurement of soil chemical indices dissolved organic c doc nh4 n and no3 n and the other part for microbial indices soil doc was determined according to jiang et al 2006 soil nh4 n and no3 n were extracted and measured following the method of lu 2000 the measurement of abundance of mcra pmoa genes aoa amoa aob amoa nirs nirk and nosz was described by wang et al 2020b the mcra and pmoa genes can be used to reflect the changes in ch4 emissions controlled by methanogens and methanotrophs and the ammonia monoxygenase genes aoa amoa and aob amoa and nitrite reductase genes nirs nirk and nosz can be implemented to assess changes in nitrification and denitrification respectively in brief soil microbial dna was extracted by a dna kit wang et al 2020b these abundance of these genes were determined by the qpcr system wang et al 2020b the specific primers were described in table s1 related functional gene fragments were amplified by bio rad iq5 rt pcr instrument and matching 96 well plate bio rad usa besides each pcr reaction was repeated three times the qpcr results were evaluated based on peasy t5 zero cloning kit transgen biotech china the amplification rate was controlled between 97 3 and 100 7 and r2 values were ranged from 0 996 to 1 000 2 3 ch4 and n2o measurements according to the method of li et al 2013 the ch4 and n2o fluxes were determined using the static steel closed gas chamber in brief four electric fans at the top of each chamber were used to fully stir the gas and then the air temperature in the chambers was monitored a 25 ml gas sample from the chambers was collected four samples were gathered with an interval of 10 min from 8 00 11 00 each time the samplings were conducted at 7 10 day internals from basal fertilizer application to rice harvest the ch4 and n2o concentrations were simultaneously detected by gas chromatograph shimadzu gc 14b equipped with a flame ionization detector and an electron capture detector respectively the changes in ch4 and n2o concentrations remained linear throughout the sampling period the ghg fluxes and cumulative seasonal ghge were computed following the method described by li et al 2013 2 4 measurement of rice grain yield and crop water productivity cwp the rice grains were harvested from an area of 5 m2 in the center of each plot at the rice mature stage sun dried and weighed the cwp was computed as

treatments were compared by duncan s multiple range tests at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 precipitation irrigation water amount water table soil water potential and soil eh the precipitation was 327 3 mm and 743 2 mm in the 2018 and 2019 rice seasons respectively fig 2 the soil eh under smd treatment was significantly decreased by 6 5 22 7 relative to that under s treatment moreover compared with f treatment awd treatment greatly reduced the total irrigation by 33 7 43 3 table 2 awd treatment led to lower water table and soil water potential than f treatment figs 4 and 5 the soil eh under awd treatment was greatly improved by 25 7 52 9 compared with that under f treatment the soil eh was affected by water regime and straw treatment fig 6 3 2 soil mineral n and doc contents straw treatment

with s treatment the no3 n contents under awd treatment were greatly increased by 17 5 25 0 relative to those under f treatment moreover the interaction of water regime and study year on the mineral n content was significant table 4 straw treatment water regime and study year had significant impacts on the doc content table 4 smd treatment remarkably improved the doc content by 16 6 18 3 compared with s treatment f treatment greatly reduced the doc content by 23 8 27 9 relative to awd treatment 3 3 abundance of ghg emissions related microbial functional genes in general the abundance of mcra aoa amoa aob amoa nirk nirs and nosz were influenced by straw treatment and study year and water regime and study year significantly impacted the abundance of pmoa table 5 smd treatment resulted in higher the abundance of mcra by 11 9 21 2 aoa amoa by 26 5 34 9 and nirk by 14 7 26 5 relative to s treatment moreover awd treatment greatly elevated the pmoa abundance by 19 0 37 3 the aoa amoa abundance by 61 8 72 5 and the aob amoa abundance by 45 7 65 0 relative to those under f treatment compared with f treatment awd treatment significantly reduced the abundance of mcra nirk nirs and nosz by 18 5 28 1 21 4 31 6 19 2 25 5 and 27 6 31 9 respectively 3 4 rice yields and cwp straw treatment significantly affected the rice yield while the yield was not affected by water regime and study year table 3 smd treatment improved the yield by 7 8 8 4 compared with s treatment the cwp was greatly affected by straw treatment water regime and study year table 2 sd treatment remarkably increased the cwp by 7 9 8 4 compared with s treatment besides awd treatment remarkably improved the cwp by 51 7 79 4 relative to f treatment moreover the interaction of water regime and study year significantly affected the cwp table 2 3 5 ch4 and n2o emissions the mid season drainage induced obvious reduction in ch4 fluxes fig 7 the soil ch4 fluxes were the range of 0 04 83 01 mg m 2 h 1 in 2019 and of 0 41 83 13 mg m 2 h 1 in 2020 across all treatments the n2o fluxes were 7 52 855 25 μg m 2 h 1 in 2019 and 23 54 794 45 μg m 2 h 1 in 2020 fig 8 straw treatment water regime and study year all significantly impacted cumulative seasonal ch4 emissions table 3 smd treatment resulted in higher ch4 emissions by 12 7 32 4 relative to s treatment regardless of water regimes awd treatment remarkably reduced the ch4 emissions by 71 5 75 7 in 2019 and by 33 2 35 5 in 2020 compared with f treatment in addition water regime and study year had significant interactive impacts on the ch4 emissions table 3 the cumulative seasonal n2o emissions were greatly influenced by water regime while straw treatment and study year did not affect the n2o emissions table 3 awd treatment significantly elevated the n2o emissions by 58 9 66 6 in 2019 and by 21 5 21 6 in 2020 relative to f treatment 3 6 gwp aigs tghg ep neep and cf straw treatment water regime and study year significantly affected the gwp table 7 smd treatment resulted in higher gwp by 12 7 27 4 than s treatment compared with f treatment awd treatment significantly reduced the gwp by 31 5 69 8 the aigs ranged from 1 35 to 2 04 t co2 eq ha 1 in 2019 and from 1 26 to 1 91 t co2 eq ha 1 in 2020 chemical fertilizers including n p and k fertilizers were the first contributor to the total aigs and the chemical fertilizers caused 26 4 39 8 in 2019 and 28 3 42 7 in 2020 of the total table 6 among chemical fertilizers n fertilizer was the largest contributor 13 5 20 3 in 2019 and 14 4 21 8 in 2020 the ghg emissions induced by diesel combustion was the second largest contributor to the total aigs 4 0 21 4 of the total the ghg emissions from pesticide consumption insecticides herbs fungicides and rice seeds were the least contributors to the total accounting for 6 0 9 6 and 2 7 4 4 respectively the results of the two year study showed that straw treatment water regime and study year remarkably influenced the tghg table 7 the interaction between water regime and study year markedly impacted the tghg compared with s treatment smd treatment significantly stimulated the tghg the tghg under f treatment was 31 2 63 9 higher than that under awd treatment the ch4 was the main contributor to the tghg accounting for 61 1 93 0 of the tghg the cf among treatments was 0 80 3 54 kg co2 eq ha 1 table 7 higher cf was observed in 2020 than in 2019 straw treatment water regime and study year had significant effects on the ep and neep table 7 compared with s treatment smd treatment significantly increased the ep by 10 9 22 8 and the neep by 10 6 22 0 on average irrespective of water regimes compared with f treatment awd treatment significantly increased the ep by 38 1 72 1 and the neep by 40 5 87 4 on average water regime and study year had significant effects on the cf while straw treatment did not affect the cf table 7 compared with f treatment awd treatment resulted in lower cf 4 discussion 4 1 ch4 and n2o emissions under straw treatment with different water regimes we observed higher ch4 emissions under smd treatment than under s treatment irrespective of water regimes table 3 liu et al 2015 pointed out that straw incorporated with decomposing inoculant could increase the number and activity of microorganisms related to ch4 production high mcra abundance under smd treatment table 4 supports the viewpoint in addition previous studies indicated that doc was linked to soil ch4 emissions due to providing substrate for methanogens bu et al 2020 young et al 2021 the higher doc content under smd treatment than under s treatment table 4 therefore promotes the ch4 emissions under awd irrigation the soil aeration can be improved but accelerated degradation of straws induced by the decomposing agents boosts o2 consumption liu et al 2015 which may weaken awd effects on soil aeration therefore the higher doc content under smd treatment than that under s treatment table 3 increased the ch4 emissions regardless of water regimes awd treatment caused lower ch4 emissions in rice growing seasons than f treatment table 3 xu et al 2015 and janz et al 2019 reported similar findings soil anaerobic conditions induced by flooding irrigation can stimulate the activity of methanogens pandey et al 2014 tirol padre et al 2017 which therefore favors ch4 emissions lower mcra abundance and higher pmoa abundance under awd treatment than under f treatment partly support this viewpoint wang et al 2020b claimed that soil doc content was positively related to ch4 emissions higher soil doc content under awd treatment than under f treatment table 4 might result in higher ch4 emissions under awd treatment in this work significant effect of study year on ch4 emissions table 3 coincides with change in rainfall during the two year experiment fig 2 more rainfall may result in more soil anaerobic conditions and thus induce more ch4 production no difference in n2o emissions was observed between s and smd treatments regardless of water regimes table 3 which coincides with the findings of jiang et al 2018 and wang et al 2020b although the decomposing agent application can accelerate the straw decomposition liu et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 especially under awd and increased nh4 n and no3 n contents due to improved abundance of aoa amoa table 5 the flooding under f irrigation may block the diffusion of produced n2o from the soil to the atmosphere which results in no difference in n2o emissions between the two treatments under awd irrigation higher nh4 n content and the improvement of soil aeration may boost nitrification janz et al 2019 but the accelerating straw decomposition may result in o2 consumption and promote denitrification moreover higher doc content under smd treatment table 2 can stimulate the reduction of n2o to n2 during denitrification hu et al 2016 these processes may result in a balance between the production and reduction of n2o resulting in similar n2o emissions between straw treatments irrespective of water regimes increased aoa amoa and nirk abundance under smd treatment relative to s treatment supports the viewpoint in this work awd treatment significantly increased n2o emissions relative to f treatment table 3 the n2o is emitted from soil nitrification and denitrification peng et al 2011 under f treatment the soil anaerobic condition can promote the conversion of n2o to n2 moreover the water layer can hamper the n2o exchange between the soil and the atmosphere thereby less n2o is emitted from f treatment yang et al 2012 wu et al 2018 however awd treatment could induce large amounts of n2o emissions by enhancing the soil nitrification and incomplete denitrification janz et al 2019 wang et al 2020a feng et al 2021 the view can be supported by increased abundance of aoa amoa and aob amoa and decreased abundance of nirk nirs and nosz under awd treatment table 5 4 2 rice yield and cwp under different straw treatments with different water regimes in this work the rice yield under smd treatment was higher than s treatment irrespective of water regimes table 3 possibly due to improvement of soil fertility under smd treatment table 4 similarly wang et al 2020b pointed out that smd treatment improved rice yield compared with s treatment by improving soil fertility in two year research liu et al 2015 also found higher the rice yield under smd treatment relative to that under s treatment similar rice yield between f and awd treatment were observed in this work table 3 some reports have proposed that awd irrigation can maintain and even increase the rice yield belder et al 2004 dong et al 2011 yang et al 2017 setyanto et al 2018 maneepitak et al 2019 which was similar to our results wang et al 2018 indicated that awd irrigation re irrigation with the soil water potential reaching 15 kpa at 15 20 cm depth could result in higher rice yield relative to flooding irrigation also carrijo 2017 and feng et al 2021 indicated that soil water potential of awd treatment with 20 kpa could result in yield losses of 11 6 22 6 relative to cf treatment hence the soil water potential with 20 kpa under awd treatment might cause similar rice yield compared with cf treatment in the present study smd treatment induced higher cwp than s treatment table 2 this may be ascribed to higher rice yield under smd treatment and similar amounts of water irrigation between straw treatments tables 2 and 3 in this work awd treatment reduced total irrigation by 33 7 43 3 compared with f treatment while maintained the rice yield table 3 which therefore improved the cwp under awd treatment table 2 feng et al 2021 also reported similar results in this experimental region in this work significant interactions between water regime and study year on the cwp were observed table 2 the result coincides with the changes in rainfall fig 2 irrigation and rice yield during the two year study tables 2 and 3 in this study we did not determine frequently ghg fluxes due to labor shortage which may ignore some ghg flux peaks and lead to outcome uncertainties nevertheless the present findings provide an insight into the effects of the agronomic practices on ghg emissions from rice fields 4 3 the aigs tghg and cf under different straw treatments with different water regimes chemical fertilizers contributed the most to the aigs table 6 accounting for 26 4 42 7 liu et al 2020a and xue et al 2016 reported similar results the result indicates that it is vital for mitigating ghg emissions from rice production through reducing chemical fertilizer use by improved fertilizer use efficiency xiang et al 2020 the diesel combustion contributed the second largest to the aigs table 6 which differs from li et al 2021 who reported a dominant role of the diesel combustion induced ghg emissions to the aigs more machinery operation used for rice cultivation liu et al 2020a can cause more diesel consumption ghg emissions from the electricity of irrigation accounted for 4 0 21 4 of the aigs table 6 the ratio is similar to the contribution of irrigation to the aigs reported in the most regions of china zhang et al 2018 in this work soil ch4 emissions were dominant in the tghg table 7 accounting for 61 1 93 0 of the total ghge li et al 2021 and liu et al 2020a found similar standpoints high soil ch4 emissions suggest that effective measurements for mitigating ch4 emissions from rice paddies should be encouraged for rice sustainable production li et al 2021 compared with s treatment smd treatment increased ch4 emissions table 7 which implies that other straw treatment should be promoted to mitigate ch4 emissions it has been reported that straw compost can effectively reduce ch4 emissions with increases in soil fertility and rice yield khosa et al 2010 moreover compared with f treatment awd treatment induced lower soil ch4 emissions table 7 suggesting that the awd irrigation is an effective agronomic regime for mitigating ch4 emissions the cf was the range of 0 80 3 58 kg co2 eq kg 1 in this work table 7 which is similar to the results of previous reports dhaliwal et al 2020 in our study similar cfs between straw treatments table 7 are due to higher ch4 emissions and rice yield under smd treatment than under s treatment awd irrigation reduced the cf relative to f irrigation table 7 compared with f irrigation awd irrigation can reduce ch4 emissions table 3 thus lowering the tghg and the cf subsequently 4 4 the ep and neep under straw treatment with different water regimes in this experiment smd treatment exhibited higher ep and neep than s treatment table 7 which lies on higher rice yield under smd treatment than s treatment however although smd treatment resulted in the largest ep neep and cwp relative to s treatment smd treatment induced more ch4 emissions suggesting that a more effective method of straw treatment should be advocated to achieve a win win benefit of mitigating ch4 emissions and enhancing economic profit awd treatment showed higher ep and neep than f treatment which agrees with xu et al 2015 and maneepitak et al 2019 high ep and neep under awd treatment are ascribed to low cost of agricultural production and gwp table 7 suggesting that the agronomic measure is an economic and environment friendly water regime in summary the smd treatment under awd is not an environment friendly straw strategy for mitigating ghg emissions and increasing economic benefit synchronously in the present study significant effects of study year on gwp aigs tghg ep neep and cf were observed table 7 in 2020 the higher ch4 emissions resulted in higher gwp tghg and cf and more rainfall led to less irrigation table 2 which reduced the agricultural production cost the above reasons contributed to the higher ep in 2020 relative to that in 2019 moreover the relatively higher ep and lower gwp cost table 7 in 2020 finally resulted in a higher neep than that in 2019 5 conclusions although compared with s treatments smd treatments maintained the cf improved the cwp increased rice yield ep and neep sd treatments increased ch4 emissions regardless of water regimes suggesting that a more effective method of straw returning should be developed to reduce ch4 emissions compared with f treatments awd treatments significantly increased the n2o emissions but reduced the ch4 emissions and maintained rice yield consequently awd treatments resulted in lower gwp ghgi and cf and higher cwp ep and neep relative to f treatments the results suggest that the awd regime is an economic and environment friendly measure for rice cleaner production while the smd treatment is not an environment friendly straw strategy for mitigating ghg emissions and increasing economic benefit synchronously other optimized treatment of crop straw is needed for mitigating ch4 emissions while improving economic benefit in order to develop rice sustainable production funding

9678,the cultivation of super high density shd olive orchards in the mediterranean basin usually faces drought events due especially to low precipitation high temperature and solar radiation in summer hence regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies can be a useful tool for irrigation management to limit yield loss therefore this work aimed to find the most suitable rdi strategy by placing special emphasis on phase ii of fruit growth for shd olive orchards irrigated below theoretical water requirements four irrigation strategies were defined according to different water availability scenarios fully irrigated rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 scaled to respectively supply 450 350 250 and 150 mm year 1 tree water relations trunk growth fruit and oil yields were evaluated the study was carried out for 5 years in an arbequina commercial orchard 1667 trees ha 1 in villena alicante spain the main results showed that arbequina tree irrigation water productivity both olive and oil gradually increased as irrigation dose lowered olive yield depended heavily on the applied irrigation dose with the highest olive yield for the control trees however the oil yield in the rdi1 trees was similar to that of the control trees but strategies rdi2 and rdi3 reduced yield all the rdi strategies diminished vegetative development and rdi2 was the most efficient strategy for resource distribution olive yield vs vegetative growth therefore based on oil production vegetative growth and irrigation water savings rdi1 was the most recommendable irrigation strategy for the arbequina olive trees cultivated in shd under semi arid mediterranean conditions keywords plant water status olive oil yield water productivity vegetative development 1 introduction the olive olea europaea l cultivated area has gradually increased in recent decades especially in mediterranean countries with 80 of global olive production spain has the biggest surface area used for olive oil in the world whose production accounts for approximately 60 in the eu and 45 in the world mapa 2021 in the 1990 s super high density shd olive orchards 1500 2200 trees ha 1 used to maximise olive production and increase orchards profitability by mechanised harvesting became common connor et al 2014 rius and lacarte 2010 these orchards are characterised by tree bush shaping with a single north south oriented axis and tree spacing less than 4 m 2 m tous et al 2007 shd olive orchards offer an investment time short return between years 3 and 6 when olive production can range from 8000 to 13000 kg ha 1 tous et al 2006 vegetation management through pruning is one of the critical aspects of these plantations because excess vigour in these plants can result in smaller size and lower fruit yield larbi et al 2011 tous et al 2006 this type of orchards with high tree density has more water requirements than traditional olive orchards when water resource are limited the application of regulated deficit irrigation rdi defined as the systematic reduction of applied water than the theoretically needed amount can result in improved irrigation water productivity iwp ruiz sánchez et al 2010 this technique consists in irrigating below theoretical needs during a period when plant sensitivity to water stress is low gómez del campo 2013 this period must be correctly defined for each species because inadequate water status can negatively impact crop development and production in olive trees inadequate water status from march to june reduces the number of flowers per inflorescence and their fertility which subsequently leads to decreased fruit load on trees orgaz and fereres 2004 another critical period goes from mid september to mid november when oil accumulates during this period severe water stress can negatively affect oil content beede and goldhamer 1994 although the scientific community has reached no clear consensus about the most suitable period for applying irrigation water restrictions gómez del campo 2011 gucci et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 it would seem that negative effects are minimised in phase ii of fruit growth that is between pit hardening and fruit ripening onset tovar et al 2002 goldhamer 1999 however major discrepancies also arise about the irrigation reduction level in shd olive irrigation studies table 1 in a previous study pérez rodríguez et al 2016 maintained similar olive and oil yields to fully irrigated trees by applying 35 reduction to irrigation needs during the period after fruit set and before oil accumulation started in another study fernández et al 2013 determined that the best balance for vigour water savings and oil production could be achieved with a 70 reduction in crop water needs applied from the end of the first fruit development phase to ripening at approximately mid september gómez del campo 2011 report no oil yield reductions after applying 30 irrigation restriction to crop water needs immediately after fruit drop which continued until the end of july however as all these irrigation restrictions start from non limiting irrigation doses the direct extrapolation of water saving percentages to other regions with limited water resources may not be suitable this work aimed to redesign rdi strategies based on applying irrigation restrictions mainly in phase ii of fruit growth for shd olive orchards irrigated below theoretical water requirements to maximise irrigation water productivity in doing so it evaluated the adoption of three rdi strategies based on different water limitation scenarios crop water status vegetative development and also on olive and oil yields 2 material and methods 2 1 orchard characteristics this study was carried out from 2014 to 2018 in a commercial shd olive orchard planted with cv arbequina located in villena 38 35 n 0 52 w 499 m a m s l alicante spain trees were 13 years old at the beginning of the experiment tree spacing was 4 0 m 1 5 m 1667 trees ha 1 soil had a clay loam texture 29 sand 28 clay 43 silt and moderate bulk density 1 69 g cm 3 that could limit root growth according to the usda natural resources conservation service soil organic matter content was very low with an average of 0 3 according to the soil water characteristics program developed by saxton and rawls usda soil water content at field capacity and wilting point was 30 3 and 17 1 respectively the provided irrigation water came from a groundwater well for the five seasons the following parameters were found on average electrical conductivity of 0 74 ds m 1 9 3 mg l 1 no3 67 7 mg l 1 cl and 46 2 mg l 1 na and ph of 7 3 the climate in this area is mediterranean with warm dry summers and mild rainy winters the annual average reference evapotranspiration et0 estimated with the penman monteith equation in the version modified by the fao allen et al 1998 and precipitation p in the area were respectively 1383 and 271 mm data were obtained from an automatic weather station located near the orchard that belongs to the sistema de información agroclimática para el regadío siar of the spanish ministry of agriculture the station is placed on a grassy surface according to the recommendations of the world meteorological organization the national institute of meteorology the food and agriculture organization fao and the american society of agricultural engineers asae the irrigation system included automatic control valves an irrigation controller and flow metres to monitor irrigation volumes in each treatment water was supplied by one drip line with 2 5 self compensating drippers 4 5 l h 1 per tree the mean annual amount of fertilisers applied by the irrigation system from may to september was 70 kg ha 1 n and 100 kg ha 1 k2o p2o5 was not necessary because its amount in soil sufficed to cover crop phosphorous needs trees were mechanically pruned annually by limiting height and width development and by not allowing branches to grow longer than 2 6 m high other agricultural practices were those often used by growers in the area 2 2 irrigation strategies four irrigation treatments control three rdi strategies were tested during five consecutive seasons rdi treatments have been defined to better distribute fixed irrigation doses of 350 250 and 150 mm year 1 the smallest water volumes were applied especially in phase ii of fruit growth by saving water to provide higher irrigation doses during the most critical crop periods irrigation timing is detailed in fig 1 i control treatment irrigated at 100 of etc throughout the season total irrigation amount ia approx 450 mm year 1 ii moderate rdi strategy rdi1 irrigated at 100 etc except during period 2 in phase ii of fruit growth from approximately mid july to mid september when pit hardening occurred by applying 40 etc ia approx 350 mm year 1 iii moderate severe rdi strategy rdi2 irrigated at 100 etc except during period 1 from pruning in february to phase ii of fruit growth irrigated at 50 etc and period 2 irrigated at 40 etc ia approx 250 mm year 1 iv severe rdi strategy rdi3 irrigated at 30 etc during period 1 at 25 etc during period 2 and at 60 etc during period 3 from mid september in phase iii of fruit growth to pruning ia approx 150 mm year 1 irrigation scheduling was based on the etc estimated by the single crop coefficient kc approach and et0 allen et al 1998 a kc of 0 39 was established by adjusting the 0 70 fixed coefficient obtained by goldhamer et al 1994 and girona et al 2002 with the correction proposed by fereres and castel 1981 which takes into account the surface covered by the olive orchard and thus adapts the calculation of irrigation needs to tree development in plots kc came very close to not only the lower limit established by rallo et al 2021 for super intensive olives kc 0 40 but also to the coefficient used by siakou et al 2021 kc 0 37 for traditional olive orchards the four irrigation treatments were replicated 5 times 20 subplots and set according to a complete randomised block design as the experimental plot did not allow the inclusion of guard rows one trench on each side of tree rows was excavated to avoid root invasion between treatments each subplot consisted in a tree row with 100 trees 2 3 measurements plant water status was determined by the midday stem water potential measurements ψstem taken at three representative time points arrows in fig 1 at the end of period 1 mid july at the halfway point mid august and at the end of period 2 mid september measurements were taken at midday 12 00 14 00 with a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa on two mature leaves from the outer canopy with 10 trees per treatment 2 trees per subplot two shoots with fully expanded leaves were enclosed in an aluminium bag for at least 1 h before measurements were taken olive and oil virgin olive oil yields were determined upon commercial harvest in all the irrigation treatments in 100 trees per subplot harvest is annually performed with an olive harvester new holland braud 9090x in november immediately after harvesting 1 kg of fruit samples per subplot was taken to determine the average fruit weight and oil content by the nmr method using 50 fruit per sample del rio and romero 1999 the number of fruit was estimated as the ratio between the average olive yield per tree and the average fruit weight fruit water content was determined by drying 10 fruit in an oven at 70 c olive and oil irrigation water productivity iwpolive and iwpoil kg m 3 were calculated as the ratio between olive and oil yields and the applied annual irrigation volume pereira et al 2012 alternate bearing crop yield behaviour was evaluated by the coefficient proposed by hoblyn et al 1937 the alternate bearing index abi was calculated according to the equation 1 abi t 2 n y t y t 1 y t y t 1 n 1 where the abi equals the sum of the absolute value of the difference in yields between two successive years t and t 1 scaled by the sum of the yields over these two years this is standardised over the total number of years within the time series n minus 1 the abi varies between 0 and 1 with abi 1 corresponding to strict alternate bearing behaviour vegetative development was determined by controlling the annual pruning weight and the trunk transverse cross sectional area tcsa cm2 at the end of each annual crop cycle in 10 trees per subplot one trunk perimeter measurement per tree was taken 20 cm above the ground the absolute growth rate of the tcsa agrtcsa was calculated by the equation 2 agr tcsa m 2 m 1 t 2 t 1 where m is the tcsa value cm2 measured at t 1 and t 2 and t is the time between seasons years yield efficiency ye kg cm 2 was calculated as the olive yield kg tree 1 to tcsa cm2 tree 1 ratio while resource distribution was calculated as the olive yield to agrtcsa ratio as suggested by ebel et al 1995 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to a one way analysis of variance anova statgraphics centurion xvi statistical package statistical graphics corp hendon va usa when statistically significant differences were found p 0 05 means were compared by the fisher s least significant difference lsd test 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and seasonal irrigation volumes the average annual et0 and precipitation recorded during the five study seasons were 1371 and 270 mm respectively table 2 the estimated precipitation taken to be effective usda soil conservation service 1993 was no more than 118 mm which highlights the scarce relevance of rainfall on water contributions to crops the average precipitation distribution was similar during the five seasons with larger amounts during periods 1 and 3 however differences in rainfall distribution and intensity during the final period of phase ii of fruit growth mid september should be highlighted for their influence on plant water status after summer restrictions the precipitations in 2015 2017 and 2018 were 40 mm 25 mm and 26 mm respectively which minimised the effect of the different irrigation restrictions on crops fig 2 in the control treatment the irrigation amount during the experimental period was around 444 mm year 1 table 2 a reduction of 100 mm in the treatment average was observed only in 2014 and was attributed to lack of data because the trial began in april that year the use of a fixed kc meant that theoretical crop water needs were proportional to the atmospheric demand throughout the year with monthly etc peaks of 84 mm in july and minimums of 16 mm in winter months the average water volume applied to treatments rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 were 345 236 and 161 mm year 1 which implies reductions to the control of 22 47 and 67 both respectively these lower irrigation volumes were achieved by applying the reductions proposed in the initial scheme fig 1 with slight variations deriving from irrigation management in treatment rdi1 the average reduction during period 2 was 41 in treatment rdi2 the average reductions during periods 1 and 2 were 52 and 40 respectively in treatment rd3 during periods 1 2 and 3 they were respectively 38 28 and 56 table 2 3 2 plant water status the different water volumes provided in each treatment had a significant effect on plant water status the control treatment obtained stable ψstem values throughout the evaluation period with an average value of 1 3 0 4 mpa fig 2 the lowest ψstem values were recorded in the years with a high yield load which corresponded to 2015 and 2017 henceforth the on years with average ψstem values of 1 6 mpa compared to 1 0 mpa values during the 2014 and 2016 low yield seasons henceforth the off years the measurements taken at the end of period 1 mid july showed different plant water statuses between treatments before the irrigation restrictions in phase ii began the control and rdi1 treatments which until that time had received 100 etc obtained similar ψstem values fig 2 treatments rdi2 and rdi3 to which different restrictions during the budding flowering phase i periods were applied had more negative ψstem values than the control treatment the significant differences between both treatments were recorded only in the on years and 2018 henceforth the medium year treatment rdi3 had the lowest values with 3 6 mpa 2 3 mpa and 3 0 mpa in 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 2 during the maximum restriction of the irrigation stage period 2 from mid july to mid september the ψstem values significantly lowered vs the control treatment in all the rdi treatments fig 2 at mid period 2 august plant water status was strongly influenced by the provided irrigation volume amount with maximum differences for ψstem between the control and rdi treatments this pattern was repeated for every growing season except for 2016 when light rains 8 mm before the measurement day of ψstem limited the stress level observed in the rdi treatments fig 2 the reduction in irrigation dose at 40 etc during period 2 analogously affected plant water status in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 in 2015 2016 and 2017 in turn significant differences in the ψstem values were observed in 2014 and 2018 between rdi1 and rdi2 and these values in the treatment rdi2 trees were lower in 2014 and higher in 2018 compared to treatment rdi1 the severest stress levels reached in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 were observed in 2015 and 2017 with ψstem values around 3 0 mpa and 3 3 mpa respectively in 2015 and 2017 fig 2 lastly the most marked irrigation restriction during period 2 was applied to the rdi3 treatment trees irrigated at 25 etc the ψstem values in the rdi3 trees were 3 9 mpa in august 2015 and 4 1 mpa in 2017 and water stress levels were significantly lower than for the other treatments when the applied irrigation restriction ended during period 2 mid september crop water status was strongly influenced by september rains in 2015 2017 and 2018 these rains resulted in partial in 2015 and 2017 and total only in 2018 plant water status recoveries in all the rdi treatments fig 2 in 2014 the ψstem values showed complete plant water status recovery in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 similarly to the control with the partial recovery of treatment rdi3 in relation to the measurements taken in august and also despite the shortage of rain during this period however the maximum water stress level was recorded in september 2016 in treatments rdi with ψstem values of 2 2 mpa in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 and 2 9 mpa in treatment rdi3 hernandez santana et al 2017 3 3 yield response interannual yield variability was high during the trial period 2014 2018 the abi value for the control treatment was 0 81 which indicates a high degree of alternate bearing the result reflected the variable fruit load recorded each season throughout the trial in absolute terms the off years 2014 and 2016 had low yields as opposed to the outstanding high production yield in the on years 2015 and 2017 table 3 an average 20 yield difference was obtained between the on years which could be partly due to the drop in the 2015 yield after intense freezing 5 9 c which occurred on 24 november during fruit ripening this episode dehydrated fruit and hindered their adequate ripening adopting rdi strategies did not modify the alternate bearing level obtained in the fully irrigated trees the abi values of the rdi treatments were 0 84 0 82 and 0 80 for treatments rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 respectively which were similar to the control p value 0 28 the total olive yield response over the 5 study years was strongly marked by the on years and olive production proportionally lowered with the applied irrigation reduction this effect was clearly observed in the on years when the rdi treatments yield gradually lowered as irrigation volumes dropped table 3 the maximum differences were found between the control and rdi3 treatments where the irrigation reduction produced the most marked drop in yield with around 32 and 38 in 2015 and 2017 respectively table 3 however in the off years the impact of the rdi strategies was practically null no clear pattern appeared from what occurred in 2014 when the greatest yield was obtained in the control treatment and also in 2016 in the trees of treatments rdi2 and rdi3 in 2018 yield seemed to break away from this variety s alternate bearing trend because an intermediate yield was obtained between the on and off years nevertheless the average control trees yield was 60 lower than in the on years during this medium season the effect of rdi treatments was milder on olive yield compared to the on years in this case olive yield slightly decreased in treatment rdi1 19 versus the control treatment with the greatest reduction in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 table 3 the total oil yield differed from the observed olive yield trend with a milder impact for irrigation dose reduction table 3 the oil yield of treatment rdi1 was similar to the control treatment and lowered only 9 and 27 in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 respectively the impact of the rdi strategies was also marked by the fruit load level with a clear effect in the on and medium years 2015 2017 and 2018 while the effect observed in 2014 and 2016 could not be attributed to irrigation treatments in the on years the oil yield of the rdi1 treatment was similar to the control whereas oil yield significant lowered only in treatment rdi3 9 3 in 2015 and in treatments rdi2 14 2 and rdi3 32 3 in 2017 table 3 in 2018 the impact of rdi treatments was similar to that of the on seasons with treatment rdi1 showing a similar oil yield to that of the control along with a gradual decrease in line with the irrigation reduction in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 the total fruit load decreased with the reduction in the irrigation water applied to the rdi treatments table 3 there was only a significant reduction in the number of fruit on the trees from rdi2 17 and rdi3 25 no statistical differences were found between treatments irrigated above 350 mm in the on years 2015 and 2017 the trend was analogous and the number of fruit in rdi1 was similar to the control however the rdi2 and rdi3 treatments showed a significant reduction in fruit load compared to the control treatment this reduction was significantly greater in rdi3 in 2015 the average fruit weight recorded during the five seasons was similar in all the treatments however in the on years fruit weight lowered in all the deficit treatments although significant differences in relation to the control were found only in 2015 in rdi3 and in 2017 in rdi1 and rdi3 for both seasons there were no differences between rdi1 and rdi2 the average fruit weight was higher in the off years 2014 and 2016 with no differences between treatments the average fruit water content lowered in the fruit of the rdi treatments table 3 the impact of rdi treatments was stronger on the on years 2015 and 2017 with lower values for the rdi3 treatment fruit in 2016 off year the fruit water content of treatment rdi3 was also significantly lower than in the other treatments the average 2014 2018 oil content obtained for fresh weight increased in the rdi treatments especially in the on years table 3 in 2015 oil content gradually increased with irrigation reduction with the highest values obtained in treatment rdi3 however in 2017 this trend was not as clearly observed as in 2015 oil content rose in all the rdi treatments with the only significant difference in treatment rdi1 compared to the control the average 2014 2018 oil content obtained for dry weight was similar in all the evaluated irrigation treatments however it is worth highlighting the increased oil content for dry weight observed in treatment rdi2 in 2015 and 2018 3 4 vegetative development and resource distribution the vegetative growth evaluated in pruning weight terms that accumulated during each season progressively reduced in accordance with the irrigation regime table 4 in 2014 and 2015 no significant differences between irrigation treatments were observed in 2016 pruning weight significantly reduced in all the rdi treatments versus the control treatment with the lowest values for treatments rdi2 and rdi3 table 4 in 2017 and 2018 the pruning weight of treatment rdi1 was similar to the control but decreased in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 the agrtcsa from the entire trial period 2014 2018 displayed a clear effect of the applied irrigation strategies table 4 the agrtcsa values lowered in all the rdi treatments compared to the control with the lowest values for the rdi2 and rdi3 trees likewise agrtcsa was strongly influenced by tree fruit load with a higher agrtcsa value in the off years than in the on ones in 2014 2016 and 2018 agrtcsa decreased in all the rdi treatments vs the control in 2016 the influence of irrigation dose reduction was more evident in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 which obtained significantly lower values the applied irrigation strategies barely altered agrtcsa in the on years a decrease in agrtcsa was observed only in 2015 for the treatment rdi3 trees yield efficiency ye decreased as the annual irrigation dose applied did table 4 in 2015 ye lowered in all the rdi treatments compared to the control with a similar reduction in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 10 less the lowest values 30 less were for treatment rdi3 in 2017 the ye of treatments rdi1 and rdi2 obtained similar values to those of the control but lowered in treatment rdi3 in 2018 with an intermediate fruit load medium an analogous response was observed to 2015 in this case however both the absolute and relative values were lower between treatments the effect of rdi treatments on the productive and vegetative resources pattern distribution was evaluated by analysing variations in the ratio between yield and agrtcsa resource distribution ratio table 4 in the on years the resource distribution ratio showed higher values especially in 2017 than in the off years this indicates that the resources redistribution prioritised resources to fruit production in the on years as opposed to vegetative growth the application of rdi strategies altered the plant resource balance table 4 by analysing the average values from the 2014 2018 experimental period the rd ratio rose in relation to the control in all the rdi treatments which highlights the highest values obtained in treatment rdi2 these results indicated that the rdi strategies altered resources distribution in plants by prioritising productive resources compared to vegetative ones however this response was not generalised throughout the trial in the on years the resource distribution ratio dropped due to the lower irrigation dose in treatment rdi2 in 2015 and 2017 and in treatment rdi3 in 2017 with a stronger irrigation treatment effect on yield compared to vegetative development in the off years the resource distribution ratio significantly increased in the treatments with a greater water restriction namely rdi2 and rdi3 in 2018 with a heavier fruit load an increase occurred only in treatment rdi1 while similar values to the control were found for the other treatments in these cases the higher resource distribution ratio was due to the milder irrigation reduction impact on yield than vegetative growth 3 5 crop water productivity the average iwp of olive and oil 2014 2018 increased as irrigation dose lowered and both parameters obtained significantly higher values in treatment rdi3 table 5 the effect of the rdi strategies on iwpolive and iwpoil was more evident in the on years with significant differences between irrigation treatments the highest iwpolive values were obtained in the on years for treatment rdi3 with 6 63 kg m 3 and 6 75 kg m 3 in 2015 and 2017 respectively these values almost doubled the values obtained by the control treatment however the impact of the rdi strategies was lower in the medium and off years in 2016 iwpolive increased only in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 while no changes were observed between irrigation treatments in 2014 and 2018 the obtained iwpoil values were similar to iwpolive with the highest values for treatment rdi3 in the on years 1 37 kg m 3 in 2015 and 1 05 kg m 3 in 2017 in the off years the effect of treatments rdi on iwpoil was mild with an increase only for rdi2 and rdi3 in 2016 in 2018 iwpoil slightly increased in all the rdi treatments with the highest values for treatment rdi2 in order to evaluate the global response against the different water provisions analysed during the experimental period 2014 2018 correlations were found between the main evaluated agronomic parameters and the average annual values of the water applied in each irrigation strategy fig 3 the average olive yield increased proportionally to the applied irrigation dose within the studied irrigation doses range 150 450 mm year 1 fig 3a oil yield increased proportionally to the applied irrigation dose but only within the 150 300 mm year 1 range while the maximum oil yield was 4 3 kg tree 1 this value remained above 350 mm year 1 for irrigation doses fig 3b agrtcsa increased proportionally to the irrigation dose within an interval ranging from 150 to 350 mm year 1 and with more pronounced growth for the irrigation volumes over 350 mm year 1 fig 3c 4 discussion the aim of the present study was to not only attempt to optimise the use of water resources but to also provide management guidelines that can be adapted to various scarcity scenarios to achieve sustainable olive and oil production thus different levels of irrigation restrictions were combined based on rdi strategies which achieved water savings between 22 and 64 table 2 quite often the only alternative available is to manage undersupplied irrigation schemes which involves adequately defining how and when restrictions must be applied in olive crops the continued water restrictions which implied progressive water stress throughout the season sustained deficit irrigation compared to water stress that concentrates in summer rdi did not tend to have an additional negative effect on yield moriana et al 2003 this means that decreased production was expected to be attributed only to a reduction in irrigation volume and not to the application period in any case the irrigation strategies herein applied were designed so that the maximum restrictions periods in each treatment would coincide with the periods when a crop would better tolerate water stress tovar et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 the period chosen to apply maximum restrictions was mid july to mid september which is phase ii of fruit growth approximately 1 month before that applied by fernández et al 2013 the application of different irrigation doses before the main water restriction in phase ii provided evidence for the different water statuses of the most irrigated control and rdi1 and least irrigated rdi2 and rdi3 plants which were accentuated in the months with the most water requirements july and august fig 2 both the irrigation dose and plant water status reached during phase i of fruit growth seemed to be determining factors on the final fruit load and consequently on olive yield the control and rdi1 treatments irrigated at 100 of etc from the beginning of the season to mid july did not overcome the threshold ψstem value of 3 5 mpa during the flowering and fruit setting periods which has been previously set for optimum yields in arbequina marra et al 2016 marino et al 2018 nevertheless the ψstem values obtained in rdi2 and rdi3 during this period led to reduce fruit number similarly in barnea and askal cultivars in israel and ahumada orellana et al 2017 in arbequina in chile ben gal et al 2021 established an rdi strategy based on dynamic ψstem thresholds ranging from 3 to 3 5 mpa during pit hardening and achieved the highest water productivity by reducing irrigation doses without affecting yields plant water status was also clearly conditioned by fruit load in the off years lack of fruit decreased the demand for photoassimilates which in turn led to stomatal closure due to a higher co2 concentration in mesophyll cells to thus lower transpiration and improve plant water status morison 1987 this could explain why in only the off years the ψstem values of the control trees continued to exceed the 1 4 mpa threshold fig 2 set for fully irrigated olive trees moriana et al 2012 however in the on years 2015 and 2017 the ψstem values were lower but did not quite reach 2 2 mpa the threshold value established for obtaining the highest yield hueso et al 2019a 2019b in general terms ψstem values around 2 0 mpa during the oil synthesis period could be considered the maximum reference value for well irrigated trees at full production capacity under these semi arid conditions olive yield showed a positive response to irrigation dose with good yields obtained with the higher provided irrigation doses this was why the application of restrictions reduced the average yields vs the control by 11 21 and 36 in rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 respectively table 3 the effect of water restriction was also reflected in the average fruit weight rdi1 with a similar number of fruit as the control treatment but irrigated at 40 etc in phase ii of fruit growth displayed a lighter average fruit weight because the high transpiration rates linked with high fruit load were not met bustan et al 2016 the irrigation treatments irrigated below 250 mm with a lighter crop load than rdi1 showed a statistical reduction only in average fruit weight terms for rdi3 in 2017 oil yield was less sensitive than olive yield with the applied water restrictions a similar trend was obtained by vita serman et al 2021 in a high density arbequina olive orchard located in northwest argentina their results showed that water restriction had a stronger impact on olive yield than on oil yield in our case the oil yield obtained in strategy rdi1 was similar to that of the fully irrigated trees and lowered by 9 and 27 in strategies rdi2 and rdi3 respectively table 3 these results indicate that the water stress level obtained by applying rdi1 was not enough to make the oil synthesis rate worse however strategy rdi3 resulted in severer water stress situations which not only went over the critical limit of ψstem 3 5 mpa fig 2 but also led to lower olive and oil yields specifically in 2017 with a 62 reduction in irrigation dose compared to the fully irrigated trees oil yield lowered only by 38 table 3 these results are comparable to those reported by fernández et al 2013 in a commercial shd arbequina olive orchard where a drop in oil yield of only 26 was noted with 72 water savings when restricting the irrigation volume in the least restrictive strategy rdi1 the decreased olive yield and the maintained oil yield proved that oil production was less sensitive than olive production when faced with moderate water stress hueso et al 2019a indeed our results evidenced that the different behaviour between olive and oil yields in treatment rdi1 was due mainly to reduced fruit water content because oil content on dry weight and number of fruit were similar to those of the control table 3 the water applied restrictions had a positive effect on oil content on fresh weight in all the evaluated rdi strategies table 3 the increased oil content in the deficit irrigated treatments was due to lower fruit water content table 3 these results agree with those obtained by berenguer et al 2006 and marra et al 2016 during trials with arbequina olive trees grown in an shd orchard in each case the oil content of fresh matter significantly exceeded the rdi treatment compared to that obtained in fully irrigated trees according to previous studies girona et al 2002 berenguer et al 2006 these rdi strategies can imply improved oil yield because attaining a high percentage of extracted oil over the total fats contained in fruit is more difficult when fruit water content increases due to irrigation the application of the different irrigation restrictions based on rdi strategies also had a marked regulating effect on shd trees vegetative development especially in the treatments with severer irrigation dose restrictions table 4 indeed the impact of the applied water stress was stronger on vegetative development than the yield parameters which resulted in plant resources redistribution to favour olive yield table 4 other authors have obtained similar results with the same growing system which suggests employing 30 and 45 reductions over the theoretical needs as a tool to reduce excessive tree vigour hernandez santana et al 2017 nevertheless it should be noted that the continued use of this irrigation strategy could limit potential crop yields in fact in the rdi3 strategy trees the high degree of accumulated water stress which continued year after year considerably limited vegetative development this could have restricted their productive capacity as indicated by decreased yield efficiency especially in the last two study years table 4 this should be contemplated when utilising deficit irrigation strategies in young orchards as plant growth and their entry in production could be delayed pérez lópez et al 2007 caruso et al 2013 vegetative development was also influenced by this olive variety s marked alternate bearing greater vegetative growth was observed only in the off years with an increased irrigation water volume however in the on years the effect of irrigation on vegetative growth and oil production was limited and differences were observed only in olive yield tables 3 and 4 these data underline the need to adapt irrigation dose to fruit load to optimise vegetative and fruit growth without affecting oil yield in light of these results strategies rdi1 and rdi2 seem more equilibrated options both rdi strategies reduced irrigation dose by 22 and 46 respectively and maintained oil production by limiting excessive vegetative growth and reducing pruning costs the application of rdi strategies to shd olive trees increased the olive and oil iwps this improvement was greater as the applied irrigation dose lowered table 5 the highest iwpolive was obtained in the most restrictive irrigation strategy 150 mm year 1 rdi3 the iwpolive values obtained by strategy rdi3 in the on years 6 6 kg m 3 in 2015 and 6 7 kg m 3 in 2017 were similar to the average values of 6 6 kg m 3 reported by tognetti et al 2007 at a similar restricted irrigation dose 100 mm year 1 the average annual precipitation of 500 mm in a high density olive orchard 555 trees ha 1 in another study carried out in an shd arbequina olive orchard 1667 trees ha 1 iwpolive was also similar to our values but no differences were found between rdi treatments padilla díaz et al 2018 however other authors have reported higher iwpolive values including the full irrigated strategy that ranged between 4 1 and 8 6 kg m 3 fernández et al 2013 all the evaluated rdi strategies increased iwpoil especially in the on years table 5 compared to other studies the iwpoil values obtained in the control and rdi3 treatments were similar to those reported by iniesta et al 2009 for a deficit irrigation trial in a high density arbequina olive orchard 408 trees ha 1 in their study oil yield was about 20 higher than in our study as irrigation restrictions were greater than the dose applied in our control treatment with a 73 reduction vs the maximum 64 reduction herein achieved with treatment rdi3 table 2 in another study that worked with shd barnea and askal olive orchards 350 trees ha 1 only the most restrictive strategy with 44 reduction in irrigation dose significantly increased iwpoil ben gal et al 2021 all these results suggest that applying rdi strategies even without having to manage irrigation provisions below 100 etc could imply improve shd olive orchard productivity the average values obtained during the five study seasons indicated that the highest olive yield was obtained without applying irrigation restrictions and oil production was maximised with an irrigation dose between 350 and 400 mm year 1 fig 3b reducing the irrigation dose could be a useful tool to regulate the excess of vigour of fully irrigated trees in our case trunk growth seemed proportional to the applied irrigation volume which underwent exponential growth when the irrigation dose exceeded 350 mm year 1 fig 3c although these results seem to indicate that the strategies with restrictions are the most profitable ones for growers a choice should be made after performing an economic analysis that takes into account the price of water and the payment type olive or oil received by growers with this balance other factors like vegetation management should be considered as the vegetative response differs depending on the applied irrigation water volume it is also necessary to maintain a limited tree canopy in shd orchards to allow the use of harvesting machines the greatest development deriving from greater water provision implies intenser and more costly pruning interventions excess vigour may also lead to a higher incidence of plagues and reduced production because of lack of light on productive branches future studies should optimise economic water productivity ewp m 3 fernández et al 2020 to attain the most profitability from orchards according to the limits imposed by available water provisions 5 conclusions applying different rdi strategies agrees with possible water scarcity scenarios and provides reproducible guidelines for similar efficient irrigation conditions in shd olive orchards our results reveal that it is crucial to adapt restrictions in both quantity and period terms to the crop phenological phases and weather conditions of a given area the provided different irrigation volumes directly affect plant water status yield and vegetative development to generally minimise a drop in yield due to deficit irrigation the ψstem threshold in phase ii could be established between a minimum of 2 0 and 3 5 mpa in productive terms fully irrigated trees 450 mm year 1 obtain the highest olive yield however according to our results we recommend following the guidelines for adopting strategy rdi1 350 mm year 1 as this poses considerable

9678,the cultivation of super high density shd olive orchards in the mediterranean basin usually faces drought events due especially to low precipitation high temperature and solar radiation in summer hence regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies can be a useful tool for irrigation management to limit yield loss therefore this work aimed to find the most suitable rdi strategy by placing special emphasis on phase ii of fruit growth for shd olive orchards irrigated below theoretical water requirements four irrigation strategies were defined according to different water availability scenarios fully irrigated rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 scaled to respectively supply 450 350 250 and 150 mm year 1 tree water relations trunk growth fruit and oil yields were evaluated the study was carried out for 5 years in an arbequina commercial orchard 1667 trees ha 1 in villena alicante spain the main results showed that arbequina tree irrigation water productivity both olive and oil gradually increased as irrigation dose lowered olive yield depended heavily on the applied irrigation dose with the highest olive yield for the control trees however the oil yield in the rdi1 trees was similar to that of the control trees but strategies rdi2 and rdi3 reduced yield all the rdi strategies diminished vegetative development and rdi2 was the most efficient strategy for resource distribution olive yield vs vegetative growth therefore based on oil production vegetative growth and irrigation water savings rdi1 was the most recommendable irrigation strategy for the arbequina olive trees cultivated in shd under semi arid mediterranean conditions keywords plant water status olive oil yield water productivity vegetative development 1 introduction the olive olea europaea l cultivated area has gradually increased in recent decades especially in mediterranean countries with 80 of global olive production spain has the biggest surface area used for olive oil in the world whose production accounts for approximately 60 in the eu and 45 in the world mapa 2021 in the 1990 s super high density shd olive orchards 1500 2200 trees ha 1 used to maximise olive production and increase orchards profitability by mechanised harvesting became common connor et al 2014 rius and lacarte 2010 these orchards are characterised by tree bush shaping with a single north south oriented axis and tree spacing less than 4 m 2 m tous et al 2007 shd olive orchards offer an investment time short return between years 3 and 6 when olive production can range from 8000 to 13000 kg ha 1 tous et al 2006 vegetation management through pruning is one of the critical aspects of these plantations because excess vigour in these plants can result in smaller size and lower fruit yield larbi et al 2011 tous et al 2006 this type of orchards with high tree density has more water requirements than traditional olive orchards when water resource are limited the application of regulated deficit irrigation rdi defined as the systematic reduction of applied water than the theoretically needed amount can result in improved irrigation water productivity iwp ruiz sánchez et al 2010 this technique consists in irrigating below theoretical needs during a period when plant sensitivity to water stress is low gómez del campo 2013 this period must be correctly defined for each species because inadequate water status can negatively impact crop development and production in olive trees inadequate water status from march to june reduces the number of flowers per inflorescence and their fertility which subsequently leads to decreased fruit load on trees orgaz and fereres 2004 another critical period goes from mid september to mid november when oil accumulates during this period severe water stress can negatively affect oil content beede and goldhamer 1994 although the scientific community has reached no clear consensus about the most suitable period for applying irrigation water restrictions gómez del campo 2011 gucci et al 2007 fernández et al 2013 it would seem that negative effects are minimised in phase ii of fruit growth that is between pit hardening and fruit ripening onset tovar et al 2002 goldhamer 1999 however major discrepancies also arise about the irrigation reduction level in shd olive irrigation studies table 1 in a previous study pérez rodríguez et al 2016 maintained similar olive and oil yields to fully irrigated trees by applying 35 reduction to irrigation needs during the period after fruit set and before oil accumulation started in another study fernández et al 2013 determined that the best balance for vigour water savings and oil production could be achieved with a 70 reduction in crop water needs applied from the end of the first fruit development phase to ripening at approximately mid september gómez del campo 2011 report no oil yield reductions after applying 30 irrigation restriction to crop water needs immediately after fruit drop which continued until the end of july however as all these irrigation restrictions start from non limiting irrigation doses the direct extrapolation of water saving percentages to other regions with limited water resources may not be suitable this work aimed to redesign rdi strategies based on applying irrigation restrictions mainly in phase ii of fruit growth for shd olive orchards irrigated below theoretical water requirements to maximise irrigation water productivity in doing so it evaluated the adoption of three rdi strategies based on different water limitation scenarios crop water status vegetative development and also on olive and oil yields 2 material and methods 2 1 orchard characteristics this study was carried out from 2014 to 2018 in a commercial shd olive orchard planted with cv arbequina located in villena 38 35 n 0 52 w 499 m a m s l alicante spain trees were 13 years old at the beginning of the experiment tree spacing was 4 0 m 1 5 m 1667 trees ha 1 soil had a clay loam texture 29 sand 28 clay 43 silt and moderate bulk density 1 69 g cm 3 that could limit root growth according to the usda natural resources conservation service soil organic matter content was very low with an average of 0 3 according to the soil water characteristics program developed by saxton and rawls usda soil water content at field capacity and wilting point was 30 3 and 17 1 respectively the provided irrigation water came from a groundwater well for the five seasons the following parameters were found on average electrical conductivity of 0 74 ds m 1 9 3 mg l 1 no3 67 7 mg l 1 cl and 46 2 mg l 1 na and ph of 7 3 the climate in this area is mediterranean with warm dry summers and mild rainy winters the annual average reference evapotranspiration et0 estimated with the penman monteith equation in the version modified by the fao allen et al 1998 and precipitation p in the area were respectively 1383 and 271 mm data were obtained from an automatic weather station located near the orchard that belongs to the sistema de información agroclimática para el regadío siar of the spanish ministry of agriculture the station is placed on a grassy surface according to the recommendations of the world meteorological organization the national institute of meteorology the food and agriculture organization fao and the american society of agricultural engineers asae the irrigation system included automatic control valves an irrigation controller and flow metres to monitor irrigation volumes in each treatment water was supplied by one drip line with 2 5 self compensating drippers 4 5 l h 1 per tree the mean annual amount of fertilisers applied by the irrigation system from may to september was 70 kg ha 1 n and 100 kg ha 1 k2o p2o5 was not necessary because its amount in soil sufficed to cover crop phosphorous needs trees were mechanically pruned annually by limiting height and width development and by not allowing branches to grow longer than 2 6 m high other agricultural practices were those often used by growers in the area 2 2 irrigation strategies four irrigation treatments control three rdi strategies were tested during five consecutive seasons rdi treatments have been defined to better distribute fixed irrigation doses of 350 250 and 150 mm year 1 the smallest water volumes were applied especially in phase ii of fruit growth by saving water to provide higher irrigation doses during the most critical crop periods irrigation timing is detailed in fig 1 i control treatment irrigated at 100 of etc throughout the season total irrigation amount ia approx 450 mm year 1 ii moderate rdi strategy rdi1 irrigated at 100 etc except during period 2 in phase ii of fruit growth from approximately mid july to mid september when pit hardening occurred by applying 40 etc ia approx 350 mm year 1 iii moderate severe rdi strategy rdi2 irrigated at 100 etc except during period 1 from pruning in february to phase ii of fruit growth irrigated at 50 etc and period 2 irrigated at 40 etc ia approx 250 mm year 1 iv severe rdi strategy rdi3 irrigated at 30 etc during period 1 at 25 etc during period 2 and at 60 etc during period 3 from mid september in phase iii of fruit growth to pruning ia approx 150 mm year 1 irrigation scheduling was based on the etc estimated by the single crop coefficient kc approach and et0 allen et al 1998 a kc of 0 39 was established by adjusting the 0 70 fixed coefficient obtained by goldhamer et al 1994 and girona et al 2002 with the correction proposed by fereres and castel 1981 which takes into account the surface covered by the olive orchard and thus adapts the calculation of irrigation needs to tree development in plots kc came very close to not only the lower limit established by rallo et al 2021 for super intensive olives kc 0 40 but also to the coefficient used by siakou et al 2021 kc 0 37 for traditional olive orchards the four irrigation treatments were replicated 5 times 20 subplots and set according to a complete randomised block design as the experimental plot did not allow the inclusion of guard rows one trench on each side of tree rows was excavated to avoid root invasion between treatments each subplot consisted in a tree row with 100 trees 2 3 measurements plant water status was determined by the midday stem water potential measurements ψstem taken at three representative time points arrows in fig 1 at the end of period 1 mid july at the halfway point mid august and at the end of period 2 mid september measurements were taken at midday 12 00 14 00 with a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument co usa on two mature leaves from the outer canopy with 10 trees per treatment 2 trees per subplot two shoots with fully expanded leaves were enclosed in an aluminium bag for at least 1 h before measurements were taken olive and oil virgin olive oil yields were determined upon commercial harvest in all the irrigation treatments in 100 trees per subplot harvest is annually performed with an olive harvester new holland braud 9090x in november immediately after harvesting 1 kg of fruit samples per subplot was taken to determine the average fruit weight and oil content by the nmr method using 50 fruit per sample del rio and romero 1999 the number of fruit was estimated as the ratio between the average olive yield per tree and the average fruit weight fruit water content was determined by drying 10 fruit in an oven at 70 c olive and oil irrigation water productivity iwpolive and iwpoil kg m 3 were calculated as the ratio between olive and oil yields and the applied annual irrigation volume pereira et al 2012 alternate bearing crop yield behaviour was evaluated by the coefficient proposed by hoblyn et al 1937 the alternate bearing index abi was calculated according to the equation 1 abi t 2 n y t y t 1 y t y t 1 n 1 where the abi equals the sum of the absolute value of the difference in yields between two successive years t and t 1 scaled by the sum of the yields over these two years this is standardised over the total number of years within the time series n minus 1 the abi varies between 0 and 1 with abi 1 corresponding to strict alternate bearing behaviour vegetative development was determined by controlling the annual pruning weight and the trunk transverse cross sectional area tcsa cm2 at the end of each annual crop cycle in 10 trees per subplot one trunk perimeter measurement per tree was taken 20 cm above the ground the absolute growth rate of the tcsa agrtcsa was calculated by the equation 2 agr tcsa m 2 m 1 t 2 t 1 where m is the tcsa value cm2 measured at t 1 and t 2 and t is the time between seasons years yield efficiency ye kg cm 2 was calculated as the olive yield kg tree 1 to tcsa cm2 tree 1 ratio while resource distribution was calculated as the olive yield to agrtcsa ratio as suggested by ebel et al 1995 2 4 statistical analysis data were subjected to a one way analysis of variance anova statgraphics centurion xvi statistical package statistical graphics corp hendon va usa when statistically significant differences were found p 0 05 means were compared by the fisher s least significant difference lsd test 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and seasonal irrigation volumes the average annual et0 and precipitation recorded during the five study seasons were 1371 and 270 mm respectively table 2 the estimated precipitation taken to be effective usda soil conservation service 1993 was no more than 118 mm which highlights the scarce relevance of rainfall on water contributions to crops the average precipitation distribution was similar during the five seasons with larger amounts during periods 1 and 3 however differences in rainfall distribution and intensity during the final period of phase ii of fruit growth mid september should be highlighted for their influence on plant water status after summer restrictions the precipitations in 2015 2017 and 2018 were 40 mm 25 mm and 26 mm respectively which minimised the effect of the different irrigation restrictions on crops fig 2 in the control treatment the irrigation amount during the experimental period was around 444 mm year 1 table 2 a reduction of 100 mm in the treatment average was observed only in 2014 and was attributed to lack of data because the trial began in april that year the use of a fixed kc meant that theoretical crop water needs were proportional to the atmospheric demand throughout the year with monthly etc peaks of 84 mm in july and minimums of 16 mm in winter months the average water volume applied to treatments rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 were 345 236 and 161 mm year 1 which implies reductions to the control of 22 47 and 67 both respectively these lower irrigation volumes were achieved by applying the reductions proposed in the initial scheme fig 1 with slight variations deriving from irrigation management in treatment rdi1 the average reduction during period 2 was 41 in treatment rdi2 the average reductions during periods 1 and 2 were 52 and 40 respectively in treatment rd3 during periods 1 2 and 3 they were respectively 38 28 and 56 table 2 3 2 plant water status the different water volumes provided in each treatment had a significant effect on plant water status the control treatment obtained stable ψstem values throughout the evaluation period with an average value of 1 3 0 4 mpa fig 2 the lowest ψstem values were recorded in the years with a high yield load which corresponded to 2015 and 2017 henceforth the on years with average ψstem values of 1 6 mpa compared to 1 0 mpa values during the 2014 and 2016 low yield seasons henceforth the off years the measurements taken at the end of period 1 mid july showed different plant water statuses between treatments before the irrigation restrictions in phase ii began the control and rdi1 treatments which until that time had received 100 etc obtained similar ψstem values fig 2 treatments rdi2 and rdi3 to which different restrictions during the budding flowering phase i periods were applied had more negative ψstem values than the control treatment the significant differences between both treatments were recorded only in the on years and 2018 henceforth the medium year treatment rdi3 had the lowest values with 3 6 mpa 2 3 mpa and 3 0 mpa in 2015 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 2 during the maximum restriction of the irrigation stage period 2 from mid july to mid september the ψstem values significantly lowered vs the control treatment in all the rdi treatments fig 2 at mid period 2 august plant water status was strongly influenced by the provided irrigation volume amount with maximum differences for ψstem between the control and rdi treatments this pattern was repeated for every growing season except for 2016 when light rains 8 mm before the measurement day of ψstem limited the stress level observed in the rdi treatments fig 2 the reduction in irrigation dose at 40 etc during period 2 analogously affected plant water status in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 in 2015 2016 and 2017 in turn significant differences in the ψstem values were observed in 2014 and 2018 between rdi1 and rdi2 and these values in the treatment rdi2 trees were lower in 2014 and higher in 2018 compared to treatment rdi1 the severest stress levels reached in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 were observed in 2015 and 2017 with ψstem values around 3 0 mpa and 3 3 mpa respectively in 2015 and 2017 fig 2 lastly the most marked irrigation restriction during period 2 was applied to the rdi3 treatment trees irrigated at 25 etc the ψstem values in the rdi3 trees were 3 9 mpa in august 2015 and 4 1 mpa in 2017 and water stress levels were significantly lower than for the other treatments when the applied irrigation restriction ended during period 2 mid september crop water status was strongly influenced by september rains in 2015 2017 and 2018 these rains resulted in partial in 2015 and 2017 and total only in 2018 plant water status recoveries in all the rdi treatments fig 2 in 2014 the ψstem values showed complete plant water status recovery in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 similarly to the control with the partial recovery of treatment rdi3 in relation to the measurements taken in august and also despite the shortage of rain during this period however the maximum water stress level was recorded in september 2016 in treatments rdi with ψstem values of 2 2 mpa in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 and 2 9 mpa in treatment rdi3 hernandez santana et al 2017 3 3 yield response interannual yield variability was high during the trial period 2014 2018 the abi value for the control treatment was 0 81 which indicates a high degree of alternate bearing the result reflected the variable fruit load recorded each season throughout the trial in absolute terms the off years 2014 and 2016 had low yields as opposed to the outstanding high production yield in the on years 2015 and 2017 table 3 an average 20 yield difference was obtained between the on years which could be partly due to the drop in the 2015 yield after intense freezing 5 9 c which occurred on 24 november during fruit ripening this episode dehydrated fruit and hindered their adequate ripening adopting rdi strategies did not modify the alternate bearing level obtained in the fully irrigated trees the abi values of the rdi treatments were 0 84 0 82 and 0 80 for treatments rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 respectively which were similar to the control p value 0 28 the total olive yield response over the 5 study years was strongly marked by the on years and olive production proportionally lowered with the applied irrigation reduction this effect was clearly observed in the on years when the rdi treatments yield gradually lowered as irrigation volumes dropped table 3 the maximum differences were found between the control and rdi3 treatments where the irrigation reduction produced the most marked drop in yield with around 32 and 38 in 2015 and 2017 respectively table 3 however in the off years the impact of the rdi strategies was practically null no clear pattern appeared from what occurred in 2014 when the greatest yield was obtained in the control treatment and also in 2016 in the trees of treatments rdi2 and rdi3 in 2018 yield seemed to break away from this variety s alternate bearing trend because an intermediate yield was obtained between the on and off years nevertheless the average control trees yield was 60 lower than in the on years during this medium season the effect of rdi treatments was milder on olive yield compared to the on years in this case olive yield slightly decreased in treatment rdi1 19 versus the control treatment with the greatest reduction in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 table 3 the total oil yield differed from the observed olive yield trend with a milder impact for irrigation dose reduction table 3 the oil yield of treatment rdi1 was similar to the control treatment and lowered only 9 and 27 in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 respectively the impact of the rdi strategies was also marked by the fruit load level with a clear effect in the on and medium years 2015 2017 and 2018 while the effect observed in 2014 and 2016 could not be attributed to irrigation treatments in the on years the oil yield of the rdi1 treatment was similar to the control whereas oil yield significant lowered only in treatment rdi3 9 3 in 2015 and in treatments rdi2 14 2 and rdi3 32 3 in 2017 table 3 in 2018 the impact of rdi treatments was similar to that of the on seasons with treatment rdi1 showing a similar oil yield to that of the control along with a gradual decrease in line with the irrigation reduction in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 the total fruit load decreased with the reduction in the irrigation water applied to the rdi treatments table 3 there was only a significant reduction in the number of fruit on the trees from rdi2 17 and rdi3 25 no statistical differences were found between treatments irrigated above 350 mm in the on years 2015 and 2017 the trend was analogous and the number of fruit in rdi1 was similar to the control however the rdi2 and rdi3 treatments showed a significant reduction in fruit load compared to the control treatment this reduction was significantly greater in rdi3 in 2015 the average fruit weight recorded during the five seasons was similar in all the treatments however in the on years fruit weight lowered in all the deficit treatments although significant differences in relation to the control were found only in 2015 in rdi3 and in 2017 in rdi1 and rdi3 for both seasons there were no differences between rdi1 and rdi2 the average fruit weight was higher in the off years 2014 and 2016 with no differences between treatments the average fruit water content lowered in the fruit of the rdi treatments table 3 the impact of rdi treatments was stronger on the on years 2015 and 2017 with lower values for the rdi3 treatment fruit in 2016 off year the fruit water content of treatment rdi3 was also significantly lower than in the other treatments the average 2014 2018 oil content obtained for fresh weight increased in the rdi treatments especially in the on years table 3 in 2015 oil content gradually increased with irrigation reduction with the highest values obtained in treatment rdi3 however in 2017 this trend was not as clearly observed as in 2015 oil content rose in all the rdi treatments with the only significant difference in treatment rdi1 compared to the control the average 2014 2018 oil content obtained for dry weight was similar in all the evaluated irrigation treatments however it is worth highlighting the increased oil content for dry weight observed in treatment rdi2 in 2015 and 2018 3 4 vegetative development and resource distribution the vegetative growth evaluated in pruning weight terms that accumulated during each season progressively reduced in accordance with the irrigation regime table 4 in 2014 and 2015 no significant differences between irrigation treatments were observed in 2016 pruning weight significantly reduced in all the rdi treatments versus the control treatment with the lowest values for treatments rdi2 and rdi3 table 4 in 2017 and 2018 the pruning weight of treatment rdi1 was similar to the control but decreased in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 the agrtcsa from the entire trial period 2014 2018 displayed a clear effect of the applied irrigation strategies table 4 the agrtcsa values lowered in all the rdi treatments compared to the control with the lowest values for the rdi2 and rdi3 trees likewise agrtcsa was strongly influenced by tree fruit load with a higher agrtcsa value in the off years than in the on ones in 2014 2016 and 2018 agrtcsa decreased in all the rdi treatments vs the control in 2016 the influence of irrigation dose reduction was more evident in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 which obtained significantly lower values the applied irrigation strategies barely altered agrtcsa in the on years a decrease in agrtcsa was observed only in 2015 for the treatment rdi3 trees yield efficiency ye decreased as the annual irrigation dose applied did table 4 in 2015 ye lowered in all the rdi treatments compared to the control with a similar reduction in treatments rdi1 and rdi2 10 less the lowest values 30 less were for treatment rdi3 in 2017 the ye of treatments rdi1 and rdi2 obtained similar values to those of the control but lowered in treatment rdi3 in 2018 with an intermediate fruit load medium an analogous response was observed to 2015 in this case however both the absolute and relative values were lower between treatments the effect of rdi treatments on the productive and vegetative resources pattern distribution was evaluated by analysing variations in the ratio between yield and agrtcsa resource distribution ratio table 4 in the on years the resource distribution ratio showed higher values especially in 2017 than in the off years this indicates that the resources redistribution prioritised resources to fruit production in the on years as opposed to vegetative growth the application of rdi strategies altered the plant resource balance table 4 by analysing the average values from the 2014 2018 experimental period the rd ratio rose in relation to the control in all the rdi treatments which highlights the highest values obtained in treatment rdi2 these results indicated that the rdi strategies altered resources distribution in plants by prioritising productive resources compared to vegetative ones however this response was not generalised throughout the trial in the on years the resource distribution ratio dropped due to the lower irrigation dose in treatment rdi2 in 2015 and 2017 and in treatment rdi3 in 2017 with a stronger irrigation treatment effect on yield compared to vegetative development in the off years the resource distribution ratio significantly increased in the treatments with a greater water restriction namely rdi2 and rdi3 in 2018 with a heavier fruit load an increase occurred only in treatment rdi1 while similar values to the control were found for the other treatments in these cases the higher resource distribution ratio was due to the milder irrigation reduction impact on yield than vegetative growth 3 5 crop water productivity the average iwp of olive and oil 2014 2018 increased as irrigation dose lowered and both parameters obtained significantly higher values in treatment rdi3 table 5 the effect of the rdi strategies on iwpolive and iwpoil was more evident in the on years with significant differences between irrigation treatments the highest iwpolive values were obtained in the on years for treatment rdi3 with 6 63 kg m 3 and 6 75 kg m 3 in 2015 and 2017 respectively these values almost doubled the values obtained by the control treatment however the impact of the rdi strategies was lower in the medium and off years in 2016 iwpolive increased only in treatments rdi2 and rdi3 while no changes were observed between irrigation treatments in 2014 and 2018 the obtained iwpoil values were similar to iwpolive with the highest values for treatment rdi3 in the on years 1 37 kg m 3 in 2015 and 1 05 kg m 3 in 2017 in the off years the effect of treatments rdi on iwpoil was mild with an increase only for rdi2 and rdi3 in 2016 in 2018 iwpoil slightly increased in all the rdi treatments with the highest values for treatment rdi2 in order to evaluate the global response against the different water provisions analysed during the experimental period 2014 2018 correlations were found between the main evaluated agronomic parameters and the average annual values of the water applied in each irrigation strategy fig 3 the average olive yield increased proportionally to the applied irrigation dose within the studied irrigation doses range 150 450 mm year 1 fig 3a oil yield increased proportionally to the applied irrigation dose but only within the 150 300 mm year 1 range while the maximum oil yield was 4 3 kg tree 1 this value remained above 350 mm year 1 for irrigation doses fig 3b agrtcsa increased proportionally to the irrigation dose within an interval ranging from 150 to 350 mm year 1 and with more pronounced growth for the irrigation volumes over 350 mm year 1 fig 3c 4 discussion the aim of the present study was to not only attempt to optimise the use of water resources but to also provide management guidelines that can be adapted to various scarcity scenarios to achieve sustainable olive and oil production thus different levels of irrigation restrictions were combined based on rdi strategies which achieved water savings between 22 and 64 table 2 quite often the only alternative available is to manage undersupplied irrigation schemes which involves adequately defining how and when restrictions must be applied in olive crops the continued water restrictions which implied progressive water stress throughout the season sustained deficit irrigation compared to water stress that concentrates in summer rdi did not tend to have an additional negative effect on yield moriana et al 2003 this means that decreased production was expected to be attributed only to a reduction in irrigation volume and not to the application period in any case the irrigation strategies herein applied were designed so that the maximum restrictions periods in each treatment would coincide with the periods when a crop would better tolerate water stress tovar et al 2002 moriana et al 2003 the period chosen to apply maximum restrictions was mid july to mid september which is phase ii of fruit growth approximately 1 month before that applied by fernández et al 2013 the application of different irrigation doses before the main water restriction in phase ii provided evidence for the different water statuses of the most irrigated control and rdi1 and least irrigated rdi2 and rdi3 plants which were accentuated in the months with the most water requirements july and august fig 2 both the irrigation dose and plant water status reached during phase i of fruit growth seemed to be determining factors on the final fruit load and consequently on olive yield the control and rdi1 treatments irrigated at 100 of etc from the beginning of the season to mid july did not overcome the threshold ψstem value of 3 5 mpa during the flowering and fruit setting periods which has been previously set for optimum yields in arbequina marra et al 2016 marino et al 2018 nevertheless the ψstem values obtained in rdi2 and rdi3 during this period led to reduce fruit number similarly in barnea and askal cultivars in israel and ahumada orellana et al 2017 in arbequina in chile ben gal et al 2021 established an rdi strategy based on dynamic ψstem thresholds ranging from 3 to 3 5 mpa during pit hardening and achieved the highest water productivity by reducing irrigation doses without affecting yields plant water status was also clearly conditioned by fruit load in the off years lack of fruit decreased the demand for photoassimilates which in turn led to stomatal closure due to a higher co2 concentration in mesophyll cells to thus lower transpiration and improve plant water status morison 1987 this could explain why in only the off years the ψstem values of the control trees continued to exceed the 1 4 mpa threshold fig 2 set for fully irrigated olive trees moriana et al 2012 however in the on years 2015 and 2017 the ψstem values were lower but did not quite reach 2 2 mpa the threshold value established for obtaining the highest yield hueso et al 2019a 2019b in general terms ψstem values around 2 0 mpa during the oil synthesis period could be considered the maximum reference value for well irrigated trees at full production capacity under these semi arid conditions olive yield showed a positive response to irrigation dose with good yields obtained with the higher provided irrigation doses this was why the application of restrictions reduced the average yields vs the control by 11 21 and 36 in rdi1 rdi2 and rdi3 respectively table 3 the effect of water restriction was also reflected in the average fruit weight rdi1 with a similar number of fruit as the control treatment but irrigated at 40 etc in phase ii of fruit growth displayed a lighter average fruit weight because the high transpiration rates linked with high fruit load were not met bustan et al 2016 the irrigation treatments irrigated below 250 mm with a lighter crop load than rdi1 showed a statistical reduction only in average fruit weight terms for rdi3 in 2017 oil yield was less sensitive than olive yield with the applied water restrictions a similar trend was obtained by vita serman et al 2021 in a high density arbequina olive orchard located in northwest argentina their results showed that water restriction had a stronger impact on olive yield than on oil yield in our case the oil yield obtained in strategy rdi1 was similar to that of the fully irrigated trees and lowered by 9 and 27 in strategies rdi2 and rdi3 respectively table 3 these results indicate that the water stress level obtained by applying rdi1 was not enough to make the oil synthesis rate worse however strategy rdi3 resulted in severer water stress situations which not only went over the critical limit of ψstem 3 5 mpa fig 2 but also led to lower olive and oil yields specifically in 2017 with a 62 reduction in irrigation dose compared to the fully irrigated trees oil yield lowered only by 38 table 3 these results are comparable to those reported by fernández et al 2013 in a commercial shd arbequina olive orchard where a drop in oil yield of only 26 was noted with 72 water savings when restricting the irrigation volume in the least restrictive strategy rdi1 the decreased olive yield and the maintained oil yield proved that oil production was less sensitive than olive production when faced with moderate water stress hueso et al 2019a indeed our results evidenced that the different behaviour between olive and oil yields in treatment rdi1 was due mainly to reduced fruit water content because oil content on dry weight and number of fruit were similar to those of the control table 3 the water applied restrictions had a positive effect on oil content on fresh weight in all the evaluated rdi strategies table 3 the increased oil content in the deficit irrigated treatments was due to lower fruit water content table 3 these results agree with those obtained by berenguer et al 2006 and marra et al 2016 during trials with arbequina olive trees grown in an shd orchard in each case the oil content of fresh matter significantly exceeded the rdi treatment compared to that obtained in fully irrigated trees according to previous studies girona et al 2002 berenguer et al 2006 these rdi strategies can imply improved oil yield because attaining a high percentage of extracted oil over the total fats contained in fruit is more difficult when fruit water content increases due to irrigation the application of the different irrigation restrictions based on rdi strategies also had a marked regulating effect on shd trees vegetative development especially in the treatments with severer irrigation dose restrictions table 4 indeed the impact of the applied water stress was stronger on vegetative development than the yield parameters which resulted in plant resources redistribution to favour olive yield table 4 other authors have obtained similar results with the same growing system which suggests employing 30 and 45 reductions over the theoretical needs as a tool to reduce excessive tree vigour hernandez santana et al 2017 nevertheless it should be noted that the continued use of this irrigation strategy could limit potential crop yields in fact in the rdi3 strategy trees the high degree of accumulated water stress which continued year after year considerably limited vegetative development this could have restricted their productive capacity as indicated by decreased yield efficiency especially in the last two study years table 4 this should be contemplated when utilising deficit irrigation strategies in young orchards as plant growth and their entry in production could be delayed pérez lópez et al 2007 caruso et al 2013 vegetative development was also influenced by this olive variety s marked alternate bearing greater vegetative growth was observed only in the off years with an increased irrigation water volume however in the on years the effect of irrigation on vegetative growth and oil production was limited and differences were observed only in olive yield tables 3 and 4 these data underline the need to adapt irrigation dose to fruit load to optimise vegetative and fruit growth without affecting oil yield in light of these results strategies rdi1 and rdi2 seem more equilibrated options both rdi strategies reduced irrigation dose by 22 and 46 respectively and maintained oil production by limiting excessive vegetative growth and reducing pruning costs the application of rdi strategies to shd olive trees increased the olive and oil iwps this improvement was greater as the applied irrigation dose lowered table 5 the highest iwpolive was obtained in the most restrictive irrigation strategy 150 mm year 1 rdi3 the iwpolive values obtained by strategy rdi3 in the on years 6 6 kg m 3 in 2015 and 6 7 kg m 3 in 2017 were similar to the average values of 6 6 kg m 3 reported by tognetti et al 2007 at a similar restricted irrigation dose 100 mm year 1 the average annual precipitation of 500 mm in a high density olive orchard 555 trees ha 1 in another study carried out in an shd arbequina olive orchard 1667 trees ha 1 iwpolive was also similar to our values but no differences were found between rdi treatments padilla díaz et al 2018 however other authors have reported higher iwpolive values including the full irrigated strategy that ranged between 4 1 and 8 6 kg m 3 fernández et al 2013 all the evaluated rdi strategies increased iwpoil especially in the on years table 5 compared to other studies the iwpoil values obtained in the control and rdi3 treatments were similar to those reported by iniesta et al 2009 for a deficit irrigation trial in a high density arbequina olive orchard 408 trees ha 1 in their study oil yield was about 20 higher than in our study as irrigation restrictions were greater than the dose applied in our control treatment with a 73 reduction vs the maximum 64 reduction herein achieved with treatment rdi3 table 2 in another study that worked with shd barnea and askal olive orchards 350 trees ha 1 only the most restrictive strategy with 44 reduction in irrigation dose significantly increased iwpoil ben gal et al 2021 all these results suggest that applying rdi strategies even without having to manage irrigation provisions below 100 etc could imply improve shd olive orchard productivity the average values obtained during the five study seasons indicated that the highest olive yield was obtained without applying irrigation restrictions and oil production was maximised with an irrigation dose between 350 and 400 mm year 1 fig 3b reducing the irrigation dose could be a useful tool to regulate the excess of vigour of fully irrigated trees in our case trunk growth seemed proportional to the applied irrigation volume which underwent exponential growth when the irrigation dose exceeded 350 mm year 1 fig 3c although these results seem to indicate that the strategies with restrictions are the most profitable ones for growers a choice should be made after performing an economic analysis that takes into account the price of water and the payment type olive or oil received by growers with this balance other factors like vegetation management should be considered as the vegetative response differs depending on the applied irrigation water volume it is also necessary to maintain a limited tree canopy in shd orchards to allow the use of harvesting machines the greatest development deriving from greater water provision implies intenser and more costly pruning interventions excess vigour may also lead to a higher incidence of plagues and reduced production because of lack of light on productive branches future studies should optimise economic water productivity ewp m 3 fernández et al 2020 to attain the most profitability from orchards according to the limits imposed by available water provisions 5 conclusions applying different rdi strategies agrees with possible water scarcity scenarios and provides reproducible guidelines for similar efficient irrigation conditions in shd olive orchards our results reveal that it is crucial to adapt restrictions in both quantity and period terms to the crop phenological phases and weather conditions of a given area the provided different irrigation volumes directly affect plant water status yield and vegetative development to generally minimise a drop in yield due to deficit irrigation the ψstem threshold in phase ii could be established between a minimum of 2 0 and 3 5 mpa in productive terms fully irrigated trees 450 mm year 1 obtain the highest olive yield however according to our results we recommend following the guidelines for adopting strategy rdi1 350 mm year 1 as this poses considerable water savings 20 optimises oil production and regulates a crop s vegetative development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9679,china s yellow river basin yrb has large watershed but scarce water resources more importantly most parts of the yrb are located in semi arid areas of northwest china where the ecology and environments are fragile so ecological restoration and agricultural production always are the key research topics of the yrb however the specific research interest of yrb changed over time and was always closely related to the implementation of government policies hence we conducted a comprehensive analysis of yrb s research topics based on the methods of bibliometrics the results showed that the number of papers about yrb s research experienced a change from slowly increasing 1998 2010 83 papers to rapidly increasing 2011 2015 128 papers and then to exponentially rising 2016 2020 369 papers secondly the main research fields of the yrb included farming crops water soil environment and etc the journal of agriculture water management had the highest global total citations and h index even local cited references were the highest among all of the reference papers about the yrb through summarizing the most cited papers and references we found the most important research hotspots about the yrb were the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the yrb the management of soil erosion and vegetation restoration in the yrb and the relationship between crops and environment and management in the loess plateau of china in addition loess plateau was the most frequent keyword in the past ten years and the popularity of climate change rose sharply in the past five years for yrb s research in near future how to effectively control carbon emissions greenhouse gas ghg emissions and carbon surplus is becoming an important implication for yrb s agricultural production and ecological restoration in the future in general this research is expected to promote a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the past present and future of yrb s research keywords yellow river basin loess plateau bibliometric analysis ecological restoration agriculture management 1 introduction the yellow river is the second longest river in china and the yellow river basin yrb covers nine provinces accounting for 30 3 of the country s population however the yrb s water resources are scarce or only about 2 6 of the country s total water resources thus water is fairly limited for industry and agriculture in the region china 2021 in fact most parts of the yrb are located in semi arid areas of northwest china where not only soil erosion is very serious but also the ecosystem is very fragile especially in the loess plateau fu et al 2011b li et al 2016 it is a big challenge for agricultural production in yrb because of the extremely scarce land and water resources need to feed such a large population as for agriculture the hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia and the loess plateau depend heavily on water resources of the yellow river ren et al 2018 in early years backward irrigation technology uncontrolled irrigation and excessive fertilization have led to serious soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district gao et al 2015 in order to prevent vegetation degradation and soil erosion the grain for green project consumed more water resources in the loess plateau causing a potential conflict between vegetation restoration and agricultural production cao et al 2009 therefore how to effectively control soil erosion and restore the ecological environments so as to expand the agricultural production to feed more population based on the limited water resources remains an important challenge in the yrb although most scientific research on yrb s agriculture had the similar ultimate goals the research emphasis of each period showed a variant tendency over time in past studies the productivity of crops in the upper yrb was severely limited because of the shortage of soil moisture fan et al 2010 more importantly a large amount of soil was brought into the yellow river through wind and or water erosion resulting in vegetation degradation and destruction of ecosystems shi and shao 2000a thus more attentions should be paid to protecting the fragile ecosystem in the yrb during this period thereafter china implemented two national policies the natural forest conservation program and the grain to green project in order to deal with the environmental crises and improve human well being liu et al 2008 xu et al 2006a however two new problems arose then e g the expansion of land for vegetation restoration and the limitation water resource for agriculture feng et al 2005 xu et al 2006b these could obviously affect the development and yield of crops to handle food crisis it was not only necessary to clarify the intrinsic relationships between crops water and nutrients but also necessary to develop efficient water saving measures to deal with the dilemma of water shortage in fact they were two different research directions for internal mechanism of efficient crop water use crops were proved to withstand water stress of environmental conditions through regulating signal transduction of abscisic acid aba in different organs tissues and guard cells kuromori et al 2018 this was because the aba synthesized by root tissue would be transmitted to shoots through the xylem duct and finally close the stomata when the soil drying began geiger et al 2011 the closing of stomata could remarkably affect leaf gas exchange especially co2 and limit photosynthesis of crops however elevated atmospheric co2 concentration could attenuate the impacts of drought stress on crops by increasing water use efficiency wue thus contribute to crop yield li et al 2020 similarly assmann and jegla 2016 suggested that the response of stomata to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration was also related to aba concentration in the plant therefore clarifying how aba regulates stomata has a great significance to the growth and yield of crops in the future climate with elevated atmospheric co2 on the other hand some efficient water saving measurements and technologies were applied in yrb s agricultural production with the progress in science and technology plastic film mulching can effectively alleviate the negative effects of soil water stress on crop growth it could not only reduce water loss through evaporation but also increase the depth of water infiltration in soil zhang et al 2009 therefore plastic film mulching has obviously improved water use efficiency and yield of many crops in the yrb bu et al 2013 li et al 2013c similarly the technology of film mulching drip irrigation replaced traditional flood irrigation in many places and greatly saved water resources tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 some other techniques and management strategies were also used to improve water use efficiency of yrb s agriculture over the past decades such as the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system the gravel sand mulched fields gsmf aerated irrigation ai and etc du et al 2018 li 2003 li and gong 2002 in general these technologies and measurements have indeed improved water use efficiency of crops nonetheless more efficient and practical technologies should be developed under future climate changes and the international goal of energy conservation and emission reduction previous studies strongly indicated that yrb s agriculture is very complicated because it not only involved the intrinsic mechanism and management measures for efficient crop water use but also needed weighing water consumption between ecological restoration and agricultural production cao et al 2021 therefore it was very necessary to understand the directions and key points of yrb s agricultural research in the past and present more importantly we need some reasonable tools to summarize and visualize yrb research so as to provide a clear research direction for researchers in the future the technique of bibliometrics could integrate the findings of previous research and use existing databases to promote scientific research and help researchers maintain professional judgment and expertise through quantitative analysis aria and cuccurullo 2017 guler et al 2016 so far the bibliometrics has often been used to quantitatively analyze the status of research and the contributions of individuals institutions and countries in the end we could use bibliometrics to dynamically evaluate the research trend in the future in this study we comprehensively reviewed relevant yrb s research based on bibliometrics the objectives were to 1 categorize the research directions and key points and understand the historical development of yrb s research 2 evaluate the contributions of individuals institutions and countries to yrb research and 3 explore the variation of research topics over time and then predict the future research directions of the yrb 2 materials and methods before bibliometric analysis a large number of databases about research on the yellow river basin fig 1 should be extensively collected as the most authoritative and comprehensive scientific database the web of science core collection database of web of science wos https www webofscience com was used to construct a bibliographic database for the yrb s research more specifically according to the advanced search of wos we searched the fields and information table 1 based on boolean operators the specific advanced search strategies could be obtained from the web of science all databases help however the search results should be manually screened to eliminate articles that were not related 2 1 workflow of bibliometrics based on bibliometrix package recently aria and cuccurullo 2017 developed a bibliometric tool or the bibliometrix package in r language which not only follows the logical workflow of classic bibliometric but also combines statistical calculation and visualization together the bibliometrix package has fully made use of the statistics and drawing capabilities of r language and more importantly the r language also was an object oriented and functional programming language meaning that the bibliometrix package can be combined with other packages to create new functions after obtaining the database about yrb s research in wos saved as text file we conducted the biliometric analysis about the scientific research on the yrb according to the following procedures a we first loaded it into r language through the readfiles function and then the convert2d function was called to convert this database into a bibliographic data frame b the biblioanalysis function summarized the results of bibliometrics and the summary counted different fields of bibliometric results such as the most published journals country authors and papers the frequency of keywords and etc c the citations function analyzed the global citations in the bibliometric results mainly including the most cited countries authors papers and references the local citations can be counted with the localcitations function d the h index is a ranking index of journals and authors which mainly describes h papers that have been cited at least h times hirsch 2005 the hindex function was used to calculate the h index in bibliometrix package e the biblionetwork function aims to show the networks about institutional collaboration and keywords co occurrence it constructed a binary matrix also a bipartite network between different papers and then extracted the required information through the metatagextraction function finally the network was visualized through the networkplot function which can classify the network and display it in different colors through different clustering algorithms louvain algorithm was a heuristic method that based on modularity optimization it can mine the hierarchical structure in the data network and finally achieve hierarchical clustering blondel et al 2008 so in this study we used the louvain algorithm to cluster the information in the network 3 results 3 1 main information about paper collection from 1998 2020 there were a total of 580 papers on the yellow river basin yrb that were published in 172 sources including 561 articles 3 editorial materials 2 meeting abstracts and 14 reviews the number of papers can reflect the popularity of research to a certain extent from 1998 2010 only 83 papers about the yrb were published accounting for 14 31 of the total papers the number of papers grew remarkably between 2011 and 2015 128 papers or 22 07 of total papers where annual average paper number increased from 6 3 1998 2010 to 25 6 from 2016 2020 the paper number increased exponentially to 369 accounting for about 63 62 of the total papers fig 2a this showed that research about the yrb increased rapidly in recent years and related scientific problems also were paid more attentions for the citation of papers the highest mean value of global total citations was 131 6 times in 2000 and it was the lowest in 2020 or only 2 49 times fig 2b in addition interannual variation would also affect the number of citations of the papers about research of the yrb the mean total citations per papers per year were also calculated the highest mean total citations were 8 46 in 2007 and 8 30 times in 2009 while the lowest mean total citations were only 1 10 times in 2003 fig 2c in general about 25 22 papers about research on the yrb were published in each year the total global citations reached 13 102 times and each paper was cited about 22 59 times on average additionally a total of 2030 authors participated in the research on the yrb and contributed 1632 keywords at the same time fig 2d therefore the research about the yrb has been receiving more and more attentions and affirmation from publishers regions institutions and researchers 3 2 publisher s citations and sources for the research of the yrb most of the papers were published in journals of the fields of agriculture water resources and environmental science the top five journals with global total citations were agricultural water management 1772 field crops research 1228 catena 693 global and planetary change 685 and environmental earth sciences 559 table 2 the top five journals with most published papers were environmental earth sciences 35 papers agricultural water management 28 papers water 27 papers science of the total environment 24 papers and catena 23 papers table 2 the h index which indicates h papers have been cited at least h times was usually used to evaluate the academic influence of journals or individuals thus h index could represent the academic achievements of journals or individuals the journal of agricultural water management 18 had the highest h index among all of the journals related to yrb s research table 2 for local cited references in all papers the top five journals were agricultural water management 1236 journal of hydrology 921 field crops research 700 catena 698 and soil tillage research 691 fig 3 generally the main directions of the yrb s research were agriculture crops water soil environment and etc the journal of agricultural water management ranked high in the number of papers references citation and h index table 2 and fig 3 3 3 top ten countries for published and cited papers in different periods the number of published papers and global citations about a research by a country can reflect the country s scientific research level and emphasis there were a total of 24 countries that have conducted research on the yrb from 1998 to 2020 the results showed that the number of papers published and cited were the highest in china 68 papers and 5445 citations but australia 179 citations per paper had the highest citations per paper during 1998 2010 table 3 during 2011 2015 china 118 papers and 2980 citations maintained the highest number of papers and citations while germany 132 citations per paper had the highest citations per paper during 2016 2020 the number of published papers in china 347 papers greatly increased compared to the 2011 2015 period and the number of total citations 3184 citations was also the highest among all of the countries involved however germany 31 citations per paper was still the country that had the highest number of citations per paper in 2016 2020 table 3 in general china maintained a high level for total papers published and total citations of research on the yrb in the three periods moreover china has been gradually narrowing the gap with other developed countries in terms of research influence and quality 3 4 most influential authors and cooperation of institutions as the development of scientific research more and more studies were accomplished through the mutual cooperation of different countries and institutions because it can produce higher influence and scientific research value through the louvain algorithm to cluster all production institutions and then selected top 20 institutions that published articles to explore the cooperative relationships between institutions fig 4 the cooperation network was mainly clustered into three categories which were represented by northwest a f university nwafu of china the chinese academy of sciences cas and the xi an jiaotong university xjtu of china the nwafu had published the most papers 222 papers these papers mainly focused on a the impacts of climate variability and human activities on the flow of the yellow river zhao et al 2014a b the protection of soil erosion in the loess plateau of china zhao et al 2013b and c the impacts of tillage systems on crop yields and water or fertilizer use efficiency li et al 2013b and etc the cas and its cooperative institutions had many research directions on the yrb but the main directions were a the impacts of climate variability and human activities on the discharge and sediment discharge of the yellow river gao et al 2011 miao et al 2011 wang et al 2016 b the hydrological and climatic trends of the yrb fu et al 2004 zhao et al 2014a c the vegetation cover dynamics in yrb miao et al 2012 xin et al 2008 and d soil erosion and crop tillage in the loess plateau huang et al 2005b shi and shao 2000b and etc the cooperative institutions represented by the xjtu explored a the impacts of anthropogenic curtailing on the yellow river s runoff and sediment load liu et al 2020 b the precipitation variation in the loess plateau over years tan et al 2014 and c water cycle and vegetation restoration in the loess plateau qiu et al 2017 and etc there were totally 2030 authors participated in relevant research on the yrb from 1998 to 2020 the highest individual total citations 1274 and local total citations 127 were from li f m li fengmin in the lanzhou university of china table 4 his main research included the agricultural ecology and vegetation variation on the loess plateau located in the yrb zhao et al 2014b zheng et al 2019 the most individually published papers about yrb were from liu y liu yu in the chinese academy of sciences whose main research direction was dendroclimatology and the management of yrb s sediment load under climate change liu et al 2020 fu b j fu bojie from the chinese academy of sciences had the highest h index 15 and the second highest number of papers 17 the research of fu mainly included the impacts of human activities on sediment transport in the yrb wang et al 2016 soil erosion control service in the loess plateau fu et al 2011b and impacts of water resources on revegetation in the loess plateau feng et al 2016b and etc 3 5 most cited papers and references conventionally the amount of paper s citations would directly reflect the quality and influence of this paper globally or locally in this study we compiled the top 20 cited papers about research on the yrb table 5 the most totally cited paper was published in the journal of global and planetary change by wang et al 2007 and the paper published by zhou et al 2009 in the journal of field crops research was the most locally totally cited paper during 1981 2020 it was necessary to classify papers according to the contents of the research wang et al 2007 mainly explored the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the yellow river cao et al 2009 mainly discussed some successful or unsuccessful examples to restore the fragile environments of the yrb by the grain for green project of china their ultimate goal was to take reasonable measures to protect the local ecological diversity cai et al 2008 compared the weathering intensity and hco3 flux in the world s major rivers including the yrb zhang 2009 introduced china s south to north water transfer project and discussed its impacts on the riverine environments of upper yellow river su and fu 2013 and wang et al 2011 studied the evolution of land use and vegetation characteristics on dried soil layers and ecosystem of the loess plateau of china dotterweich 2013 and fu et al 2000 also conducted research on soil conditions and soil erosion on the loess plateau the interaction relationship among crops environment and management on the loess plateau was one of the momentous studies on the yrb in 1988 2020 these studies mainly included a the effects of mulching on crops and soil moisture or fertility li et al 2004a 2004b zhang et al 2009 b the effects of irrigation measures on crop yield and growth kang et al 2000 2002 liu et al 2010 sadras and angus 2006 wang et al 2009 c the effects of tillage measures on crops and resource utilization su et al 2007 and d the effects of multi factor coupling on crops and soil li et al 2001 liu et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 about references the paper with the highest tc and ltc was from shi and shao 2000b which mainly investigated the problem of soil and water loss in the loess plateau and putted forward the existing problems and measures of comprehensive control table 6 in fact 19 of the top 20 citations were related to studies of the loess plateau the concerns of these references were also consistent with the research directions of the loess plateau located in the yrb in 1988 2020 table 6 one exception is that berner et al 2012 studied the biomass distribution fire regime and post fire recovery of cajander larch larix cajanderi l in northeastern siberia to improve predictions of net climatic feedbacks associated with landscape scale forest disturbances in northern eurasia that includes the loess plateau these references provided important enlightenment for the relationship between climate and forests of the yrb and the impacts of future climate change on terrestrial ecosystems through summarizing the research contents of these highly cited papers and references the main key findings included the following parts first climate change and human activities have jointly affected the sediment load of the yrb and human activities including agricultural water consumption soil conservation practices and etc were the main reasons for the reduction of sediment load next the grain for green project has made researchers to focus on the relationship between vegetation restoration and efficient use of water and soil the relevant studies found that reducing the intensity of farming and grazing should be considered together as the primary tool in this project to reduce afforestation finally for agricultural production in the yrb researchers mainly focused on the technology and methods about high crop yields based on efficient resource utilization therefore the research focuses were not only related to the government s policies but also to the actual problems faced by the yrb at different times 3 6 keywords evolution and co occurrence a paper s keywords not only indicate the research direction of this paper but also the variation of hot topics of relevant research in this study we screened out the top 20 frequent keywords for the research on the yrb from 1998 to 2020 fig 5 all keywords relatively had a lower frequency during 1998 2010 suggesting that the yrb s research were still in infancy fig 5 the keywords and their frequencies changed in different periods the keywords of loess plateau management water use efficiency wue yield and land use were the top 5 high frequency keywords during this period fig 5 in more detail the keywords of management soil loess plateau yield and irrigation was the five most frequent keywords from 1998 to 2010 implying that efficient use of soil was the hot topic in this period efficient crop water use was so necessary in the loess plateau that some scientific and reasonable management measures should be adopted table 7 between 2011 and 2015 the frequency of all keywords increased indistinctively indicating that the yrb s research experienced a slow but steady growth during this period fig 5 the top 5 keywords in this period were loess plateau water use efficiency wue management vegetation and model some models such as crop models statistical models and machine learning models were gradually applied in yrb s research in addition vegetation restoration and soil erosion in the yrb attracted more and more attentions in 2011 2015 among these keywords the frequency of loess plateau increased exponentially since 2015 fig 5 the keyword of climate change also suddenly increased and ranked third in 2016 2020 table 7 in general the yrb s research developed rapidly during this period and paid more and more attentions to future climate change as well we used the louvain algorithm to cluster the top 50 keywords related to the yrb s research from 1998 to 2020 all keywords were clustered into three types in the co occurrence network fig 6 the red cluster had a total of 21 keywords which mainly were loess plateau management water use efficiency wue yield use efficiency and etc thus this clustering focused on the management of crops in the loess plateau of china efficient use of water and nutrients were also hot topics so that the growth and yield of crops could be improved with limited water resources based on the cluster analysis it was found that the main crops were maize and wheat on the loess plateau located in the yrb especially winter wheat fig 6 thus the red cluster mainly focused on agricultural production the blue clusters with a total of 26 keywords mainly including land use climate change china model vegetation and etc fig 6 the yrb still faced serious soil erosion in this period which were bound to cause changes in land use and population characteristics of vegetation under future climate change thus the main research directions of blue clustering were environment ecology meteorology and hydrology the green cluster had only three keywords of carbon conservation and organic matter fig 6 more importantly these three keywords appeared only in recent years since the chinese government wants to achieve the goals of reducing carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 the research on carbon emissions greenhouse gas ghg emissions and carbon surplus is coming under global spotlight now especially under future climate change generally the management of crops utilization of water and fertilizer in the loess plateau and the ecological restoration were still the main research directions of the yrb however more and more yrb s research will integrate carbon emissions and carbon neutrality under future climate change 4 discussion although the ecosystem was relatively fragile the yellow river basin yrb still urgently needed to increase its agricultural productivity to feed more population in the future it was well known that there was a greater conflict between vegetation expansion for ecological restoration and agricultural farmland in respect of land and water use chen et al 2015 feng et al 2016b the way to resolve this conflict depends on the formulation of government policies however advanced water saving technologies and management as well as water consumption mechanisms of crops were also needed to understand cao et al 2020 it was exciting that the yrb s research has attracted more and more attentions from researchers in different countries about either ecological restoration or agricultural production especially in the past five years fig 2a based on journal paper analysis the fields of yrb s research mainly included agriculture water resources soil and environment in addition the journal of agricultural water management gained great influence in the yrb s research because of the highest number of citations and the second largest number of papers among all journals table 2 and fig 3 this means that an increasing number of researchers focused on the relationship between crops and water and efficient use of water and fertilizer in agriculture deng et al 2006 ren et al 2018 this was also proven by the cooperation between institutions and the highly cited authors which were more related to research about agriculture in the yrb fig 4 and table 4 according to the top 20 most cited papers the yrb s research mainly focused on the relationship between crops soil and water table 5 because serious soil erosion of the yrb restricted agricultural production some scientific management measures were developed rainfed agriculture based on mulching was always valued by researchers li et al 2001 liu et al 2009 and different tillage measures were also an important research content wang et al 2009 in fact irrigation conditions were usually lacking in the loess plateau located in the yrb mulching the soil with plastic film was believed to inhibit the evaporation from soil during planting the moisture of deeper soil layers transferred to the topsoil making the topsoil water content relatively stable in addition solar radiation formed a diffuse reflection between the plastic film and topsoil leading to an accumulation of heat in the root zone thus the accumulated temperature during crop growing season was increased compared to no mulching field which contributed to the increase of yield in the semi arid areas of the yrb zhang et al 2009 as for tillage measures the practice of double ridges and furrows mulched with plastic film to collect rainwater could improve water use efficiency of crops resulting in an increase of crop yield this management practice was widely used in semi arid areas of the yrb and almost completely replaced conventional tillage practice zhou et al 2009 thus a great emphasis was placed on water saving technology and management for crops in the past since it could directly and efficiently provide benefits for actual agricultural production moreover most of the top20 most cited reference papers were related to crop water management and technology table 6 however the water balance between ecological restoration and agricultural production in the yrb was still a hot research topic the topic of research generally focused on the problems that demanded prompt solution or the implementation of national policies the evolution of keywords in different periods could be the bellwether of research topics from 1998 2010 the keywords uniformly had low frequency due to the smaller number of papers the keywords of management soil loess plateau yield and irrigation were the top 5 frequent ones table 7 this means that crop management based on soil and irrigation was the main research direction in the early stage of yrb s research because of the intuitive impact of water shortage on agriculture in the semi arid area of the yrb researchers were forced to quantitatively control irrigation in order to save water while minimizing the impacts on yield kang et al 2002 li et al 2001 wang et al 2009 from 2011 to 2015 the frequency of all keywords increased compared to the past ten years except for loess plateau and management the top 5 frequent keywords also included water use efficiency vegetation and model the accelerated implementation of grain for green project of china ensured the effective restoration of ecology in the yrb however the expansion of vegetation also raised several misgivings first in respect of water resources the reduction in yrb s runoff caused by vegetation restoration affected the amount of water available for human activities which might cause negative socio economic consequences feng et al 2016b miao et al 2012 second utilizations of land and water must be balanced between vegetation and crops to avoid exacerbated food shortages chen et al 2015 therefore the research during this period mainly relied on the grain for green project of china to weigh and simulate the vegetation restoration and agricultural production in the yrb the frequency of keyword loess plateau increased exponentially since 2015 additionally the frequency of keyword climate change also remarkably increased temperature was one of the main factors that regulate the growing seasons of vegetation many studies showed that the growing seasons of vegetation in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere were prolonged due to global warming jeong et al 2011 liu et al 2016 piao et al 2020 thus it is very meaningful for policy making and technological innovation to study the vegetation restoration and crop growth in the yrb under future climate changes after understanding the past and current goals of research on the yrb it was necessary to explore the trend of future research in the cluster analysis of top 50 keywords the red clusters mainly concentrated on agricultural production while the blue clusters mainly focused on the ecological restoration of the yrb both two clusters were the main research directions in the period of 1998 2020 however the green cluster only included three keywords of carbon conservation and organic matter whose frequencies just increased in the past five years terrestrial plants fix carbon dioxide co2 into organic matter this process was also called gross primary production at the ecological level as the world s largest carbon flux gpp drives the carbon cycle in the ecosystem and helps offset anthropogenic carbon emissions beer et al 2010 chapin et al 2009 lu et al 2017 the co2 in the atmosphere is expected to rise to 800 ppm at the end of this century and intensifies the process of global warming van vuuren et al 2011 in fact agricultural production has contributed about 19 29 of global anthropogenic ghg emissions the dependence of growing population on food production and the impact of climate change on crops both raise serious concerns about ghg emissions in the future vermeulen et al 2012 thus how to effectively control greenhouse gas ghg emissions and carbon surplus was of great importance to agricultural production and ecological restoration in the yrb in the future more importantly the consequences of rising co2 should be additionally taken into consideration to bring new directions in policy making and technological innovation 5 conclusions in this study we comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated the focuses and evolution of global research on the yellow river basin yrb in china using the method of bibliometrics the advanced search of web of science wos based on the web of science core collection database was used to screen out a total of 580 papers including 561 articles 3 editorial material 2 meeting abstract and 14 reviews then the bibliometrix package in r language was used to analyze all papers about research on the yrb some main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the number of published papers about yrb s research slowly increased in 1998 2010 83 papers then rapidly increased in 2011 2015 128 papers and exponentially rose in 2016 2020 369 papers indicating a perspective about yrb s research in the future 2 the main research areas of the yrb were summarized including agriculture crops water soil environment and etc most of the research papers involved were published in the journal of environmental earth sciences however the journal of agriculture water management had the highest global total citations and h index as well as the highest local citations among all of the reference sources about the yrb 3 for the contributions of different countries institutions and individuals to the yrb s research the number of papers and total citations of china always maintained a high level in the periods of 1998 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 the cooperation between institutions was mainly represented by the northwest a f university nwafu the chinese academy of sciences cas and the xi an jiaotong university xjtu of china for different research characteristics and directions as for individuals li f m li fengmin liu y liu yu and fu b j fu bojie were the most influential and competitive authors for the yrb s research 4 based on summary of the most cited papers and references the most important research hotspots were the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the yrb the management of soil erosion and vegetation restoration in the yrb and the relationship between crops and environment and management on the loess plateau located in the yrb 5 the keywords of loess plateau management climate change water use efficiency and yield were the focuses of yrb s research over the past five years this can also be proved by the clustering results the top 50 keywords about the research in the yrb in addition carbon emissions greenhouse gas emissions under future climate change may become hotspot in near future in general this study systematically revealed the development evolution and prospects of the scientific research on the yrb and could enhance our understanding about the yrb s research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9679,china s yellow river basin yrb has large watershed but scarce water resources more importantly most parts of the yrb are located in semi arid areas of northwest china where the ecology and environments are fragile so ecological restoration and agricultural production always are the key research topics of the yrb however the specific research interest of yrb changed over time and was always closely related to the implementation of government policies hence we conducted a comprehensive analysis of yrb s research topics based on the methods of bibliometrics the results showed that the number of papers about yrb s research experienced a change from slowly increasing 1998 2010 83 papers to rapidly increasing 2011 2015 128 papers and then to exponentially rising 2016 2020 369 papers secondly the main research fields of the yrb included farming crops water soil environment and etc the journal of agriculture water management had the highest global total citations and h index even local cited references were the highest among all of the reference papers about the yrb through summarizing the most cited papers and references we found the most important research hotspots about the yrb were the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the yrb the management of soil erosion and vegetation restoration in the yrb and the relationship between crops and environment and management in the loess plateau of china in addition loess plateau was the most frequent keyword in the past ten years and the popularity of climate change rose sharply in the past five years for yrb s research in near future how to effectively control carbon emissions greenhouse gas ghg emissions and carbon surplus is becoming an important implication for yrb s agricultural production and ecological restoration in the future in general this research is expected to promote a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the past present and future of yrb s research keywords yellow river basin loess plateau bibliometric analysis ecological restoration agriculture management 1 introduction the yellow river is the second longest river in china and the yellow river basin yrb covers nine provinces accounting for 30 3 of the country s population however the yrb s water resources are scarce or only about 2 6 of the country s total water resources thus water is fairly limited for industry and agriculture in the region china 2021 in fact most parts of the yrb are located in semi arid areas of northwest china where not only soil erosion is very serious but also the ecosystem is very fragile especially in the loess plateau fu et al 2011b li et al 2016 it is a big challenge for agricultural production in yrb because of the extremely scarce land and water resources need to feed such a large population as for agriculture the hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia and the loess plateau depend heavily on water resources of the yellow river ren et al 2018 in early years backward irrigation technology uncontrolled irrigation and excessive fertilization have led to serious soil salinization in the hetao irrigation district gao et al 2015 in order to prevent vegetation degradation and soil erosion the grain for green project consumed more water resources in the loess plateau causing a potential conflict between vegetation restoration and agricultural production cao et al 2009 therefore how to effectively control soil erosion and restore the ecological environments so as to expand the agricultural production to feed more population based on the limited water resources remains an important challenge in the yrb although most scientific research on yrb s agriculture had the similar ultimate goals the research emphasis of each period showed a variant tendency over time in past studies the productivity of crops in the upper yrb was severely limited because of the shortage of soil moisture fan et al 2010 more importantly a large amount of soil was brought into the yellow river through wind and or water erosion resulting in vegetation degradation and destruction of ecosystems shi and shao 2000a thus more attentions should be paid to protecting the fragile ecosystem in the yrb during this period thereafter china implemented two national policies the natural forest conservation program and the grain to green project in order to deal with the environmental crises and improve human well being liu et al 2008 xu et al 2006a however two new problems arose then e g the expansion of land for vegetation restoration and the limitation water resource for agriculture feng et al 2005 xu et al 2006b these could obviously affect the development and yield of crops to handle food crisis it was not only necessary to clarify the intrinsic relationships between crops water and nutrients but also necessary to develop efficient water saving measures to deal with the dilemma of water shortage in fact they were two different research directions for internal mechanism of efficient crop water use crops were proved to withstand water stress of environmental conditions through regulating signal transduction of abscisic acid aba in different organs tissues and guard cells kuromori et al 2018 this was because the aba synthesized by root tissue would be transmitted to shoots through the xylem duct and finally close the stomata when the soil drying began geiger et al 2011 the closing of stomata could remarkably affect leaf gas exchange especially co2 and limit photosynthesis of crops however elevated atmospheric co2 concentration could attenuate the impacts of drought stress on crops by increasing water use efficiency wue thus contribute to crop yield li et al 2020 similarly assmann and jegla 2016 suggested that the response of stomata to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration was also related to aba concentration in the plant therefore clarifying how aba regulates stomata has a great significance to the growth and yield of crops in the future climate with elevated atmospheric co2 on the other hand some efficient water saving measurements and technologies were applied in yrb s agricultural production with the progress in science and technology plastic film mulching can effectively alleviate the negative effects of soil water stress on crop growth it could not only reduce water loss through evaporation but also increase the depth of water infiltration in soil zhang et al 2009 therefore plastic film mulching has obviously improved water use efficiency and yield of many crops in the yrb bu et al 2013 li et al 2013c similarly the technology of film mulching drip irrigation replaced traditional flood irrigation in many places and greatly saved water resources tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 some other techniques and management strategies were also used to improve water use efficiency of yrb s agriculture over the past decades such as the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system the gravel sand mulched fields gsmf aerated irrigation ai and etc du et al 2018 li 2003 li and gong 2002 in general these technologies and measurements have indeed improved water use efficiency of crops nonetheless more efficient and practical technologies should be developed under future climate changes and the international goal of energy conservation and emission reduction previous studies strongly indicated that yrb s agriculture is very complicated because it not only involved the intrinsic mechanism and management measures for efficient crop water use but also needed weighing water consumption between ecological restoration and agricultural production cao et al 2021 therefore it was very necessary to understand the directions and key points of yrb s agricultural research in the past and present more importantly we need some reasonable tools to summarize and visualize yrb research so as to provide a clear research direction for researchers in the future the technique of bibliometrics could integrate the findings of previous research and use existing databases to promote scientific research and help researchers maintain professional judgment and expertise through quantitative analysis aria and cuccurullo 2017 guler et al 2016 so far the bibliometrics has often been used to quantitatively analyze the status of research and the contributions of individuals institutions and countries in the end we could use bibliometrics to dynamically evaluate the research trend in the future in this study we comprehensively reviewed relevant yrb s research based on bibliometrics the objectives were to 1 categorize the research directions and key points and understand the historical development of yrb s research 2 evaluate the contributions of individuals institutions and countries to yrb research and 3 explore the variation of research topics over time and then predict the future research directions of the yrb 2 materials and methods before bibliometric analysis a large number of databases about research on the yellow river basin fig 1 should be extensively collected as the most authoritative and comprehensive scientific database the web of science core collection database of web of science wos https www webofscience com was used to construct a bibliographic database for the yrb s research more specifically according to the advanced search of wos we searched the fields and information table 1 based on boolean operators the specific advanced search strategies could be obtained from the web of science all databases help however the search results should be manually screened to eliminate articles that were not related 2 1 workflow of bibliometrics based on bibliometrix package recently aria and cuccurullo 2017 developed a bibliometric tool or the bibliometrix package in r language which not only follows the logical workflow of classic bibliometric but also combines statistical calculation and visualization together the bibliometrix package has fully made use of the statistics and drawing capabilities of r language and more importantly the r language also was an object oriented and functional programming language meaning that the bibliometrix package can be combined with other packages to create new functions after obtaining the database about yrb s research in wos saved as text file we conducted the biliometric analysis about the scientific research on the yrb according to the following procedures a we first loaded it into r language through the readfiles function and then the convert2d function was called to convert this database into a bibliographic data frame b the biblioanalysis function summarized the results of bibliometrics and the summary counted different fields of bibliometric results such as the most published journals country authors and papers the frequency of keywords and etc c the citations function analyzed the global citations in the bibliometric results mainly including the most cited countries authors papers and references the local citations can be counted with the localcitations function d the h index is a ranking index of journals and authors which mainly describes h papers that have been cited at least h times hirsch 2005 the hindex function was used to calculate the h index in bibliometrix package e the biblionetwork function aims to show the networks about institutional collaboration and keywords co occurrence it constructed a binary matrix also a bipartite network between different papers and then extracted the required information through the metatagextraction function finally the network was visualized through the networkplot function which can classify the network and display it in different colors through different clustering algorithms louvain algorithm was a heuristic method that based on modularity optimization it can mine the hierarchical structure in the data network and finally achieve hierarchical clustering blondel et al 2008 so in this study we used the louvain algorithm to cluster the information in the network 3 results 3 1 main information about paper collection from 1998 2020 there were a total of 580 papers on the yellow river basin yrb that were published in 172 sources including 561 articles 3 editorial materials 2 meeting abstracts and 14 reviews the number of papers can reflect the popularity of research to a certain extent from 1998 2010 only 83 papers about the yrb were published accounting for 14 31 of the total papers the number of papers grew remarkably between 2011 and 2015 128 papers or 22 07 of total papers where annual average paper number increased from 6 3 1998 2010 to 25 6 from 2016 2020 the paper number increased exponentially to 369 accounting for about 63 62 of the total papers fig 2a this showed that research about the yrb increased rapidly in recent years and related scientific problems also were paid more attentions for the citation of papers the highest mean value of global total citations was 131 6 times in 2000 and it was the lowest in 2020 or only 2 49 times fig 2b in addition interannual variation would also affect the number of citations of the papers about research of the yrb the mean total citations per papers per year were also calculated the highest mean total citations were 8 46 in 2007 and 8 30 times in 2009 while the lowest mean total citations were only 1 10 times in 2003 fig 2c in general about 25 22 papers about research on the yrb were published in each year the total global citations reached 13 102 times and each paper was cited about 22 59 times on average additionally a total of 2030 authors participated in the research on the yrb and contributed 1632 keywords at the same time fig 2d therefore the research about the yrb has been receiving more and more attentions and affirmation from publishers regions institutions and researchers 3 2 publisher s citations and sources for the research of the yrb most of the papers were published in journals of the fields of agriculture water resources and environmental science the top five journals with global total citations were agricultural water management 1772 field crops research 1228 catena 693 global and planetary change 685 and environmental earth sciences 559 table 2 the top five journals with most published papers were environmental earth sciences 35 papers agricultural water management 28 papers water 27 papers science of the total environment 24 papers and catena 23 papers table 2 the h index which indicates h papers have been cited at least h times was usually used to evaluate the academic influence of journals or individuals thus h index could represent the academic achievements of journals or individuals the journal of agricultural water management 18 had the highest h index among all of the journals related to yrb s research table 2 for local cited references in all papers the top five journals were agricultural water management 1236 journal of hydrology 921 field crops research 700 catena 698 and soil tillage research 691 fig 3 generally the main directions of the yrb s research were agriculture crops water soil environment and etc the journal of agricultural water management ranked high in the number of papers references citation and h index table 2 and fig 3 3 3 top ten countries for published and cited papers in different periods the number of published papers and global citations about a research by a country can reflect the country s scientific research level and emphasis there were a total of 24 countries that have conducted research on the yrb from 1998 to 2020 the results showed that the number of papers published and cited were the highest in china 68 papers and 5445 citations but australia 179 citations per paper had the highest citations per paper during 1998 2010 table 3 during 2011 2015 china 118 papers and 2980 citations maintained the highest number of papers and citations while germany 132 citations per paper had the highest citations per paper during 2016 2020 the number of published papers in china 347 papers greatly increased compared to the 2011 2015 period and the number of total citations 3184 citations was also the highest among all of the countries involved however germany 31 citations per paper was still the country that had the highest number of citations per paper in 2016 2020 table 3 in general china maintained a high level for total papers published and total citations of research on the yrb in the three periods moreover china has been gradually narrowing the gap with other developed countries in terms of research influence and quality 3 4 most influential authors and cooperation of institutions as the development of scientific research more and more studies were accomplished through the mutual cooperation of different countries and institutions because it can produce higher influence and scientific research value through the louvain algorithm to cluster all production institutions and then selected top 20 institutions that published articles to explore the cooperative relationships between institutions fig 4 the cooperation network was mainly clustered into three categories which were represented by northwest a f university nwafu of china the chinese academy of sciences cas and the xi an jiaotong university xjtu of china the nwafu had published the most papers 222 papers these papers mainly focused on a the impacts of climate variability and human activities on the flow of the yellow river zhao et al 2014a b the protection of soil erosion in the loess plateau of china zhao et al 2013b and c the impacts of tillage systems on crop yields and water or fertilizer use efficiency li et al 2013b and etc the cas and its cooperative institutions had many research directions on the yrb but the main directions were a the impacts of climate variability and human activities on the discharge and sediment discharge of the yellow river gao et al 2011 miao et al 2011 wang et al 2016 b the hydrological and climatic trends of the yrb fu et al 2004 zhao et al 2014a c the vegetation cover dynamics in yrb miao et al 2012 xin et al 2008 and d soil erosion and crop tillage in the loess plateau huang et al 2005b shi and shao 2000b and etc the cooperative institutions represented by the xjtu explored a the impacts of anthropogenic curtailing on the yellow river s runoff and sediment load liu et al 2020 b the precipitation variation in the loess plateau over years tan et al 2014 and c water cycle and vegetation restoration in the loess plateau qiu et al 2017 and etc there were totally 2030 authors participated in relevant research on the yrb from 1998 to 2020 the highest individual total citations 1274 and local total citations 127 were from li f m li fengmin in the lanzhou university of china table 4 his main research included the agricultural ecology and vegetation variation on the loess plateau located in the yrb zhao et al 2014b zheng et al 2019 the most individually published papers about yrb were from liu y liu yu in the chinese academy of sciences whose main research direction was dendroclimatology and the management of yrb s sediment load under climate change liu et al 2020 fu b j fu bojie from the chinese academy of sciences had the highest h index 15 and the second highest number of papers 17 the research of fu mainly included the impacts of human activities on sediment transport in the yrb wang et al 2016 soil erosion control service in the loess plateau fu et al 2011b and impacts of water resources on revegetation in the loess plateau feng et al 2016b and etc 3 5 most cited papers and references conventionally the amount of paper s citations would directly reflect the quality and influence of this paper globally or locally in this study we compiled the top 20 cited papers about research on the yrb table 5 the most totally cited paper was published in the journal of global and planetary change by wang et al 2007 and the paper published by zhou et al 2009 in the journal of field crops research was the most locally totally cited paper during 1981 2020 it was necessary to classify papers according to the contents of the research wang et al 2007 mainly explored the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the yellow river cao et al 2009 mainly discussed some successful or unsuccessful examples to restore the fragile environments of the yrb by the grain for green project of china their ultimate goal was to take reasonable measures to protect the local ecological diversity cai et al 2008 compared the weathering intensity and hco3 flux in the world s major rivers including the yrb zhang 2009 introduced china s south to north water transfer project and discussed its impacts on the riverine environments of upper yellow river su and fu 2013 and wang et al 2011 studied the evolution of land use and vegetation characteristics on dried soil layers and ecosystem of the loess plateau of china dotterweich 2013 and fu et al 2000 also conducted research on soil conditions and soil erosion on the loess plateau the interaction relationship among crops environment and management on the loess plateau was one of the momentous studies on the yrb in 1988 2020 these studies mainly included a the effects of mulching on crops and soil moisture or fertility li et al 2004a 2004b zhang et al 2009 b the effects of irrigation measures on crop yield and growth kang et al 2000 2002 liu et al 2010 sadras and angus 2006 wang et al 2009 c the effects of tillage measures on crops and resource utilization su et al 2007 and d the effects of multi factor coupling on crops and soil li et al 2001 liu et al 2009 zhou et al 2009 about references the paper with the highest tc and ltc was from shi and shao 2000b which mainly investigated the problem of soil and water loss in the loess plateau and putted forward the existing problems and measures of comprehensive control table 6 in fact 19 of the top 20 citations were related to studies of the loess plateau the concerns of these references were also consistent with the research directions of the loess plateau located in the yrb in 1988 2020 table 6 one exception is that berner et al 2012 studied the biomass distribution fire regime and post fire recovery of cajander larch larix cajanderi l in northeastern siberia to improve predictions of net climatic feedbacks associated with landscape scale forest disturbances in northern eurasia that includes the loess plateau these references provided important enlightenment for the relationship between climate and forests of the yrb and the impacts of future climate change on terrestrial ecosystems through summarizing the research contents of these highly cited papers and references the main key findings included the following parts first climate change and human activities have jointly affected the sediment load of the yrb and human activities including agricultural water consumption soil conservation practices and etc were the main reasons for the reduction of sediment load next the grain for green project has made researchers to focus on the relationship between vegetation restoration and efficient use of water and soil the relevant studies found that reducing the intensity of farming and grazing should be considered together as the primary tool in this project to reduce afforestation finally for agricultural production in the yrb researchers mainly focused on the technology and methods about high crop yields based on efficient resource utilization therefore the research focuses were not only related to the government s policies but also to the actual problems faced by the yrb at different times 3 6 keywords evolution and co occurrence a paper s keywords not only indicate the research direction of this paper but also the variation of hot topics of relevant research in this study we screened out the top 20 frequent keywords for the research on the yrb from 1998 to 2020 fig 5 all keywords relatively had a lower frequency during 1998 2010 suggesting that the yrb s research were still in infancy fig 5 the keywords and their frequencies changed in different periods the keywords of loess plateau management water use efficiency wue yield and land use were the top 5 high frequency keywords during this period fig 5 in more detail the keywords of management soil loess plateau yield and irrigation was the five most frequent keywords from 1998 to 2010 implying that efficient use of soil was the hot topic in this period efficient crop water use was so necessary in the loess plateau that some scientific and reasonable management measures should be adopted table 7 between 2011 and 2015 the frequency of all keywords increased indistinctively indicating that the yrb s research experienced a slow but steady growth during this period fig 5 the top 5 keywords in this period were loess plateau water use efficiency wue management vegetation and model some models such as crop models statistical models and machine learning models were gradually applied in yrb s research in addition vegetation restoration and soil erosion in the yrb attracted more and more attentions in 2011 2015 among these keywords the frequency of loess plateau increased exponentially since 2015 fig 5 the keyword of climate change also suddenly increased and ranked third in 2016 2020 table 7 in general the yrb s research developed rapidly during this period and paid more and more attentions to future climate change as well we used the louvain algorithm to cluster the top 50 keywords related to the yrb s research from 1998 to 2020 all keywords were clustered into three types in the co occurrence network fig 6 the red cluster had a total of 21 keywords which mainly were loess plateau management water use efficiency wue yield use efficiency and etc thus this clustering focused on the management of crops in the loess plateau of china efficient use of water and nutrients were also hot topics so that the growth and yield of crops could be improved with limited water resources based on the cluster analysis it was found that the main crops were maize and wheat on the loess plateau located in the yrb especially winter wheat fig 6 thus the red cluster mainly focused on agricultural production the blue clusters with a total of 26 keywords mainly including land use climate change china model vegetation and etc fig 6 the yrb still faced serious soil erosion in this period which were bound to cause changes in land use and population characteristics of vegetation under future climate change thus the main research directions of blue clustering were environment ecology meteorology and hydrology the green cluster had only three keywords of carbon conservation and organic matter fig 6 more importantly these three keywords appeared only in recent years since the chinese government wants to achieve the goals of reducing carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 the research on carbon emissions greenhouse gas ghg emissions and carbon surplus is coming under global spotlight now especially under future climate change generally the management of crops utilization of water and fertilizer in the loess plateau and the ecological restoration were still the main research directions of the yrb however more and more yrb s research will integrate carbon emissions and carbon neutrality under future climate change 4 discussion although the ecosystem was relatively fragile the yellow river basin yrb still urgently needed to increase its agricultural productivity to feed more population in the future it was well known that there was a greater conflict between vegetation expansion for ecological restoration and agricultural farmland in respect of land and water use chen et al 2015 feng et al 2016b the way to resolve this conflict depends on the formulation of government policies however advanced water saving technologies and management as well as water consumption mechanisms of crops were also needed to understand cao et al 2020 it was exciting that the yrb s research has attracted more and more attentions from researchers in different countries about either ecological restoration or agricultural production especially in the past five years fig 2a based on journal paper analysis the fields of yrb s research mainly included agriculture water resources soil and environment in addition the journal of agricultural water management gained great influence in the yrb s research because of the highest number of citations and the second largest number of papers among all journals table 2 and fig 3 this means that an increasing number of researchers focused on the relationship between crops and water and efficient use of water and fertilizer in agriculture deng et al 2006 ren et al 2018 this was also proven by the cooperation between institutions and the highly cited authors which were more related to research about agriculture in the yrb fig 4 and table 4 according to the top 20 most cited papers the yrb s research mainly focused on the relationship between crops soil and water table 5 because serious soil erosion of the yrb restricted agricultural production some scientific management measures were developed rainfed agriculture based on mulching was always valued by researchers li et al 2001 liu et al 2009 and different tillage measures were also an important research content wang et al 2009 in fact irrigation conditions were usually lacking in the loess plateau located in the yrb mulching the soil with plastic film was believed to inhibit the evaporation from soil during planting the moisture of deeper soil layers transferred to the topsoil making the topsoil water content relatively stable in addition solar radiation formed a diffuse reflection between the plastic film and topsoil leading to an accumulation of heat in the root zone thus the accumulated temperature during crop growing season was increased compared to no mulching field which contributed to the increase of yield in the semi arid areas of the yrb zhang et al 2009 as for tillage measures the practice of double ridges and furrows mulched with plastic film to collect rainwater could improve water use efficiency of crops resulting in an increase of crop yield this management practice was widely used in semi arid areas of the yrb and almost completely replaced conventional tillage practice zhou et al 2009 thus a great emphasis was placed on water saving technology and management for crops in the past since it could directly and efficiently provide benefits for actual agricultural production moreover most of the top20 most cited reference papers were related to crop water management and technology table 6 however the water balance between ecological restoration and agricultural production in the yrb was still a hot research topic the topic of research generally focused on the problems that demanded prompt solution or the implementation of national policies the evolution of keywords in different periods could be the bellwether of research topics from 1998 2010 the keywords uniformly had low frequency due to the smaller number of papers the keywords of management soil loess plateau yield and irrigation were the top 5 frequent ones table 7 this means that crop management based on soil and irrigation was the main research direction in the early stage of yrb s research because of the intuitive impact of water shortage on agriculture in the semi arid area of the yrb researchers were forced to quantitatively control irrigation in order to save water while minimizing the impacts on yield kang et al 2002 li et al 2001 wang et al 2009 from 2011 to 2015 the frequency of all keywords increased compared to the past ten years except for loess plateau and management the top 5 frequent keywords also included water use efficiency vegetation and model the accelerated implementation of grain for green project of china ensured the effective restoration of ecology in the yrb however the expansion of vegetation also raised several misgivings first in respect of water resources the reduction in yrb s runoff caused by vegetation restoration affected the amount of water available for human activities which might cause negative socio economic consequences feng et al 2016b miao et al 2012 second utilizations of land and water must be balanced between vegetation and crops to avoid exacerbated food shortages chen et al 2015 therefore the research during this period mainly relied on the grain for green project of china to weigh and simulate the vegetation restoration and agricultural production in the yrb the frequency of keyword loess plateau increased exponentially since 2015 additionally the frequency of keyword climate change also remarkably increased temperature was one of the main factors that regulate the growing seasons of vegetation many studies showed that the growing seasons of vegetation in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere were prolonged due to global warming jeong et al 2011 liu et al 2016 piao et al 2020 thus it is very meaningful for policy making and technological innovation to study the vegetation restoration and crop growth in the yrb under future climate changes after understanding the past and current goals of research on the yrb it was necessary to explore the trend of future research in the cluster analysis of top 50 keywords the red clusters mainly concentrated on agricultural production while the blue clusters mainly focused on the ecological restoration of the yrb both two clusters were the main research directions in the period of 1998 2020 however the green cluster only included three keywords of carbon conservation and organic matter whose frequencies just increased in the past five years terrestrial plants fix carbon dioxide co2 into organic matter this process was also called gross primary production at the ecological level as the world s largest carbon flux gpp drives the carbon cycle in the ecosystem and helps offset anthropogenic carbon emissions beer et al 2010 chapin et al 2009 lu et al 2017 the co2 in the atmosphere is expected to rise to 800 ppm at the end of this century and intensifies the process of global warming van vuuren et al 2011 in fact agricultural production has contributed about 19 29 of global anthropogenic ghg emissions the dependence of growing population on food production and the impact of climate change on crops both raise serious concerns about ghg emissions in the future vermeulen et al 2012 thus how to effectively control greenhouse gas ghg emissions and carbon surplus was of great importance to agricultural production and ecological restoration in the yrb in the future more importantly the consequences of rising co2 should be additionally taken into consideration to bring new directions in policy making and technological innovation 5 conclusions in this study we comprehensively and quantitatively evaluated the focuses and evolution of global research on the yellow river basin yrb in china using the method of bibliometrics the advanced search of web of science wos based on the web of science core collection database was used to screen out a total of 580 papers including 561 articles 3 editorial material 2 meeting abstract and 14 reviews then the bibliometrix package in r language was used to analyze all papers about research on the yrb some main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the number of published papers about yrb s research slowly increased in 1998 2010 83 papers then rapidly increased in 2011 2015 128 papers and exponentially rose in 2016 2020 369 papers indicating a perspective about yrb s research in the future 2 the main research areas of the yrb were summarized including agriculture crops water soil environment and etc most of the research papers involved were published in the journal of environmental earth sciences however the journal of agriculture water management had the highest global total citations and h index as well as the highest local citations among all of the reference sources about the yrb 3 for the contributions of different countries institutions and individuals to the yrb s research the number of papers and total citations of china always maintained a high level in the periods of 1998 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 the cooperation between institutions was mainly represented by the northwest a f university nwafu the chinese academy of sciences cas and the xi an jiaotong university xjtu of china for different research characteristics and directions as for individuals li f m li fengmin liu y liu yu and fu b j fu bojie were the most influential and competitive authors for the yrb s research 4 based on summary of the most cited papers and references the most important research hotspots were the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the yrb the management of soil erosion and vegetation restoration in the yrb and the relationship between crops and environment and management on the loess plateau located in the yrb 5 the keywords of loess plateau management climate change water use efficiency and yield were the focuses of yrb s research over the past five years this can also be proved by the clustering results the top 50 keywords about the research in the yrb in addition carbon emissions greenhouse gas emissions under future climate change may become hotspot in near future in general this study systematically revealed the development evolution and prospects of the scientific research on the yrb and could enhance our understanding about the yrb s research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
