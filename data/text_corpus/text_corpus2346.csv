11730,the occurrence of emerging pollutants in water represents a health risk for humans and the ecosystem it has been shown that pollutant soil interactions are determinants in preventing contamination of water sources by leachates from landfills in this work batch experiments were conducted to study the soil sorption process of amoxicillin amx acetaminophen acp levonorgestrel lng and chlorothalonil ctl in four different soil layers used as cover material in buena vista landfill located in the municipality of la union antioquia colombia all soil layers were characterized using ft ir xrf and bet experimental techniques in addition ph and ionic strength effects on the adsorption process were also evaluated the of removal follows the order ctl lng amx acp in all soil layers acp y amx adsorption was best described by pseudo second order kinetics while lng and ctl adsorption was best fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model pollutant adsorptions were found to be favored at ph 6 3 increasing the solution ionic strength decreases the adsorption of pollutants in all evaluated soil layers the adsorption process was governed by hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions polar molecules such as amx and acp remain in the aqueous phase while nonpolar lng and ctl interact with clay minerals in the soil surface presumably through van der waals forces based on our findings a cover material with both hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics operating close to neutral and with low ionic content is advised for the buena vista landfill to improve its role as a barrier in decreasing potential pollutants contaminating groundwater sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords leaching soil adsorption emerging pollutants landfills and cover material data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction municipal landfills are a reservoir of complex solid wastes which represent a risk to human health wildlife and the environment osako et al 2004 many pollutants can move from the landfill soil covering material by different mechanisms and reach surface and groundwater sources posing an additional risk for the communities przydatek and kanownik 2021 according to the world bank around 369 million tons of solid waste are generated in latin america la annually which are discharged to landfills being the predominant method for waste disposal hettiarachchi et al 2018 the lack of recycling and post waste collection technologies in the region increases the risk to health wildlife and the environment mishra et al 2019 hazardous substances such as persistent organic pollutants pops pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps and organochlorine pesticides ocps have been found in leachates from landfills across the globe including la chrysikou et al 2008 li 2014 these substances are well known for their carcinogenic bioaccumulation and endocrine disruptive potential eggen et al 2010 narvaez et al 2022 the soil adsorption process involves the interaction between two reactants soil and pollutant species in solution soil and pollutant physiochemical properties control the adsorption mechanism pollutants uptake and diffusion to surface and groundwater sources adsorption is affected by the soil surface chemical composition surface area sa soil fractions particle size porosity mineral and organic content and ph etc martínez hernández et al 2016 lertpaitoonpan et al 2009 khan et al 2017 as well as by the pollutant chemical form adsorption involves several mechanisms including cation exchange electrostatic interactions surface complexation hydrogen bonding π π interactions and van der waals attractions xu et al 2021 the type of mechanism taking place will depend on several factors such as ph ionic strength organic and mineral matter content and temperature xu et al 2021 strawn 2021 the adsorption of pops ppcps and ocps have been usually studied in natural soils composite exchangers biomass derived adsorbents and carbonaceous materials like graphene activated carbon and nanotubes among others xu et al 2021 rivera jiménez et al 2010 titchou rachid ait assabbane and hamdani 2020 jung et al 2015 de andrade et al 2018 many of these substances have been recently known as emerging pollutants due to their spread use in medicine veterinary agricultural and healthcare these pollutants have been found in water soil and biota antibiotics painkillers contraceptives and pesticides have caught the researchers attention due to their health and environmental implications among the rapidly growing list of emerging pollutants are acetaminophen acp a widely used painkiller that has been reported to be toxic to aquatic environments at concentrations 71 ng l 1 vulliet and cren olivé 2011 amoxicillin amx a broad spectrum antibiotic that has a negative impact on bacterial communities by increasing the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb binh et al 2007 fungicides such as chlorothalonil ctl which have been recently banned in some countries due to their carcinogenic potential and toxicity to fish and amphibians zhang et al 2016 and contraceptives like levonorgestrel lng a synthetic progestin widely reported to have a negative effect on the reproduction and growth of aquatic organisms oropesa and guimaraes 2020 narváez et al 2019 several kinds of adsorbents have been investigated to remove amoxicillin from water and wastewater othmanehamadache et al 2016 homem et al 2010 majidi 2016 pandey et al 2021 de franco et al 2017 budyanto et al 2008 kim et al 2012 studied the sorption behavior of amoxicillin in two different soil types silt loam and sandy loam it was found that amoxicillin adsorption increases with decreasing soil ph and decreases when soil organic matter content increases the results indicated that amoxicillin was highly mobile in soils and could therefore be rapidly transported to surface waters de franco et al de franco et al 2017 investigated amoxicillin removal from water by activated carbon by performing batch and bed column experiments it was found that the pseudo second order kinetic model describes the adsorption process the adsorption of the emerging pollutant acetaminophen has been studied using different adsorbents principally activated carbon igwegbe et al 2021 ahmadthue et al 2019 nam et al 2014 the mechanism of adsorption involves π π interactions hydrogen bonds and van der walls forces acetaminophen adsorption was found to be favored at ph close to neutral in contrast adsorption capacity of activated carbon decreases as organic matter content increases ho kyongngo and huu hao 2010 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models and the pseudo second order kinetics model were best fits in most cases igwegbe et al 2021 the research on lng and ctl removal from water sources has also been carried out on natural soils and carbonaceous materials although in less extent than acetaminophen and amoxicillin patakioutas and albanis 2002 sun et al 2017 it has been found that chlorothalonil adsorption in soils increases as organic matter content increases involving weak induction forces typical of the physical adsorption process patakioutas and albanis 2002 similar results were found for lng adsorption carbonaceous materials and natural soils sun et al 2017 yang et al 2020 tang et al 2012 despite the vast amount of research devoted to emerging pollutants adsorption and removal from water sources few studies have been conducted using landfill covering materials as adsorbents koutsopoulou et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 these studies are essential because knowing the mechanisms governing the pollutant soil interactions can help to design more efficient covering materials to prevent water sources contamination with leachates from landfills this work aims to evaluate the adsorption of four emerging pollutants amx acp lng and ctl on the cover material used in the buena vista landfill using batch experiments soil layers were characterized using several experimental techniques additionally the influence of ph and ionic strength parameters was evaluated to

the landfill operation was obtained by excavation 2 m depth of the surrounding mountain leaving soil layers exposed three layers were observed with different colors and physical appearances of grain

second calcination at 900 c during the same time all the reported wt values were corrected by losses during calcination 2 7 surface area and pore volume analysis surface area and pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 k using an asap 2020 micromeritics instrument according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 8 batch adsorption experiments adsorption batch tests were performed following the oecd 106 experimental protocol oecd oecd 2000 25 ml of the stock solution and 5 g soil were added to 45 ml conical centrifuge tubes and wrapped in aluminum foil all sample tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm at 15 c aqueous samples were taken at predetermined times between 0 and 24 h finally aqueous samples were transferred to 1 5 ml chromatography vials

effect of ph on amx acp ctl and lng adsorption on all soil layers was studied at ph values of 2 4 6 3 and 9 4 this ph range covers the ionizable and non ionizable states of acp and amx pollutants the ph of the stock solution was modified by adding hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m until the desired ph 2 4 6 3 and 9 4 was reached the adsorption isotherms were carried out for 24 h finally the effect of the ionic strength in the amx acp ctl and lng adsorption was evaluated at the maximum adsorption ph by setting different cacl2 concentrations 0 0 1 and 1 m in the stock solutions based on the oecd 106 experimental protocol oecd oecd 2000 2 10 statistical output data analysis the influence of ph ionic strength and soil grain size parameters over pollutants soil adsorption was analyzed by performing a multifactorial analysis of variance with a significance level of 0 05 using the concentration ppm of each pollutant in the soil as the dependent variable in addition a posthoc analysis was carried out through the lsd least significant difference test to establish which value for each parameter determines the adsorption at the different soil layers studied 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analysis of soil samples the physicochemical analysis of soil samples layer 1 l1 layer 2 l2 layer 3 l3 and their mixture mix are presented in table 2 all samples were classified according to united state department of agriculture usda methods hughes et al 2017 overall l1 l2 l3 and mix layers present high clay and variable silt and sand fractions l1 and l3 showed the highest clay fraction while mix and l3 presented the highest silty fraction l2 presented a higher sand content compared with the other soil layers all soil samples can be classified as slightly acidic which indicates an optimal balance of nutrients and trace elements leitgeb et al 2019 the organic matter om fraction was higher for l1 om consists of residues of plants or animals decomposition and is indicative of the soil s agricultural productivity it has been reported that soils with a high sand content show a lower affinity for organic pollutants while a high om and clay content enhance the adsorption process cheremisinoff 2003 the aluminum concentration varies from 0 7 to 1 4 cmol kg 1 with l2 showing the highest content in contrast calcium concentration remains almost constant in all layers except for l1 which presents a ca2 concentration of 0 2 cmol kg 1 the analysis revealed that l3 has the highest cation exchange capacity cec cec influences the soil ph stability and the mechanism through which soil interacts with chemical species li et al 2019 finally layers water infiltration varies from 31 to 75 6 with l1 showing the highest value 75 6 water infiltration is an important parameter in determining the pollutants partition between the water soil phase slimani et al 2017 the cover material mix can be prepared with different ratios of any presented layer in table 1 according to shen and coworkers soil layers play an important role as a barrier to selectively delivering pollutants to groundwater shen et al 2018 for instance soil with a predominant clay fraction may adsorb antibiotics such as bithionol ma et al 2019 the properties shown in table 2 may affect the pollutant transport since grain and pore size clay silt and sand fractions can work as a chromatography column that retains and delivers pollutants at different times depending on their interactions with soil it has been reported that soils with a small porous size 80 μm promote lipophilic substances adsorption rath et al 2019 whereas sandy soils show less pollutant layer interactions due to grain size other parameters affecting the pollutant soil interaction process include ph and cation exchange capacity cec surface area pore volume and size khan et al 2017 the ph may affect a pollutants adsorption via two mechanisms i changing pollutant charge and ii changing soil surface group chemical form zuo et al 2018 cec is related to the capacity of soil to hold exchangeable cations zhong et al 2010 surface area sa and pore size determine many physical chemical and biological properties of soils from table 2 it is seen that mix and l2 layers present the highest surface areas with 70 92 and 53 12m2 kg 1 followed by l3 and l1 with 46 91 and 21 80m2 kg 1 respectively pore volume and size were found to be similar for all soil layers classifying them as mesoporous materials soil sa and pore size distribution can be correlated to physiochemical soil characteristics like cec organic matter content and clay content among others petersen et al 1996 found that sa was positively correlated to cec while negatively correlated to the soil organic matter content om as for pollutants adsorption it has been found that large sa improve their adsorption and retention from table 2 it can be noted that sa correlated negatively with om in good agreement with petersen et al 1996 while no positive correlation was found between sa and cec 3 2 xrf elemental composition analysis xrf elemental composition analysis is presented in table 3 si al fe and ti oxides were the major components in all soil samples with 41 13 28 33 16 92 1 55 for mix 50 65 30 36 6 38 1 12 for l1 33 16 30 41 19 86 3 04 for l2 and 37 38 26 45 22 44 1 58 for l3 respectively other metal oxides are present at concentrations 2 08 wt heavy metals as cd cr cu hg ni pb and zn presence was either very low or not detected in all soil layers these results agree well with the clay silt and sand percentages presented in table 2 it has been shown that pollutants adsorption can be affected by soil particle size fractions and ultimately by their chemical composition oxides present in clay silt and sand fractions can interact with pollutants in solution through several mechanisms involving electrostatic attraction cation exchange and complexation xu et al 2021 strawn 2021 3 3 fitr analysis soil surfaces can be very complex as they can contain both organic and inorganic functional groups infrared spectroscopy allows us to identify bonds nature and the functional groups present on soil sample surfaces the ft ir spectra for mix l1 l2 and l3 are presented in fig 2 in general all soil layers spectra were found to be very similar the peaks at 3700 and 3620 cm 1 are associated with o h stretching in the alcohols and silanol si oh groups coates 2006 the signal at 1020 cm 1 can be related to the c o bond or siloxane groups the peaks at 900 cm 1 can be assigned to oh vibration in alcohols phenols ethers or acetates sulfates and nitrates could be responsible for peaks between 710 and 798 cm 1 finally the peak at 531 cm 1 corresponds to the fingerprint region characteristic carboxylic acid peaks were not detected since the broad peak between 2800 and 3550 cm 1corresponding to o h vibrations and 1700 cm 1 co stretching were missing 3 4 amx acp lng and ctl batch adsorption experiments adsorption tests were performed in 45 ml conical centrifuge tubes to evaluate the removal capacity of the different soil layers l1 l2 l3 and mix 25 ml of a stock solution containing amx 18 75 mg l 1 acp 18 75 mg l 1 lgn 10 5 mg l 1 and ctl 38 75 mg l 1 was placed in contact with 5 g of each adsorbent during 24 h at 15 c the results for the of removal are presented in fig 3 from fig 3 it can be seen that the of removal follows the order ctl lng amx acp in all soil layers acp and amx were slightly adsorbed with a maximum of removal reaching around 20 for amx and 10 for acp respectively lng and ctl showed a higher of removal ranging from 30 to 40 for lng and 90 for ctl a close look at fig 3 shows that mix and l1 have the highest of removal for all pollutants with l1 being slightly more efficient this could be related to the fact that l1 presents the highest organic matter content 4 1 organic matter is mainly composed of humic substances which have both polar and non polar functional groups allowing hydrophilic or hydrophobic interactions between soil and pollutants considering that all pollutants are neutral at the working ph 5 1 5 6 lower amounts of organic matter in the soil layers provide additional sites for adsorption 3 5 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics can be used to predict the removal efficiency of a contaminant from an aqueous solution controlling factors such as the rate of reaction and the mass transfer mechanism can be determined from the kinetic analysis additionally the elucidation of the kinetics of the process allows a better understanding of the adsorption phenomena paredes laverde et al 2019 therefore to study kinetic aspects type and rate pseudo first order lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order ho and mckay 1998 models were evaluated table 4 presents the amount of each pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium qe mg g 1 the equilibrium rate constant of pseudo first order k1 min 1 and pseudo second order k2 min 1 r2 and δqe values are also presented for both models data in table 4 was obtained by linearization of eqs 5 and 6 in the mix layer acp and amx adsorption is best described by langmuir isotherm and a pseudo second order kinetic model in good agreement with previous reports kim et al 2009 while ctl adsorption was best described by a freundlich isotherm and pseudo first order model kinetic model as reported by patakioutas and albanis 2002 for lng adsorption isotherm obtained was well described by both langmuir and freundlich isotherms and pseudo first order model kinetic model as reported by tang et al 2012 in l1 all pollutants show r2 0 9 and lower δqe values for the pseudo second order kinetics model except for ctl which showed a lower δqe value when a pseudo first order model is applied in l2 acp amx and ctl adsorption is best described by a pseudo second order kinetic model lng has a similar r2 in both kinetics models however a lower δqe was found with the pseudo first order model in l3 all pollutants adsorption process is best described by the pseudo first order kinetics except for amx the pseudo first order lagergren model is the oldest and most typical adsorption rate model this model describes a reversible equilibrium adsorbate adsorbent choi et al 2017 the pseudo first order kinetic model assumes that the occupation rate of adsorption sites is proportional to the number of unoccupied sites calagui et al 2014 in contrast the pseudo second order assumes that the rate of occupation of adsorption sites is proportional to the square of the number of unoccupied sites cruz et al 2004 the half life adsorption t 50 represents the time necessary to reach 50 of the total pollutant soil adsorption at equilibrium here t 50 follows the order amx acp lng ctl implying that lipophilic interactions are favored between pollutants and soil in contrast polar substances like amx and acp have a higher t 50 and reach the equilibrium faster due to the higher affinity for the aqueous phase 3 6 ph effect on pollutants adsorption the ph effect on pollutants adsorption is closely linked with the changes that ph induces in the pollutants structure and soil surface functional groups these changes can make the soil exhibit a greater lower affinity for a specific substance the effect of ph variation on the of removal for amx acp lng and ctl is shown in fig 4 a bell shape relationship is observed in fig 4 this is adsorption first increasing and then decreasing as ph increases the of removal as the ph varies follows the order ctl lng amx acp to explain this behavior it is necessary to consider the adsorbent surface charge the structural form of each pollutant in the solution neutral ionic ion pair and hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions to determine the adsorbent surface charge it is necessary to know the point of zero charge pzc which is defined as the ph at which the adsorbate surface is globally neutral above this point the surface will be positively charged and below negatively charged pzc was determined for l1 l2 l3 and mx the results are shown in fig 5 it is possible from fig 5 to establish the layer surface charge at a specific ph for instance l2 l3 and mx surfaces are positively charged at ph 5 1 while the l1 surface is slightly negatively charged the pka values presented in table 1 indicate that at the working ph 5 1 acp lng and ctl are neutral in contrast amx is deprotonated at the carboxylic acid groups considering the pzc values from fig 5 at ph 2 4 all layers are negatively charged while at ph 6 3 and ph 9 4 are positively charged ctl and lng pollutants are neutral in the ph range evaluated ctl does not have acid or basic groups see table 1 also lng is not ionized in the ph range evaluated conversely amx has the amino group protonated at ph 2 4 the zwitterionic form at ph 6 3 and deprotonated both the carboxylic acid and phenyl group at ph 9 4 while acp is neutral below ph 9 4 and negatively charged at ph 9 4 considering the surface charge and the pollutants structural form as a function of ph it is possible to predict the type of electrostatic interactions attraction or repulsion between pollutants and the soil surface for instance the attraction is expected for amx at ph 2 4 and ph 9 4 however the lowest of removal is seen at these ph values see fig 3 while the highest is presented at ph 6 3 this amx adsorption behavior can be explained by considering the solubility of amx in water as a function of ph it has been reported that amx solubility shows a u pattern when the ph varies from acidic to basic values tsuji et al 1978 with the solubility increasing at acidic ph values then decreasing to remain almost constant at ph values between 4 5 and 7 5 and increasing at ph values 8 therefore an increment of amx water solubility will decrease pollutant affinity for the soil at ph 2 4 and 9 4 respectively explaining the pattern seen in fig 4 similarly acp attractive interaction with soil layers is expected at ph 9 4 since acp is negatively charged and all the four layers surfaces are positively charged yet this is not observed in the experimental results shown in fig 4 a key parameter accounting for these interactions is the octanol water partition coefficient from table 1 it is seen that amx and acp have similar k o w values 2 03 and 2 81 respectively this could explain a major affinity for water and their low soil adsorption additionally it has been found for acp that k o w remains constant in the ph range evaluated here which agrees with the results shown in fig 4 chen et al 1996 ctl and lng present the highest of removal even though ctl does not have acid base properties and lng ionizable proton is not dissociated in the ph range evaluated here the higher of removal could be related to their k ow indicating that pollutant soil hydrophobic interactions dominate the adsorption mechanism the bell shape trend seen in fig 4 for ctl could be explained considering that some organochlorinated pesticides can react with the organic matter in soil and undergo reductive dechlorination forming the 4 hydroxychlorothalonil specie at low and high ph values 4 hydroxychlorothalonil is much more soluble in water than ctl and co elute in the chromatogram burns et al 1997 bouchama et al 2014 this could explain the lower of removal at 2 4 and 9 4 ph values the of removal peak at ph 6 3 might be related to the fact that log k ow increases at this ph value meaning a higher affinity of ctl by adsorbent surface lng behavior can be rationalized considering the u solubility ph profile observed for zwitterionic pharmaceuticals shoghi et al 2013 this is a high solubility in water at low and high ph values and low solubility at ph close to neutral values it seems that textural properties bet surface area and pore volume and size do not play an important role in pollutant adsorption instead pollutant affinity by aqueous phase or soil surface will determine the of removal polar compounds like amx and acp will remain in the aqueous phase instead of interacting with the soil layers surface due to the absence of carboxyl groups as was revealed by the ftir analysis in contrast non polar compounds like ctl and lng will interact with the clay minerals likely through van der waals forces implying physical adsorption sawhney and gent 1990 tunega et al 2020 3 7 ionic strength effect the adsorption behavior of pollutants is also affected by the ionic strength is since cations such as ca2 and mg2 can bond to soil surfaces or exchange with hydrogens in the acidic functional groups changing the availability of active sites for adsorption the effect of the is in the pollutant removal was evaluated at the maximum removal ph 6 3 and ca2 concentrations of 0 0 1 and 1 m respectively the results are shown in fig 6 it is seen that for ctl and lng the of removal initially drops as ca2 increases from 0 to 0 1 ppm while a further increment in ca2 to 1 ppm results in an increment of the of removal with respect to the value at 0 1 ppm for amx the of removal decreases as ca2 increases from 0 to 1 ppm the of removal for acp initially increases as ca2 increases from 0 to 0 1 ppm and remains almost constant at 1 ppm in mix l1 and l2 layers whereas in l3 the of removal decreases in the whole range of ca2 n evaluated two cases are seen in fig 6 i adsorption decreases as ca2 increases and ii adsorption increases as ca2 increases three mechanisms have been reported in the literature to explain i and ii the competition between pollutants and ca2 for the active sites the effect of is on the electrostatic layer at the soil surface and the salting out effect zhong et al 2010 pavlovic et al found that an initial increase in ca2 can lead to a decrease in the ciprofloxacin adsorption on sediments due to the replacement of the hydrogen ions in the acidic groups by ca2 mutavdžić pavlović et al 2017 thus reducing hydrogen bonds formed between the pollutant and soil surface this is not the case here as no carboxylic acid peaks were observed in the ft ir analysis it has also been reported that an increase in is decreases the electric double layer thickness reducing the negative charges at the soil surface therefore decreasing soil pollutant interaction on the other hand high ca2 can reduce pore size and lower the pollutant s accessibility to active sites the former two mechanisms could explain the pollutant s adsorption behavior observed in fig 6 3 8 multifactorial analysis a multifactorial analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of cacl2 concentration and soil layers on the adsorption behavior of all pollutants at the maximum of removal ph 6 3 see fig 3 for amx the multifactorial analysis revealed that cacl2 concentration and soil layers variables are statistically significant p value 0 0001 as well as the double interactions between ca2 soil layer the posthoc test of multiple comparisons revealed that the highest soil adsorption of amx occurs in l1 at ph 6 3 and without the presence of cacl2 l1 presented the highest of organic matter 4 1 among all layers indicating that organic matter content is an important parameter for enhancing amx adsorption this is in good agreement with kim and coworkers who found that soil adsorption of veterinary pharmaceuticals vps like oxytetracycline amoxicillin and sulfathiazole increased at ph values close to neutral and with the increment of organic matter wade 2018 additionally soil adsorption capacities for vps in silty loam soil were higher compared to sandy loam soil similarly acp adsorption is affected mainly by the soil layer p value 0 0001 the post hoc test showed that acp maximum adsorption takes place in l3 and remains almost independent of the calcium concentration for ctl the ca2 soil layer interaction was not statistically significant wang et al found that soil ph and organic matter can affect ctl soil adsorption wang et al 2020 the amount of om may be correlated with the soil adsorption in all layers for ctl by lipophilic interaction see the log k ow in table 1 additionally the size grain interaction may play an important role because significant amounts of clay and silty were found in all layers finally for lng soil adsorption ca2 soil layer interaction was statistically significant p value 0 05 the posthoc test revealed that the highest concentration of lng occurs in the mix soil layer under conditions ca2 0 3 9 soil adsorption of emerging pollutants in cover material used in buena vista landfill and their implication on water pollution from the results presented above it is inferred that ph values close to neutral favor adsorption in all cases polar molecules like amx and acp prefer the aqueous phase rather than interacting with soil layers this might be probably due to the lack of carboxyl groups in the soil surface and the solubility of polar pollutants in water therefore risk assessments should be focused on hydrophilic emerging pollutants amx and acp notwithstanding the possibility of lipophilic pollutants ctl and lng transport to water bodies since they are not entirely removed at equilibrium as was found in batch experiments in fact in a previous contribution we detected lng in the leachate from the buena vista landfill which demonstrates that cover material does not remove these pollutants completely ríos sossa et al 2022 additionally natural degradation should be included in future studies an appropriate selection of buena vista landfill cover material might increase pollutants adsorption reducing the leaching process and the potential contamination of the piedras river located 500 m downhill since the buena vista landfill is established at the top of a steep hill infiltration horizontal transport and runoff are the dominant transport mechanisms that could allow pollutants to reach drinking water sources 4 conclusions amx acp lng and ctl adsorption on three layers and their mix l1 l2 l3 and mix of the covering material of the buena vista landfill was studied by performing batch experiments the experiments revealed that lipophilic pollutants lng and ctl reach equilibrium in cover material faster compared to hydrophilic substances amx and acp acp y amx adsorption was best described by pseudo second order kinetics while lng and ctl adsorption was best fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model the highest adsorption is seen at ph values close to neutral increasing ca2 from 0 to 1 ppm decreases all pollutant affinity by soil layers the ca2 soil layer interaction multifactorial analysis at ph 6 3 showed that these interactions were only statistically significant for amx acp and lng with l1 l3 and mix reaching the highest adsorption performance respectively all soil layers showed low contents of organic matter and no presence of carboxyl groups implying that the adsorption process was governed by hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions while polar molecules like amx and acp remain in the aqueous phase nonpolar lng and ctl interact with clay minerals in the soil surfaces likely through van der waals forces implying physisorption finally it is recommended to use a cover material with the best adsorption capacity for both lipophilic and hydrophilic emerging pollutants this could be achieved using soil layers with the proper balance of clay silt fractions organic matter content and cec however additional studies are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11730,the occurrence of emerging pollutants in water represents a health risk for humans and the ecosystem it has been shown that pollutant soil interactions are determinants in preventing contamination of water sources by leachates from landfills in this work batch experiments were conducted to study the soil sorption process of amoxicillin amx acetaminophen acp levonorgestrel lng and chlorothalonil ctl in four different soil layers used as cover material in buena vista landfill located in the municipality of la union antioquia colombia all soil layers were characterized using ft ir xrf and bet experimental techniques in addition ph and ionic strength effects on the adsorption process were also evaluated the of removal follows the order ctl lng amx acp in all soil layers acp y amx adsorption was best described by pseudo second order kinetics while lng and ctl adsorption was best fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model pollutant adsorptions were found to be favored at ph 6 3 increasing the solution ionic strength decreases the adsorption of pollutants in all evaluated soil layers the adsorption process was governed by hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions polar molecules such as amx and acp remain in the aqueous phase while nonpolar lng and ctl interact with clay minerals in the soil surface presumably through van der waals forces based on our findings a cover material with both hydrophilic and lipophilic characteristics operating close to neutral and with low ionic content is advised for the buena vista landfill to improve its role as a barrier in decreasing potential pollutants contaminating groundwater sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords leaching soil adsorption emerging pollutants landfills and cover material data availability no

osako et al 2004 many pollutants can move from the landfill soil covering material by different mechanisms and reach surface and groundwater sources posing an additional risk for the communities przydatek and kanownik 2021 according to the world bank around 369 million tons of solid waste are generated in latin america la annually which are discharged to landfills being the predominant method for waste disposal hettiarachchi et al 2018 the lack of recycling and post waste collection technologies in the region increases the risk to health wildlife and the environment mishra et al 2019

kim et al 2012 studied the sorption behavior of amoxicillin in two different soil types silt loam and sandy loam it was found that amoxicillin adsorption increases with decreasing soil ph and decreases when soil organic matter content increases the results indicated that amoxicillin was highly mobile in soils and could therefore be rapidly transported to surface waters de franco et al de franco et al 2017 investigated amoxicillin removal from water by activated carbon by performing batch and bed column experiments it was found that the pseudo second order kinetic model describes the adsorption process the adsorption of the emerging pollutant acetaminophen has been studied using different adsorbents principally activated carbon igwegbe et al 2021 ahmadthue et al 2019 nam et al 2014 the mechanism of adsorption involves π π interactions hydrogen bonds and van der walls forces acetaminophen adsorption was found to be favored at ph close to neutral in contrast adsorption capacity of activated carbon decreases as organic matter content increases ho kyongngo and huu hao 2010 the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models and the pseudo second order kinetics model were best fits in most cases igwegbe et al 2021 the research on lng and ctl removal from water sources has also been carried out on natural soils and carbonaceous materials although in less extent than acetaminophen and amoxicillin patakioutas and albanis 2002 sun et al 2017 it has been found that chlorothalonil adsorption in soils increases as organic matter content increases involving weak induction forces typical of the physical adsorption process patakioutas and albanis 2002 similar results were found for lng adsorption carbonaceous materials and natural soils sun et al 2017 yang et al 2020 tang et al 2012 despite the vast amount of research devoted to emerging pollutants adsorption and removal from water sources few studies have been conducted using landfill covering materials as adsorbents koutsopoulou et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 these studies are essential because knowing the mechanisms governing the pollutant soil interactions can help to design more efficient covering materials to prevent water sources contamination with leachates from landfills this work aims to evaluate the adsorption of four emerging pollutants amx acp lng and ctl on the cover material used in the buena vista landfill using batch experiments soil layers were characterized using several experimental techniques additionally the influence of ph and ionic strength parameters was evaluated to

the landfill operation was obtained by excavation 2 m depth of the surrounding mountain leaving soil layers exposed three layers were observed with different colors and physical appearances of grain

second calcination at 900 c during the same time all the reported wt values were corrected by losses during calcination 2 7 surface area and pore volume analysis surface area and pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 k using an asap 2020 micromeritics instrument according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 8 batch adsorption experiments adsorption batch tests were performed following the oecd 106 experimental protocol oecd oecd 2000 25 ml of the stock solution and 5 g soil were added to 45 ml conical centrifuge tubes and wrapped in aluminum foil all sample tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm at 15 c aqueous samples were taken at predetermined times between 0 and 24 h finally aqueous samples were transferred to 1 5 ml chromatography vials

effect of ph on amx acp ctl and lng adsorption on all soil layers was studied at ph values of 2 4 6 3 and 9 4 this ph range covers the ionizable and non ionizable states of acp and amx pollutants the ph of the stock solution was modified by adding hcl 0 1 m or naoh 0 1 m until the desired ph 2 4 6 3 and 9 4 was reached the adsorption isotherms were carried out for 24 h finally the effect of the ionic strength in the amx acp ctl and lng adsorption was evaluated at the maximum adsorption ph by setting different cacl2 concentrations 0 0 1 and 1 m in the stock solutions based on the oecd 106 experimental protocol oecd oecd 2000 2 10 statistical output data analysis the influence of ph ionic strength and soil grain size parameters over pollutants soil adsorption was analyzed by performing a multifactorial analysis of variance with a significance level of 0 05 using the concentration ppm of each pollutant in the soil as the dependent variable in addition a posthoc analysis was carried out through the lsd least significant difference test to establish which value for each parameter determines the adsorption at the different soil layers studied 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical analysis of soil samples the physicochemical analysis of soil samples layer 1 l1 layer 2 l2 layer 3 l3 and their mixture mix are presented in table 2 all samples were classified according to united state department of agriculture usda methods hughes et al 2017 overall l1 l2 l3 and mix layers present high clay and variable silt and sand fractions l1 and l3 showed the highest clay fraction while mix and l3 presented the highest silty fraction l2 presented a higher sand content compared with the other soil layers all soil samples can be classified as slightly acidic which indicates an optimal balance of nutrients and trace elements leitgeb et al 2019 the organic matter om fraction was higher for l1 om consists of residues of plants or animals decomposition and is indicative of the soil s agricultural productivity it has been reported that soils with a high sand content show a lower affinity for organic pollutants while a high om and clay content enhance the adsorption process cheremisinoff 2003 the aluminum concentration varies from 0 7 to 1 4 cmol kg 1 with l2 showing the highest content in contrast calcium concentration remains almost constant in all layers except for l1 which presents a ca2 concentration of 0 2 cmol kg 1 the analysis revealed that l3 has the highest cation exchange capacity cec cec influences the soil ph stability and the mechanism through which soil interacts with chemical species li et al 2019 finally layers water infiltration varies from 31 to 75 6 with l1 showing the highest value 75 6 water infiltration is an important parameter in determining the pollutants partition between the water soil phase slimani et al 2017 the cover material mix can be prepared with different ratios of any presented layer in table 1 according to shen and coworkers soil layers play an important role as a barrier to selectively delivering pollutants to groundwater shen et al 2018 for instance soil with a predominant clay fraction may adsorb antibiotics such as bithionol ma et al 2019 the properties shown in table 2 may affect the pollutant transport since grain and pore size clay silt and sand fractions can work as a chromatography column that retains and delivers pollutants at different times depending on their interactions with soil it has been reported that soils with a small porous size 80 μm promote lipophilic substances adsorption rath et al 2019 whereas sandy soils show less pollutant layer interactions due to grain size other parameters affecting the pollutant soil interaction process include ph and cation exchange capacity cec surface area pore volume and size khan et al 2017 the ph may affect a pollutants adsorption via two mechanisms i changing pollutant charge and ii changing soil surface group chemical form zuo et al 2018 cec is related to the capacity of soil to hold exchangeable cations zhong et al 2010 surface area sa and pore size determine many physical chemical and biological properties of soils from table 2 it is seen that mix and l2 layers present the highest surface areas with 70 92 and 53 12m2 kg 1 followed by l3 and l1 with 46 91 and 21 80m2 kg 1 respectively pore volume and size were found to be similar for all soil layers classifying them as mesoporous materials soil sa and pore size distribution can be correlated to physiochemical soil characteristics like cec organic matter content and clay content among others petersen et al 1996 found that sa was positively correlated to cec while negatively correlated to the soil organic matter content om as for pollutants adsorption it has been found that large sa improve their adsorption and retention from table 2 it can be noted that sa correlated negatively with om in good agreement with petersen et al 1996 while no positive correlation was found between sa and cec 3 2 xrf elemental composition analysis xrf elemental composition analysis is presented in table 3 si al fe and ti oxides were the major components in all soil samples with 41 13 28 33 16 92 1 55 for mix 50 65 30 36 6 38 1 12 for l1 33 16 30 41 19 86 3 04 for l2 and 37 38 26 45 22 44 1 58 for l3 respectively other metal oxides are present at concentrations 2 08 wt heavy metals as cd cr cu hg ni pb and zn presence was either very low or not detected in all soil layers these results agree well with the clay silt and sand percentages presented in table 2 it has been shown that pollutants adsorption can be affected by soil particle size fractions and ultimately by their chemical composition oxides present in clay silt and sand fractions can interact with pollutants in solution through several mechanisms involving electrostatic attraction cation exchange and complexation xu et al 2021 strawn 2021 3 3 fitr analysis soil surfaces can be very complex as they can contain both organic and inorganic functional groups infrared spectroscopy allows us to identify bonds nature and the functional groups present on soil sample surfaces the ft ir spectra for mix l1 l2 and l3 are presented in fig 2 in general all soil layers spectra were found to be very similar the peaks at 3700 and 3620 cm 1 are associated with o h stretching in the alcohols and silanol si oh groups coates 2006 the signal at 1020 cm 1 can be related to the c o bond or siloxane groups the peaks at 900 cm 1 can be assigned to oh vibration in alcohols phenols ethers or acetates sulfates and nitrates could be responsible for peaks between 710 and 798 cm 1 finally the peak at 531 cm 1 corresponds to the fingerprint region characteristic carboxylic acid peaks were not detected since the broad peak between 2800 and 3550 cm 1corresponding to o h vibrations and 1700 cm 1 co stretching were missing 3 4 amx acp lng and ctl batch adsorption experiments adsorption tests were performed in 45 ml conical centrifuge tubes to evaluate the removal capacity of the different soil layers l1 l2 l3 and mix 25 ml of a stock solution containing amx 18 75 mg l 1 acp 18 75 mg l 1 lgn 10 5 mg l 1 and ctl 38 75 mg l 1 was placed in contact with 5 g of each adsorbent during 24 h at 15 c the results for the of removal are presented in fig 3 from fig 3 it can be seen that the of removal follows the order ctl lng amx acp in all soil layers acp and amx were slightly adsorbed with a maximum of removal reaching around 20 for amx and 10 for acp respectively lng and ctl showed a higher of removal ranging from 30 to 40 for lng and 90 for ctl a close look at fig 3 shows that mix and l1 have the highest of removal for all pollutants with l1 being slightly more efficient this could be related to the fact that l1 presents the highest organic matter content 4 1 organic matter is mainly composed of humic substances which have both polar and non polar functional groups allowing hydrophilic or hydrophobic interactions between soil and pollutants considering that all pollutants are neutral at the working ph 5 1 5 6 lower amounts of organic matter in the soil layers provide additional sites for adsorption 3 5 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics can be used to predict the removal efficiency of a contaminant from an aqueous solution controlling factors such as the rate of reaction and the mass transfer mechanism can be determined from the kinetic analysis additionally the elucidation of the kinetics of the process allows a better understanding of the adsorption phenomena paredes laverde et al 2019 therefore to study kinetic aspects type and rate pseudo first order lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order ho and mckay 1998 models were evaluated table 4 presents the amount of each pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium qe mg g 1 the equilibrium rate constant of pseudo first order k1 min 1 and pseudo second order k2 min 1 r2 and δqe values are also presented for both models data in table 4 was obtained by linearization of eqs 5 and 6 in the mix layer acp and amx adsorption is best described by langmuir isotherm and a pseudo second order kinetic model in good agreement with previous reports kim et al 2009 while ctl adsorption was best described by a freundlich isotherm and pseudo first order model kinetic model as reported by patakioutas and albanis 2002 for lng adsorption isotherm obtained was well described by both langmuir and freundlich isotherms and pseudo first order model kinetic model as reported by tang et al 2012 in l1 all pollutants show r2 0 9 and lower δqe values for the pseudo second order kinetics model except for ctl which showed a lower δqe value when a pseudo first order model is applied in l2 acp amx and ctl adsorption is best described by a pseudo second order kinetic model lng has a similar r2 in both kinetics models however a lower δqe was found with the pseudo first order model in l3 all pollutants adsorption process is best described by the pseudo first order kinetics except for amx the pseudo first order lagergren model is the oldest and most typical adsorption rate model this model describes a reversible equilibrium adsorbate adsorbent choi et al 2017 the pseudo first order kinetic model assumes that the occupation rate of adsorption sites is proportional to the number of unoccupied sites calagui et al 2014 in contrast the pseudo second order assumes that the rate of occupation of adsorption sites is proportional to the square of the number of unoccupied sites cruz et al 2004 the half life adsorption t 50 represents the time necessary to reach 50 of the total pollutant soil adsorption at equilibrium here t 50 follows the order amx acp lng ctl implying that lipophilic interactions are favored between pollutants and soil in contrast polar substances like amx and acp have a higher t 50 and reach the equilibrium faster due to the higher affinity for the aqueous phase 3 6 ph effect on pollutants adsorption the ph effect on pollutants adsorption is closely linked with the changes that ph induces in the pollutants structure and soil surface functional groups these changes can make the soil exhibit a greater lower affinity for a specific substance the effect of ph variation on the of removal for amx acp lng and ctl is shown in fig 4 a bell shape relationship is observed in fig 4 this is adsorption first increasing and then decreasing as ph increases the of removal as the ph varies follows the order ctl lng amx acp to explain this behavior it is necessary to consider the adsorbent surface charge the structural form of each pollutant in the solution neutral ionic ion pair and hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions to determine the adsorbent surface charge it is necessary to know the point of zero charge pzc which is defined as the ph at which the adsorbate surface is globally neutral above this point the surface will be positively charged and below negatively charged pzc was determined for l1 l2 l3 and mx the results are shown in fig 5 it is possible from fig 5 to establish the layer surface charge at a specific ph for instance l2 l3 and mx surfaces are positively charged at ph 5 1 while the l1 surface is slightly negatively charged the pka values presented in table 1 indicate that at the working ph 5 1 acp lng and ctl are neutral in contrast amx is deprotonated at the carboxylic acid groups considering the pzc values from fig 5 at ph 2 4 all layers are negatively charged while at ph 6 3 and ph 9 4 are positively charged ctl and lng pollutants are neutral in the ph range evaluated ctl does not have acid or basic groups see table 1 also lng is not ionized in the ph range evaluated conversely amx has the amino group protonated at ph 2 4 the zwitterionic form at ph 6 3 and deprotonated both the carboxylic acid and phenyl group at ph 9 4 while acp is neutral below ph 9 4 and negatively charged at ph 9 4 considering the surface charge and the pollutants structural form as a function of ph it is possible to predict the type of electrostatic interactions attraction or repulsion between pollutants and the soil surface for instance the attraction is expected for amx at ph 2 4 and ph 9 4 however the lowest of removal is seen at these ph values see fig 3 while the highest is presented at ph 6 3 this amx adsorption behavior can be explained by considering the solubility of amx in water as a function of ph it has been reported that amx solubility shows a u pattern when the ph varies from acidic to basic values tsuji et al 1978 with the solubility increasing at acidic ph values then decreasing to remain almost constant at ph values between 4 5 and 7 5 and increasing at ph values 8 therefore an increment of amx water solubility will decrease pollutant affinity for the soil at ph 2 4 and 9 4 respectively explaining the pattern seen in fig 4 similarly acp attractive interaction with soil layers is expected at ph 9 4 since acp is negatively charged and all the four layers surfaces are positively charged yet this is not observed in the experimental results shown in fig 4 a key parameter accounting for these interactions is the octanol water partition coefficient from table 1 it is seen that amx and acp have similar k o w values 2 03 and 2 81 respectively this could explain a major affinity for water and their low soil adsorption additionally it has been found for acp that k o w remains constant in the ph range evaluated here which agrees with the results shown in fig 4 chen et al 1996 ctl and lng present the highest of removal even though ctl does not have acid base properties and lng ionizable proton is not dissociated in the ph range evaluated here the higher of removal could be related to their k ow indicating that pollutant soil hydrophobic interactions dominate the adsorption mechanism the bell shape trend seen in fig 4 for ctl could be explained considering that some organochlorinated pesticides can react with the organic matter in soil and undergo reductive dechlorination forming the 4 hydroxychlorothalonil specie at low and high ph values 4 hydroxychlorothalonil is much more soluble in water than ctl and co elute in the chromatogram burns et al 1997 bouchama et al 2014 this could explain the lower of removal at 2 4 and 9 4 ph values the of removal peak at ph 6 3 might be related to the fact that log k ow increases at this ph value meaning a higher affinity of ctl by adsorbent surface lng behavior can be rationalized considering the u solubility ph profile observed for zwitterionic pharmaceuticals shoghi et al 2013 this is a high solubility in water at low and high ph values and low solubility at ph close to neutral values it seems that textural properties bet surface area and pore volume and size do not play an important role in pollutant adsorption instead pollutant affinity by aqueous phase or soil surface will determine the of removal polar compounds like amx and acp will remain in the aqueous phase instead of interacting with the soil layers surface due to the absence of carboxyl groups as was revealed by the ftir analysis in contrast non polar compounds like ctl and lng will interact with the clay minerals likely through van der waals forces implying physical adsorption sawhney and gent 1990 tunega et al 2020 3 7 ionic strength effect the adsorption behavior of pollutants is also affected by the ionic strength is since cations such as ca2 and mg2 can bond to soil surfaces or exchange with hydrogens in the acidic functional groups changing the availability of active sites for adsorption the effect of the is in the pollutant removal was evaluated at the maximum removal ph 6 3 and ca2 concentrations of 0 0 1 and 1 m respectively the results are shown in fig 6 it is seen that for ctl and lng the of removal initially drops as ca2 increases from 0 to 0 1 ppm while a further increment in ca2 to 1 ppm results in an increment of the of removal with respect to the value at 0 1 ppm for amx the of removal decreases as ca2 increases from 0 to 1 ppm the of removal for acp initially increases as ca2 increases from 0 to 0 1 ppm and remains almost constant at 1 ppm in mix l1 and l2 layers whereas in l3 the of removal decreases in the whole range of ca2 n evaluated two cases are seen in fig 6 i adsorption decreases as ca2 increases and ii adsorption increases as ca2 increases three mechanisms have been reported in the literature to explain i and ii the competition between pollutants and ca2 for the active sites the effect of is on the electrostatic layer at the soil surface and the salting out effect zhong et al 2010 pavlovic et al found that an initial increase in ca2 can lead to a decrease in the ciprofloxacin adsorption on sediments due to the replacement of the hydrogen ions in the acidic groups by ca2 mutavdžić pavlović et al 2017 thus reducing hydrogen bonds formed between the pollutant and soil surface this is not the case here as no carboxylic acid peaks were observed in the ft ir analysis it has also been reported that an increase in is decreases the electric double layer thickness reducing the negative charges at the soil surface therefore decreasing soil pollutant interaction on the other hand high ca2 can reduce pore size and lower the pollutant s accessibility to active sites the former two mechanisms could explain the pollutant s adsorption behavior observed in fig 6 3 8 multifactorial analysis a multifactorial analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of cacl2 concentration and soil layers on the adsorption behavior of all pollutants at the maximum of removal ph 6 3 see fig 3 for amx the multifactorial analysis revealed that cacl2 concentration and soil layers variables are statistically significant p value 0 0001 as well as the double interactions between ca2 soil layer the posthoc test of multiple comparisons revealed that the highest soil adsorption of amx occurs in l1 at ph 6 3 and without the presence of cacl2 l1 presented the highest of organic matter 4 1 among all layers indicating that organic matter content is an important parameter for enhancing amx adsorption this is in good agreement with kim and coworkers who found that soil adsorption of veterinary pharmaceuticals vps like oxytetracycline amoxicillin and sulfathiazole increased at ph values close to neutral and with the increment of organic matter wade 2018 additionally soil adsorption capacities for vps in silty loam soil were higher compared to sandy loam soil similarly acp adsorption is affected mainly by the soil layer p value 0 0001 the post hoc test showed that acp maximum adsorption takes place in l3 and remains almost independent of the calcium concentration for ctl the ca2 soil layer interaction was not statistically significant wang et al found that soil ph and organic matter can affect ctl soil adsorption wang et al 2020 the amount of om may be correlated with the soil adsorption in all layers for ctl by lipophilic interaction see the log k ow in table 1 additionally the size grain interaction may play an important role because significant amounts of clay and silty were found in all layers finally for lng soil adsorption ca2 soil layer interaction was statistically significant p value 0 05 the posthoc test revealed that the highest concentration of lng occurs in the mix soil layer under conditions ca2 0 3 9 soil adsorption of emerging pollutants in cover material used in buena vista landfill and their implication on water pollution from the results presented above it is inferred that ph values close to neutral favor adsorption in all cases polar molecules like amx and acp prefer the aqueous phase rather than interacting with soil layers this might be probably due to the lack of carboxyl groups in the soil surface and the solubility of polar pollutants in water therefore risk assessments should be focused on hydrophilic emerging pollutants amx and acp notwithstanding the possibility of lipophilic pollutants ctl and lng transport to water bodies since they are not entirely removed at equilibrium as was found in batch experiments in fact in a previous contribution we detected lng in the leachate from the buena vista landfill which demonstrates that cover material does not remove these pollutants completely ríos sossa et al 2022 additionally natural degradation should be included in future studies an appropriate selection of buena vista landfill cover material might increase pollutants adsorption reducing the leaching process and the potential contamination of the piedras river located 500 m downhill since the buena vista landfill is established at the top of a steep hill infiltration horizontal transport and runoff are the dominant transport mechanisms that could allow pollutants to reach drinking water sources 4 conclusions amx acp lng and ctl adsorption on three layers and their mix l1 l2 l3 and mix of the covering material of the buena vista landfill was studied by performing batch experiments the experiments revealed that lipophilic pollutants lng and ctl reach equilibrium in cover material faster compared to hydrophilic substances amx and acp acp y amx adsorption was best described by pseudo second order kinetics while lng and ctl adsorption was best fitted by the pseudo first order kinetic model the highest adsorption is seen at ph values close to neutral increasing ca2 from 0 to 1 ppm decreases all pollutant affinity by soil layers the ca2 soil layer interaction multifactorial analysis at ph 6 3 showed that these interactions were only statistically significant for amx acp and lng with l1 l3 and mix reaching the highest adsorption performance respectively all soil layers showed low contents of organic matter and no presence of carboxyl groups implying that the adsorption process was governed by hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions while polar molecules like amx and acp remain in the aqueous phase nonpolar lng and ctl interact with clay minerals in the soil surfaces likely through van der waals forces implying physisorption finally it is recommended to use a cover material with the best adsorption capacity for both lipophilic and hydrophilic emerging pollutants this could be achieved using soil layers with the proper balance of clay silt fractions organic matter content and cec however additional studies are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11731,the release of furfural as effluent from industries has been considered a major pollution source since it adversely affects health and the environment in a proper nutrient condition the indigenous microbial removal process is always considered efficient economical and eco friendly thus the main objective is to employ the effective indigenous bacteria to remove the furfural from wastewater in the present study the indigenous isolates osbh3 strain number and osbh4 strain number were isolated from furfural containing oily sludge and were identified by 16s rrna technique with 99 nucleotide similarity as pseudomonas putida p putida acc no gu329915 and pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa acc no gu329916 respectively in a batch experiment the furfural degradation was observed higher in the presence of the most efficient isolate p putida compare to p aeruginosa at different nutrient conditions including suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer glucose and carbohydrate free synthetic media cfm generally the furfural degradation rate was lower in cfm than the other substrates nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer glucose in the presence of p putida or p aeruginosa the furfural degradation efficiency was observed higher in presence of p putida compare to p aeruginosa experimentally the total 100 degradation of furfural 500 mg l was noticed by p putida within 12h incubation time in presence of 1 mg l suphala even among different factors based on taguchi l9 orthogonal array study the suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer was influential in degrading the furfural at level 2 where the effects of ph and glucose were noticed at level 2 and level 2 respectively the experimental findings supported the orthogonal array study positively the bacterial p putida growth rate and furfural degradation were promoted at the condition of 1 mg l suphala 2 mg l glucose ph 7 2 where the furfural was used by p putida as the sole carbon source for growth thus the indigenous p putida osbh3 acc no gu329915 in presence of modified nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer media can be applicable for furfural toxic remediation from industrial effluent water by the eco friendly process graphical abstract image 1 keywords furfural microbial treatment nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer media p putida and p aeruginosa orthogonal study data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the demand of water is increasing by growing populations urbanization and industrialization coupled with low rainfall which has ultimately led to water scarcity in many areas of the world ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 akbar et al 2022 the effluent water from industrial operations causes widespread pollution on available freshwater resources ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 thus several biological and chemical technologies have emerged to treat the effluent before it is discharged into water bodies ajala et al 2022 kanaujiya et al 2019 wu et al 2010 there are few technologies which adopt to recycle and reuse the wastewater mukherjee et al 2020 bdour et al 2009 the eco friendly and cost effectiveness also play an important role in determining the adoption of appropriate technologies for the effluent treatment process numerous industries e g petrochemical industries oil refineries etc use cow dung di ammonium phosphate and urea for their effluent treatment as a cost effective way mukherjee et al 2020 ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 ajala et al 2022 kanaujiya et al 2019 otokunefor and obiukwu 2010 chinnaraj and rao 2006 muruganandam et al 2008 agrawal 2001 vijayaraghavan et al 2007 however the use of effective microbes em in effluent treatment plants represents a crucial biological treatment method banerjee et al 2013 samal et al 2004 2021 the release of complex chemicals from petrochemical industries oil refineries oil processing and other chemical plants into the surrounding environment has been considered as a major source of soil air and water pollution radelyuk et al 2021 iliev et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 many of these complex chemicals materials are less biodegradable or act as inhibitors for biological systems and often have toxic effects on living systems a chemical of such character is furfural which is an aromatic aldehyde with a cyclic structure it is an excellent organic solvent used in oil extraction units of oil refineries and in petrochemical refining to extract dienes from other hydrocarbons furfural is the general component of wastewater in petrochemical industries or oil refineries which is released and mixed to the wastewater after being used as a selective solvent for refining lubricating oils rosin diesel fuel and catalytic cracker recycle stocks rahmani et al 2020 boopathy and daniels 1991 boopathy 2002 it is important to mention that the furfural effects on the skin mucous membrane respiratory system liver kidney etc furthermore the furfural is moderately toxic to aquatic species thus the removal of furfural is an important issue in current day research the degradation removal of furfural under anaerobic conditions by sulfate reducing bacteria has been reported in earlier studies boopathy and daniels 1991 boopathy 2002 also furfural has been studied intensively where furfural conversion to furan methanol fm furfuryl alcohol has been established by saccharomyces cerevisiae morimoto and murakami m 1967 banerjee et al 1981 villa et al 1992 nemirovskii et al 1989 taherzadeh et al 2000 zhao et al 2005 gorsich et al 2006 almeida et al 2008 liu et al 2008 li and yuan 2010 the bacillus genus bacillus licheniformis microbacterium sp and brevundimonas sp are capable of the biotransformation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural becerra et al 2022 farías et al 2022 in another study the aerobic degradation of 2 furoic acid by p putida fu1 has been reported by koenig and andreesen 1989 and p putida f2 by kitcher et al 1972 nichols and mertens 2008 reported that the genes of p putida fu1 involved metabolizing the furfural through a pathway involving conversion to 2 oxoglutarate via 2 furoic acid fa and coenzyme a intermediates furthermore coniochaeta ligniaria c8 nrrl 30616 is able to degrade furfural lópez et al 2004 furfural is inhibitory to microorganisms at low concentrations 1 12 mm yet many wastes that contain furfural are otherwise appropriate for biological treatment especially anaerobic digestion morris et al 1979 thus different microbes exhibit different degradation efficiency and even similar species exhibit differential degradation responses under strain levels genetically engineered bacteria in some cases show efficient however indigenous microbes are always exhibited efficient cost effective and eco friendly unfortunately there are insufficient reports regarding the degradation of furfural from wastewater using effective indigenous microbes under aerobic conditions furthermore there is limited information about the estimation of furfural degradation factors that influence the performance criteria and which factors are more important and effective than others considering this background the objective of the research is to identify and utilize the effective indigenous bacteria isolated from refinery oily sludge for the bioremediation of furfural in oil refinery wastewater the research was also conducted to optimize the furfural degradation efficiency by effective indigenous bacteria under different substrate conditions nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer etc furthermore the present research estimates the factors that influence the performance criteria and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of bacteria and furfural degradation experiments the indigenous bacteria used by enriching under

and maheshwari 2005 where only furfural was used as carbon source in modified cfm the degradation of furfural was found to be very slow section 3 2 representing a drawback for efficient industrial effluent treatment to understand how to improve the degradation of furfural the research performed in different sets of experiments by varying different factors glucose suphala and ph at different levels to maintain the bacterial growth the batch experiment was executed to optimized the different factors as for instance while suphala nitrogen phosphorus fertilizer was added in different concentration 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 mg l to test the furfural degradation efficiency the concentration of glucose 2 mg l and ph ph 7 2 remained unchanged table 1 one of novelty of this

conducted to obtain the final optimum conditions the qualitek 4 software was used for orthogonal study design and analyze taguchi experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of the isolated indigenous bacteria of 11 successfully isolated strains only osbh3 and osbh4 were able to degrade furfural efficiently in comparison the indigenous isolate osbh3 is more efficient in removing the furfural than osbh4 the isolates osbh3 and osbh4 were identified as pseudomonas spp accession numbers gu329915 and gu329916 respectively using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis 16s rrna sequence provided a fast and accurate method to identify the osbh3 and osbh4 phylogeny positions full length about 1500 bp 16s rrna genes were sequenced and used to construct a phylogenetic tree fig 1 the results showed that the verified isolate osbh3 was classified in the pseudomonas genera the nucleotide similarities between osbh3 accession no gu329915 and p putida am930519 p putida dq157470 p putida psegyrb2 p putida fj472858 p putida eu931564 p putida eu661866 and p putida gq303714 were each 99 0 fig 1 therefore osbh3 gu329915 was closely related to p putida this is belonging to pseudomonadaceae family gram negative rod shaped colony type bacteria a member of gamma proteobacteria gram stained cells were 0 5 0 8 μm wide 1 5 3 0 μm long this is a free living bacterium and is commonly found in soil and wastewater the isolated strain osbh4 was classified in the pseudomonas genera the nucleotides similarities between osbh4 accession no gu329916 and p aeruginosa fj90719 p aeruginosa ef05124 p aeruginosa dq09587 p aeruginosa ef53057 p aeruginosa gu19919 p aeruginosa fj97253 were each 99 0 respectively fig 1b therefore osbh4 gu329916 was found to be closely related to p aeruginosa koenig and andreesen identified as p putida which was isolated from an enrichment culture with 2 furoic acid koenig and andreesen 1989 nichols and mertens reported that p putida fu1 metabolizes the furfural nichols and mertens 2008 3 2 biodegradation of furfural in carbohydrate free synthetic media the p putida osbh3 gu329915 and p aeruginosa osbh4 gu329916 were isolated from a sludge sample containing furfural the experiments on furfural degradation by osbh3 and osbh4 were performed at different nutrient levels figs 2 and 3 the results indicate an increase in the concentration of nutrients would increase the furfural degradation figs 2 4 the isolates osbh3 and osbh4 were able to degrade furfural in laboratory experiments however because isolate osbh3 exhibited much greater efficiency in furfural degradation the study focuses to discuss on the selected strain for the remainder of the present study figs 2 and 3 in the batch experiment the osbh3 bacteria degraded 500 mg l furfural within 22h incubation time whereas osbh4 degraded the same concentration of furfural at 26h incubation time the experimental results exhibited that the degradation efficiency of furfural was noticed very low 10 after the first 6h incubation in cfm whereas 28 of furfural was degraded in the within 12h incubation time fig 2a the total degradation 100 of 500 mg l was observed after 22 26h in an ex situ experiment using the selected effective p putida osbh3 however the degradation of furfural in actual wastewater in situ was noticed at 8 12 during 24h without using selected effective bacteria by contrast the concentration of furfural was decreased up to 1 2 due to evaporation in the same duration for the blank experiment without bacteria fig 2a the maximum rate of bacterial growth was observed at 2 6h incubation time and these bacteria uses carbon source from furfural for their metabolism present result of bacterial growth in presence of furfural may be compared with the report of wierckx et al 2010 where the furfural metabolizing bacterium used furfural as the sole carbon source also the degradation of furfural depends upon microbial adaptation for their metabolic activity lin et al 2009 recent research reported that the several bacteria such as bacillus genus bacillus licheniformis microbacterium sp and brevundimonas sp are capable to biotransformation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural by metabolic process becerra et al 2022 farías et al 2022 3 3 nutrient dependent bacterial growth in furfural environment the experiments were conducted to measure bacterial growth and furfural degradation by the p putida osbh3 at different nutrient levels fig 2b d and 3a c the results shows that the concentrations of inorganic nutrient were either in the lower range 0 75 mg l suphala or in the higher range of 1 25 mg l the bacterial growth and furfural degradation were limited fig 2b the bacterial growth biomass increases significantly with an increase of glucose concentration 1 mg l fig 2c where ph was varied from ph 4 to ph 8 fig 2d and maximum growth of the bacteria was noticed at ph 7 2 it is noted that the maximum bacterial growth 3 109 5 109 cell ml observed at higher glucose concentrations and lower concentrations of suphala 1 mg l at ph 7 2 the previous researchers were reported that the furfural degrading sulfate reducers reached counts of 1 107 5 8 107 cells ml and acetotrophic methanogens reached their highest numbers of 1 3 108 2 6 108 cells ml ney et al 1990 boopathy 2009 which is lower value in comparison with the present study 3 4 degradation of furfural in different conditions of nutrients the p putida osbh3 degraded furfural in the presence of various nutrients fig 2b c and at different ph levels fig 2d 3 4 1 inorganic suphala nutrient dependent degradation of furfural the furfural degradation efficiency was higher in presence of p putida osbh3 compared to p aeruginosa osbh4 data not shown the growth of osbh3 was found to be very poor at low concentrations of suphala inorganic substrate below 0 75 mg l fig 2b and the degradation transformation of furfural was also very low the furfural degradation was observed at only 62 after 12h incubation using 0 75 mg l of suphala however the degradation was noticed at 49 and 31 after the same incubation period 12h at substrate concentrations of 0 5 mg l and 0 25 mg l of suphala respectively similar trends were observed at higher substrate concentrations 1 25 mg l of suphala only 53 and 36 of furfural were degraded at 1 25 mg l and 1 50 mg l respectively after 12h incubation however total 100 degradation of furfural was observed at a substrate concentration of 1 mg l suphala which is very specific for p putida osbh3 the finding was consistent with the results for p putida osbh3 growth present results are comparable with the previous report where the microbial species were capable of degrading furanic compounds wierckx et al 2011 however the level of nutrient dependent degradation was not reported in another report hong et al 1981 described pseudomonas sp strain fs 1 which degraded 2 furoic acid and also koenig and andreesen reported aerobic degradation of 2 furoic acid by p putida fu1 koenig and andreesen 1989 thus in the present study the indigenous p putida osbh3 removes the furfural by and novel inorganic nutrient suphala media 3 4 2 organic glucose nutrient dependent degradation of furfural the p putida osbh3 shows glucose concentration dependent growth and furfural degradation with time the degradation of furfural increased with increasing incubation time for each concentration of glucose and with increasing glucose substrate concentrations such as 0 50 mg l 1 00 mg l 1 50 mg l 2 00 mg l 2 50 mg l and 3 00 mg l fig 2c the research findings indicate that the substrate glucose may promote bacterial growth and associated degradation of furfural at lower concentrations of glucose 0 50 1 50 mg l the percentage of furfural degradation was 34 38 at 10h incubation in contrast this percentage of furfural degradation was drastically increased nearly 78 with 2 00 mg l glucose at the same incubation time at higher concentrations of glucose from 2 50 to 3 00 mg l bacterial growth and degradation of furfural were observed at a faintly higher rate 82 86 however degradation rates decreased with increasing substrate concentration chirife et al 1983 jean et al 2008 similar results are found in the previous report of boyer et al where other compounds such as furfural and 5 hydroxy methyl furfural hmf inhibited microbial growth boyer et al 1992 3 4 3 bacterial growth and time dependent degradation of furfural in the presence of suphala the degradation rates of furfural were decreased with the increase of incubation time except at a concentration of 1 00 mg l fig 3a table 3 for lower concentrations of suphala i e from 0 25 mg l to 1 00 mg l the degradation rates of furfural increased with an increase in substrate concentration however the degradation rates slowly decreased at higher concentrations compared to 1 00 mg l these results are similar to bacterial growth where our isolates exhibited a slightly toxic effect to high suphala fig 2b the maximum growth rate was noticed at a suphala concentration of 1 00 mg l whereas the degradation rate increased with increasing incubation time fig 3a table 3 similarly bacterial growth increased with an increase of glucose concentration up to 2 00 mg l and further growth was slightly decreased fig 2c also the degradation rate decreased within the concentration of 2 00 mg l but increased at higher concentrations 2 mg l given the same incubation time fig 3b furthermore the bacterial growth and furfural degradation demonstrated significant variation with ph figs 3c and 2d wierckx et al reported that most bio abatement processes are performed aerobically at near neutral ph wierckx et al 2011 koopman et al 2010 present results indicate that the degradation rates were significantly higher within the ph range 7 0 7 4 fig 3c table 3 with the maximum degradation rate at ph 7 2 the variations in the concentration of nutrients such as suphala and glucose at different ph conditions are shown in fig 4 statistical analysis revealed that bacterial growth furfural degradation and degradation rate were highest at suphala concentrations of 1 0 mg l and glucose concentrations of 2 mg l at ph 7 2 3 5 optimum conditions for furfural degradation by taguchi experimental design the significant factors and their levels are significant to optimize the furfural degradation table 2 shows the factors variable and their levels in the taguchi experimental design for biodegradation of furfural by p putida osbh3 gu329915 to evaluate the effects of different factors suphala glucose and ph each factor is assigned with three levels in presence of selected microorganism table 4 shows the layout of the l9 orthogonal array and the amount of furfural removal in the presence of p putida osbh3 gu329915 in each experiment the removal of furfural was noticed in all trials and experiment the maximum and minimum removal was exhibited in trial 5 498 57 mg l and 6 106 25 mg l respectively the l9 orthogonal array is clearly indicated that p putida osbh3 gu329915 is effective microorganism for removal of furfural because of its resistance to the furfural toxicity among different factors suphala was very influential at level 2 1 00 mg l whereas the effects of ph and glucose concentration were higher in level 2 ph 7 and level 2 2 0 mg l respectively based on the l9 orthogonal array study the ph and suphala showed a stronger influence on furfural removal followed by glucose table 5 the significant factor and interaction influence clearly indicates that suphala is more influenced to degrade the furfural in the presence of p putida osbh3 gu329915 tables 6 and 7 3 6 microbial metabolism of furfural the concentration of furfural in modified culture medium dropped rapidly from 500 mg l on 0h to below the detection limit within 12h of incubation correspondingly in the aquas medium the acetic acid is produced the concentration of acetic acid increased gradually from 0h zero hours and the corresponding ph of the experimental medium decreased from ph 7 2 to 5 2 fig 3d thus the furfural was used by p putida osbh3 gu329915 as the sole carbon source for growth and transform to acetic acid furthermore the degradation rates of furfural were decreased in higher concentration of suphala and glucose due to toxic effect to microorganism it is noted that the transformations of furfural fig 5 by p putida osbh3 in the presence of suphala has not been reported earlier the previous researcher reported that the furfural metabolism take place in a putative route of p putida strains fu1 and f2 koopman et al 2010 koenig and andreesen 1990 trudgill 1969 the unique enzyme encoded by hmfe likely 2 oxoglutaroyl coa thioester hydrolase trudgill 1969 and homologues genes of p putida fu1 lysr type regulator gene were involved for furfural degradation nichols and mertens 2008 it was necessary to find intermediates to elucidate the pathway of furfural degradation in the osbh3 strain however we could not detect compounds other than acetic acid in these experiments similar results were reported earlier on the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria on furfural resulting in acetic acid production boopathy and daniels 1991 most studies of furfural degradation have been reported for anaerobic conditions involving sulfate reducing bacteria or methanogenic bacteria boopathy and daniels 1991 belay et al 1997 the biodegradation of furfural is important to the remediation of oil refinery paper mill and oatmeal processing effluent as well as the development of eco friendly wastewater management the present study shows the usefulness of p putida osbh3 gu329915 for complete transformation of furfural also the conversion of highly toxic furfural to less toxic acetic acid and successively non toxic alcohol suggest a beneficial role of micro organisms in wastewater treatment plants it is very relevant that the degradation efficiency of these bacteria can be increased with the use of an inexpensive fertilizer suphala and glucose in the wastewater treatment plant to promote bacterial growth and subsequent bioremediation of furfural 4 conclusions the indigenous isolate p putida osbh3 compared to p aeruginosa osbh4 was found more efficiently to degrade the furfural in aqueous environment in the presence of suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer media the concentrations of inorganic nutrient suphala either in the lower range 0 75 mg l suphala or in the higher range 1 25 mg l are strongly effect on the bacterial growth and furfural degradation where the degradation furfural is limited thus higher concentration of nutrient may exhibit the toxic effects the p putida are used the furfural as the sole carbon source for their growth and converted it to acetic acid study demonstrates the morphological adoption of p putida as well as the degradation of furfural that are strongly influenced by nutrient levels experimentally statistically and optimum conditions of significant factors for furfural degradation by taguchi experimental design revealed that bacterial growth furfural degradation and rate of degradation were highest at suphala concentrations of 1 0 mg l and glucose concentrations of 2 mg l at ph 7 2 thus the effective indigenous microbes p putida and an inexpensive nutrient suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer can be useful for degrading the furfural in biological effluent treatment plants betp moreover when amended with the low cost nutrient suphala these isolates may represent an applicable strategy for eco friendly biodegradation or biotransformation of furfural in industrial betp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11731,the release of furfural as effluent from industries has been considered a major pollution source since it adversely affects health and the environment in a proper nutrient condition the indigenous microbial removal process is always considered efficient economical and eco friendly thus the main objective is to employ the effective indigenous bacteria to remove the furfural from wastewater in the present study the indigenous isolates osbh3 strain number and osbh4 strain number were isolated from furfural containing oily sludge and were identified by 16s rrna technique with 99 nucleotide similarity as pseudomonas putida p putida acc no gu329915 and pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa acc no gu329916 respectively in a batch experiment the furfural degradation was observed higher in the presence of the most efficient isolate p putida compare to p aeruginosa at different nutrient conditions including suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer glucose and carbohydrate free synthetic media cfm generally the furfural degradation rate was lower in cfm than the other substrates nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer glucose in the presence of p putida or p aeruginosa the furfural degradation efficiency was observed higher in presence of p putida compare to p aeruginosa experimentally the total 100 degradation of furfural 500 mg l was noticed by p putida within 12h incubation time in presence of 1 mg l suphala even among different factors based on taguchi l9 orthogonal array study the suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer was influential in degrading the furfural at level 2 where the effects of ph and glucose were noticed at level 2 and level 2 respectively the experimental findings supported the orthogonal array study positively the bacterial p putida growth rate and furfural degradation were promoted at the condition of 1 mg l suphala 2 mg l glucose ph 7 2 where the furfural was used by p putida as the sole carbon source for growth thus the indigenous p putida osbh3 acc no gu329915 in presence of modified nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer media can be applicable for furfural toxic remediation from industrial effluent water by the eco friendly process graphical abstract image 1 keywords furfural microbial treatment nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer media p putida and p aeruginosa orthogonal study data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the demand of water is increasing by growing populations urbanization and industrialization coupled with low rainfall which has ultimately led to water scarcity in many areas of the world ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 akbar et al 2022 the effluent water from industrial operations causes widespread pollution on available freshwater resources ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 thus several biological and chemical technologies have emerged to treat the effluent before it is discharged into water bodies ajala et al 2022 kanaujiya et al 2019 wu et al 2010 there are few technologies which adopt to recycle and reuse the wastewater mukherjee et al 2020 bdour et al 2009 the eco friendly and cost effectiveness also play an important role in determining the adoption of appropriate technologies for the effluent treatment process numerous industries e g petrochemical industries oil refineries etc use cow dung di ammonium phosphate and urea for their effluent treatment as a cost effective way mukherjee et al 2020 ahmad and bhattacharya 2021 ajala et al 2022 kanaujiya et al 2019 otokunefor and obiukwu 2010 chinnaraj and rao 2006 muruganandam et al 2008 agrawal 2001 vijayaraghavan et al 2007 however the use of effective microbes em in effluent treatment plants represents a crucial biological treatment method banerjee et al 2013 samal et al 2004 2021 the release of complex chemicals from petrochemical industries oil refineries oil processing and other chemical plants into the surrounding environment has been considered as a major source of soil air and water pollution radelyuk et al 2021 iliev et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 many of these complex chemicals materials are less biodegradable or act as inhibitors for biological systems and often have toxic effects on living systems a chemical of such character is furfural which is an aromatic aldehyde with a cyclic structure it is an excellent organic solvent used in oil extraction units of oil refineries and in petrochemical refining to extract dienes from other hydrocarbons furfural is the general component of wastewater in petrochemical industries or oil refineries which is released and mixed to the wastewater after being used as a selective solvent for refining lubricating oils rosin diesel fuel and catalytic cracker recycle stocks rahmani et al 2020 boopathy and daniels 1991 boopathy 2002 it is important to mention that the furfural effects on the skin mucous membrane respiratory system liver kidney etc furthermore the furfural is moderately toxic to aquatic species thus the removal of furfural is an important issue in current day research the degradation removal of furfural under anaerobic conditions by sulfate reducing bacteria has been reported in earlier studies boopathy and daniels 1991 boopathy 2002 also furfural has been studied intensively where furfural conversion to furan methanol fm furfuryl alcohol has been established by saccharomyces cerevisiae morimoto and murakami m 1967 banerjee et al 1981 villa et al 1992 nemirovskii et al 1989 taherzadeh et al 2000 zhao et al 2005 gorsich et al 2006 almeida et al 2008 liu et al 2008 li and yuan 2010 the bacillus genus bacillus licheniformis microbacterium sp and brevundimonas sp are capable of the biotransformation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural becerra et al 2022 farías et al 2022 in another study the aerobic degradation of 2 furoic acid by p putida fu1 has been reported by koenig and andreesen 1989 and p putida f2 by kitcher et al 1972 nichols and mertens 2008 reported that the genes of p putida fu1 involved metabolizing the furfural through a pathway involving conversion to 2 oxoglutarate via 2 furoic acid fa and coenzyme a intermediates furthermore coniochaeta ligniaria c8 nrrl 30616 is able to degrade furfural lópez et al 2004 furfural is inhibitory to microorganisms at low concentrations 1 12 mm yet many wastes that contain furfural are otherwise appropriate for biological treatment especially anaerobic digestion morris et al 1979 thus different microbes exhibit different degradation efficiency and even similar species exhibit differential degradation responses under strain levels genetically engineered bacteria in some cases show efficient however indigenous microbes are always exhibited efficient cost effective and eco friendly unfortunately there are insufficient reports regarding the degradation of furfural from wastewater using effective indigenous microbes under aerobic conditions furthermore there is limited information about the estimation of furfural degradation factors that influence the performance criteria and which factors are more important and effective than others considering this background the objective of the research is to identify and utilize the effective indigenous bacteria isolated from refinery oily sludge for the bioremediation of furfural in oil refinery wastewater the research was also conducted to optimize the furfural degradation efficiency by effective indigenous bacteria under different substrate conditions nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer etc furthermore the present research estimates the factors that influence the performance criteria and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of bacteria and furfural degradation experiments the indigenous bacteria used by enriching under

and maheshwari 2005 where only furfural was used as carbon source in modified cfm the degradation of furfural was found to be very slow section 3 2 representing a drawback for efficient industrial effluent treatment to understand how to improve the degradation of furfural the research performed in different sets of experiments by varying different factors glucose suphala and ph at different

indigenous bacteria of 11 successfully isolated strains only osbh3 and osbh4 were able to degrade furfural efficiently in comparison the indigenous isolate osbh3 is more efficient in removing the furfural than osbh4 the isolates osbh3 and osbh4 were identified as pseudomonas spp accession numbers gu329915 and gu329916 respectively using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis 16s rrna sequence provided a fast and accurate method to identify the osbh3 and osbh4 phylogeny positions full length about 1500 bp 16s rrna genes were sequenced and used to construct a phylogenetic tree fig 1 the results showed that the verified isolate osbh3 was classified in the pseudomonas genera the nucleotide similarities between osbh3 accession no gu329915 and p putida am930519 p putida dq157470 p putida psegyrb2 p putida fj472858 p putida eu931564 p putida eu661866 and p putida gq303714 were each 99 0 fig 1 therefore osbh3 gu329915 was closely related to p putida this is belonging to pseudomonadaceae family gram negative rod shaped colony type bacteria a member of gamma proteobacteria gram stained cells were 0 5 0 8 μm wide 1 5 3 0 μm long this is a free living bacterium and is commonly found in soil and wastewater the isolated strain osbh4 was classified in the pseudomonas genera the nucleotides similarities between osbh4 accession no gu329916 and p aeruginosa fj90719 p aeruginosa ef05124 p aeruginosa dq09587 p aeruginosa ef53057 p aeruginosa gu19919 p aeruginosa fj97253 were each 99 0 respectively fig 1b therefore osbh4 gu329916 was found to be closely related to p aeruginosa koenig and andreesen identified as p putida which was isolated from an enrichment culture with 2 furoic acid koenig and andreesen 1989 nichols and mertens reported that p putida fu1 metabolizes the furfural nichols and mertens 2008 3 2 biodegradation of furfural in carbohydrate free synthetic media the p putida osbh3 gu329915 and p aeruginosa osbh4 gu329916 were isolated from a sludge sample containing furfural the experiments on furfural degradation by osbh3 and osbh4 were performed at different nutrient levels figs 2 and 3 the results indicate an increase in the concentration of nutrients would increase the furfural degradation figs 2 4 the isolates osbh3 and osbh4 were able to degrade furfural in laboratory experiments however because isolate osbh3 exhibited much greater efficiency in furfural degradation the study focuses to discuss on the selected strain for the remainder of the present study figs 2 and 3 in the batch experiment the osbh3 bacteria degraded 500 mg l furfural within 22h incubation time whereas osbh4 degraded the same concentration of furfural at 26h incubation time the experimental results exhibited that the degradation efficiency of furfural was noticed very low 10 after the first 6h incubation in cfm whereas 28 of furfural was degraded in the within 12h incubation time fig 2a the total degradation 100 of 500 mg l was observed after 22 26h in an ex situ experiment using the selected effective p putida osbh3 however the degradation of furfural in actual wastewater in situ was noticed at 8 12 during 24h without using selected effective bacteria by contrast the concentration of furfural was decreased up to 1 2 due to evaporation in the same duration for the blank experiment without bacteria fig 2a the maximum rate of bacterial growth was observed at 2 6h incubation time and these bacteria uses carbon source from furfural for their metabolism present result of bacterial growth in presence of furfural may be compared with the report of wierckx et al 2010 where the furfural metabolizing bacterium used furfural as the sole carbon source also the degradation of furfural depends upon microbial adaptation for their metabolic activity lin et al 2009 recent research reported that the several bacteria such as bacillus genus bacillus licheniformis microbacterium sp and brevundimonas sp are capable to biotransformation of 5 hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural by metabolic process becerra et al 2022 farías et al 2022 3 3 nutrient dependent bacterial growth in furfural environment the experiments were conducted to measure bacterial growth and furfural degradation by the p putida osbh3 at different nutrient levels fig 2b d and 3a c the results shows that the concentrations of inorganic nutrient were either in the lower range 0 75 mg l suphala or in the higher range of 1 25 mg l the bacterial growth and furfural degradation were limited fig 2b the bacterial growth biomass increases significantly with an increase of glucose concentration 1 mg l fig 2c where ph was varied from ph 4 to ph 8 fig 2d and maximum growth of the bacteria was noticed at ph 7 2 it is noted that the maximum bacterial growth 3 109 5 109 cell ml observed at higher glucose concentrations and lower concentrations of suphala 1 mg l at ph 7 2 the previous researchers were reported that the furfural degrading sulfate reducers reached counts of 1 107 5 8 107 cells ml and acetotrophic methanogens reached their highest numbers of 1 3 108 2 6 108 cells ml ney et al 1990 boopathy 2009 which is lower value in comparison with the present study 3 4 degradation of furfural in different conditions of nutrients the p putida osbh3 degraded furfural in the presence of various nutrients fig 2b c and at different ph levels fig 2d 3 4 1 inorganic suphala nutrient dependent degradation of furfural the furfural degradation efficiency was higher in presence of p putida osbh3 compared to p aeruginosa osbh4 data not shown the growth of osbh3 was found to be very poor at low concentrations of suphala inorganic substrate below 0 75 mg l fig 2b and the degradation transformation of furfural was also very low the furfural degradation was observed at only 62 after 12h incubation using 0 75 mg l of suphala however the degradation was noticed at 49 and 31 after the same incubation period 12h at substrate concentrations of 0 5 mg l and 0 25 mg l of suphala respectively similar trends were observed at higher substrate concentrations 1 25 mg l of suphala only 53 and 36 of furfural were degraded at 1 25 mg l and 1 50 mg l respectively after 12h incubation however total 100 degradation of furfural was observed at a substrate concentration of 1 mg l suphala which is very specific for p putida osbh3 the finding was consistent with the results for p putida osbh3 growth present results are comparable with the previous report where the microbial species were capable of degrading furanic compounds wierckx et al 2011 however the level of nutrient dependent degradation was not reported in another report hong et al 1981 described pseudomonas sp strain fs 1 which degraded 2 furoic acid and also koenig and andreesen reported aerobic degradation of 2 furoic acid by p putida fu1 koenig and andreesen 1989 thus in the present study the indigenous p putida osbh3 removes the furfural by and novel inorganic nutrient suphala media 3 4 2 organic glucose nutrient dependent degradation of furfural the p putida osbh3 shows glucose concentration dependent growth and furfural degradation with time the degradation of furfural increased with increasing incubation time for each concentration of glucose and with increasing glucose substrate concentrations such as 0 50 mg l 1 00 mg l 1 50 mg l 2 00 mg l 2 50 mg l and 3 00 mg l fig 2c the research findings indicate that the substrate glucose may promote bacterial growth and associated degradation of furfural at lower concentrations of glucose 0 50 1 50 mg l the percentage of furfural degradation was 34 38 at 10h incubation in contrast this percentage of furfural degradation was drastically increased nearly 78 with 2 00 mg l glucose at the same incubation time at higher concentrations of glucose from 2 50 to 3 00 mg l bacterial growth and degradation of furfural were observed at a faintly higher rate 82 86 however degradation rates decreased with increasing substrate concentration chirife et al 1983 jean et al 2008 similar results are found in the previous report of boyer et al where other compounds such as furfural and 5 hydroxy methyl furfural hmf inhibited microbial growth boyer et al 1992 3 4 3 bacterial growth and time dependent degradation of furfural in the presence of suphala the degradation rates of furfural were decreased with the increase of incubation time except at a concentration of 1 00 mg l fig 3a table 3 for lower concentrations of suphala i e from 0 25 mg l to 1 00 mg l the degradation rates of furfural increased with an increase in substrate concentration however the degradation rates slowly decreased at higher concentrations compared to 1 00 mg l these results are similar to bacterial growth where our isolates exhibited a slightly toxic effect to high suphala fig 2b the maximum growth rate was noticed at a suphala concentration of 1 00 mg l whereas the degradation rate increased with increasing incubation time fig 3a table 3 similarly bacterial growth increased with an increase of glucose concentration up to 2 00 mg l and further growth was slightly decreased fig 2c also the degradation rate decreased within the concentration of 2 00 mg l but increased at higher concentrations 2 mg l given the same incubation time fig 3b furthermore the bacterial growth and furfural degradation demonstrated significant variation with ph figs 3c and 2d wierckx et al reported that most bio abatement processes are performed aerobically at near neutral ph wierckx et al 2011 koopman et al 2010 present results indicate that the degradation rates were significantly higher within the ph range 7 0 7 4 fig 3c table 3 with the maximum degradation rate at ph 7 2 the variations in the concentration of nutrients such as suphala and glucose at different ph conditions are shown in fig 4 statistical analysis revealed that bacterial growth furfural degradation and degradation rate were highest at suphala concentrations of 1 0 mg l and glucose concentrations of 2 mg l at ph 7 2 3 5 optimum conditions for furfural degradation by taguchi experimental design the significant factors and their levels are significant to optimize the furfural degradation table 2 shows the factors variable and their levels in the taguchi experimental design for biodegradation of furfural by p putida osbh3 gu329915 to evaluate the effects of different factors suphala glucose and ph each factor is assigned with three levels in presence of selected microorganism table 4 shows the layout of the l9 orthogonal array and the amount of furfural removal in the presence of p putida osbh3 gu329915 in each experiment the removal of furfural was noticed in all trials and experiment the maximum and minimum removal was exhibited in trial 5 498 57 mg l and 6 106 25 mg l respectively the l9 orthogonal array is clearly indicated that p putida osbh3 gu329915 is effective microorganism for removal of furfural because of its resistance to the furfural toxicity among different factors suphala was very influential at level 2 1 00 mg l whereas the effects of ph and glucose concentration were higher in level 2 ph 7 and level 2 2 0 mg l respectively based on the l9 orthogonal array study the ph and suphala showed a stronger influence on furfural removal followed by glucose table 5 the significant factor and interaction influence clearly indicates that suphala is more influenced to degrade the furfural in the presence of p putida osbh3 gu329915 tables 6 and 7 3 6 microbial metabolism of furfural the concentration of furfural in modified culture medium dropped rapidly from 500 mg l on 0h to below the detection limit within 12h of incubation correspondingly in the aquas medium the acetic acid is produced the concentration of acetic acid increased gradually from 0h zero hours and the corresponding ph of the experimental medium decreased from ph 7 2 to 5 2 fig 3d thus the furfural was used by p putida osbh3 gu329915 as the sole carbon source for growth and transform to acetic acid furthermore the degradation rates of furfural were decreased in higher concentration of suphala and glucose due to toxic effect to microorganism it is noted that the transformations of furfural fig 5 by p putida osbh3 in the presence of suphala has not been reported earlier the previous researcher reported that the furfural metabolism take place in a putative route of p putida strains fu1 and f2 koopman et al 2010 koenig and andreesen 1990 trudgill 1969 the unique enzyme encoded by hmfe likely 2 oxoglutaroyl coa thioester hydrolase trudgill 1969 and homologues genes of p putida fu1 lysr type regulator gene were involved for furfural degradation nichols and mertens 2008 it was necessary to find intermediates to elucidate the pathway of furfural degradation in the osbh3 strain however we could not detect compounds other than acetic acid in these experiments similar results were reported earlier on the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria on furfural resulting in acetic acid production boopathy and daniels 1991 most studies of furfural degradation have been reported for anaerobic conditions involving sulfate reducing bacteria or methanogenic bacteria boopathy and daniels 1991 belay et al 1997 the biodegradation of furfural is important to the remediation of oil refinery paper mill and oatmeal processing effluent as well as the development of eco friendly wastewater management the present study shows the usefulness of p putida osbh3 gu329915 for complete transformation of furfural also the conversion of highly toxic furfural to less toxic acetic acid and successively non toxic alcohol suggest a beneficial role of micro organisms in wastewater treatment plants it is very relevant that the degradation efficiency of these bacteria can be increased with the use of an inexpensive fertilizer suphala and glucose in the wastewater treatment plant to promote bacterial growth and subsequent bioremediation of furfural 4 conclusions the indigenous isolate p putida osbh3 compared to p aeruginosa osbh4 was found more efficiently to degrade the furfural in aqueous environment in the presence of suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer media the concentrations of inorganic nutrient suphala either in the lower range 0 75 mg l suphala or in the higher range 1 25 mg l are strongly effect on the bacterial growth and furfural degradation where the degradation furfural is limited thus higher concentration of nutrient may exhibit the toxic effects the p putida are used the furfural as the sole carbon source for their growth and converted it to acetic acid study demonstrates the morphological adoption of p putida as well as the degradation of furfural that are strongly influenced by nutrient levels experimentally statistically and optimum conditions of significant factors for furfural degradation by taguchi experimental design revealed that bacterial growth furfural degradation and rate of degradation were highest at suphala concentrations of 1 0 mg l and glucose concentrations of 2 mg l at ph 7 2 thus the effective indigenous microbes p putida and an inexpensive nutrient suphala nitrogen phosphorous fertilizer can be useful for degrading the furfural in biological effluent treatment plants betp moreover when amended with the low cost nutrient suphala these isolates may represent an applicable strategy for eco friendly biodegradation or biotransformation of furfural in industrial betp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

government and gw users coupled with ineffective gw policies to control gw extraction in the last two decades muenratch et al 2022 piyapong et al 2019 strong institutional capacity and policy instruments are essential to intervene in the gw use by influencing the behaviour of gw users to reduce and control groundwater consumption among different users toward sustainable groundwater governance 2 material and methods 2 1 study area groundwater extraction has been rising over the last two decades 2000 2019 in 2019 gw was extracted from almost 13 mm3 and 5 mm3 by the business and agricultural sectors respectively muenratch et al 2022 through khon kaen case study fig 1 different groups of users tend to use groundwater as a major source due to drought and socio economic development however there has been a lack of setting the conservation charge free gw charge for agricultural purposes in many areas muenratch et al 2022 dean et al 2021 and a lack of collaboration between local government and gw users muenratch and nguyen 2022 piyapong et al 2019 thus the gw saving behaviour is necessary to promote in the study area to cope with the challenge of sustainable gw extraction to response to sustainable development goals 2 2 questionnaires survey 338 respondents were randomly selected based on the sampling frame gw user lists using the yamane formula at 5 significant the sample size is required at least 334 the proportionate stratified random sampling formula was used to calculate the proportion of each sample group stratified random sampling is used for the sampling method the questionnaires are designed based on the theory of planned behaviour tpb the questionnaire includes socio demographic characteristics the self perception of gw saving and gw saving behaviour 2 3 data analysis the probit regression model was used to examine the current groundwater saving practice binary dependent variables y i which will be explained by independent variables x i the data is processed in stata se 16 1 meanwhile the structural equation model sem was used to analyze the pathway of intention toward groundwater saving behaviour seven latent constructs based on tpb were created in the model and estimated the standardized coefficient β and p value in the stata se 16 1 sem tests theoretical models by using the scientific hypothesis testing method to understand the complex relationships among latent variables schumacker et al 2004 the model modification was conducted to the model fit rmsea 0 0001 cfi 1 tli 1 srmr 0 0001 a set of hypotheses to test in the sem model based on tpb h1 behavioral beliefs may influence attitude h2 normative beliefs may influence subjective norms h3 control beliefs may influence perceived behavioral control h4 attitude may influence intention h5 subjective norms may influence intention h6 perceived behavioral control may influence intention 3 results 3 1 respondents profile table 1 shows the sociodemographic of respondents who are gw users in different sectors most of the respondents are female 63 6 age groups 46 60 years old 47 6 primary school 50 they are all thai and buddhism they were from the business sector 37 3 agricultural sector 32 5 and domestic use 30 2 3 2 self perception of gw saving groundwater plays a crucial role in socio economic development in the study area dean et al 2021 2021 people use gw for domestic use agriculture industry and tourism they reflected that public wells for agriculture were supported by the department of groundwater resources bureau of groundwater resources regional 4 and the provincial energy department the government projects aim to support gw in the agricultural sector to mitigate drought risk in the fields where located outside the irrigation area dgr 2017 2021 fig 2 shows the self perception of gw saving by gw users the result shows 34 30 of users in the business sector assessed they save gw while 29 30 of users in agriculture and 29 of users in domestic use also identified they save gw self perception on gw saving can reduce unsustainable gw use in the future therefore we investigate the factors influencing the self perception of gw saving routine to understand how to increase gw saving perception in the future table 2 shows the factors influencing the self perception of gw saving by using the probit regression model the results show agricultural sector β 0 98 p 0 01 has a negative influence on self perception of their gw saving at a statistically significant level changing other sectors to the agricultural sector the self perception of gw saving tends to decrease in z score by 0 98 at a statistical significance level awareness of impacts from high groundwater abstraction β 0 89 p 0 002 has an impact on the self perception of gw saving at a statistically significant level high gw tariff β 0 78 p 0 02 and adequate knowledge and information β 1 16 p 0 015 have impact on the self perception of gw saving at statistically significant level thus these policy options can be considered to support the gw saving programs in the future 3 3 the determinants of intention toward gw saving behaviour prediction of intention toward gw saving behaviour is significant to respond to sustainable gw use psychological factors are the key determinant to change human behaviour in this study gw saving behaviour is necessary to be performed in the study area due to the gw having been high extraction muenratch et al 2022 appendix a presents the descriptive statistical values of attitude att subjective norms sn perceived behavioral control pbc and intention toward gw saving behaviour of gw users in khon kaen the values are shown as mean median mode and standard deviation to explain the central tendency of the data it is found that gw users have a quite high average level of pbc mean 4 77 attitude mean 4 35 intention mean 3 85 and subjective norms mean 3 29 meanwhile appendix b presents the descriptive statistical values of beliefs in groundwater saving behaviour in khon kaen the values of mean median mode and standard deviation are explained the central tendency of the data it is found that gw users have a high average level of behavioral belief bb mean 4 61 however control belief cb mean 3 74 and normative belief nb mean 3 14 are in moderate level fig 3 presents the structural equation model to predict gw saving behaviour in the future we found subjective norms β 0 52 p 0 001 and pbc β 0 21 p 0 001 have a positive impact on intention toward gw saving behaviour while attitude β 0 0036 p 0 94 has no influence on intention in another construct we found behavioral belief bb β 0 38 p 0 001 has influenced attitude normative belief nb β 0 83 p 0 001 has influenced subjective norms control belief cb β 0 2 p 0 001 has influenced pbc consequently the findings accepted the 5 hypotheses except for h4 attitude may influence intention 4 discussion our findings highlight that gw users in the agricultural sector need to be targeted for controlling gw use as they tend to have low self perception in gw saving however we found the factors that positively impact gw saving perception awareness of impacts from high groundwater abstraction adequate knowledge and information and high gw tariff many studies confirmed that awareness knowledge and information and water pricing significantly enhance the perception of water users for sustainable water management bhattacharya et al 2022 cary 2008 espejo et al 2021 nocella et al 2022 villholth 2006 zuthi et al 2022 thus these factors are the key intervention for sustainable gw management due to the exemption of gw tariff for agricultural purposes farmers tend to use gw regardless of saving manner specifically the area without tap water access liangsatjatham 2019 meanwhile people who use gw in the tap water access area khon kaen outside the critical zone have been charged only 3 50 th b m3 around 0 09 us dollars m3 muenratch et al 2022 thus water pricing is the one of economic instruments that can be the solution to change the behaviour of people upadhyaya et al 2022 soto rios et al 2018 further knowledge also affects practices and induces a change in human behaviour see allan et al 2013 liao et al 2022 nocella et al 2022 zuthi et al 2022 therefore providing adequate knowledge and information about gw impacts can enhance the awareness and perception of gw saving in communities baldwin et al 2012 bhangaonkar and fennell 2022 as a consequence agricultural gw users should be engaged in the policy making process to transform their behaviour to sustainable gw use in this present study intention toward gw saving behaviour is revealed we found that subjective norms have an impact on gw saving behaviour in khon kaen thailand many researchers agreed that subjective norms have a positive impact on intention toward water conservation practices and waste reduction see cary 2008 fang et al 2017 gibson et al 2021 thakur et al 2022 in contrast tatar et al 2022 argued that subjective norms do not influence the intention to manifest water conflict the context of water conflict may differ from the water conservation context sn may not have an effect in this study perceived behavioral control also has an impact on the intention toward gw saving behaviour significantly this study is in line with abadi 2017 who highlights that pbc has strongly influenced water conservation behaviour rather than other factors if pbc is highlighted to farmers ability there is no need the interventions from related organizations another paper agrees that pbc has a strong factor to explain recycling intention botetzagias et al 2015 meanwhile pbc has influenced residents intentions toward water conservation initiatives upstream of west java indonesia nugroho et al 2022 thus our finding shows the key role of pbc on gw saving behaviour although our finding reveals that attitude does not influence intention toward gw saving behaviour other studies found attitude has a positive influence on intention toward water conservation water saving behaviour wastewater management conservation agriculture and waste management behaviour see bagheri and teymouri 2022 obuobi et al 2022 sadeghfam and abadi 2021 si et al 2022 tama et al 2021 it is possible to recognize the impact of attitude depends on the various context of different case studies thus this study confirms the theoretical model of tpb except for attitude which does not affect intention toward behaviour another construct normative beliefs nb have a strong impact on subjective norms sn this result is confirmed by fang et al 2017 who found the effect of nb on sn toward waste reduction behaviour thus nb is an important factor in influencing subjective norms to shape the intention toward behaviour however there might be inherent uncertainty in the predicting model because of the complexity of independent explanatory variables many variables such as demographic socioeconomic experience awareness knowledge and perception haven t been considered within the model these variables might be important in influencing the gw saving intentional behaviour future research is suggested to develop a more comprehensive predicting model which includes as much as possible of the above mentioned uncontrollable variables to improve the accuracy of the predicting results 5 policy implications our findings can support the challenge of gw policy formulation by integrating the role of human behaviour to enhance sustainable gw use even though many policies regarding gw management i e gw license gw pricing regulatory policies etc have been implemented under the gw act gw abstraction in the study area is not relatively reduced muenratch et al 2022 in this study the findings can address the policy gaps to lead the role of gw saving behaviour to control the gw abstraction policymakers can apply these findings to formulate the gw policy and target specific groups of gw users to sustain the gw resources at the community level policymakers can formulate a program about the awareness raising of gw impacts to enhance the capacity of gw users to balance gw resources additionally gw data and information should be provided for the end users to perceive the status of gw at the community level however increasing the gw tariff is the one option that can be considered for agricultural gw use to induce farmers to have more responsible consumption of gw resources family activities gw user networks and collaboration in communities are important to the target of the saving behaviour program this study revealed people tend to believe people who are important to them to perform gw saving behaviour it is possible to enhance the knowledge about gw saving in their community and let family neighbours peers friends and local governments encourage gw users to save this resource promote gw saving campaign i e which household can reduce water use within 1 3 months the big gifts will be provided or the household name will be announced and honoured in their community this activity will influence gw users to perform gw saving behaviour through the role of social pressures thus our findings can be a guideline to promote the saving behaviour program to reduce gw extraction in the case study 6 conclusion this study provides the key findings to understand the perception of gw saving and the intention toward gw saving behaviour that is shaped at the community level in the case study people depend on gw resources in their economic activities and daily life over a long period our findings reveal key factors determining gw saving perception and predictors of their intention toward gw saving behaviour first the perception of gw saving has been negatively influenced by agricultural users due to the free gw charge furthermore awareness of groundwater over extraction impacts gw adequate knowledge and information and gw pricing are the key factors to enhance gw saving attitudes second the gw saving intentional behaviour has been influenced by subjective norms and perceived behavioral control regarding the theory of planned behaviour hence social pressures e g family activities gw user networks and collaboration among key actors in communities and sharing knowledge and information about sustainable gw use are the key policy interventions to shape the intention toward gw saving behaviour in the study area gw saving behaviour is thus a good option for policy strategies to shape the sustainable practice of gw users however maintaining gw saving behaviour is a future challenge therefore future studies need to be explored how to maintain the saving behaviour persistently to prevent the serious impact of gw over extraction in the long term institutional review board statement the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration

11732,promoting gw saving behaviour is one of the strategies to support sustainable groundwater use and management and climate change adaptation however few studies paid attention to gw saving behaviours to address this we surveyed gw users n 338 to investigate factors influencing current gw saving attitudes and how gw saving behaviour is shaped in the community through the theory of planned behaviour tpb participants were asked about the perception of their gw saving and water saving intentional behaviour the probit regression use deployed explore factors influencing water users perception of gw saving structural equation model sem was also used to construct the tpb variables to investigate psychological factors influencing gw saving intention behaviour the findings show water users in the agricultural sector β 0 98 p 0 01 are negative with gw saving bahavior changing to the users in the agricultural sector the self perception of gw saving tends to decrease in z score by 0 98 at a statistical significance level awareness of gw extraction impacts β 0 89 p 0 002 gw adequate knowledge and information β 1 16 p 0 015 and gw tariff β 0 78 p 0 02 have strongly influenced gw saving behaviour the gw saving intentional behaviour has been influenced by subjective norms β 0 52 p 0 001 and perceived behavioral control β 0 21 p 0 001 our findings suggest that gw policy options should pay attention to gw tariff application awareness raising about gw impacts gw knowledge dissemination to control gw abstraction in the community and enhance gw water saving attitude and behaviour in the community the study also appeals to the engagement of local community in water governance to increase the social pressures on water saving changing behaviors graphical abstract image

introduction groundwater gw has been developed for socioeconomic development and climate change adaptation worldwide unesco 2022 in 2021 69 of gw is abstracted for irrigation while 22 has been extracted for domestic use and 9 for industrial purposes however asia is the largest gw abstractor in the world 64 5 of total gw volume unesco 2022 it is necessary to pay attention to gw extraction among gw users to understand the behavioral aspects of human society additionally good groundwater governance relies on gw users who are the key factor determining the dynamic of gw resources chaisemartin et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 therefore understanding gw saving behaviours is one of the strategies to support sustainable groundwater extraction response to socio economic development and climate change adaptation thakur et al 2022 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 gw users behaviour is under the actor which is the key component of groundwater governance chaisemartin et al 2017 in thailand the gw tariff for agricultural purposes is still free in several areas and this sector tended to use more volume than necessary coupled with weak law enforcement in limitation of use liangsatjatham 2019 thus the gw saving behaviour program is a challenge for policy intervention due to the individual practice and it is difficult to change in a short time several pieces of research confirmed the significance of determinants of water saving or conservation behaviour koop et al 2019 liu et al 2022 su et al 2021 thakur et al 2022 it is essential to explore the key factors influencing gw saving behaviour to enhance the roles of involvement of gw users in gwg understanding the key determinants of gw saving behaviour provides valuable information to inform policymakers about the strategies to change the behaviour fielding et al 2012 theory of planned behaviour tpb has been introduced by ajzen 1991 2020 it is currently applied in many environmental researches to examine the roles of psychological factors toward behaviour see abadi 2017 bagheri and teymouri 2022 fang et al 2017 nugroho et al 2022 obuobi et al 2022 sadeghfam and abadi 2021 si et al 2022 tama et al 2021 thakur et al 2022 water management needs to be addressed by the tpb to explore how to change individual behaviour thus gw saving behaviour is significant to change gw users behaviour to reduce gw consumption for sustainable groundwater management mondéjar jiménez et al 2011 this paper aims to investigate factors influencing the self perception of gw saving and how intention toward gw saving behaviour can be shaped in the community through the theory of planned behaviour the findings will be useful for policymakers policy implementers local governments gw users and other stakeholders to understand how the gw saving behaviour is shaped and gw uses controls in the community including the way forward to change the gw users behaviour due to the lack of collaboration between local government and gw users coupled with ineffective gw policies to control gw extraction in the last two decades muenratch et al 2022 piyapong et al 2019 strong institutional capacity and policy instruments are essential to intervene in the gw use by influencing the behaviour of gw users to reduce and control groundwater consumption among different users toward sustainable groundwater governance 2 material and methods 2 1 study area groundwater extraction has been rising over the last two decades 2000 2019 in 2019 gw was extracted from almost 13 mm3 and 5 mm3 by the business and

prediction of intention toward gw saving behaviour is significant to respond to sustainable gw use psychological factors are the key determinant to change human behaviour in this study gw saving behaviour is necessary to be performed in the study area due to the gw having been high extraction muenratch et al 2022 appendix a presents the descriptive statistical values of attitude att

presents the descriptive statistical values of beliefs in groundwater saving behaviour in khon kaen the values of mean median mode and standard deviation are explained the central tendency of the data it is found that gw users have a high average level of behavioral belief bb mean 4 61 however control belief cb mean 3 74 and normative belief nb mean 3 14 are in moderate level fig 3 presents the structural equation model to predict gw saving behaviour in the future we found subjective norms β 0 52 p 0 001 and pbc β 0 21 p 0 001 have a positive impact on intention toward gw saving behaviour while attitude β 0 0036 p 0 94 has no influence on intention in another construct we found behavioral belief bb β 0 38 p 0 001 has influenced attitude normative belief nb β 0 83 p 0 001 has influenced subjective norms control belief cb β 0 2 p 0 001 has influenced pbc consequently the findings accepted the 5 hypotheses except for h4 attitude may influence intention 4 discussion our findings highlight that gw users in the agricultural sector need to be targeted for controlling gw use as they tend to have low self perception in gw saving however we found the factors that positively impact gw saving perception awareness of impacts from high groundwater abstraction adequate knowledge and information and high gw tariff many studies confirmed that awareness knowledge and information and water pricing significantly enhance the perception of water users for sustainable water management bhattacharya et al 2022 cary 2008 espejo et al 2021 nocella et al 2022 villholth 2006 zuthi et al 2022 thus these factors are the key intervention for sustainable gw management due to the exemption of gw tariff for agricultural purposes farmers tend to use gw regardless of saving manner specifically the area without tap water access liangsatjatham 2019 meanwhile people who use gw in the tap water access area khon kaen outside the critical zone have been charged only 3 50 th b m3 around 0 09 us dollars m3 muenratch et al 2022 thus water pricing is the one of economic instruments that can be the solution to change the behaviour of people upadhyaya et al 2022 soto rios et al 2018 further knowledge also affects practices and induces a change in human behaviour see allan et al 2013 liao et al 2022 nocella et al 2022 zuthi et al 2022 therefore providing adequate knowledge and information about gw impacts can enhance the awareness and perception of gw saving in communities baldwin et al 2012 bhangaonkar and fennell 2022 as a consequence agricultural gw users should be engaged in the policy making process to transform their behaviour to sustainable gw use in this present study intention toward gw saving behaviour is revealed we found that subjective norms have an

11733,sudden increase of groundwater abstraction for water supply to a million forcefully migrated myanmar nationals rohingya in ukhia and teknaf upazila of cox s bazar district has created a threat to the sustainability of the dupi tila and tipam aquifers the primary source of drinking water for the host community reasonable estimation of groundwater recharge is crucial for understanding the sustainability of an aquifer therefore this study estimates groundwater recharge employing multiple methods such as i wetspass water balance model ii water table fluctuation wtf iii chloride mass balance cmb and iv empirical formulas ef and compares it with current withdrawal additionally the applicability of empirical formulas for recharge estimation in bangladesh has been evaluated which will benefit future groundwater studies requiring a rapid estimate of recharge from precipitation despite a large spatial variability in recharge the spatially mean annual groundwater recharge estimated by these methods is comparable to each other the estimated spatially mean annual volumetric groundwater recharge for the dupi tila and tipam aquifer is 135 and 122 million m3 y respectively most of the estimated groundwater abstraction of 49 million m3 y in this area is from the dupi tila aquifer which is about 36 of the annual recharge suggesting that the current withdrawal should be sustainable however since the rohingya camp abstraction is concentrated within a small area there is potential for a large cone of depression development in and around the camp which may adversely impact the wells of the host population in adjacent areas a numerical model is required to assess the extent of the cone and its impacts on host community wells this study also finds that the maxey eakin and sehgal formulas for precipitation based recharge estimation are the most suitable for this area and may be applied in other areas of bangladesh graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge rohingya refugees aquifer sustainability cmb wtf wetspass data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction safe water resources are vital for the social economic and environmental sustainability of a nation constituting over 98 of earth s available freshwater resources groundwater provides over 70 of the global irrigation water supply and 90 of consumptive water supply kimberly 2012 siebert et al 2010 in bangladesh groundwater fed irrigation has increased drastically over the last few decades kirby et al 2015 currently about 80 of the agricultural land is irrigated by groundwater and more than 90 of domestic water supply is from groundwater bbs 2015 ravenscroft 2009 as groundwater is a limited renewable resource it must be managed sustainably since late 2017 about a million forcefully displaced myanmar nationals ronhingya is living in several refugee camps in the ukhia and teknaf upazilas of the cox s bazar district with the largest concentration 0 75 million in the kutupalong mega camp fig 1 before migration of the rohingyas groundwater was abstracted only for the 0 86 million local community in the study area in early 2018 thousands of hand pump wells were installed throughout the mega camp for water supply to the rohingya population over the period of 2019 2021 the hand pump based water supply was replaced by more than 150 production wells with an average capacity of 85 m3 d well iom 2020 this sudden increase in groundwater withdrawal puts the sustainability of water resources of the whole region in question the ukhia and teknaf upazilas sub district of cox s bazar district bangladesh has a long term and established problem with drinking water resources geologically the area is complex and characterized by a series of synclines and anticlines and this setting made the area of limited groundwater resources besides surface water is prone to contamination because of poor sanitation and unawareness iwm 2018 therefore it is of utmost importance to assess the sustainability of the groundwater in this region as it is the primary source of drinking water for both the host community and rohingyas the quantification of groundwater recharge and its spatio temporal variability is the key to sustainable water resource management policy healy and cook 2002 loucks 2009 scanlon et al 2006 groundwater recharge is defined as the volume of water from different sources such as precipitation and glacier melt reaching the water table by infiltration through the unsaturated or vadose zone and replenishes the groundwater zone for a given time manna et al 2016 this replenishment of groundwater also occurs by lateral movement of water from adjacent aquifers from any other direction scanlon et al 2006 groundwater recharge can be estimated by a number of methods it is a good practice to determine recharge by several methods as large uncertainty exists in the estimation by a single method healy and cook 2002 it can be estimated directly using lysimeters tensiometers and or time domain reflectometry tdr probes allen et al 1991 baehr et al 2003 dreiss and anderson 1985 evett et al 1995 gburek w j folmar 1999 nimmo et al 1994 ward and gee 1997 wellings 1984 among the indirect methods water table fluctuation wtf is a simple and widely used method for groundwater recharge estimation it is based on aquifer characteristics and groundwater level fluctuations healy and scanlon 2010 hendrickx 1992 heppner and nimmo 2005 however in the wtf method groundwater recharge is calculated from water level observed at point location point estimates may not necessarily be representative of recharge over a wide area bresciani et al 2014 eriksson and khunakasem 1969 harrington et al 2002 chloride mass balance cmb is another commonly used indirect method of point estimation of recharge it is based on chloride concentration values in precipitation and groundwater additionally there are a number of empirical formulas ef for indirect estimation of mean annual groundwater recharge from precipitation apart from the above mentioned methods there are a number of physically based models that estimate groundwater recharge as a residual at the land surface between precipitation runoff and evaporation with the development of the geographic information system gis physical based hydrologic modeling has advanced for recharge estimation and or possible climate change on basin hydrology and water resources alemaw and chaoka 2003 each method of groundwater recharge estimation has some advantages and disadvantages the effectiveness of each method depends on the climate e g humid arid boreal and tropical topography hydrogeological setting availability of data and quality of data in many areas of bangladesh groundwater recharge has been estimated mostly by the water table fluctuation wtf method adham et al 2010 hoque and burgess 2012 hossain 2021 kanoua and merkel 2015 nowreen et al 2020 shahid et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2011 no study has been carried out so far that compares multiple methods of recharge estimation in bangladesh the objectives of this study are a estimation of groundwater recharge in a highly stressed aquifer in bangladesh using multiple recharge estimation methods b assessment of the sustainability of groundwater in the study area by comparing estimated demands and groundwater recharge and c compare various methods of recharge estimation and gain insights on their applicability in bangladesh 2 study area geographically the study area is located in the south eastern part of bangladesh and covers an area of about 92 km2 it is bounded by the bay of bengal in the west the naf river in the south east also separated from myanmar and the bandarban and chittagong district in the north fig 1 the study area is a part of the nne ssw trending indo burman fold belt the area is tapering towards the south and follows the geographic boundary of bangladesh thrust faulted anticlines and broad synclinal valleys are the major geomorphological features of this area fig 2 in the plain land of the synclinal part numerous hillocks gulleys dunes mudflats tidal creeks spits flood plains are small scale geomorphological features gani and alam 2003 the climate is characterized by moist tropical maritime with high rainfall concentrated during monsoon june september and a dry period of 4 5 months the average annual rainfall is about 4 m and experiences a 25 c annual average temperature the potential et remains almost constant throughout the year with a mean of about 1 3 m year fig 1 the surface geology compliments the stratigraphic settings of the study area the dupi tila formation plio pleistocene and the tipam sandstone formation pliocene are the main aquifers in the study area separated by an aquitard the girujan clay formation fig 2 the dupi tila aquifer is unconfined to semi confined the tipam aquifer is confined except where it is exposed the tipam sandstone aquifer is exposed around the dupi tila aquifer fig 2 the surma group bhuban and bokabil formations which is an alternating sandstone and shale unit cannot be specified as a useable aquifer due to low permeability and deeper depth of these units the tipam and dupi tila formations are mostly sandy porous and permeable 3 data and methodology wetspass model water table fluctuation wtf chloride mass balance cmb and empirical formula ef methods were used in this study to estimate the groundwater recharge to the aquifers of the study area the theoretical background of the groundwater recharge estimation methods used in this study is discussed in the following sections 3 1 wetspass method wetspass an acronym for water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state assimilate a water balance in a geographical information system gis environment ashaolu and olorunfemi 2020 batelaan and de smedt 2007 salem et al 2019 it is a technique for estimating spatially distributed long term average recharge in the humid temporal area batelaan 2001 the model treats an area as a regular pattern of raster cells where every raster cell is further subdivided in a vegetated bare soil open water and impervious surface fraction for which independent water balances are maintained groundwater recharge is simulated using wetspass as a residual of water balance kahsay et al 2019 by the following equation 1 r p s e t i where p is the average precipitation et is the actual evapotranspiration s is the surface runoff i is the interception by vegetation and r is the groundwater recharge to simulate recharge with the wetspass method gridded raster maps 10 m of land use soil texture slope elevation precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature wind speed and depth to groundwater level data have been used figs s1 s6 in esm the meteorological data of cox s bazar and teknaf stations were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd between 2001 and 2020 fig 1 these data were processed and interpolated over the study area to construct the required raster layers for the elevation grid 12 5 m resolution alos palsar dem was resampled to 10 m and the slope was calculated using the gis slope function figs s1a and b in esm the sentinel 2 satellite image spatial resolution 10 m was used for land use classification fig s1c in esm the soil map was created using the surface geology and the lithological characteristics of the geological units fig s1d in esm 3 2 water table fluctuation wtf method the principle of the wtf method is that the water level rise in the unconfined aquifer is due to the percolation or infiltration of the precipitation which is considered as recharge recharge is calculated in this method as 2 r s y δ h δ t where sy is the specific yield δh is the hydraulic head change and δt is the time interval for the recharge period somaratne and smettem 2014 to estimate recharge δh is considered equal to the difference between the peak of the rise and low point of the extrapolated antecedent recession curve at the time of the peak the antecedent recession curve is the trace that the well hydrograph would have followed in the absence of the water level rise from precipitation high frequency hourly groundwater level data has been collected for recharge estimation with the wtf method between november 2019 to march 2021 water level data were collected from 23 monitoring wells selected considering the spatial distribution data quality and screen depth for recharge calculation fig 1 these wells were classified as shallow and deep according to the depth of the monitoring well screen groundwater well screen depth greater than 150 m was considered as deep and less than 150 m as shallow among the 23 monitoring wells 9 wells were shallow and the rest 14 wells were deep both shallow and deep monitoring data were kept under consideration to assess the response of recharge with precipitation to the shallower and deeper part of the dupi tila and tipam sandstone aquifers the value of the specific yield was separately calculated for dupitila and tipam sandstone aquifers from well test data 3 3 chloride mass balance cmb method the chloride mass balance cmb method is a widely used recharge estimation method because it needs only analysis of chloride concentration in precipitation and groundwater scanlon et al 2006 during evapotranspiration chloride ions remain in the root zone but after precipitation the chloride ions dissolve with precipitated water to infiltrate into the aquifer which eventually increases the water level as recharge allison 1988 during this path concentration of chloride ions increases by dissolving chloride from the geological formation this method is not applicable in the karstic aquifer system because of the mineral composition of the karstic rock somaratne and smettem 2014 geologically the study area is characterized by sedimentary rock formations and the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system suggested that the chloride mass balance cmb method is suitable for groundwater recharge estimation in this method recharge is calculated by the following equation 3 r p e f f c l p c l g w where r is the annual groundwater recharge mm year peff is the effective precipitation mm year which is the total precipitation amount over the calculated time period subtracted from the runoff amount of that period clp is the chloride concentration in precipitation mg l and clgw is the chloride concentration in groundwater mg l bazuhair and wood 1996 groundwater samples were collected from 27 monitoring wells of the study area between 2019 and 2020 which are spatially distributed over the area for water chemistry analysis fig 1 among them 10 groundwater samples were collected from shallow wells depth 150 m and 17 groundwater samples were collected from deep wells depth 150 m fig 4b the average concentration of the chloride data has been used to calculate the annual recharge at each sampling point nitrate concentrations in the water samples also correlated against chloride to avoid anthropogenic contamination of groundwater samples the nitrate concentration in the groundwater samples was low and there was no such correlation with the chloride concentration table s1 in esm so it can be suggested that the chloride amount in the groundwater is due to evapotranspiration the effective annual precipitation was calculated by subtracting the annual runoff from the annual precipitation the annual surface runoff was calculated by wetspass simulation 3 4 empirical formulas ef many authors developed several empirical equations for groundwater recharge estimation bredenkamp 1995 chaturvedi 1973 kirchner et al 1991 krishna rao 1970 maxey and eakin 1949 the empirical equations were developed based on the precipitation amount of an area physiography climatic conditions etc these equations basically imitate the relationship between precipitation and recharge empirical equations are simple and easy to use because it requires only the precipitation value of the area chaturvedi 1973 developed an equation for an area where precipitation is limited to 14 28 inches based on water level fluctuation and precipitation sehgal and irrigation research institute roorkee modified the chaturvedi s formula for an area where precipitation is between 23 6 and 27 5 inches ali et al 2017 baweja and karanth 1980 krishna rao 1970 krishna rao 1970 proposed an empirical equation for a limited climatological homogenous area where precipitation is above 2000 mm both kirchner et al 1991 and bredenkamp 1995 developed empirical equations considering the mean annual precipitation map based on the proportion of annual precipitation varies from 0 to 25 maxey and eakin 1949 established a classical formula for recharge calculation maxey and eakin 1949 the empirical equations used for recharge estimation are summarized in table 1 where r is recharge p is annual precipitation and map is mean annual precipitation 3 5 groundwater abstraction estimation agriculture and domestic host and rohingya camp are the two major sources of groundwater use in the study area considering yearly 0 6 m net water is required for irrigation purposes irrigation water demand was calculated for the irrigated land area host community domestic abstraction was estimated based on the assumption that per capita domestic consumption is 50 l day groundwater abstraction in the camp area for rohingya people was calculated using the pumping rate of the production boreholes as well as pumping by the shallow camp tubewells 4 results and discussions 4 1 wetspass simulated recharge groundwater recharge simulated using the wetspass method provides spatially distributed recharge in the study area the annual groundwater recharge simulated from the wetspass method ranges from 0 to 2234 mm with a spatial mean of 754 mm year fig 3 a the model is highly sensitive to the soil type slope and precipitation amount rather than the other physical parameters of the area as 85 of the precipitation occurs in the wet period may october the recharge is mainly confined during that period temporarily the area gets about 641 and 113 mm annual average recharge in the wet may october and dry november april periods respectively there is a spatial variation in recharge due to variation in the physical characteristics such as land use soil type and slope of the study area the dupi tila tipam sandstone and bokabil sandstone areas with loamy sand and sandy loam soil texture get a higher recharge of 839 1676 mm year the beach deposit in the western part of the study area with beach sand texture recharges more than 1677 mm year the girujan clay upper bokabil and bhuban formations with fine textured clay soil get annual recharge less than 559 mm fig 3a the water bodies are the major discharge area of the surface runoff and aquifers the variation in recharge values with slope angle was clearly observed groundwater recharge in the gentle moderate and steep slope areas were 649 124 and 25 mm year respectively fig 3a and s1b the higher slope areas get lower recharge with a higher rate of surface runoff fig 3b and s1b the annual surface runoff varies from 1197 to 4307 mm in the study area spatially the dupi tila tipam sandstone and bokabil sandstone have shown lower surface runoff values of 1197 2397 mm year whereas girujan clay upper bokabil and bhuban formation have shown higher surface runoff more than 2398 mm year of the study area fig 3b and c the water bodies such as lakes and rivers have shown the maximum amount of annual surface runoff of the study area temporally the surface runoff and groundwater recharge are proportional to the precipitation amount of the study area fig 3d the mean recharge and surface runoff are higher in the wet period june september with a higher rate of precipitation fig 3d 4 2 water table fluctuation wtf recharge the estimated groundwater recharge value by wtf method ranges from 540 mm year to 1530 mm year for the dupi tila aquifer based on 13 monitoring wells data 4 shallow and 9 deep fig 4 a the mean annual groundwater recharge for the dupi tila aquifer was 1006 mm year the average shallow and deep recharge for the dupi tila aquifer are 923 and 1044 mm year respectively the tipam sandstone aquifer has shown calculated recharge value ranges from 144 mm year to 880 mm year calculated from 10 monitoring wells 5 shallow and 5 deep fig 4a the mean annual groundwater recharge for the tipam sandstone aquifer was 466 mm year the average shallow and deep recharge for tipam sandstone aquifer are 415 and 519 mm year respectively the estimated groundwater recharge was higher in the dupi tila than in the tipam sandstone aquifer the calculated mean annual groundwater recharge using the wtf method for both the dupi tila and tipam sandstone aquifers is about 771 mm year for the study area representing 20 of long term annual average precipitation 4 3 chloride mass balance cmb recharge the annual groundwater recharge value estimated with the cmb method ranges from 495 mm year to 1343 mm year for the dupi tila aquifer based on 20 groundwater samples 5 shallows and 15 deep fig 4b the average shallow and deep recharge for the dupi tila aquifer are 700 and 807 mm year respectively with a mean annual groundwater recharge value of 780 mm the groundwater recharge value ranges from 354 mm year to 1695 mm year for the tipam sandstone aquifer using 5 groundwater samples 3 shallow and 2 deep fig 4b the average shallow and deep recharge for tipam sandstone aquifer are 536 and 720 mm year respectively the mean annual recharge value was 731 mm year the iwm ttt 09 sampling point showed a very low value of 179 mm annual recharge figs 1 and 4b this low value is due to the recent deposit preventing precipitation water infiltrates to the water level of the aquifer the dupi tila and tipam sandstone aquifers have shown similar values of mean annual groundwater recharge using the chloride mass balance method cmb the overall mean annual groundwater recharge with the cmb method was 748 mm for the study area which is 19 of the long term annual average precipitation 4 4 empirical formulas ef recharge groundwater recharge obtained from different empirical equations is illustrated in fig 5 the annual groundwater recharge calculated with the empirical formulas has shown a large range of values annual groundwater recharge value ranges from 342 mm to 1231 mm fig 5 three different clusters of empirical formulas can be easily distinguished based on groundwater recharge values in fig 5 krishna rao and bredenkamp equations estimate 1000 1200 mm year maxey eakin and sehgal estimate 650 800 mm year and chaturvedi iri and kirchner estimate 350 450 mm year groundwater recharge see fig 6 4 5 groundwater abstraction groundwater abstraction in the study area occurs for irrigation by the host community domestic consumption for both the host community and for the rohingya people in the camp area the total estimated annual groundwater abstraction in the study area is about 49 million cubic meters the estimated groundwater abstraction for domestic needs is about 18 million cubic meters per year considering per capita domestic consumption of 50 l day of which about 5 million cubic meters for host pumping and about 13 million cubic meters for camp pumping groundwater abstraction for irrigation is about 31 million cubic meters per year 5 discussions 5 1 groundwater sustainability groundwater sustainability of the aquifers in the study area largely depends on the balance between the available water resources and water demand most of the pre existing wells are installed in the dupi tila aquifer for irrigation and domestic needs so the demand for groundwater in the area is met by pumping from the dupi tila aquifer as the tipam aquifer is mostly unutilized the total estimated annual groundwater abstraction from the dupi tila aquifer is about 49 million cubic meters whereas the estimated groundwater recharge to it is about 133 137 million cubic meters per year although the demand is only about 35 36 of the potential recharge to the dupi tila aquifer the spatial distribution of demand and recharge is not uniform most of the rohingyas are concentrated in the kutupalong mega camp area of ukhia upazila having a very high demand for water compared to other parts of the study area and resulting into overpumping from the underlying dupi tila aquifer the estimated groundwater abstraction in the camp area alone is about 13 million cubic meters against the recharge volume of about 9 10 million cubic meters per year groundwater abstraction in the camp area occurs largely from depths greater than 100 m although the recharge to the shallow part of the aquifer is greater than the abstraction actual recharge to the pumping depth is potentially much less than that in the shallow zone this is due to undulating surface topography which conduits a significant proportion of the estimated recharge as subsurface runoff that feeds the local streams and rivers occurring in the topographic low areas also the extent of percolation of locally recharged water to the pumping depths would depend on the vertical heterogeneity of the aquifer besides pumping would also induce lateral groundwater flow from surrounding areas and hence the ultimate drawdown caused by the wells in the camp areas would largely depend on the vertical and horizontal hydraulic properties of the aquifer matrix as well as the spatial distribution of pumping concentrated pumping in a small area is likely to create a large cone of depression possibly adversely impacting the host community water wells in neighboring areas moreover as the study area is a part of a complex geological setting the lateral and vertical continuities of the aquifers are difficult to identify due to lack of high density drilling and geophysical data so proper aquifer mapping extensive assessment of the spatial and vertical variation of the aquifer hydraulic parameters and development of a groundwater flow model are highly required for assessing sustainability and undertaking long term water resources management plan 5 2 comparison of recharge estimation methods recharge estimation by the wetspass method generates a spatially distributed groundwater recharge map while cmb and wtf methods estimate point recharge and empirical equations calculate mean annual recharge only from the mean annual precipitation amount for the study area there is a high spatial and temporal variation in recharge due to landform landuse and climatic variabilities as 82 of annual precipitation occurs in the wet monsoon period june september the higher recharge values also occur in that period recharge estimation using the wetspass is a physically based method but groundwater recharge is also controlled by the subsurface aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity k and transmissivity t and hence the wetspass method is not valid for groundwater recharge estimation to the deeper part of the unconfined or confined aquifer systems groundwater recharge calculated from the wtf method varies greatly due to aquifer heterogeneity and difference in pumping rate in the study area the effectiveness of this method is dependent on the length of the time steps of recharge calculation which is critical in the success of this method and the accurate estimation of specific yield if the water is redistributed from the water level at a higher rate than the recharge rate then this method is not so effective healy and cook 2002 the deeper parts for both the dupi tila and tipam sandstone formation showed higher recharge than the shallow aquifers with wtf because the deep aquifer pumping rate is higher around the camp area where a large recession in the groundwater hydrograph was observed in the monitoring wells fig 7 the point recharge values for the monitoring wells calculated by wtf and cmb methods were correlated with wetspass recharge fig 8 where calculated recharge for the dupi tila aquifer has shown a higher correlation than the tipam aquifer recharge fig 8a and b this might have resulted from the uneven numbers of monitoring wells used for recharge calculation for the dupi tila higher numbers and the tipam aquifer lower number recharge in the humid region like the study area with a sedimentary aquifer system can be estimated with the chloride mass balance cmb method nitrate concentrations in the water samples correlated against chloride to identify anthropogenically contaminated groundwater samples also groundwater samples with abnormal chloride concentrations cannot be used for recharge estimation as this is most likely resulted from saltwater intrusion or any other anthropogenic process the cmb recharge value has a higher correlation with the wetspass than the wtf method the recharge calculated using different empirical formulas has shown three clusters fig 5 the mean annual groundwater recharge has shown large variations because empirical equations were developed for certain areas or valid for the areas which can be comparable comparing the mean annual groundwater recharge calculated by empirical formulas with the wetspass method suggested that krishna rao and bredenkamp equations over estimated groundwater recharge while chaturvedi iri and kirchner methods under estimated groundwater recharge for the study area groundwater recharge values obtained from maxey eakin and sehgal have shown values similar to the wtf cmb and wetspass methods therefore it can be argued that the maxey eakin and sehgal equations are valid for recharge estimation in the current study area average groundwater recharge calculated by wtf cmb ef and wetspass methods are 20 19 20 and 18 of annual total precipitation respectively hence the proportion of rainfall that percolate to the aquifer through recharge has been found to be identical by all the methods along with some spatial variability many authors estimated groundwater recharge and identified the sources of recharge in the flood and the deltaic plains but none of those covered the south eastern hilly region of bangladesh adham et al 2010 adhikary et al 2013 hoque et al 2014 hoque and burgess 2012 hossain et al 2021 kanoua and merkel 2015 nowreen et al 2020 shahid et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2011 adham et al 2010 and shahid et al 2015 estimated groundwater recharge in the north western barind tract using remote sensing and wtf methods with values of about 1685 mm year and 320 890 mm year respectively adhikary et al 2013 and kanoua 2015 estimated recharge in kushtia and titas upazila of cumilla using the wtf method with values of about 1413 and 230 mm year mean annual groundwater recharge has shown higher 300 600 mm in northwestern and southwestern areas of bangladesh than in southeastern and northeastern regions 100 mm by shamsudduha et al 2011 they underestimated groundwater recharge for this area as specific yield 0 01 0 02 was calculated from only one monitoring well as annual rainfall in the southeastern region is higher than in the northwestern region groundwater recharge potentials may be higher in southeastern bangladesh than estimated by shamsudduha et al 2011 groundwater recharge estimated in the humid region around the world has been compared with the estimated recharge of the study area chung et al 2016 estimated groundwater recharge in central uganda as 245 mm year which is 12 of mean annual precipitation in ghana recharge was about 1 5 19 of mean annual precipitation which is comparable to the estimated recharge value for the study area the estimated groundwater recharge value was about 140 250 mm year in africa kotchoni et al 2019 yenehun et al 2020 estimated recharge in semi humid ethiopia with wetspass and chloride mass balance methods recharge values were 462 477 mm year for the wetspass and cmb method respectively which represent 10 48 of the mean annual rainfall of ethiopia hung vu and merkel 2019 applied wtf what and hydrograph analysis to estimate groundwater recharge in hanoi vietnam which is the subtropical humid climatic area the estimated recharge 340 mm year was about 20 of the annual precipitation of the area graf and przybyłek 2014 also found recharge about 20 of mean annual rainfall in the poznan plateau of the great poland lowland in western poland therefore it is clearly observed that groundwater recharge estimated for the study area is comparable to the values estimated in similar physiographic and climatic settings around the world 6 conclusions groundwater recharge was estimated for the study area using wetspass water table fluctuation chloride mass balance and empirical equations the mean annual groundwater recharge for the entire study area has been calculated as 771 748 772 and 754 mm by wtf cmb ef and wetspass methods respectively the mean annual recharge value of the study area by averaging all four methods has been estimated as 761 mm the recharge amount is about 18 20 of the long term annual mean precipitation of the study area although the average recharge values are more or less similar for all the four methods there is high spatial variability in estimated recharge in each method the estimated mean annual groundwater recharge for dupi tila and tipam aquifer are 825 and 667 mm year respectively the estimated recharge is about 133 137 million cubic meters whereas demand is about 49 million cubic meters per year although demand for groundwater is only 35 36 of estimated recharge the distribution of recharge vs demand is not uniform so the sustainability of the aquifer system largely depends on mapping the extent and distribution of the aquifer and accurate estimation of the aquifer properties of the study area each of the recharge estimation methods used in this study has limitations and uncertainty primarily resulting from the uncertainty in the input data the wetspass requires continuous spatial distribution of a number of parameters which are rarely available these are often prepared by interpolating point measurements similarly the wtf method largely depends on the accurate estimation of the specific yield value and its spatial variability this is difficult for a large study area with too much geological heterogeneity on the other hand empirical formulas are developed for specific areas and may not be suitable elsewhere however use of multiple methods can provide a reliable range of recharge especially if they are consistent to estimate the spatial distribution of recharge the wetspass method is suitable for shallow groundwater recharge local recharge can be estimated by the water table fluctuation and chloride mass balance methods as eakin and sehgal empirical formulas have a good correlation with the other methods these formulas can be applied to estimate recharge in a short time with only mean annual precipitation data of the area for sustainable water resources management and planning the estimated recharge in this study will be helpful for the local stakeholders and authority for making groundwater management plans the applied methods can be used for recharge estimation in other areas of bangladesh in the coastal areas of bangladesh the cmb

11733,sudden increase of groundwater abstraction for water supply to a million forcefully migrated myanmar nationals rohingya in ukhia and teknaf upazila of cox s bazar district has created a threat to the sustainability of the dupi tila and tipam aquifers the primary source of drinking water for the host community reasonable estimation of groundwater recharge is crucial for understanding the sustainability of an aquifer therefore this study estimates groundwater recharge employing multiple methods such as i wetspass water balance model ii water table fluctuation wtf iii chloride mass balance cmb and iv empirical formulas ef and compares it with current withdrawal additionally the applicability of empirical formulas for recharge estimation in bangladesh has been evaluated which will benefit future groundwater studies requiring a rapid estimate of recharge from precipitation despite a large spatial variability in recharge the spatially mean annual groundwater recharge estimated by these methods is comparable to each other the estimated spatially mean annual volumetric groundwater recharge for the dupi tila and tipam aquifer is 135 and 122 million m3 y respectively most of the estimated groundwater abstraction of 49 million m3 y in this area is from the dupi tila aquifer which is about 36 of the annual recharge suggesting that the current withdrawal should be sustainable however since the rohingya camp abstraction is concentrated within a small area there is potential for a large cone of depression development in and around the camp which may adversely impact the wells of the host population in adjacent areas a numerical model is required to assess the extent of the cone and its impacts on host community wells this study also finds that the maxey eakin and sehgal formulas for precipitation based recharge estimation are the most suitable for this area and may be applied in other areas of bangladesh graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater recharge rohingya refugees aquifer sustainability cmb wtf wetspass data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction safe water resources are vital for the social economic and environmental sustainability of a nation constituting over 98 of earth s available freshwater resources groundwater provides over 70 of the global irrigation water supply and 90 of consumptive water supply kimberly 2012 siebert et al 2010 in bangladesh groundwater fed irrigation has increased drastically over the last few decades kirby et al 2015 currently about 80 of the agricultural land is irrigated by groundwater and more than 90 of domestic water supply is from groundwater bbs 2015 ravenscroft 2009 as groundwater is a limited renewable resource it must be managed sustainably since late 2017 about a million forcefully displaced myanmar nationals ronhingya is living in several refugee camps in the ukhia and teknaf upazilas of the cox s bazar district with the largest concentration 0 75 million in the kutupalong mega camp fig 1 before migration of the rohingyas groundwater was abstracted only for the 0 86 million local community in the study area in early 2018 thousands of hand pump wells were installed throughout the mega camp for water supply to the rohingya population over the period of 2019 2021 the hand pump based water supply was replaced by more than 150 production wells with an average capacity of 85 m3 d well iom 2020 this sudden increase in groundwater withdrawal puts the sustainability of water resources of the whole region in question the ukhia and teknaf upazilas sub district of cox s bazar district bangladesh has a long term and established problem with drinking water resources geologically the area is complex and characterized by a series of synclines and anticlines and this setting made the area of limited groundwater resources besides surface water is prone to contamination because of poor sanitation and unawareness iwm 2018 therefore it is of utmost importance to assess the sustainability of the groundwater in this region as it is the primary source of drinking water for both the host community and rohingyas the quantification of groundwater recharge and its spatio temporal variability is the key to sustainable water resource management policy healy and cook 2002 loucks 2009 scanlon et al 2006 groundwater recharge is defined as the volume of water from different sources such as precipitation and glacier melt reaching the water table by infiltration through the unsaturated or vadose zone and replenishes the groundwater zone for a given time manna et al 2016 this replenishment of groundwater also occurs by lateral movement of water from adjacent aquifers from any other direction scanlon et al 2006 groundwater recharge can be estimated by a number of methods it is a good practice to determine recharge by several methods as large uncertainty exists in the estimation by a single method healy and cook 2002 it can be estimated directly using lysimeters tensiometers and or time domain reflectometry tdr probes allen et al 1991 baehr et al 2003 dreiss and anderson 1985 evett et al 1995 gburek w j folmar 1999 nimmo et al 1994 ward and gee 1997 wellings 1984 among the indirect methods water table fluctuation wtf is a simple and widely used method for groundwater recharge estimation it is based on aquifer characteristics and groundwater level fluctuations healy and scanlon 2010 hendrickx 1992 heppner and nimmo 2005 however in the wtf method groundwater recharge is calculated from water level observed at point location point estimates may not necessarily be representative of recharge over a wide area bresciani et al 2014 eriksson and khunakasem 1969 harrington et al 2002 chloride mass balance cmb is another commonly used indirect method of point estimation of recharge it is based on chloride concentration values in precipitation and groundwater additionally there are a number of empirical formulas ef for indirect estimation of mean annual groundwater recharge from precipitation apart from the above mentioned methods there are a number of physically based models that estimate groundwater recharge as a residual at the land surface between precipitation runoff and evaporation with the development of the geographic information system gis physical based hydrologic modeling has advanced for recharge estimation and or possible climate change on basin hydrology and water resources alemaw and chaoka 2003 each method of groundwater recharge estimation has some advantages and disadvantages the effectiveness of each method depends on the climate e g humid arid boreal and tropical topography hydrogeological setting availability of data and quality of data in many areas of bangladesh groundwater recharge has been estimated mostly by the water table fluctuation wtf method adham et al 2010 hoque and burgess 2012 hossain 2021 kanoua and merkel 2015 nowreen et al 2020 shahid et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2011 no study has been carried out so far that compares multiple methods of recharge estimation in bangladesh the objectives of this study are a estimation of groundwater recharge in a highly stressed aquifer in bangladesh using multiple recharge estimation methods b assessment of the sustainability of groundwater in the study area by comparing estimated demands and groundwater recharge and c compare various methods of recharge estimation and gain insights on their applicability in bangladesh 2 study area geographically the study area is located in the south eastern part of bangladesh and covers an area of about 92 km2 it is bounded by the bay of bengal in the west the naf river in the south east also separated from myanmar and the bandarban and chittagong district in the north fig 1 the study area is a part of the nne ssw trending indo burman fold belt the area is tapering towards the south and follows the geographic boundary of bangladesh thrust faulted anticlines and broad synclinal valleys are the major geomorphological features of this area fig 2 in the plain land of the synclinal part numerous hillocks gulleys dunes mudflats tidal creeks spits flood plains are small scale geomorphological features gani and alam 2003 the climate is characterized by moist tropical maritime with high rainfall concentrated during monsoon june september and a dry period of 4 5 months the average annual rainfall is about 4 m and experiences a 25 c annual average temperature the potential et remains almost constant throughout the year with a mean of about 1 3 m year fig 1 the surface geology compliments the stratigraphic settings of the study area the dupi tila formation plio pleistocene and the tipam sandstone formation pliocene are the main aquifers in the study area separated by an aquitard the girujan clay formation fig 2 the dupi tila aquifer is unconfined to semi confined the tipam aquifer is confined except where it is exposed the tipam sandstone aquifer is exposed around the dupi tila aquifer fig 2 the surma group bhuban and bokabil formations which is an alternating sandstone and shale unit cannot be specified as a useable aquifer due to low permeability and deeper depth of these units the tipam and dupi tila formations are mostly sandy porous and permeable 3 data and methodology wetspass model water table fluctuation wtf chloride mass balance cmb and empirical formula ef methods were used in this study to estimate the groundwater recharge to the aquifers of the study area the theoretical background of the groundwater recharge estimation methods used in this study is discussed in the following sections 3 1 wetspass method wetspass an acronym for water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state assimilate a water balance in a geographical information system gis environment ashaolu and olorunfemi 2020 batelaan and de smedt 2007 salem et al 2019 it is a technique for estimating spatially distributed long term average recharge in the humid temporal area batelaan 2001 the model treats an area as a regular pattern of raster cells where every raster cell is further subdivided in a vegetated bare soil open water and impervious surface fraction for which independent water balances are maintained groundwater recharge is simulated using wetspass as a residual of water balance kahsay et al 2019 by the following equation 1 r p s e t i where p is the average precipitation et is the actual evapotranspiration s is the surface runoff i is the interception by vegetation and r is the groundwater recharge to simulate recharge with the wetspass method gridded raster maps 10 m of land use soil texture slope elevation precipitation potential evapotranspiration temperature wind speed and depth to groundwater level data have been used figs s1 s6 in esm the meteorological data of cox s bazar and teknaf stations were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd between 2001 and 2020 fig 1 these data were processed and interpolated over the study area to construct the required raster layers for the elevation grid 12 5 m resolution alos palsar dem was resampled to 10 m and the slope was calculated using the gis slope function figs s1a and b in esm the sentinel 2 satellite image spatial resolution 10 m was used for land use classification fig s1c in esm the soil map was created using the surface geology and the lithological characteristics of the geological units fig s1d in esm 3 2 water table fluctuation wtf method the principle of the wtf method is that the water level rise in the unconfined aquifer is due to the percolation or infiltration of the precipitation which is considered as recharge recharge is calculated in this method as 2 r s y δ h δ t where sy is the specific yield δh is the hydraulic head change and δt is the time interval for the recharge period somaratne and smettem 2014 to estimate recharge δh is considered equal to the difference between the peak of the rise and low point of the extrapolated antecedent recession curve at the time of the peak the antecedent recession curve is the trace that the well hydrograph would have followed in the absence of the water level rise from precipitation high frequency hourly groundwater level data has been collected for recharge estimation with the wtf method between november 2019 to march 2021 water level data were collected from 23 monitoring wells selected considering the spatial distribution data quality and screen depth for recharge calculation fig 1 these wells were classified as shallow and deep according to the depth of the monitoring well screen groundwater well screen depth greater than 150 m was considered as deep and less than 150 m as shallow among the 23 monitoring wells 9 wells were shallow and the rest 14 wells were deep both shallow and deep monitoring data were kept under consideration to assess the response of recharge with precipitation to the shallower and deeper part of the dupi tila and tipam sandstone aquifers the value of the specific yield was separately calculated for dupitila and tipam sandstone aquifers from well test data 3 3 chloride mass balance cmb method the chloride mass balance cmb method is a widely used recharge estimation method because it needs only analysis of chloride concentration in precipitation and groundwater scanlon et al 2006 during evapotranspiration chloride ions remain in the root zone but after precipitation the chloride ions dissolve with precipitated water to infiltrate into the aquifer which eventually increases the water level as recharge allison 1988 during this path concentration of chloride ions increases by dissolving chloride from the geological formation this method is not applicable in the karstic aquifer system because of the mineral composition of the karstic rock somaratne and smettem 2014 geologically the study area is characterized by sedimentary rock formations and the hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer system suggested that the chloride mass balance cmb method is suitable for groundwater recharge estimation in this method recharge is calculated by the following equation 3 r p e f f c l p c l g w where r is the annual groundwater recharge mm year peff is the effective precipitation mm year which is the total precipitation amount over the calculated time period subtracted from the runoff amount of that period clp is the chloride concentration in precipitation mg l and clgw is the chloride concentration in groundwater mg l bazuhair and wood 1996 groundwater samples were collected from 27 monitoring wells of the study area between 2019 and 2020 which are spatially distributed over the area for water chemistry analysis fig 1 among them 10 groundwater samples were collected from shallow wells depth 150 m and 17 groundwater samples were collected from deep wells depth 150 m fig 4b the average concentration of the chloride data has been used to calculate the annual recharge at each sampling point nitrate concentrations in the water samples also correlated against chloride to avoid anthropogenic contamination of groundwater samples the nitrate concentration in the groundwater samples was low and there was no such correlation with the chloride concentration table s1 in esm so it can be suggested that the chloride amount in the groundwater is due to evapotranspiration the effective annual precipitation was calculated by subtracting the annual runoff from the annual precipitation the annual surface runoff was calculated by wetspass simulation 3 4 empirical formulas ef many authors developed several empirical equations for groundwater recharge estimation bredenkamp 1995 chaturvedi 1973 kirchner et al 1991 krishna rao 1970 maxey and eakin 1949 the empirical equations were developed based on the precipitation amount of an area physiography climatic conditions etc these equations basically imitate the relationship between precipitation and recharge empirical equations are simple and easy to use because it requires only the precipitation value of the area chaturvedi 1973 developed an equation for an area where precipitation is limited to 14 28 inches based on water level fluctuation and precipitation sehgal and irrigation research institute roorkee modified the chaturvedi s formula for an area where precipitation is between 23 6 and 27 5 inches ali et al 2017 baweja and karanth 1980 krishna rao 1970 krishna rao 1970 proposed an empirical equation for a limited climatological homogenous area where precipitation is above 2000 mm both kirchner et al 1991 and bredenkamp 1995 developed empirical equations considering the mean annual precipitation map based on the proportion of annual precipitation varies from 0 to 25 maxey and eakin 1949 established a classical formula for recharge calculation maxey and eakin 1949 the empirical equations used for recharge estimation are summarized in table 1 where r is recharge p is annual precipitation and map is mean annual precipitation 3 5 groundwater abstraction estimation agriculture and domestic host and rohingya camp are the two major sources of groundwater use in the study area considering yearly 0 6 m net water is required for irrigation purposes irrigation water demand was calculated for the irrigated land area host community domestic abstraction was estimated based on the assumption that per capita domestic consumption is 50 l day groundwater abstraction in the camp area for rohingya people was calculated using the pumping rate of the production boreholes as well as pumping by the shallow camp tubewells 4 results and discussions 4 1 wetspass simulated recharge groundwater recharge simulated using the wetspass method provides spatially distributed recharge in the study area the annual groundwater recharge simulated from the wetspass method ranges from 0 to 2234 mm with a spatial mean of 754 mm year fig 3 a the model is highly sensitive to the soil type slope and precipitation amount rather than the other physical parameters of the area as 85 of the precipitation occurs in the wet period may october the recharge is mainly confined during that period temporarily the area gets about 641 and 113 mm annual average recharge in the wet may october and dry november april periods respectively there is a spatial variation in recharge due to variation in the physical characteristics such as land use soil type and slope of the study area the dupi tila tipam sandstone and bokabil sandstone areas with loamy sand and sandy loam soil texture get a higher recharge of 839 1676 mm year the beach deposit in the western part of the study area with beach sand texture recharges more than 1677 mm year the girujan clay upper bokabil and bhuban formations with fine textured clay soil get annual recharge less than 559 mm fig 3a the water bodies are the major discharge area of the surface runoff and aquifers the variation in recharge values with slope angle was clearly observed groundwater recharge in the gentle moderate and steep slope areas were 649 124 and 25 mm year respectively fig 3a and s1b the higher slope areas get lower recharge with a higher rate of surface runoff fig 3b and s1b the annual surface runoff varies from 1197 to 4307 mm in the study area spatially the dupi tila tipam sandstone and bokabil sandstone have shown lower surface runoff values of 1197 2397 mm year whereas girujan clay upper bokabil and bhuban formation have shown higher surface runoff more than 2398 mm year of the study area fig 3b and c the water bodies such as lakes and rivers have shown the maximum amount of annual surface runoff of the study area temporally the surface runoff and groundwater recharge are proportional to the precipitation amount of the study area fig 3d the mean recharge and surface runoff are higher in the wet period june september with a higher rate of precipitation fig 3d 4 2 water table fluctuation wtf recharge the estimated groundwater recharge value by wtf method ranges from 540 mm year to 1530 mm year for the dupi tila aquifer based on 13 monitoring wells data 4 shallow and 9 deep fig 4 a the mean annual groundwater recharge for the dupi tila aquifer was 1006 mm year the average shallow and deep recharge for the dupi tila aquifer are 923 and 1044 mm year respectively the tipam sandstone aquifer has shown calculated recharge value ranges from 144 mm year to 880 mm year calculated from 10 monitoring wells 5 shallow and 5 deep fig 4a the mean annual groundwater recharge for the tipam sandstone aquifer was 466 mm year the average shallow and deep recharge for tipam sandstone aquifer are 415 and 519 mm year respectively the estimated groundwater recharge was higher in the dupi tila than in the tipam sandstone aquifer the calculated mean annual groundwater recharge using the wtf method for both the dupi tila and tipam sandstone aquifers is about 771 mm year for the study area representing 20 of long term annual average precipitation 4 3 chloride mass balance cmb recharge the annual groundwater recharge value estimated with the cmb method ranges from 495 mm year to 1343 mm year for the dupi tila aquifer based on 20 groundwater samples 5 shallows and 15 deep fig 4b the average shallow and deep recharge for the dupi tila aquifer are 700 and 807 mm year respectively with a mean annual groundwater recharge value of 780 mm the groundwater recharge value ranges from 354 mm year to 1695 mm year for the tipam sandstone aquifer using 5 groundwater samples 3 shallow and 2 deep fig 4b the average shallow and deep recharge for tipam sandstone aquifer are 536 and 720 mm year respectively the mean annual recharge value was 731 mm year the iwm ttt 09 sampling point showed a very low value of 179 mm annual recharge figs 1 and 4b this low value is due to the recent deposit preventing precipitation water infiltrates to the water level of the aquifer the dupi tila and tipam sandstone aquifers have shown similar values of mean annual groundwater recharge using the chloride mass balance method cmb the overall mean annual groundwater recharge with the cmb method was 748 mm for the study area which is 19 of the long term annual average precipitation 4 4 empirical formulas ef recharge groundwater recharge obtained from different empirical equations is illustrated in fig 5 the annual groundwater recharge calculated with the empirical formulas has shown a large range of values annual groundwater recharge value ranges from 342 mm to 1231 mm fig 5 three different clusters of empirical formulas can be easily distinguished based on groundwater recharge values in fig 5 krishna rao and bredenkamp equations estimate 1000 1200 mm year maxey eakin and sehgal estimate 650 800 mm year and chaturvedi iri and kirchner estimate 350 450 mm year groundwater recharge see fig 6 4 5 groundwater abstraction groundwater abstraction in the study area occurs for irrigation by the host community domestic consumption for both the host community and for the rohingya people in the camp area the total estimated annual groundwater abstraction in the study area is about 49 million cubic meters the estimated groundwater abstraction for domestic needs is about 18 million cubic meters per year considering per capita domestic consumption of 50 l day of which about 5 million cubic meters for host pumping and about 13 million cubic meters for camp pumping groundwater abstraction for irrigation is about 31 million cubic meters per year 5 discussions 5 1 groundwater sustainability groundwater sustainability of the aquifers in the study area largely depends on the balance between the available water resources and water demand most of the pre existing wells are installed in the dupi tila aquifer for irrigation and domestic needs so the demand for groundwater in the area is met by pumping from the dupi tila aquifer as the tipam aquifer is mostly unutilized the total estimated annual groundwater abstraction from the dupi tila aquifer is about 49 million cubic meters whereas the estimated groundwater recharge to it is about 133 137 million cubic meters per year although the demand is only about 35 36 of the potential recharge to the dupi tila aquifer the spatial distribution of demand and recharge is not uniform most of the rohingyas are concentrated in the kutupalong mega camp area of ukhia upazila having a very high demand for water compared to other parts of the study area and resulting into overpumping from the underlying dupi tila aquifer the estimated groundwater abstraction in the camp area alone is about 13 million cubic meters against the recharge volume of about 9 10 million cubic meters per year groundwater abstraction in the camp area occurs largely from depths greater than 100 m although the recharge to the shallow part of the aquifer is greater than the abstraction actual recharge to the pumping depth is potentially much less than that in the shallow zone this is due to undulating surface topography which conduits a significant proportion of the estimated recharge as subsurface runoff that feeds the local streams and rivers occurring in the topographic low areas also the extent of percolation of locally recharged water to the pumping depths would depend on the vertical heterogeneity of the aquifer besides pumping would also induce lateral groundwater flow from surrounding areas and hence the ultimate drawdown caused by the wells in the camp areas would largely depend on the vertical and horizontal hydraulic properties of the aquifer matrix as well as the spatial distribution of pumping concentrated pumping in a small area is likely to create a large cone of depression possibly adversely impacting the host community water wells in neighboring areas moreover as the study area is a part of a complex geological setting the lateral and vertical continuities of the aquifers are difficult to identify due to lack of high density drilling and geophysical data so proper aquifer mapping extensive assessment of the spatial and vertical variation of the aquifer hydraulic parameters and development of a groundwater flow model are highly required for assessing sustainability and undertaking long term water resources management plan 5 2 comparison of recharge estimation methods recharge estimation by the wetspass method generates a spatially distributed groundwater recharge map while cmb and wtf methods estimate point recharge and empirical equations calculate mean annual recharge only from the mean annual precipitation amount for the study area there is a high spatial and temporal variation in recharge due to landform landuse and climatic variabilities as 82 of annual precipitation occurs in the wet monsoon period june september the higher recharge values also occur in that period recharge estimation using the wetspass is a physically based method but groundwater recharge is also controlled by the subsurface aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity k and transmissivity t and hence the wetspass method is not valid for groundwater recharge estimation to the deeper part of the unconfined or confined aquifer systems groundwater recharge calculated from the wtf method varies greatly due to aquifer heterogeneity and difference in pumping rate in the study area the effectiveness of this method is dependent on the length of the time steps of recharge calculation which is critical in the success of this method and the accurate estimation of specific yield if the water is redistributed from the water level at a higher rate than the recharge rate then this method is not so effective healy and cook 2002 the deeper parts for both the dupi tila and tipam sandstone formation showed higher recharge than the shallow aquifers with wtf because the deep aquifer pumping rate is higher around the camp area where a large recession in the groundwater hydrograph was observed in the monitoring wells fig 7 the point recharge values for the monitoring wells calculated by wtf and cmb methods were correlated with wetspass recharge fig 8 where calculated recharge for the dupi tila aquifer has shown a higher correlation than the tipam aquifer recharge fig 8a and b this might have resulted from the uneven numbers of monitoring wells used for recharge calculation for the dupi tila higher numbers and the tipam aquifer lower number recharge in the humid region like the study area with a sedimentary aquifer system can be estimated with the chloride mass balance cmb method nitrate concentrations in the water samples correlated against chloride to identify anthropogenically contaminated groundwater samples also groundwater samples with abnormal chloride concentrations cannot be used for recharge estimation as this is most likely resulted from saltwater intrusion or any other anthropogenic process the cmb recharge value has a higher correlation with the wetspass than the wtf method the recharge calculated using different empirical formulas has shown three clusters fig 5 the mean annual groundwater recharge has shown large variations because empirical equations were developed for certain areas or valid for the areas which can be comparable comparing the mean annual groundwater recharge calculated by empirical formulas with the wetspass method suggested that krishna rao and bredenkamp equations over estimated groundwater recharge while chaturvedi iri and kirchner methods under estimated groundwater recharge for the study area groundwater recharge values obtained from maxey eakin and sehgal have shown values similar to the wtf cmb and wetspass methods therefore it can be argued that the maxey eakin and sehgal equations are valid for recharge estimation in the current study area average groundwater recharge calculated by wtf cmb ef and wetspass methods are 20 19 20 and 18 of annual total precipitation respectively hence the proportion of rainfall that percolate to the aquifer through recharge has been found to be identical by all the methods along with some spatial variability many authors estimated groundwater recharge and identified the sources of recharge in the flood and the deltaic plains but none of those covered the south eastern hilly region of bangladesh adham et al 2010 adhikary et al 2013 hoque et al 2014 hoque and burgess 2012 hossain et al 2021 kanoua and merkel 2015 nowreen et al 2020 shahid et al 2015 shamsudduha et al 2011 adham et al 2010 and shahid et al 2015 estimated groundwater recharge in the north western barind tract using remote sensing and wtf methods with values of about 1685 mm year and 320 890 mm year respectively adhikary et al 2013 and kanoua 2015 estimated recharge in kushtia and titas upazila of cumilla using the wtf method with values of about 1413 and 230 mm year mean annual groundwater recharge has shown higher 300 600 mm in northwestern and southwestern areas of bangladesh than in southeastern and northeastern regions 100 mm by shamsudduha et al 2011 they underestimated groundwater recharge for this area as specific yield 0 01 0 02 was calculated from only one monitoring well as annual rainfall in the southeastern region is higher than in the northwestern region groundwater recharge potentials may be higher in southeastern bangladesh than estimated by shamsudduha et al 2011 groundwater recharge estimated in the humid region around the world has been compared with the estimated recharge of the study area chung et al 2016 estimated groundwater recharge in central uganda as 245 mm year which is 12 of mean annual precipitation in ghana recharge was about 1 5 19 of mean annual precipitation which is comparable to the estimated recharge value for the study area the estimated groundwater recharge value was about 140 250 mm year in africa kotchoni et al 2019 yenehun et al 2020 estimated recharge in semi humid ethiopia with wetspass and chloride mass balance methods recharge values were 462 477 mm year for the wetspass and cmb method respectively which represent 10 48 of the mean annual rainfall of ethiopia hung vu and merkel 2019 applied wtf what and hydrograph analysis to estimate groundwater recharge in hanoi vietnam which is the subtropical humid climatic area the estimated recharge 340 mm year was about 20 of the annual precipitation of the area graf and przybyłek 2014 also found recharge about 20 of mean annual rainfall in the poznan plateau of the great poland lowland in western poland therefore it is clearly observed that groundwater recharge estimated for the study area is comparable to the values estimated in similar physiographic and climatic settings around the world 6 conclusions groundwater recharge was estimated for the study area using wetspass water table fluctuation chloride mass balance and empirical equations the mean annual groundwater recharge for the entire study area has been calculated as 771 748 772 and 754 mm by wtf cmb ef and wetspass methods respectively the mean annual recharge value of the study area by averaging all four methods has been estimated as 761 mm the recharge amount is about 18 20 of the long term annual mean precipitation of the study area although the average recharge values are more or less similar for all the four methods there is high spatial variability in estimated recharge in each method the estimated mean annual groundwater recharge for dupi tila and tipam aquifer are 825 and 667 mm year respectively the estimated recharge is about 133 137 million cubic meters whereas demand is about 49 million cubic meters per year although demand for groundwater is only 35 36 of estimated recharge the distribution of recharge vs demand is not uniform so the sustainability of the aquifer system largely depends on mapping the extent and distribution of the aquifer and accurate estimation of the aquifer properties of the study area each of the recharge estimation methods used in this study has limitations and uncertainty primarily resulting from the uncertainty in the input data the wetspass requires continuous spatial distribution of a number of parameters which are rarely available these are often prepared by interpolating point measurements similarly the wtf method largely depends on the accurate estimation of the specific yield value and its spatial variability this is difficult for a large study area with too much geological heterogeneity on the other hand empirical formulas are developed for specific areas and may not be suitable elsewhere however use of multiple methods can provide a reliable range of recharge especially if they are consistent to estimate the spatial distribution of recharge the wetspass method is suitable for shallow groundwater recharge local recharge can be estimated by the water table fluctuation and chloride mass balance methods as eakin and sehgal empirical formulas have a good correlation with the other methods these formulas can be applied to estimate recharge in a short time with only mean annual precipitation data of the area for sustainable water resources management and planning the estimated recharge in this study will be helpful for the local stakeholders and authority for making groundwater management plans the applied methods can be used for recharge estimation in other areas of bangladesh in the coastal areas of bangladesh the cmb

design in colombia falls short to sustainably manage pervasive groundwater extraction and rule enforcement this article is aimed at understanding the extant contractual delegation of groundwater extraction on farmers as the main water users across the country this understanding is a relevant first step before undertaking the improvement of institutional arrangements to pursue real sustainability objectives of water use for agriculture despite pervasive free riding water access to a certain extent extraction permits act like social contracts with implicit clauses determined by the law in entitling extraction permits principals unavoidably delegate on agents although their interests tend to diverge in this relationship socio physical information about groundwater status is certainly asymmetric which is not problematic per se difficulties arise from widened gaps between groundwater management information portions managed by different actors besides contract design should operate under the natural limits of aquifer systems which are usually recognized after granting extraction permits notwithstanding crude caveats should be considered incomplete delegation and hidden institutions exists and if ignorance on informal and formal water volumes extracted continue sustainable management of aquifers would not only be incomplete but an illusion real sustainable management of aquifer systems when deciding upon water extraction permits should incorporate aquifer limits as an ex ante condition and innovative incentives that trigger institutions towards capped aquifer extractions graphical abstract aquifers and climate adaptation incentives information and institutions image 1 keywords institutions groundwater asymmetrical information principal agent transaction costs limits of nature extraction caps data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable and secure water provision for rural and urban territories demand the understanding of institutions and incentives governing water use groundwater in developing countries like colombia is a centrally managed resource being this at state or regional level at best the authority as a principal grants a resource usufruct permission to a water agent farmer who pays a fee for it amidst this transaction there is an implicit contract with clear legal clauses in its role as principal the authority is expected to monitor contract compliance but monitoring extraction is complex water regulation systems are continuously hindered because the administration of legal procedures is complex and time consuming madani and dinar 2012 sandoval 2004 hence the authority unavoidably delegates its duty to multiple agents for them to sustainably manage water extraction notwithstanding delegation can be diverted to some extent from the principal s conservation objective due to the presence of free riders and spendthrift agents the extant groundwater management institutional setting seems to occur on a long alleyway without foreseeable end solution despite the fact that communities can self organize and get to manage common pool resources cpr it is assumed in the present work that central governments will continue to be responsible for national and regional water conservation objectives under this setting new or improved institutional arrangements should be implemented business as usual principal agent relationships certainly accelerate the exhaustion of groundwater resources groundwater sustainable management is relevant since the evidence reveals spread groundwater overexploitation in dry regions around the world barlow and leake 2012 oecd 2017a 2017b if true water resource sustainability is on top of the priority list of the authorities both delegation and the social contract should be innovatively enforced in turn smart and innovative incentives which may crop up from the positive and careful activation of the intrinsic motivations of thrift water extraction may trigger convergence toward the water conservation objectives of the principal as the monitoring and enforcement of the social contract on the part of central and regional governments is currently so limited what alternatives do governments have to exert productive delegation on farmers and other water users the answers to this question are not simple since the evidence suggests that incentives may crowd out individuals from contributions to conservation cardenas et al 2000 gneezy et al 2011 possible solutions should contemplate different variables such as timely control of extraction before depletion fluctuations due to climate variability and water scarcity multiplicity of agents sustainable yield as related to aquifer stocks and rules intended to prevent over exploitation to mention just a few this is a titanic societal task that pursues sustainable extraction rates in which collective contribution is claimed more importantly sustainability requires further discussion on effective incentives to generate stable extraction declinations not just expressing whether crowding out or crowding in occurs in this article the author discusses theory of incentives plus a short analysis of asymmetrical information as seen through the lens of colombia s groundwater management law elements are provided to illustrate the existence of a sort of social contract with clear clauses the compliance with which might make groundwater management transactions more predictable and less perilous for the existence of aquifers this analysis is conducted in the caribbean region of colombia and other regions wherein droughts and water scarcity are exacerbated by the looming threat of climate variability in this respect the institutional economics theory allows explaining incentive analysis asymmetric information regarding aquifer status and the transaction costs of coordination for sustainable aquifer management however extant situation reflects an unbalanced outflow inflow relationship in the sense that extractions tend to outpace recharge levels in the context of study different institutions have formally and informally evolved and led aquifer systems to overexploitation and water table declination in sucre la guajira magdalena southeastern part in casanare in tunja bogotá d c and boyacá in the andean region there is some knowledge on recharge rates of aquifer systems but real figures on extraction is completely ignored understanding unawareness of extraction activities by authorities the complete insubordination to formal rules of extraction permits request and existing institutions governing informal illegal extractions are intricate tasks the aim of this work is to understand the extant contractual delegation of groundwater extraction to farmers and other water users in colombia to find out innovative incentives to manage aquifers under climate change this understanding is a relevant first step before undertaking the improvement of institutional arrangements in water management in agriculture to pursue sustainability objectives under the threats of climate change as to the research methods document analysis allowed examining the groundwater decrees that regulate extraction from aquifers just as well interviews were conducted with environmental authority officials borehole technicians and farmers from the departments of la guajira bogotá córdoba and sucre this article is organized as follows the first part includes this introductory section the second part makes brief reference to theory of incentives and transaction costs concepts as applied to water and cpr special attention is paid to contract theory since a hydro social contract allegedly exists between principal and agents entitled to extract water in the third section the theory of incentives is introduced since in entitling extraction permits principals unavoidably delegate on agents although their interests tend to diverge hence incentives for groundwater conservation are discussed in their relationship with social institutions the final sections convey the discussion and conclusions 1 1 overview of groundwater norms and regulations in colombia groundwater and specifically aquifers are legally protected natural resources under national environmental law the first legislative decision towards groundwater protection was released 48 years ago through decree 2811 1974 without mentioning any forecast about climate variability or drought this norm makes brief reference to the limited character of this underground resource nonetheless it establishes contingencies in case of evident risk of dangerous depletion or contamination of aquifers or progressive shrinkage of extracted water in these eventualities the decree states that new extraction permits may be denied and the existing ones partially restricted or even cancelled government entities bestow on individuals public water facilities farmers or companies the right to extract water for a renewable period public water facilities might be entitled for up to a period of 50 years while other water users might be allowed extraction for up to 10 years all these maximum periods of extraction may be renewed nevertheless decree 1541 states that when land is used only for domestic purposes there is no need to request an entitlement to extract water from the underground the entitlement of an underground water extraction permit entails the payment of a retributive rate which is intended to offset the negative consequences of the economic activities arising from groundwater use remarkably decree 2811 refers to the need to keep enough water stocks and preserve the environment when prioritizing aquifer allocations the decree 1541 1978 states that in case the environmental authority is knowledgeable about any groundwater basin depletion problem the permit cannot be granted however an explicit statement about the need to conduct investigation into the causes of depletion contamination and existing economic activities is mainly formulated from the engineering perspective yet it does not explicitly mention the common pool resource cpr character of aquifers 1 1 at first glance aquifers appear to be typical cpr as such although they are subjected to rivalry they are non excludable in nature nevertheless governmental attempts to control access and bestow extraction permits seem to turn aquifers into club goods which are in turn defined as non subjected to rivalry but excludable in nature likewise the need to address externalities arising from competition and extraction costs is missing formal rules are focused on entitling or denying extraction permits to petitioners in legal terms the centralized control of groundwater allocation to water claimants aims at guaranteeing groundwater sustainability notwithstanding there are different sources of complications risks asymmetric information and limited adherence to institutions and rules these difficulties which are listed below limit the possibilities that the parties involved fulfill their side of the agreed social contract groundwater extraction by the users entails the production of externalities arising from private exploitation free riders benefiting from the cpr actually piggyback on the effort of others monitoring withdrawals and legal procedures against users who illegally drill new wells reveals how the government is often defeated madani and dinar 2012 sandoval 2004 the environmental authority should know the extant locations and extraction rates of wells under operation however the transaction costs of monitoring dispersed users make this a complicated and in vain task the water regulatory system is continuously hindered because of the complexity and the time needed to administer legal procedures madani and dinar 2012 sandoval 2004 is there any need to implement formal contracts intending to reduce uncertainty and enforce water rules are uncertainty and high monitoring and transaction costs valid reasons not to enact extraction permits via contracts or despite such hindrances is it justified to endeavor in formal agreements agents are more likely to agree on pumping limits when the aggregate benefits exceed transaction and implementation costs ayres et al 2018 this is a short list of elements to take into consideration when it comes to agreeing on verbal or written contracts among water users and central governmental agencies actually the problems associated to devising and implementing social contracts should not deter governments from finding more institutional options to manage valuable water resources for all kinds of users with different types of contractual water allocations 2 document analysis and literature on transaction costs and theory of incentives transaction cost theory is relevant for groundwater management due to the existence of coordination tradeoffs which crop up between the endeavor to collectively reach productive outcomes and the costs of reaching them interactions and cooperation in conserving a cpr can be rather complex especially when a set of individuals repeatedly use the same common resource in different locations over long periods of time all transactions are concluded with some form of contract which according to contract theory is established when the parties involved consider they have reached an agreement that benefits all of them ostmann and meinhardt 2008 groenewegen et al 2010 nevertheless the types of social contracts should bear in mind the effects of climate change on water resources therefore multiple sources of uncertainties on available water and flows stocks appear and the stakeholders involved in the social contracts should add flexibility to water extraction activities this is no matter if a farmer is awarded a certain water flow he she should be willing to reduce extraction volumes if a severe drought is forecasted certainly the delegation to exert extractions should be adaptable to the pressures of climate change effects on water resources thus new and innovative incentives should be devised to make contracts as useful instruments for sustainability under the shared responsibility of users and governments in charge of water use control to the best of the author s knowledge formal groundwater extraction contracts are not common in the literature in this context the formal petition of extraction permits and respective entitlement is taken as a formal contract between governments and water users see tables 1 1 thus we may understand groundwater extraction permits as social contracts once an extraction permit is entitled there seem to be explicit clauses for sustainable groundwater management this assumed social contract contains overarching rules sanctions in case of rule breaking criteria for contract amendments and other elements shaping the permission which are described in the lines that follow 2 1 transaction cost economics challenges in practice reaching stable cooperation levels in sustainably managing groundwater extractions entails the need to coordinate water users towards this purpose attaining groundwater management cooperation requires water users to renounce the lure to purely pursue self interest in order to contribute to collective interest in their commonly managed aquifers the essential problem of cooperation in managing a cpr has to do with reducing the joint cost of extraction and increasing the joint benefit of cooperation v o e ostrom 1977 social scientists used to think there was a natural tendency for people with shared interests to act together in pursuit of those interests oliver 1993 notwithstanding such natural tendency might not be straightforward so people would not automatically agree on cooperating to conserve or maintain their cpr paraphrasing coase 1960 a sustainable cpr management rearrangement depends on balancing its own costs with the productive value increase that it likely entails what does a coordination for cpr extraction sustainable management mean based on the socio physical contexts of groundwater overexploitation it implies moving from an uncoordinated independent and selfish water units appropriation to a system of new social rules and institutions aimed at reaching stable productive outcomes tables 1 1 lists a series of sound rules and institutions that might work for sustainable groundwater extraction management accordingly there exist institutional dimensions towards sustainable aquifer management worth to note complying with the mandatory groundwater extraction permit fulfilling the legal obligation to request an extraction permit firstly implies confirming that every single prospective water user is acquainted with this norm having done this an individual may confront their personal principles to the costs and benefits of compliance income level socioeconomic background social status and many other variables may play a role in the decision to abide by the external norm people might even deliberate with neighbors to exchange perceptions about it restricting the number of wells on own lands wells placed over urban or rural areas are private goods that belong to landowners or lessors this fact differentiates aquifers from open access resources such as forests or fishing areas the surface plots where the wells are built are excludable and the private character of wells impede other neighbors to collect water from them limiting pumping extraction timing to be consistent with declined precipitations caused by climate change limiting pumping extraction rates to be consistent with reduced aquifer stocks availability caused by reduced precipitations caused by climate change however agents are more likely to agree on pumping limits where aggregate benefits exceed transaction and implementation costs ayres et al 2018 devising mechanisms to resolve conflicts in case of water shortages occur defining monitoring and enforcing rules the question is how can this simple and short list of rules and institutions be implemented there is no single or clear cut answer to the necessary design to make these rules work who could lead the design of these new rules to adapt to the pressures of climate change effects on water resources what type of information would be needed to determine the most adequate timing and extraction rates under climate change scenarios how to ensure that every single user complies with their own rules and institutions what type of mechanisms might work better to discourage non cooperation and implement credible and applicable sanctions how to restart or upsurge cooperation in cases of free riding proliferation how to regain trust and cooperation while moving towards a profitable decision in case of deviation from agreed extraction paths in periods of severe scarcity who should be put in charge and how should sustainable extraction paths be recalculated and updated what instruments might be used to provide water extraction feedback and who could oversee their administration questions such as these picture a real norm design implementation and monitoring situation in fact issuing new rules and implementing and maintaining institutional work takes time and demands role assignation and individual and collective efforts and expenses in short it entails the need to decipher the complex challenge of keeping individuals as steady cooperators 2 2 theory of incentives in practice the theory of incentives addresses the alignment of the different members of an organization with its central objectives laffont and martimort 2009 in the agriculture sector the landowner hires some workers to perform sowing maintenance and other activities inside a company the managers hire employees to perform operative and managerial activities police departments recruit men and women and train police officers to enforce the law on the streets government ministers hire public employees to delegate on them the obligation to serve the citizens in each of these cases there is an assignment from organizational leaders for a number of reasons the head of the organization must delegate various tasks to its members which naturally raises information flow management complications laffont and martimort 2009 the landowner expects his laborers to plant as many seeds as possible and to harvest high amount of k g h a even though in some cases the payment is based on performance he expects them to harvest as much as they can following quality assuring procedures the police commander wants his troops to be physically and mentally able to manage crime situations without exerting excessive force or abusing from authority at the end of the day he would not like to attend disclosing and fierce media interviews the minister expects his employees not to step out frequently to have coffee or keep distracted in their smartphones while the office phone is ringing or citizens wait in line he expects them to remain seated and produce during a minimum number of h r d a y in all of these organizations there is a principal who delegates assignments and an agent who executes them and is expected to keep the information they have received in order to adequately perform the tasks as soon as the principal delegates a task they expect it to be executed by their agents and wonder how will they behave while i am not shadowing on them conflicting objectives and decentralized information are the two basic ingredients of the incentives theory laffont and martimort 2009 similarly groundwater management is a principal multi agent relation in the former cases there is a direct subordination relation you do the task i request and i pay you for this in groundwater extraction management the task is quite different at least in most oecd countries groundwater is a state property it means that the principal represents the owner of the resource and the agents must request a permission to usufruct it however there is legal subordination since the principal dictates water extraction level norms in the case of industry the principal pays the agents because he she perceives the resulting productivity in the groundwater management case agents pay the principal because they perceive the marginal benefit of extraction groundwater resources can be separated into five rights 1 access 2 withdrawal 3 management 4 exclusion and 5 transferability donohew 2005 these listed rights are connected to groundwater management stages the principal agent model being at stake in each stage the information condensed in table 1 is quite idealistic for different reasons firstly cprs have many users and this raises many issues given that cprs are affected by non excludability if an agent cannot be barred from benefiting from the contribution of other agents who do respect the delegation the former is motivated not to contribute but to free ride on the contribution of others cárdenas 2009 fleishman 1988 ostrom 2015a secondly in the groundwater management setting the interests of different stakeholders principal agents other actors may differ edelenbos et al 2013 this is the case of free riders who are certainly not aligned with formal institutional objectives besides modest free riders in colombia there exist powerful companies from mining and agricultural sectors with the capacity to be entitled to extract abundant water resources while neighboring low income communities remain unattended in fulfilling human right to water access thirdly the principal s capability to monitor delegation tends to be limited indeed officials face constraints to cope with the complex and scattered phenomenon of deep well drillings sandoval 2004 as a result in practice the principal says i delegate onto you but i cannot monitor you so i trust you follow my rule given anomalies in power relations in water access pervasive free riding and unstable cooperation this might be understood as an incomplete delegation among a pervasive and dispersed extraction activity however if this type of incompleteness is found in formal relationships informal markets in water extractions content a sort of hidden institutions governing water access in colombia 64 000 groundwater sources are registered and for only 30 000 ideam 2019 of them some hydrogeological information is gathered by environmental authorities this is for the unlicensed 52 of aquifer users no information is available this incomplete knowledge on water extraction is widespread across the country in the northeast extreme of the country in la guajira out of 2631 wells there is only information for 15 of them for the remaining 2210 wells real figures on extractions are unknown in sucre in the north of the country the authority reports having knowledge of almost 100 of 1713 groundwater users however according to the national agricultural census every year almost 9700 farms dane 2015 mostly collect groundwater for crops irrigation and cattle raising activities in the south of the country in macarena region the authority reports having reports on 20 of groundwater users this is a special case since army conflict may have exacerbated the limitations in getting water users monitored in the central part of colombia in boyacá there is information for only 30 of users and in the sabana of bogotá authorities officially report ignoring information on 28 of its users ideam 2019 but illegal or informal groundwater users represent 60 of total users in this region car 2015 in central western part in tolima where the biggest rice producer companies exist there is full ignorance on the groundwater extraction behavior since out of 3830 wells reported there is 0 knowledge on water extractions a similar situation is registered in magdalena in the northern part of the country in the group of municipalities close to medellin in the northwest of colombia in the eastern part in santander and in the southwestern part in valle del cauca to mention just a few in all these cases water users are managing significant water volumes without any recorded figures and the delegation to extract authorized water units w i t is impossible or inexistent in informal water markets how may water wells be built under complete ignorance of authorities how formal water wells construction markets co exist with illegal informal water extraction markets if hidden markets of water wells building co occur with formal rules of extraction permits so hidden institutions may be present as well accessing water without authorities notice is not simply about hiding soil perforation equipment before building wells in private plots but hiding the reasons why approaching cpr without revealing any rule consistent with the need to conserve water hidden institutions in informal or illegal water access refer to collecting water under an unlimited stock believe and without reporting extraction levels governing groundwater sustainably must eliminate this knowledge gap if ignorance on informal and formal water volumes extracted continue sustainable management of aquifers would not only be incomplete but an illusion different questions may turn up over the alleged incompleteness in formal water markets how to handle this unavoidable delegation of the extraction activity by the environmental authority principal on water users agents under what conditions may groundwater sustainability come up amidst this incomplete principal to agent delegation in this case the category unavoidable conveys the notion that if delegation were not possible the government agency would have to collect the water from centralized boreholes and distribute it to farmers households and companies alternatively the principal could also visit every single plot and turn on or operate the water pumps according to the permission conditions this complex time consuming and cost ineffective groundwater extraction management alternative just does not make sense under certain circumstances it may be possible for a principal to induce agents to behave exactly as he she would do in sharing the agents skills and knowledge sappington 1991 in this principal agent model the environmental authority simply wishes every agent requests the permit keep up to its conditions and do not extract beyond sustainable levels delegation being sensibly unavoidable it certainly constitutes a challenging responsibility for the principal through each permission granted there exist intertemporal implications for sustainable aquifer management if wastefully water use is admitted and replenishment conditions are not met each water unit w i t i 1 2 n i n d i v i d u a l s t 0 1 t t i m e p e r i o d s granted today will simply not exist in the future when the principal delegates he she should have access to truthful information because each water unit counts while performing the groundwater management function the principal receives many claims for water extraction he she might decide whether w 11 w 21 or w 11 w 21 i e they must decide whether to allocate more water units to one agent in time 1 or more to another agent in time 2 at the end of the day the principal should know the sum of water units granted for extraction i 1 n t 1 t w i t the relevance of this information is not trivial the total extraction volume is useful to determine to what extent the aquifer stock is being portioned for the periods of permission ignoring the relevance of the size of w i t and i 1 n t 1 t w i t may jeopardize the opportunities to sustainably manage the aquifer stocks and flows under climate change conditions consequently every w i t granted to the agents might be understood as a rule oriented delegation commanding them to extract a water volume less or equal to the entitled one w i t during the determined time limit notwithstanding due to the presence of free riders and spendthrift agents one may observe some divergence from the delegation and hence from the principal s objective that is the principal says i want the agent to follow my rule but they just pass it over the objective states that the agents should extract limited amounts of water units because the resource is not unlimited and future generations deserve using it hence w i t is much more than a number it represents a flow of data processed through hydrogeological formulas leading to a feasible water volume extraction w i t embodies a great deal of aquifer status information taking into account aquifer recharge levels precipitation evapotranspiration and other variables governed by nature based on this argumentation principals should devise new or improved incentives to trigger convergence toward their objectives in this claim it is suggested that better meaningful and relevant information may play a role as an incentive aimed at triggering intrinsic motivations one may wonder what type of information it is as well as its format channel frequency and mechanism of dissemination these issues caution that information provision is not a straightforward task departing from typical status quo information delivered to water users it can be observed that water managers and environmental authorities usually release information on prices extraction charges and allowed extraction amounts these price and non price approaches may fall short in generating sufficient incentives aimed at curbing water extraction or keeping entitled water volume indeed pervasive overexploitation around the world seems to support this conjecture incentives to trigger cooperative building motivations should be reasoned in the context of free riding and the conventional competition for cpr units said this incentives need to be contextualized in situations of collective damage or collective productive outcomes competition free riding and the delegation to extract w i t units involve worth to note basic dimensions a time for extraction and likely eventual depletion b the need to adapt to scarcity and climate change c multiplicity of agents d sustainable yield and stocks under climate change scenarios e rules delivered to prevent over exploitation one of the challenges of this rule s delivery from the principals refer to embedding incentives in the existing social institutional setting wherein free riders and cooperators interact inside communities and intricate hidden institutions in water allocations exist in this case cooperative behavior implies keeping up to the entitled w i t units however free riders neither request permits nor attach to any pre determined w i t unit amount for this reason the rule itself which is not the only resource at hand might not be an incentive at all so there is room for improvement in incentives design 2 3 incentives rules from inside and outside laffont and martimort 2009 have discussed the need to design institutions aimed at incentivizing economic agents to accomplish the principal s objectives complementarily it is suggested in the current work that incentives operate bidirectionally as shown in fig 1 groundwater management systems require the design of incentives to spark productive social institutions and rules in dealing with water extraction similarly formal and informal institutions are necessary to activate positive incentives let us assume that at certain point in time there are n agents distributed among farmers households and businesses for each type of agent a segment of them is following the formal rules stated by the principal asking for a water extraction permit paying charges reporting consumption limiting extraction to agreed w i t units see table 2 while another group just lives in anarchy later on some movements occur between both groups so those who cooperate and follow the rules decide to break their cooperative behavior and shirk extant institutions while free riders regret and begin to follow the rules back and forth swaps do not come from nowhere belonging to one group and swapping to the other might be permeated by a collection of motivations the level of knowledge on the current water availability and the expectations on the occurrence of severe droughts in the upcoming days put farmers to reveal to which group they belong to individualistic and collectivistic intrinsic motivations are revealed during harsh drought conditions some farmers are more prone to risk aversion inequity aversion and reciprocity when dealing with water shortages in magdalena and sucre meanwhile in la guajira where the driest conditions occur some farmers are more inclined to argue that they definitely cannot lose crops due to lack of irrigation so they will proceed to irrigate crops no matter what the rule is see tables 2 and 3 table 4 the environmental authority is expected to activate smart rules from outside and be able to merge external with internal rules bearing in mind the intrinsic factors that motivate farmers to conserve water through extraction limits compliance in addition since some communities have successfully reached productive outcomes in managing their commons and overcome the free riding temptation ostrom 2015b schlager 2002 bold entrepreneurs are needed to re start social institutions that work for the people this entrepreneurship is suggested to firstly understand the social institutions in time and place and especially the evolution of institutions under the presence of external changes issues such as the looming threats of climate effects on water availability cannot expect that institutions keep inert therefore the expected cooperation to conserve water in periods of droughts is complex since institutions evolve and similarly the incentives to conserve the left side of fig 1 depicts the corresponding structure of incentives which are understood as steering mechanisms aimed at moving agents behavior towards the desired direction of cooperation these mechanisms are deemed as internal when they come from agents determination or external if they come from authorities who in paper seek for sustainable water management it is suggested here that between rules the devising of institutions and the structure of incentives there is not such a leap instead new or improved rules add subtract or transform the existing institutions prior to activating positive or desired incentives that is rules are initially digested before turning into a desired incentive examples of rules are as follows see tables 2 2 rules from outside are usually implemented through price and non price approaches one of the most relevant incentives provided by standard economics refers to the influence of prices on demand the law of demand declares an inverse relationship between prices and quantities if prices of a certain good rise the demanded good amount decreases notwithstanding prices as driving mechanisms to reduce the demand for a good in this case to reduce water extraction rely on key issues such as price elasticity of the demand in the short and long term also average price elasticity at the household level has been found to be around 0 51 olmstead and stavins 2009 which represents an inelastic water demand this inelasticity leads water agencies and environmental authorities to implement non price approaches as extrinsic incentives to curb water demand tables 2 and 3 presents a short list of extrinsic motivations deemed as upcoming from water authorities in turn some intrinsic motivations that may arise from water users acting as agents before the principal s regulations are included the referred intrinsic motivations work in favor and against cooperation towards the sustainability of groundwater rules inequity aversion cox 2004 fehr and schmidt 1999 velez et al 2009 reciprocity axelrod 1984 axelrod r william 1981 hamilton 1964 and trust cox 2004 may benefit cooperative behavior as a means of keeping actual cooperation and motivate others by setting the norm contrarily some internal motivations such as pursuing individual objectives in agricultural or industrial activities do not favor cooperation and even might spark retreat from it in other intrinsic motivations there is more room for improvement when searching cooperation the literature on crowding out and the provision of extrinsic incentives concludes that the latter do not last for long cardenas et al 2000 warn that discreetly imposed local environmental policies may not be effective while meier 2007 informs that people decrease their contributions after the motivational mechanism has been removed furthermore compensations have been insinuated to hinder the performance of individuals gneezy and rustichini 2000 it is suggested here that a discussion on whether incentives provoke crowding out or not falls short when referring to sustainable management of water resources sustainability requires further discussion on effective incentives to generate stable extraction declination not just expressing whether crowding out or crowding in occurs as described in tables 2 and 3 intrinsic motivations may abound and go beyond price approaches menaces and sticks from the principal in relation to promoting sustainable groundwater management incentives should be carefully designed in order to avoid eroding personal and collective engagement with water conservation extrinsic incentives may in some way crowd out intrinsic motivations that are important to produce the desired behavior gneezy et al 2011 for example in some contexts such as performance at workplace health services education completion or employment search some incentives might be provided to encourage productivity increase at work getting rid of detrimental habits for health increasing school attendance or improving people s ability towards employability if the structure of incentives does not achieve switching behaviors or the latter do not persist through time some alternatives may arise for instance employees might be sacked or transferred to other positions patients may opt for taking more medication and students might move to other schools or alternative education methods in the standard incentive effect the motivation to perform a task without an additional motivation can be permanently reduced gneezy et al 2011 for which purpose some alternatives might be found by the agent notwithstanding sustainability issues related to water conservation green house gas emission reductions ecosystem protection endangered species preservation and other top essential for life issues would require a carefully designed structure of incentives the latter must ensure that positive behaviors in favor of natural resource conservation do not vanish in the long term given the vital character of water in the principal agent relationships the former should bear in mind that before promoting their objective it is necessary to understand what stimulates people see fig 2 monetary rewards gneezy and rustichini 2000 sanctions or compensations do not necessarily lead to curbing water extraction more specifically money and prices may encourage or discourage desired behaviors titmus 1970 provided an outstanding theoretical input from economics to the discussion on monetary rewards and contributions to desired behavior this author asserted that offering money to individuals in exchange for blood donations may undermine their intrinsic motivations to follow voluntary donation social norms urban water management literature suggests the short term impact of water saving programs around the world water conservation achievements tend to be transitory to the point that sometimes gains revert to prior to intervention levels fielding et al 2013 lindenberg and steg 2007 in a cpr setting an environmental policy can be more detrimental than beneficial especially when allowing individuals to collectively meet local environmental dilemmas without interference cardenas et al 2000 the authors argue that the main reason for observed weak performance of an external intervention by environmental authorities is that the control measures crowded out group regarding behavior in favor of stronger selfish behavior consequently external control monetary rewards and pricing approaches seem not to incorporate enough drivers to curb cpr extraction in order to provide any type of incentive for achieving plausible objectives or extraction goals say limited to w i t it is necessary to achieve a better understanding of the real intrinsic motivation and extrinsic incentives that underlie an agent s conformity with an extraction rule as depicted in fig 2 before devising incentives and jumping to expected extraction goals it may be necessary to get acquainted with the mentioned motivations it is suggested here that the fulfilment of extraction goals should be evaluated as a means of providing updated feedback on people s motivation the devising of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives should ponder that for example at time t 1 n individuals living over or in the surroundings of a cpr ground are accustomed to certain water extraction patterns suppose that the authority visits the productive plots in order to update their figures about regulation compliance farmers collect groundwater to irrigate their crops according to plant growth periods businesses extract groundwater units to perform their productive activities and households do the same to fulfil water consumption requirements the authority finds that some agents display the granted permits while many others do not later at time t 5 some new agents have requested permits while others have ignored this obligation or are simply not motivated to do it those who requested the permits may be extracting larger or lesser amounts than w i t w i 0 w i t 1 t w i t 0 w i 0 is the extracted amount when the agent commences their extraction activity similarly at time t 5 the authority finds that in not priorly visited locations new collective efforts to self manage aquifers have arisen inside the communities see examples in tables 2 2 in the latter case caution might be required prior to any rule delivery if applicable because external control may crowd out group regarding behavior in favor of a stronger selfish behavior cardenas et al 2000 the case of autonomous devising of aquifer management rules deserves special attention since it shows how a promising self management endeavor could be fused with external regulations contrarily perhaps the autonomous endeavor should be left untouched by external agents in order not to destabilize or damage the devising of productive social institutions however the socio physical setting on which the present research has focused corresponds to non registered groundwater resource management institutional arrangements in summary the principal agent model analyzes goal alignment between delegation on the part of the principal and implementation by the agents as mentioned before divergences may occur between both parties as a complement to these deviations asymmetries may arise in the type of information that each party is able to handle and afford 2 4 asymmetric information on water stocks and flows groundwater management sustainability is a matter of stocks flows and water quality the evidence of aquifer overexploitation reflects groundwater availability declination the sustainable use of both renewable and nonrenewable aquifers entails the need to maintain significant water amounts for current and future generations groundwater availability is governed by variables such as recharge rates extraction rates by different users discharges to surface water precipitation levels and other more complex hydrogeological variables physical or environmental variables such as precipitation water table static and dynamic levels and recharge and discharge rates influence socio economic variables such as extraction rates extraction costs and well productivity in some cases the relation is inverted and social variables end up influencing bio physical ones this is the case when for example extraction rates affect the water table and consequently the depression cones hydrogeological laws describe the generation of a depression cone when a well is under operation when several wells are close to each other their depression cones may overlap glennon 2002 kalf and woolley 2005 in case that some water users continuously extract much more water than others wider depression cones may be formed and overlap with neighbor ones cone overlapping may influence the productivity of surrounding wells likewise extraction rates alter the static and dynamic levels of aquifer stocks for another thing social variables such as extraction rates alter other social variables as well social variables such as volumes of extraction extraction timing number of wells well density on the surface depends on human decisions more suggestively social variables depend on interrelated human decisions among water users for instance the higher the extraction rate by single users the higher the cost of extraction for all water users in the vicinity of a well the higher and more constant the extraction rate the higher the probability to perceive the social effects of wider cones of depression in the underground as mentioned above depression cones overlapping alters the productivity of the wells involved thus negatively affecting their users given the difficulty to foresee socio physical interactions getting acquainted with them requires the capability to monitor different social and physical parameter data cpr users use to know their location respect to the resource system more specifically anderies et al 2013 presents evidence on contexts where participants share asymmetric positions respect to irrigation systems given that players located close to the head or to the end of the irrigation canals obtain asymmetric right to use to the water each player has incentives to cooperate and reach favorable outcomes in contexts of provision and appropriation decisions under asymmetric or sequential appropriation the opportunity to communicate influences cooperation and coordination cardenas et al 2011 ostrom e gardner 1994 in these contexts there exists asymmetrical information on the locations benefits perceived and quality of information on the resource stock conditions in the aquifer systems farmers use to know how far they and neighbors are from water tables besides farmers have a slight idea of water flows in their vicinities nevertheless knowledge on water stocks is lacking water stocks and flows are not always perceived in time since this demands technology and financial resources that allow gathering an updated data repository of water table stock level and recharge and discharge data it is ordinarily assumed that physical variables are best monitored and collected by environmental authorities since this type of information requires sophisticated equipment and is costly and difficult to collect unless for academic purposes one can hardly picture individuals and farmers approaching to environmental authority offices to inquire about hydrogeological variables this is not to say that farmers are not interested in relevant environmental variables since the necessary processing capacity and technical knowledge tends to keep them away from this pursuit it is observed here that sophisticated information about physical variables is mostly managed by environmental authorities instead of the public who are not familiar or not interested in it in turn individuals households and communities are more likely to be acquainted with certain social and economic variables they are probably more familiar with the relevant information they need to access water farmers have more knowledge about borehole building costs how long it takes to fill a thousand liter tank or what equipment was used to extract water there are probably few people from urban and rural neighborhoods with precise knowledge about the storativity and transmissivity coefficients recharge rates or depression cone shape of the aquifers they benefit from furthermore they may not need to know this technical information indeed difficult to process farmers tend to take into consideration those hydrogeological variables they personally need for example they are more interested in how deep the water table is and how deep they must punch to get a bore hole built environmental authorities have information on the extensive margin that is how many wells have been legally built and where they may be located in case a groundwater user formally legally requests a permit this is the opportunity for the environmental authority to collect this type of information however some of these entities in colombia acknowledge that illegal or informal groundwater users represent 60 of total users in certain regions for their part individuals and households might rather have information on the intensive margin for example they may know their truthful extraction volume if they have a consumption measuring device which is not the rule but the exception in the research area a key concern for the sustainability of aquifers is that neither environmental authorities nor farmers are acquainted on the approximate water volumes being aggregately extracted authorities partially dominate the data on the physical variables and water users have some knowledge on social variables however the knowledge on the key socio physical variable concerning the time series of extraction rates is missing for both in general it can be said that socio physical data about groundwater status flows in asymmetric information settings reaching symmetric information scenarios in groundwater management may result difficult to pursue environmental and water authorities have their own roles limitations constraints and restricted monitoring capacity individuals households and communities spend time pursuing personal economic and social needs that is people are busy working doing domestic or productive activities and not always have time to get acquainted with physical and hydrogeological variables especially when people face water scarcity they are busy collecting and storing some cubic meters of water in carrying out personal and productive activities people may face limitations regarding time budget and even interest in environmental issues notwithstanding asymmetries in groundwater socio physical information may have implications for the extraction and sustainability of this resource information asymmetries are not problematic per se because each actor is playing their role in a limited framework difficulties arise from widened information gaps between different actors in groundwater socio ecological systems reducing socio physical information asymmetries between principal and agents should be a top priority in climate change adaptation based on data for decision making 3 discussion curbing water extraction demands understanding the type of motivations that incentivize adhesion to sustainability purposes since water conservation might be considered a socially desirable norm and a public interest issue incentives directed to water users may either crowd them in or out from the expected results indeed on behalf of sustainability interests smart and alternative incentivizing approaches are required the structure of incentives should consider that a set of rules from outside and from inside operate locally these cannot be taken for granted when designing the intrinsic and extrinsic models to motivate farmers to treat aquifers as depletable resource worth to be conserved this research has studied intrinsic and extrinsic forms of motivation but results do not necessarily lead to desired behaviors in ensuring that farmers in colombia abide by the rule of requesting extraction permits the formal environmental rules in colombia still take rule compliance for granted without providing additional incentives further than releasing information on the legal procedures extrinsic dis incentives such as sanctioning rule breakers has not been reported in the field in colombia if this would happened this would signal farmers and all users about the urgency and relevance of water conservation extrinsic motivations such as monetary rewards gneezy and rustichini 2000 restricting the pump power connection or regulating power supply to wells meinzen dick et al 2016 discreetly imposed local environmental policies cardenas et al 2000 monetary sanctions imposed restrictions or threating exclusion from cpr benefits all have proven to be insufficient to incorporate the abundant intrinsic motivations that drive cpr users it is suggested here that it is time not only for users to be more active but for administrators to treat them as center pieces in devising stable and robust incentives aimed at encouraging cooperation in water conservation in connection with incentivizing desired behaviors some social programs in developing countries promote the accomplishment of nutrition health education and labor indicators by motivating individuals through monetary rewards these strategies have proven effective in accumulating human capital to address the needs involved in people s lifecycle however fund availability for monetary and non monetary incentives is not the main issue at stake regarding contract delegation in groundwater extraction the real issue that should be collectively deliberated has to do with the interaction between the design of contract clauses and the nature of the cpr in question nature and more precisely aquifer systems have limits but these are usually recognized after granting extraction permits authentic sustainable management of aquifer systems should incorporate aquifer limits or extraction caps as an ex ante condition to decide on the amount of water w i t granted through an extraction permit formal regulation and extraction permit practices by environmental authorities in colombia timidly mention the risk of groundwater depletion and extracted water declination as an alleged criterion for contract amendment or denial of new extraction permits the generation of new regulatory systems for aquifer management should be overtly bounded by specific aquifer characterization and interactions between hydrogeological factors the latter may perform as pre conditions for setting the most responsible extraction rates e g either caps or target extraction rates as delimited by sustainable extraction paths as suggested by some environmental authority officials in la guajira and sucre water claimants often complain when informed about lower extraction flow entitlement this issue sets the scene to discuss the political and social opposition to delimited water flows pressure on water authorities often comes from watershed stakeholders who are interested in unlimited development donohew 2005 to the point of exerting power to guide water management institutional arrangements cardenas et al 2011 furthermore free riding is still an obstacle for groundwater extraction permits and formal agreements the transition from free riding to stable cooperative attitudes takes long water and environmental authorities and all involved governmental agencies should search for alternative institutional environments aimed at improved delegation on water users as part of the pre requisites for aquifer sustainable management under any climate change scenario all stakeholders of water management should start to implement pilot test aimed at rearranging the conditions to design credible social contracts adapted to local conditions physical conditions on the status and characteristics of the aquifer systems should become as common knowledge ostrom 2015b e ostrom 2002 in multiple and simple formats information provision landon et al 2018 sell and wilson 1991 may progressively activate the intrinsic motivations on water users to design social institutions consistent with the looming threats of climate change effects on water resources recent evidence has suggested the relevance of extraction quotas pfaff a vélez m ramos p molina 2015 in using a cpr and the information about remaining water stocks and remaining time for aquifer depletion as a means of signaling scarcity and to promote cooperation asprilla echeverría 2022 nonetheless the information provision to activate cooperation and signaling water scarcity is part of the equation aimed at building the foundations of social institutions adaptive to climate conditions information is only an instrument since more elements configure the drivers of cooperation the drivers for cooperation which might be classified in four drivers such as i instruments to stimulate cooperation ii conditions to reach stable cooperation iii assumptions in support of cooperation and iv strategies as building blocks aimed at structuring cooperation asprilla echeverría 2021 notwithstanding these drivers cannot be put to work without stakeholders engagement in a participatory process a structured participatory re design of institutions should systematically activate these drivers the method of the participatory process to stimulate cooperation cannot be unique and would depend on the contexts knowledge of inputs and resources under consideration stakeholders engagement pathway development and impact are deemed as part of the participatory conditions to promote cooperation for climate adaptation van der voorn et al 2017 more interestingly the adaptive capacity smit and wandel 2006 and resilience holling 1973 for climate change adaptation to manage aquifer systems can be part of the strategy development stage in catchment management strategy cms suggested by van der voorn et al 2012 the cms steps consists of inception of engagement reports continues with the assessment stage in which water resources and environment are assessed the following step is about the vision for the catchment area and finishes with the strategy development and its approval van der voorn et al 2012 applying this cms to aquifer systems demand the need to understand the system as cpr in which lots of incentives and disincentives for cooperation exists 4 conclusion this article is aimed at comprehending the extant contractual delegation of groundwater extraction to water users in colombia to find out innovative incentives to manage aquifers under climate change this understanding is a relevant first step before undertaking the improvement of institutional arrangements to pursue aquifer management adaptive to climate change effects particular attention is paid to drought areas of colombia relying on aquifers for domestic and agricultural activities the current top down hierarchical regulatory scheme seems to fall short in accomplishing the control of pervasive groundwater extraction it is certainly concerning to see that while water continues to be extracted and water tables steadily decline the current institutional setting seems to be lumbering and is seemingly unable to overcome the challenges of sustainability and climate change effects on water resources in the field of aquifer central management the authority acts as the principal and as such they are entitled to granting extraction permits in turn water users act as agents on whom water extraction is legally delegated this principal agent relationship holds an implicit contract aimed at taking care of aquifer resources delegation implies following some instructions and constraints in order to avoid groundwater depletion the problem is that while depletion is occurring the delegation structure has not changed since delegation is practically unavoidable we may question why the principal agent relationship is divergent from the principal s alleged purpose is it that agents are unaware of this outstanding delegation or the expectations of the parties actually diverge while sustainability is only at top governmental level discussions one of the challenges of this rule s delivery from the principals refers to embedding incentives in the existing social institutional setting wherein free riders and cooperators interact inside communities and intricate hidden institutions in water allocations exists in the areas exposed to droughts in colombia one might focus on water users understanding and practice of sustainability but given steady water table declination an acid test may cast some doubts on that approach however this is not to be blamed on water users since they are the reason for water regulatory systems a better understanding of their rationale is urgent should we always end up unsatisfied in understanding how a group of people witness the depletion of their cpr while maintaining current inertia in implemented rules and institutions how to deal with the task of delegating limited water extraction on agents if asking the principal to carry out extraction themselves tends to be unfeasible this alleged delegation is complex since users rarely apply for an extraction permit free riding on water access is pervasive and both extensive and intensive information on aquifer status is asymmetric water users tend to gather intensive data such as extracted water volumes extraction costs and neighbors conservation drivers for their part authorities know more about water tables recharge levels and numbers of users as they change in time and space information asymmetry is not a problem in itself troubles arise as a consequence of widening gaps in the information managed by different actors involved in groundwater socio ecological systems if true sustainability of water resources is on top of the priority list of authorities the social contract and a re engineered delegation should be innovatively enforced innovations may crop up from positive and careful activation of intrinsic motivations smart and innovative incentives may trigger convergence toward principal s water conservation objectives for this aim the design of social institutions able to activate extrinsic incentives and intrinsic motivations should not take extant institutions for granted thus in the structure of incentives design the drivers of cooperation see asprilla echeverría 2021 should be properly differentiated since some incentives might work in dealing with instruments to activate cooperation but fall short or inadequate to promote the needed conditions for the stability of cooperation since information provision is taken as part of the instruments to activate cooperation the corresponding structure of incentives should properly signal water scarcity situations because farmers prefer to avoid the woes of living without sufficient water among the conditions to support stable cooperation reciprocity and fairness preference are included however the incentives design to build positive reciprocity in conserving water takes time and it corresponds to the needed social institutions to guarantee cooperation as part of the assumptions supporting cooperation we can mention the expected low transaction costs of reaching the agreements to conserve water in this case the structure of incentives to ensure that the costs and complexity of working together are lower respect to the benefits of cooperation is challenged by the presence of free riders who may disincentive cooperators to keep as stable cooperators the overarching limitations of this research lie in the difficulty to further understand the design of incentives to put more drivers of cooperation to work this research was limited to understand the role of information provision as part of the instruments to stimulate cooperation nevertheless the drivers pertaining to social capital arenas such as reciprocity trust inequity aversion transaction costs and others were far from the scope of this research but would result as good complements to further comprehend what motivates farmers to build these social capital aspects this research had multiple limitations holding interviews with directive of environmental authorities was intended to broaden the perspectives on incentives and disincentives construction at local level but only the sub directors and engineers responded the calls the field work was developed only in three municipalities exposed to frequent droughts key comparisons with area exposed to less frequent droughts would result of interest to understand the structure of incentives level of information on aquifer conditions and the social institutions built locally under less pressures and stress of reduced water availability a continued research agenda is suggested in order to test the effects of incentives design for each type of drivers for cooperation aquifer systems provide water for half global population and for 38 of irrigated agricultural land barlow and leake 2012 oecd 2017b therefore more efforts should be exerted to understand how farmers using groundwater intensively but facing water scarcity are able to trust on others ability to reduce water extractions this is especially applicable to sustainable development goal 6 pursuing water use efficiency this efficiency demands water consumption declinations and users cooperation to conserve water as a cpr which is not straightforward thus depending on the stage of groundwater sustainable management drivers and incentives might be put to work productively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11734,sustainable water provision for rural and urban territories demands the understanding of institutions and incentives governing groundwater use under climate change the extant institutional design in colombia falls short to sustainably manage pervasive groundwater extraction and rule enforcement this article is aimed at understanding the extant contractual delegation of groundwater extraction on farmers as the main water users across the country this understanding is a relevant first step before undertaking the improvement of institutional arrangements to pursue real sustainability objectives of water use for agriculture despite pervasive free riding water access to a certain extent extraction permits act like social contracts with implicit clauses determined by the law in entitling extraction permits principals unavoidably delegate on agents although their interests tend to diverge in this relationship socio physical information about groundwater status is certainly asymmetric which is not problematic per se difficulties arise from widened gaps between groundwater management information portions managed by different actors besides contract design should operate under the natural limits of aquifer systems which are usually recognized after granting extraction permits notwithstanding crude caveats should be considered incomplete delegation and hidden institutions exists and if ignorance on informal and formal water volumes extracted continue sustainable management of aquifers would not only be incomplete but an illusion real sustainable management of aquifer systems when deciding upon water extraction permits should incorporate aquifer limits as an ex ante condition and innovative incentives that trigger institutions towards capped aquifer extractions graphical abstract aquifers and climate adaptation incentives information and institutions image 1 keywords institutions groundwater asymmetrical information principal agent transaction costs limits of nature extraction caps data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sustainable and secure water provision for rural and urban territories demand the understanding of institutions and incentives governing water use groundwater in developing countries like colombia is a centrally managed resource being this at state or regional level at best the authority as a principal grants a resource usufruct permission to a water agent farmer who pays a fee for it amidst this transaction there is an implicit contract with clear legal clauses in its role as principal the authority is expected to monitor contract compliance but monitoring extraction is complex water regulation systems are continuously hindered because the administration of legal procedures is complex and time consuming madani and dinar 2012 sandoval 2004 hence the authority unavoidably delegates its duty to multiple agents for them to sustainably manage water extraction notwithstanding delegation can be diverted to some extent from the principal s conservation objective due to the presence of free riders and spendthrift agents the extant groundwater management institutional setting seems to occur on a long alleyway without foreseeable end solution despite the fact that communities can self organize and get to manage common pool resources cpr it is assumed in the present work that central governments will continue to be responsible for national and regional water conservation objectives under this setting new or improved institutional arrangements should be implemented business as usual principal agent relationships certainly accelerate the exhaustion of groundwater resources groundwater sustainable management is relevant since the evidence reveals spread groundwater overexploitation in dry regions around the world barlow and leake 2012 oecd 2017a 2017b if true water resource sustainability is on top of the priority list of the authorities both delegation and the social contract should be innovatively enforced in turn smart and innovative incentives which may crop up from the positive and careful activation of the intrinsic motivations of thrift water extraction may trigger convergence toward the water conservation objectives of the principal as the monitoring and enforcement of the social contract on the part of central and regional governments is currently so limited what alternatives do governments have to exert productive delegation on farmers and other water users the answers to this question are not simple since the evidence suggests that incentives may crowd out individuals from contributions to conservation cardenas et al 2000 gneezy et al 2011 possible solutions should contemplate different variables such as timely control of extraction before depletion fluctuations due to climate variability and water scarcity multiplicity of agents sustainable yield as related to aquifer stocks and rules intended to prevent over exploitation to mention just a few this is a titanic societal task that pursues sustainable extraction rates in which collective contribution is claimed more importantly sustainability requires further discussion on effective incentives to generate stable extraction declinations not just expressing whether crowding out or crowding in occurs in this article the author discusses theory of incentives plus a short analysis of asymmetrical information as seen through the lens of colombia s groundwater management law elements are provided to illustrate the existence of a sort of social contract with clear clauses the compliance with which might make groundwater management transactions more predictable and less perilous for the existence of aquifers this analysis is conducted in the caribbean region of colombia and other regions wherein droughts and water scarcity are exacerbated by the looming threat of climate variability in this respect the institutional economics theory allows explaining incentive analysis asymmetric information regarding aquifer status and the transaction costs of coordination for sustainable aquifer management however extant situation reflects an unbalanced outflow inflow relationship in the sense that extractions tend to outpace recharge levels in the context of study different institutions have formally and informally evolved and led aquifer systems to overexploitation and water table declination in sucre la guajira magdalena southeastern part in casanare in tunja bogotá d c and boyacá in the andean region there is some knowledge on recharge rates of aquifer systems but real figures on extraction is completely ignored understanding unawareness of extraction activities by authorities the complete insubordination to formal rules of extraction permits request and existing institutions governing informal illegal extractions are intricate tasks the aim of this work is to understand the extant contractual delegation of groundwater extraction to farmers and other water users in colombia to find out innovative incentives to manage aquifers under climate change this understanding is a relevant first step before undertaking the improvement of institutional arrangements in water management in agriculture to pursue sustainability objectives under the threats of climate change as to the research methods document analysis allowed examining the groundwater decrees that regulate extraction from aquifers just as well interviews were conducted with environmental authority officials borehole technicians and farmers from the departments of la guajira bogotá córdoba and sucre this article is organized as follows the first part includes this introductory section the second part makes brief reference to theory of incentives and transaction costs concepts as applied to water and cpr special attention is paid to contract theory since a hydro social contract allegedly exists between principal and agents entitled to extract water in the third section the theory of incentives is introduced since in entitling extraction permits principals unavoidably delegate on agents although their interests tend to diverge hence incentives for groundwater conservation are discussed in their relationship with social institutions the final sections convey the discussion and conclusions 1 1 overview of groundwater norms and regulations in colombia groundwater and specifically aquifers are legally protected natural resources under national environmental law the first legislative decision towards groundwater protection was released 48 years ago through decree 2811 1974 without mentioning any forecast about climate variability or drought this norm makes brief reference to the limited character of this underground resource nonetheless it establishes contingencies in case of evident risk of dangerous depletion or contamination of aquifers or progressive shrinkage of extracted water in these eventualities the decree states that new extraction permits may be denied and the existing ones partially restricted or even cancelled government entities bestow on individuals public water facilities farmers or companies the right to extract water for a renewable period public water facilities might be entitled for up to a period of 50 years while other water users might be allowed extraction for up to 10 years all these maximum periods of extraction may be renewed nevertheless decree 1541 states that when land is used only for domestic purposes there is no need to request an entitlement to extract water from the underground the entitlement of an underground water extraction permit entails the payment of a retributive rate which is intended to offset the negative consequences of the economic activities arising from groundwater use remarkably decree 2811 refers to the need to keep enough water stocks and preserve the environment when prioritizing aquifer allocations the decree 1541 1978 states that in case the environmental authority is knowledgeable about any groundwater basin depletion problem the permit cannot be granted however an explicit statement about the need to conduct investigation into the causes of depletion contamination and existing economic activities is mainly formulated from the engineering perspective yet it does not explicitly mention the common pool resource cpr character of aquifers 1 1 at first glance aquifers appear to be typical cpr as such although they are subjected to rivalry they are non excludable in nature nevertheless governmental attempts to control access and bestow extraction permits seem to turn aquifers into club goods which are in turn defined as non subjected to rivalry but excludable in nature likewise the need to address externalities arising from competition and extraction costs is missing formal rules are focused on entitling or denying extraction permits to petitioners in legal terms the centralized control of groundwater allocation to water claimants aims at guaranteeing groundwater sustainability notwithstanding there are different sources of complications risks asymmetric information and limited adherence to institutions and rules these difficulties which are listed below limit the possibilities that the parties involved fulfill their side of the agreed social contract groundwater extraction by the users entails the production of externalities arising from private exploitation free riders benefiting from the cpr actually piggyback on the effort of others monitoring withdrawals and legal procedures against users who illegally drill new wells reveals how the government is often defeated madani and dinar 2012 sandoval 2004 the environmental authority should know the extant locations and extraction rates of wells under operation however the transaction costs of monitoring dispersed users make this a complicated and in vain task the water regulatory system is continuously hindered because of the complexity and the time needed to administer legal procedures madani and dinar 2012 sandoval 2004 is there any need to implement formal contracts intending to reduce uncertainty and enforce water rules are uncertainty and high monitoring and transaction costs valid reasons not to enact extraction permits via contracts or despite such hindrances is it justified to endeavor in formal agreements agents are more likely to agree on pumping limits when the aggregate benefits exceed transaction and implementation costs ayres et al 2018 this is a short list of elements to take into consideration when it comes to agreeing on verbal or written contracts among water users and central governmental agencies actually the problems associated to devising and implementing social contracts should not deter governments from finding more institutional options to manage valuable water resources for all kinds of users with different types of contractual water allocations 2 document analysis and literature on transaction costs and theory of incentives transaction cost theory is relevant for groundwater management due to the existence of coordination tradeoffs which crop up between the endeavor to collectively reach productive outcomes and the costs of reaching them interactions and cooperation in conserving a cpr can be rather complex especially when a set of individuals repeatedly use the same common resource in different locations over long periods of time all transactions are concluded with some form of contract which according to contract theory is established when the parties involved consider they have reached an agreement that benefits all of them ostmann and meinhardt 2008 groenewegen et al 2010 nevertheless the types of social contracts should bear in mind the effects of climate change on water resources therefore multiple sources of uncertainties on available water and flows stocks appear and the stakeholders involved in the social contracts should add flexibility to water extraction activities this is no matter if a farmer is awarded a certain water flow he she should be willing to reduce extraction volumes if a severe drought is forecasted certainly the delegation to exert extractions should be adaptable to the pressures of climate change effects on water resources thus new and innovative incentives should be devised to make contracts as useful instruments for sustainability under the shared responsibility of users and governments in charge of water use control to the best of the author s knowledge formal groundwater extraction contracts are not common in the literature in this context the formal petition of extraction permits and respective entitlement is taken as a formal contract between governments and water users see tables 1 1 thus we may understand groundwater extraction permits as social contracts once an extraction permit is entitled there seem to be explicit clauses for sustainable groundwater management this assumed social contract contains overarching rules sanctions in case of rule breaking criteria for contract amendments and other elements shaping the permission which are described in the lines that follow 2 1 transaction cost economics challenges in practice reaching stable cooperation levels in sustainably managing groundwater extractions entails the need to coordinate water users towards this purpose attaining groundwater management cooperation requires water users to renounce the lure to purely pursue self interest in order to contribute to collective interest in their commonly managed aquifers the essential problem of cooperation in managing a cpr has to do with reducing the joint cost of extraction and increasing the joint benefit of cooperation v o e ostrom 1977 social scientists used to think there was a natural tendency for people with shared interests to act together in pursuit of those interests oliver 1993 notwithstanding such natural tendency might not be straightforward so people would not automatically agree on cooperating to conserve or maintain their cpr paraphrasing coase 1960 a sustainable cpr management rearrangement depends on balancing its own costs with the productive value increase that it likely entails what does a coordination for cpr extraction sustainable management mean based on the socio physical contexts of groundwater overexploitation it implies moving from an uncoordinated independent and selfish water units appropriation to a system of new social rules and institutions aimed at reaching stable productive outcomes tables 1 1 lists a series of sound rules and institutions that might work for sustainable groundwater extraction management accordingly there exist institutional dimensions towards sustainable aquifer management worth to note complying with the mandatory groundwater extraction permit fulfilling the legal obligation to request an extraction permit firstly implies confirming that every single prospective water user is acquainted with this norm having done this an individual may confront their personal principles to the costs and benefits of compliance income level socioeconomic background social status and many other variables may play a role in the decision to abide by the external norm people might even deliberate with neighbors to exchange perceptions about it restricting the number of wells on own lands wells placed over urban or rural areas are private goods that belong to landowners or lessors this fact differentiates aquifers from open access resources such as forests or fishing areas the surface plots where the wells are built are excludable and the private character of wells impede other neighbors to collect water from them limiting pumping extraction timing to be consistent with declined precipitations caused by climate change limiting pumping extraction rates to be consistent with reduced aquifer stocks availability caused by reduced precipitations caused by climate change however agents are more likely to agree on pumping limits where aggregate benefits exceed transaction and implementation costs ayres et al 2018 devising mechanisms to resolve conflicts in case of water shortages occur defining monitoring and enforcing rules the question is how can this simple and short list of rules and institutions be implemented there is no single or clear cut answer to the necessary design to make these rules work who could lead the design of these new rules to adapt to the pressures of climate change effects on water resources what type of information would be needed to determine the most adequate timing and extraction rates under climate change scenarios how to ensure that every single user complies with their own rules and institutions what type of mechanisms might work better to discourage non cooperation and implement credible and applicable sanctions how to restart or upsurge cooperation in cases of free riding proliferation how to regain trust and cooperation while moving towards a profitable decision in case of deviation from agreed extraction paths in periods of severe scarcity who should be put in charge and how should sustainable extraction paths be recalculated and updated what instruments might be used to provide water extraction feedback and who could oversee their administration questions such as these picture a real norm design implementation and monitoring situation in fact issuing new rules and implementing and maintaining institutional work takes time and demands role assignation and individual and collective efforts and expenses in short it entails the need to decipher the complex challenge of keeping individuals as steady cooperators 2 2 theory of incentives in practice the theory of incentives addresses the alignment of the different members of an organization with its central objectives laffont and martimort 2009 in the agriculture sector the landowner hires some workers to perform sowing maintenance and other activities inside a company the managers hire employees to perform operative and managerial activities police departments recruit men and women and train police officers to enforce the law on the streets government ministers hire public employees to delegate on them the obligation to serve the citizens in each of these cases there is an assignment from organizational leaders for a number of reasons the head of the organization must delegate various tasks to its members which naturally raises information flow management complications laffont and martimort 2009 the landowner expects his laborers to plant as many seeds as possible and to harvest high amount of k g h a even though in some cases the payment is based on performance he expects them to harvest as much as they can following quality assuring procedures the police commander wants his troops to be physically and mentally able to manage crime situations without exerting excessive force or abusing from authority at the end of the day he would not like to attend disclosing and fierce media interviews the minister expects his employees not to step out frequently to have coffee or keep distracted in their smartphones while the office phone is ringing or citizens wait in line he expects them to remain seated and produce during a minimum number of h r d a y in all of these organizations there is a principal who delegates assignments and an agent who executes them and is expected to keep the information they have received in order to adequately perform the tasks as soon as the principal delegates a task they expect it to be executed by their agents and wonder how will they behave while i am not shadowing on them conflicting objectives and decentralized information are the two basic ingredients of the incentives theory laffont and martimort 2009 similarly groundwater management is a principal multi agent relation in the former cases there is a direct subordination relation you do the task i request and i pay you for this in groundwater extraction management the task is quite different at least in most oecd countries groundwater is a state property it means that the principal represents the owner of the resource and the agents must request a permission to usufruct it however there is legal subordination since the principal dictates water extraction level norms in the case of industry the principal pays the agents because he she perceives the resulting productivity in the groundwater management case agents pay the principal because they perceive the marginal benefit of extraction groundwater resources can be separated into five rights 1 access 2 withdrawal 3 management 4 exclusion and 5 transferability donohew 2005 these listed rights are connected to groundwater management stages the principal agent model being at stake in each stage the information condensed in table 1 is quite idealistic for different reasons firstly cprs have many users and this raises many issues given that cprs are affected by non excludability if an agent cannot be barred from benefiting from the contribution of other agents who do respect the delegation the former is motivated not to contribute but to free ride on the contribution of others cárdenas 2009 fleishman 1988 ostrom 2015a secondly in the groundwater management setting the interests of different stakeholders principal agents other actors may differ edelenbos et al 2013 this is the case of free riders who are certainly not aligned with formal institutional objectives besides modest free riders in colombia there exist powerful companies from mining and agricultural sectors with the capacity to be entitled to extract abundant water resources while neighboring low income communities remain unattended in fulfilling human right to water access thirdly the principal s capability to monitor delegation tends to be limited indeed officials face constraints to cope with the complex and scattered phenomenon of deep well drillings sandoval 2004 as a result in practice the principal says i delegate onto you but i cannot monitor you so i trust you follow my rule given anomalies in power relations in water access pervasive free riding and unstable cooperation this might be understood as an incomplete delegation among a pervasive and dispersed extraction activity however if this type of incompleteness is found in formal relationships informal markets in water extractions content a sort of hidden institutions governing water access in colombia 64 000 groundwater sources are registered and for only 30 000 ideam 2019 of them some hydrogeological information is gathered by environmental authorities this is for the unlicensed 52 of aquifer users no information is available this incomplete knowledge on water extraction is widespread across the country in the northeast extreme of the country in la guajira out of 2631 wells there is only information for 15 of them for the remaining 2210 wells real figures on extractions are unknown in sucre in the north of the country the authority reports having knowledge of almost 100 of 1713 groundwater users however according to the national agricultural census every year almost 9700 farms dane 2015 mostly collect groundwater for crops irrigation and cattle raising activities in the south of the country in macarena region the authority reports having reports on 20 of groundwater users this is a special case since army conflict may have exacerbated the limitations in getting water users monitored in the central part of colombia in boyacá there is information for only 30 of users and in the sabana of bogotá authorities officially report ignoring information on 28 of its users ideam 2019 but illegal or informal groundwater users represent 60 of total users in this region car 2015 in central western part in tolima where the biggest rice producer companies exist there is full ignorance on the groundwater extraction behavior since out of 3830 wells reported there is 0 knowledge on water extractions a similar situation is registered in magdalena in the northern part of the country in the group of municipalities close to medellin in the northwest of colombia in the eastern part in santander and in the southwestern part in valle del cauca to mention just a few in all these cases water users are managing significant water volumes without any recorded figures and the delegation to extract authorized water units w i t is impossible or inexistent in informal water markets how may water wells be built under complete ignorance of authorities how formal water wells construction markets co exist with illegal informal water extraction markets if hidden markets of water wells building co occur with formal rules of extraction permits so hidden institutions may be present as well accessing water without authorities notice is not simply about hiding soil perforation equipment before building wells in private plots but hiding the reasons why approaching cpr without revealing any rule consistent with the need to conserve water hidden institutions in informal or illegal water access refer to collecting water under an unlimited stock believe and without reporting extraction levels governing groundwater sustainably must eliminate this knowledge gap if ignorance on informal and formal water volumes extracted continue sustainable management of aquifers would not only be incomplete but an illusion different questions may turn up over the alleged incompleteness in formal water markets how to handle this unavoidable delegation of the extraction activity by the environmental authority principal on water users agents under what conditions may groundwater sustainability come up amidst this incomplete principal to agent delegation in this case the category unavoidable conveys the notion that if delegation were not possible the government agency would have to collect the water from centralized boreholes and distribute it to farmers households and companies alternatively the principal could also visit every single plot and turn on or operate the water pumps according to the permission conditions this complex time consuming and cost ineffective groundwater extraction management alternative just does not make sense under certain circumstances it may be possible for a principal to induce agents to behave exactly as he she would do in sharing the agents skills and knowledge sappington 1991 in this principal agent model the environmental authority simply wishes every agent requests the permit keep up to its conditions and do not extract beyond sustainable levels delegation being sensibly unavoidable it certainly constitutes a challenging responsibility for the principal through each permission granted there exist intertemporal implications for sustainable aquifer management if wastefully water use is admitted and replenishment conditions are not met each water unit w i t i 1 2 n i n d i v i d u a l s t 0 1 t t i m e p e r i o d s granted today will simply not exist in the future when the principal delegates he she should have access to truthful information because each water unit counts while performing the groundwater management function the principal receives many claims for water extraction he she might decide whether w 11 w 21 or w 11 w 21 i e they must decide whether to allocate more water units to one agent in time 1 or more to another agent in time 2 at the end of the day the principal should know the sum of water units granted for extraction i 1 n t 1 t w i t the relevance of this information is not trivial the total extraction volume is useful to determine to what extent the aquifer stock is being portioned for the periods of permission ignoring the relevance of the size of w i t and i 1 n t 1 t w i t may jeopardize the opportunities to sustainably manage the aquifer stocks and flows under climate change conditions consequently every w i t granted to the agents might be understood as a rule oriented delegation commanding them to extract a water volume less or equal to the entitled one w i t during the determined time limit notwithstanding due to the presence of free riders and spendthrift agents one may observe some divergence from the delegation and hence from the principal s objective that is the principal says i want the agent to follow my rule but they just pass it over the objective states that the agents should extract limited amounts of water units because the resource is not unlimited and future generations deserve using it hence w i t is much more than a number it represents a flow of data processed through hydrogeological formulas leading to a feasible water volume extraction w i t embodies a great deal of aquifer status information taking into account aquifer recharge levels precipitation evapotranspiration and other variables governed by nature based on this argumentation principals should devise new or improved incentives to trigger convergence toward their objectives in this claim it is suggested that better meaningful and relevant information may play a role as an incentive aimed at triggering intrinsic motivations one may wonder what type of information it is as well as its format channel frequency and mechanism of dissemination these issues caution that information provision is not a straightforward task departing from typical status quo information delivered to water users it can be observed that water managers and environmental authorities usually release information on prices extraction charges and allowed extraction amounts these price and non price approaches may fall short in generating sufficient incentives aimed at curbing water extraction or keeping entitled water volume indeed pervasive overexploitation around the world seems to support this conjecture incentives to trigger cooperative building motivations should be reasoned in the context of free riding and the conventional competition for cpr units said this incentives need to be contextualized in situations of collective damage or collective productive outcomes competition free riding and the delegation to extract w i t units involve worth to note basic dimensions a time for extraction and likely eventual depletion b the need to adapt to scarcity and climate change c multiplicity of agents d sustainable yield and stocks under climate change scenarios e rules delivered to prevent over exploitation one of the challenges of this rule s delivery from the principals refer to embedding incentives in the existing social institutional setting wherein free riders and cooperators interact inside communities and intricate hidden institutions in water allocations exist in this case cooperative behavior implies keeping up to the entitled w i t units however free riders neither request permits nor attach to any pre determined w i t unit amount for this reason the rule itself which is not the only resource at hand might not be an incentive at all so there is room for improvement in incentives design 2 3 incentives rules from inside and outside laffont and martimort 2009 have discussed the need to design institutions aimed at incentivizing economic agents to accomplish the principal s objectives complementarily it is suggested in the current work that incentives operate bidirectionally as shown in fig 1 groundwater management systems require the design of incentives to spark productive social institutions and rules in dealing with water extraction similarly formal and informal institutions are necessary to activate positive incentives let us assume that at certain point in time there are n agents distributed among farmers households and businesses for each type of agent a segment of them is following the formal rules stated by the principal asking for a water extraction permit paying charges reporting consumption limiting extraction to agreed w i t units see table 2 while another group just lives in anarchy later on some movements occur between both groups so those who cooperate and follow the rules decide to break their cooperative behavior and shirk extant institutions while free riders regret and begin to follow the rules back and forth swaps do not come from nowhere belonging to one group and swapping to the other might be permeated by a collection of motivations the level of knowledge on the current water availability and the expectations on the occurrence of severe droughts in the upcoming days put farmers to reveal to which group they belong to individualistic and collectivistic intrinsic motivations are revealed during harsh drought conditions some farmers are more prone to risk aversion inequity aversion and reciprocity when dealing with water shortages in magdalena and sucre meanwhile in la guajira where the driest conditions occur some farmers are more inclined to argue that they definitely cannot lose crops due to lack of irrigation so they will proceed to irrigate crops no matter what the rule is see tables 2 and 3 table 4 the environmental authority is expected to activate smart rules from outside and be able to merge external with internal rules bearing in mind the intrinsic factors that motivate farmers to conserve water through extraction limits compliance in addition since some communities have successfully reached productive outcomes in managing their commons and overcome the free riding temptation ostrom 2015b schlager 2002 bold entrepreneurs are needed to re start social institutions that work for the people this entrepreneurship is suggested to firstly understand the social institutions in time and place and especially the evolution of institutions under the presence of external changes issues such as the looming threats of climate effects on water availability cannot expect that institutions keep inert therefore the expected cooperation to conserve water in periods of droughts is complex since institutions evolve and similarly the incentives to conserve the left side of fig 1 depicts the corresponding structure of incentives which are understood as steering mechanisms aimed at moving agents behavior towards the desired direction of cooperation these mechanisms are deemed as internal when they come from agents determination or external if they come from authorities who in paper seek for sustainable water management it is suggested here that between rules the devising of institutions and the structure of incentives there is not such a leap instead new or improved rules add subtract or transform the existing institutions prior to activating positive or desired incentives that is rules are initially digested before turning into a desired incentive examples of rules are as follows see tables 2 2 rules from outside are usually implemented through price and non price approaches one of the most relevant incentives provided by standard economics refers to the influence of prices on demand the law of demand declares an inverse relationship between prices and quantities if prices of a certain good rise the demanded good amount decreases notwithstanding prices as driving mechanisms to reduce the demand for a good in this case to reduce water extraction rely on key issues such as price elasticity of the demand in the short and long term also average price elasticity at the household level has been found to be around 0 51 olmstead and stavins 2009 which represents an inelastic water demand this inelasticity leads water agencies and environmental authorities to implement non price approaches as extrinsic incentives to curb water demand tables 2 and 3 presents a short list of extrinsic motivations deemed as upcoming from water authorities in turn some intrinsic motivations that may arise from water users acting as agents before the principal s regulations are included the referred intrinsic motivations work in favor and against cooperation towards the sustainability of groundwater rules inequity aversion cox 2004 fehr and schmidt 1999 velez et al 2009 reciprocity axelrod 1984 axelrod r william 1981 hamilton 1964 and trust cox 2004 may benefit cooperative behavior as a means of keeping actual cooperation and motivate others by setting the norm contrarily some internal motivations such as pursuing individual objectives in agricultural or industrial activities do not favor cooperation and even might spark retreat from it in other intrinsic motivations there is more room for improvement when searching cooperation the literature on crowding out and the provision of extrinsic incentives concludes that the latter do not last for long cardenas et al 2000 warn that discreetly imposed local environmental policies may not be effective while meier 2007 informs that people decrease their contributions after the motivational mechanism has been removed furthermore compensations have been insinuated to hinder the performance of individuals gneezy and rustichini 2000 it is suggested here that a discussion on whether incentives provoke crowding out or not falls short when referring to sustainable management of water resources sustainability requires further discussion on effective incentives to generate stable extraction declination not just expressing whether crowding out or crowding in occurs as described in tables 2 and 3 intrinsic motivations may abound and go beyond price approaches menaces and sticks from the principal in relation to promoting sustainable groundwater management incentives should be carefully designed in order to avoid eroding personal and collective engagement with water conservation extrinsic incentives may in some way crowd out intrinsic motivations that are important to produce the desired behavior gneezy et al 2011 for example in some contexts such as performance at workplace health services education completion or employment search some incentives might be provided to encourage productivity increase at work getting rid of detrimental habits for health increasing school attendance or improving people s ability towards employability if the structure of incentives does not achieve switching behaviors or the latter do not persist through time some alternatives may arise for instance employees might be sacked or transferred to other positions patients may opt for taking more medication and students might move to other schools or alternative education methods in the standard incentive effect the motivation to perform a task without an additional motivation can be permanently reduced gneezy et al 2011 for which purpose some alternatives might be found by the agent notwithstanding sustainability issues related to water conservation green house gas emission reductions ecosystem protection endangered species preservation and other top essential for life issues would require a carefully designed structure of incentives the latter must ensure that positive behaviors in favor of natural resource conservation do not vanish in the long term given the vital character of water in the principal agent relationships the former should bear in mind that before promoting their objective it is necessary to understand what stimulates people see fig 2 monetary rewards gneezy and rustichini 2000 sanctions or compensations do not necessarily lead to curbing water extraction more specifically money and prices may encourage or discourage desired behaviors titmus 1970 provided an outstanding theoretical input from economics to the discussion on monetary rewards and contributions to desired behavior this author asserted that offering money to individuals in exchange for blood donations may undermine their intrinsic motivations to follow voluntary donation social norms urban water management literature suggests the short term impact of water saving programs around the world water conservation achievements tend to be transitory to the point that sometimes gains revert to prior to intervention levels fielding et al 2013 lindenberg and steg 2007 in a cpr setting an environmental policy can be more detrimental than beneficial especially when allowing individuals to collectively meet local environmental dilemmas without interference cardenas et al 2000 the authors argue that the main reason for observed weak performance of an external intervention by environmental authorities is that the control measures crowded out group regarding behavior in favor of stronger selfish behavior consequently external control monetary rewards and pricing approaches seem not to incorporate enough drivers to curb cpr extraction in order to provide any type of incentive for achieving plausible objectives or extraction goals say limited to w i t it is necessary to achieve a better understanding of the real intrinsic motivation and extrinsic incentives that underlie an agent s conformity with an extraction rule as depicted in fig 2 before devising incentives and jumping to expected extraction goals it may be necessary to get acquainted with the mentioned motivations it is suggested here that the fulfilment of extraction goals should be evaluated as a means of providing updated feedback on people s motivation the devising of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives should ponder that for example at time t 1 n individuals living over or in the surroundings of a cpr ground are accustomed to certain water extraction patterns suppose that the authority visits the productive plots in order to update their figures about regulation compliance farmers collect groundwater to irrigate their crops according to plant growth periods businesses extract groundwater units to perform their productive activities and households do the same to fulfil water consumption requirements the authority finds that some agents display the granted permits while many others do not later at time t 5 some new agents have requested permits while others have ignored this obligation or are simply not motivated to do it those who requested the permits may be extracting larger or lesser amounts than w i t w i 0 w i t 1 t w i t 0 w i 0 is the extracted amount when the agent commences their extraction activity similarly at time t 5 the authority finds that in not priorly visited locations new collective efforts to self manage aquifers have arisen inside the communities see examples in tables 2 2 in the latter case caution might be required prior to any rule delivery if applicable because external control may crowd out group regarding behavior in favor of a stronger selfish behavior cardenas et al 2000 the case of autonomous devising of aquifer management rules deserves special attention since it shows how a promising self management endeavor could be fused with external regulations contrarily perhaps the autonomous endeavor should be left untouched by external agents in order not to destabilize or damage the devising of productive social institutions however the socio physical setting on which the present research has focused corresponds to non registered groundwater resource management institutional arrangements in summary the principal agent model analyzes goal alignment between delegation on the part of the principal and implementation by the agents as mentioned before divergences may occur between both parties as a complement to these deviations asymmetries may arise in the type of information that each party is able to handle and afford 2 4 asymmetric information on water stocks and flows groundwater management sustainability is a matter of stocks flows and water quality the evidence of aquifer overexploitation reflects groundwater availability declination the sustainable use of both renewable and nonrenewable aquifers entails the need to maintain significant water amounts for current and future generations groundwater availability is governed by variables such as recharge rates extraction rates by different users discharges to surface water precipitation levels and other more complex hydrogeological variables physical or environmental variables such as precipitation water table static and dynamic levels and recharge and discharge rates influence socio economic variables such as extraction rates extraction costs and well productivity in some cases the relation is inverted and social variables end up influencing bio physical ones this is the case when for example extraction rates affect the water table and consequently the depression cones hydrogeological laws describe the generation of a depression cone when a well is under operation when several wells are close to each other their depression cones may overlap glennon 2002 kalf and woolley 2005 in case that some water users continuously extract much more water than others wider depression cones may be formed and overlap with neighbor ones cone overlapping may influence the productivity of surrounding wells likewise extraction rates alter the static and dynamic levels of aquifer stocks for another thing social variables such as extraction rates alter other social variables as well social variables such as volumes of extraction extraction timing number of wells well density on the surface depends on human decisions more suggestively social variables depend on interrelated human decisions among water users for instance the higher the extraction rate by single users the higher the cost of extraction for all water users in the vicinity of a well the higher and more constant the extraction rate the higher the probability to perceive the social effects of wider cones of depression in the underground as mentioned above depression cones overlapping alters the productivity of the wells involved thus negatively affecting their users given the difficulty to foresee socio physical interactions getting acquainted with them requires the capability to monitor different social and physical parameter data cpr users use to know their location respect to the resource system more specifically anderies et al 2013 presents evidence on contexts where participants share asymmetric positions respect to irrigation systems given that players located close to the head or to the end of the irrigation canals obtain asymmetric right to use to the water each player has incentives to cooperate and reach favorable outcomes in contexts of provision and appropriation decisions under asymmetric or sequential appropriation the opportunity to communicate influences cooperation and coordination cardenas et al 2011 ostrom e gardner 1994 in these contexts there exists asymmetrical information on the locations benefits perceived and quality of information on the resource stock conditions in the aquifer systems farmers use to know how far they and neighbors are from water tables besides farmers have a slight idea of water flows in their vicinities nevertheless knowledge on water stocks is lacking water stocks and flows are not always perceived in time since this demands technology and financial resources that allow gathering an updated data repository of water table stock level and recharge and discharge data it is ordinarily assumed that physical variables are best monitored and collected by environmental authorities since this type of information requires sophisticated equipment and is costly and difficult to collect unless for academic purposes one can hardly picture individuals and farmers approaching to environmental authority offices to inquire about hydrogeological variables this is not to say that farmers are not interested in relevant environmental variables since the necessary processing capacity and technical knowledge tends to keep them away from this pursuit it is observed here that sophisticated information about physical variables is mostly managed by environmental authorities instead of the public who are not familiar or not interested in it in turn individuals households and communities are more likely to be acquainted with certain social and economic variables they are probably more familiar with the relevant information they need to access water farmers have more knowledge about borehole building costs how long it takes to fill a thousand liter tank or what equipment was used to extract water there are probably few people from urban and rural neighborhoods with precise knowledge about the storativity and transmissivity coefficients recharge rates or depression cone shape of the aquifers they benefit from furthermore they may not need to know this technical information indeed difficult to process farmers tend to take into consideration those hydrogeological variables they personally need for example they are more interested in how deep the water table is and how deep they must punch to get a bore hole built environmental authorities have information on the extensive margin that is how many wells have been legally built and where they may be located in case a groundwater user formally legally requests a permit this is the opportunity for the environmental authority to collect this type of information however some of these entities in colombia acknowledge that illegal or informal groundwater users represent 60 of total users in certain regions for their part individuals and households might rather have information on the intensive margin for example they may know their truthful extraction volume if they have a consumption measuring device which is not the rule but the exception in the research area a key concern for the sustainability of aquifers is that neither environmental authorities nor farmers are acquainted on the approximate water volumes being aggregately extracted authorities partially dominate the data on the physical variables and water users have some knowledge on social variables however the knowledge on the key socio physical variable concerning the time series of extraction rates is missing for both in general it can be said that socio physical data about groundwater status flows in asymmetric information settings reaching symmetric information scenarios in groundwater management may result difficult to pursue environmental and water authorities have their own roles limitations constraints and restricted monitoring capacity individuals households and communities spend time pursuing personal economic and social needs that is people are busy working doing domestic or productive activities and not always have time to get acquainted with physical and hydrogeological variables especially when people face water scarcity they are busy collecting and storing some cubic meters of water in carrying out personal and productive activities people may face limitations regarding time budget and even interest in environmental issues notwithstanding asymmetries in groundwater socio physical information may have implications for the extraction and sustainability of this resource information asymmetries are not problematic per se because each actor is playing their role in a limited framework difficulties arise from widened information gaps between different actors in groundwater socio ecological systems reducing socio physical information asymmetries between principal and agents should be a top priority in climate change adaptation based on data for decision making 3 discussion curbing water extraction demands understanding the type of motivations that incentivize adhesion to sustainability purposes since water conservation might be considered a socially desirable norm and a public interest issue incentives directed to water users may either crowd them in or out from the expected results indeed on behalf of sustainability interests smart and alternative incentivizing approaches are required the structure of incentives should consider that a set of rules from outside and from inside operate locally these cannot be taken for granted when designing the intrinsic and extrinsic models to motivate farmers to treat aquifers as depletable resource worth to be conserved this research has studied intrinsic and extrinsic forms of motivation but results do not necessarily lead to desired behaviors in ensuring that farmers in colombia abide by the rule of requesting extraction permits the formal environmental rules in colombia still take rule compliance for granted without providing additional incentives further than releasing information on the legal procedures extrinsic dis incentives such as sanctioning rule breakers has not been reported in the field in colombia if this would happened this would signal farmers and all users about the urgency and relevance of water conservation extrinsic motivations such as monetary rewards gneezy and rustichini 2000 restricting the pump power connection or regulating power supply to wells meinzen dick et al 2016 discreetly imposed local environmental policies cardenas et al 2000 monetary sanctions imposed restrictions or threating exclusion from cpr benefits all have proven to be insufficient to incorporate the abundant intrinsic motivations that drive cpr users it is suggested here that it is time not only for users to be more active but for administrators to treat them as center pieces in devising stable and robust incentives aimed at encouraging cooperation in water conservation in connection with incentivizing desired behaviors some social programs in developing countries promote the accomplishment of nutrition health education and labor indicators by motivating individuals through monetary rewards these strategies have proven effective in accumulating human capital to address the needs involved in people s lifecycle however fund availability for monetary and non monetary incentives is not the main issue at stake regarding contract delegation in groundwater extraction the real issue that should be collectively deliberated has to do with the interaction between the design of contract clauses and the nature of the cpr in question nature and more precisely aquifer systems have limits but these are usually recognized after granting extraction permits authentic sustainable management of aquifer systems should incorporate aquifer limits or extraction caps as an ex ante condition to decide on the amount of water w i t granted through an extraction permit formal regulation and extraction permit practices by environmental authorities in colombia timidly mention the risk of groundwater depletion and extracted water declination as an alleged criterion for contract amendment or denial of new extraction permits the generation of new regulatory systems for aquifer management should be overtly bounded by specific aquifer characterization and interactions between hydrogeological factors the latter may perform as pre conditions for setting the most responsible extraction rates e g either caps or target extraction rates as delimited by sustainable extraction paths as suggested by some environmental authority officials in la guajira and sucre water claimants often complain when informed about lower extraction flow entitlement this issue sets the scene to discuss the political and social opposition to delimited water flows pressure on water authorities often comes from watershed stakeholders who are interested in unlimited development donohew 2005 to the point of exerting power to guide water management institutional arrangements cardenas et al 2011 furthermore free riding is still an obstacle for groundwater extraction permits and formal agreements the transition from free riding to stable cooperative attitudes takes long water and environmental authorities and all involved governmental agencies should search for alternative institutional environments aimed at improved delegation on water users as part of the pre requisites for aquifer sustainable management under any climate change scenario all stakeholders of water management should start to implement pilot test aimed at rearranging the conditions to design credible social contracts adapted to local conditions physical conditions on the status and characteristics of the aquifer systems should become as common knowledge ostrom 2015b e ostrom 2002 in multiple and simple formats information provision landon et al 2018 sell and wilson 1991 may progressively activate the intrinsic motivations on water users to design social institutions consistent with the looming threats of climate change effects on water resources recent evidence has suggested the relevance of extraction quotas pfaff a vélez m ramos p molina 2015 in using a cpr and the information about remaining water stocks and remaining time for aquifer depletion as a means of signaling scarcity and to promote cooperation asprilla echeverría 2022 nonetheless the information provision to activate cooperation and signaling water scarcity is part of the equation aimed at building the foundations of social institutions adaptive to climate conditions information is only an instrument since more elements configure the drivers of cooperation the drivers for cooperation which might be classified in four drivers such as i instruments to stimulate cooperation ii conditions to reach stable cooperation iii assumptions in support of cooperation and iv strategies as building blocks aimed at structuring cooperation asprilla echeverría 2021 notwithstanding these drivers cannot be put to work without stakeholders engagement in a participatory process a structured participatory re design of institutions should systematically activate these drivers the method of the participatory process to stimulate cooperation cannot be unique and would depend on the contexts knowledge of inputs and resources under consideration stakeholders engagement pathway development and impact are deemed as part of the participatory conditions to promote cooperation for climate adaptation van der voorn et al 2017 more interestingly the adaptive capacity smit and wandel 2006 and resilience holling 1973 for climate change adaptation to manage aquifer systems can be part of the strategy development stage in catchment management strategy cms suggested by van der voorn et al 2012 the cms steps consists of inception of engagement reports continues with the assessment stage in which water resources and environment are assessed the following step is about the vision for the catchment area and finishes with the strategy development and its approval van der voorn et al 2012 applying this cms to aquifer systems demand the need to understand the system as cpr in which lots of incentives and disincentives for cooperation exists 4 conclusion this article is aimed at comprehending the extant contractual delegation of groundwater extraction to water users in colombia to find out innovative incentives to manage aquifers under climate change this understanding is a relevant first step before undertaking the improvement of institutional arrangements to pursue aquifer management adaptive to climate change effects particular attention is paid to drought areas of colombia relying on aquifers for domestic and agricultural activities the current top down hierarchical regulatory scheme seems to fall short in accomplishing the control of pervasive groundwater extraction it is certainly concerning to see that while water continues to be extracted and water tables steadily decline the current institutional setting seems to be lumbering and is seemingly unable to overcome the challenges of sustainability and climate change effects on water resources in the field of aquifer central management the authority acts as the principal and as such they are entitled to granting extraction permits in turn water users act as agents on whom water extraction is legally delegated this principal agent relationship holds an implicit contract aimed at taking care of aquifer resources delegation implies following some instructions and constraints in order to avoid groundwater depletion the problem is that while depletion is occurring the delegation structure has not changed since delegation is practically unavoidable we may question why the principal agent relationship is divergent from the principal s alleged purpose is it that agents are unaware of this outstanding delegation or the expectations of the parties actually diverge while sustainability is only at top governmental level discussions one of the challenges of this rule s delivery from the principals refers to embedding incentives in the existing social institutional setting wherein free riders and cooperators interact inside communities and intricate hidden institutions in water allocations exists in the areas exposed to droughts in colombia one might focus on water users understanding and practice of sustainability but given steady water table declination an acid test may cast some doubts on that approach however this is not to be blamed on water users since they are the reason for water regulatory systems a better understanding of their rationale is urgent should we always end up unsatisfied in understanding how a group of people witness the depletion of their cpr while maintaining current inertia in implemented rules and institutions how to deal with the task of delegating limited water extraction on agents if asking the principal to carry out extraction themselves tends to be unfeasible this alleged delegation is complex since users rarely apply for an extraction permit free riding on water access is pervasive and both extensive and intensive information on aquifer status is asymmetric water users tend to gather intensive data such as extracted water volumes extraction costs and neighbors conservation drivers for their part authorities know more about water tables recharge levels and numbers of users as they change in time and space information asymmetry is not a problem in itself troubles arise as a consequence of widening gaps in the information managed by different actors involved in groundwater socio ecological systems if true sustainability of water resources is on top of the priority list of authorities the social contract and a re engineered delegation should be innovatively enforced innovations may crop up from positive and careful activation of intrinsic motivations smart and innovative incentives may trigger convergence toward principal s water conservation objectives for this aim the design of social institutions able to activate extrinsic incentives and intrinsic motivations should not take extant institutions for granted thus in the structure of incentives design the drivers of cooperation see asprilla echeverría 2021 should be properly differentiated since some incentives might work in dealing with instruments to activate cooperation but fall short or inadequate to promote the needed conditions for the stability of cooperation since information provision is taken as part of the instruments to activate cooperation the corresponding structure of incentives should properly signal water scarcity situations because farmers prefer to avoid the woes of living without sufficient water among the conditions to support stable cooperation reciprocity and fairness preference are included however the incentives design to build positive reciprocity in conserving water takes time and it corresponds to the needed social institutions to guarantee cooperation as part of the assumptions supporting cooperation we can mention the expected low transaction costs of reaching the agreements to conserve water in this case the structure of incentives to ensure that the costs and complexity of working together are lower respect to the benefits of cooperation is challenged by the presence of free riders who may disincentive cooperators to keep as stable cooperators the overarching limitations of this research lie in the difficulty to further understand the design of incentives to put more drivers of cooperation to work this research was limited to understand the role of information provision as part of the instruments to stimulate cooperation nevertheless the drivers pertaining to social capital arenas such as reciprocity trust inequity aversion transaction costs and others were far from the scope of this research but would result as good complements to further comprehend what motivates farmers to build these social capital aspects this research had multiple limitations holding interviews with directive of environmental authorities was intended to broaden the perspectives on incentives and disincentives construction at local level but only the sub directors and engineers responded the calls the field work was developed only in three municipalities exposed to frequent droughts key comparisons with area exposed to less frequent droughts would result of interest to understand the structure of incentives level of information on aquifer conditions and the social institutions built locally under less pressures and stress of reduced water availability a continued research agenda is suggested in order to test the effects of incentives design for each type of drivers for cooperation aquifer systems provide water for half global population and for 38 of irrigated agricultural land barlow and leake 2012 oecd 2017b therefore more efforts should be exerted to understand how farmers using groundwater intensively but facing water scarcity are able to trust on others ability to reduce water extractions this is especially applicable to sustainable development goal 6 pursuing water use efficiency this efficiency demands water consumption declinations and users cooperation to conserve water as a cpr which is not straightforward thus depending on the stage of groundwater sustainable management drivers and incentives might be put to work productively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
