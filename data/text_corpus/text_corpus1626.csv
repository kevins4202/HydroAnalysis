water used in razavi khorasan province 5 318 mcm comes from groundwater that is extracted predominantly from alluvial aquifers by 23 727 wells with an average depth of 76 m and an average flow rate of

the measured ions and elements were gridded using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method hutchinson 1989 in arcgis in order to display their spatial distributions relationships among

modeling predictor variables relating to potential anthropogenic and geogenic contamination sources were identified based on hydrogeochemical analyses as well as previous studies shojaat et al 2003 esmaeili vardanjani et al 2015 nematollahi et al 2016 taheri et al 2016 zirjanizadeh et al 2016a alighardashi and mehrani 2017 qasemi et al 2018 vesali naseh et al 2018 hamidian et al 2019 zendehbad et al 2019 irrigated areas urban areas industrial areas ophiolites and mafic rocks intermediate to silicic volcanic granitoid rocks carbonate rocks marl evaporite loess mineral deposits metal ores were considered as predictor variables the attributes of independent variables are shown in table 1 and the location maps are presented in the supplementary materials the main lithologies and metal ore locations provided in supplementary fig 1 are obtained from geological maps of razavi khorasan province published at 1 250 000 scale korehie et al 2016 the locations of irrigated urban and industrial areas were extracted from land use reports provided by razavi khorasan management and planning organization 2019 all of the independent variables were available in raster format with province wide coverage new rasters were created with buffer zones at distances of 2 5 5 7 5 and 10 km around the features of interest each buffer distance was assigned a rank value from 1 to 5 according to table 2 2 3 2 random forest rf modeling rf is an ensemble machine learning technique utilizing decision trees and can be used for classification or regression breiman 2001 and biau and scornet 2016 in regression problems a continuous response variable is predicted by growing and then averaging many decision trees which vary by utilizing different randomly selected data rows with replacement in each tree and different predictor variables at each branch tahmasebi et al 2020 regression rf modelling was implemented using the microsoft excel add in xlstat addinsoft 2020 the main parameters of the rf model that must be specified are the number of variables randomly selected at each node mtry and the number of trees ntree the mtry value was set to p 3 in which p is the number of independent variables and ntree was set to 1000 the relative importance of the predictor variables in each model was assessed through the rf measure of importance which gives the average model error when the independent variable values are randomly sorted the predictive ability of the rf models was evaluated by three criteria coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse legates and mccabe 1999 which are defined as follows 1 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o max o min 2 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is an observed value omin omax and o are the minimum maximum and average of the observed values respectively and pi is the model predicted value and n is the number of observed data if a model produces values that are the same as the observations nrmse and nse values are 0 and 1 respectively nrmse shows the square of the differences between the predicted and the observed values in relation to the variability in the observed data these three criteria together give insight into how well the models predict the observed data 2 4 non carcinogenic health risk assessment the health risk posed by exposure to the metal loid s as cr cu fe pb se v and zn in groundwater was quantified using the hazard quotient hq method of the usepa 1999 3 h q c d i r f d 4 c d i c i r b w where cdi is the dose of metal loid intake mg kg day rfd is the reference dose mg kg day which refers to the maximum acceptable dose of a toxic substance table 3 c is the concentration of metal loid mg l ir is the ingestion rate of water which was set to 3 49 for adults and 2 14 l day for children tirkey et al 2017 radfard et al 2019 and bw is body weight which was taken as 70 kg for adults and 22 3 for children fakhri et al 2015 in this study ingestion of contaminated groundwater was considered as the only exposure route to ptes ravindra et al 2019 as the risk assessment is done for multiple metals and metalloids the hazard index hi can be calculated from following equation qasemi et al 2019 sohrabi et al 2020 5 h i i 1 n h q i an hq or hi value greater than 1 indicates medium to high chronic health risk yousefi et al 2018 as outlined in supplementary table 2 3 results 3 1 groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics and spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters table 4 provides a statistical summary of the measured major anions trace elements and other chemical parameters in the 676 data points along with the corresponding who guideline concentrations world health organization who 2017 the gridded maps of these parameters are shown in fig 2 the ranking of major cation concentrations is generally na ca2 mg2 k the ranking among the major anions is so4 2 cl hco3 the measures of ec so4 2 na mg2 and cr exceed the maximum permissible limits in more than 10 of the samples 3 2 factors controlling the major ions chemistry in groundwater plotting the samples on a piper diagram fig 3 reveals that 50 of the samples belongs to the na cl type followed by ca mg cl 27 ca hco3 15 ca na hco3 7 and ca cl 2 the ca mg hco3 water type is mostly found in the northern part of the province where ec values are all less than 1000 μs cm which is likely due to the dissolution of carbonates supplementary fig 6 the predominance of the na cl water type indicates that evaporites such as halite and gypsum anhydrite strongly affect the groundwater chemistry bivariate plots of ionic constituents of studied samples are presented in fig 4 the ratio of ca2 mg2 to total cations fig 4a for all samples is considerably less than one which implies that other cations such as na and k are abundant in groundwater samples the ratio of ca2 mg2 to hco3 so4 2 of most samples is less than one fig 4b which suggests that silicate weathering affects the ca2 and mg2 chemistry lakshmanan et al 2003 dehbandi et al 2017 the ratio of ca2 to hco3 for groundwater formed in dolomite and calcite aquifers is normally between 1 4 and 1 2 ledesma et al 2014 however only a few samples in fig 4c fall between these ratios whereas most are higher the ratio of some samples of ca2 vs so4 2 fig 4d is close to one which suggests that these samples are in contact with gypsum and anhydrite wu et al 2015 examination of fig 4c and d suggests that ca2 is removed from water by reactions such as cation exchange the plot of na k cl against ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 fig 4e confirms the cation exchange process with na increasing while ca2 decreases mclean et al 2000 the plot of the na cl ratio against cl concentrations fig 4f shows that the ratio increases with decreasing salinity with the na cl ratio of the water samples ranging from 0 3 to 8 6 the majority of samples 97 has a molar ratio 1 which indicates that the relative abundance of sodium na could be related to ion exchange and or silicate weathering this plot also shows that samples with high ec values have a molar ratio equal or close to one which is a sign of the dissolution of evaporite minerals sánchez martos et al 2002 taherian and joodavi 2021 furthermore ec is significantly corelated with na cl and so4 2 supplementary table 3 the hco3 cl ratio is an indicator of salinization whereby values greater than one indicate low salinity in carbonate zones dissolution of evaporite minerals enriches cl in groundwater which decreases the hco3 cl ratio fig 4f as seen in fig 4h the water samples have a wide range of ca2 na ratios 0 1 10 which are inversely related to salinity a high ca2 na molar ratio indicates that carbonate dissolution is the dominant process in the aquifer ayadi et al 2018 moreover the saturation index si calculated by phreeqc indicates that some groundwater samples are saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 5 a b e which confirms carbonate dissolution on the other hand all samples are undersaturated with respect to gypsum and halite sigypsum and sihalite increase with tds indicating dissolution of evaporite minerals fig 5c d plotting sihalite versus sicalcite fig 5f reveals two geochemical evolution trends in the aquifer in relatively low salinity groundwater samples mostly located in the northern areas and close to karst aquifers the precipitation of ca2 and the dissolution of evaporite minerals along the groundwater flow path lead to a decrease in sicalcite and increase in sihalite line i in fig 5f in contrast far from carbonate formations for example in the northeast off the study area the dissolution of evaporites and carbonate minerals in marl and loess formations causes a simultaneous increases in sicalcite and sihalite ec line ii in fig 5f 3 3 geostatistical modelling random forest rf regression models were used to help identify potential sources and processes of groundwater contamination based on the water quality assessment described above six parameters as cr ec fe no3 se were modeled using the variables listed in table 1 the model results are plotted against the observations in fig 6 which also includes the model performance measures r2 nrmse and nse the performance of the models are generally considered acceptable as nse and r2 for all models are greater than 0 5 zhou et al 2019 the variables importance in each regression model indicates the strength of the relationship between a contaminant and its potential sources fig 7 the ec model confirms that high salinity is found where evaporate deposits are found fig 7a and supplementary fig 1 and or considerable evapotranspiration has taken place evaporites can exist as geological formations such as marl halite gypsum loess or salt flats pans and their dissolution can considerably increase groundwater salinity sánchez martos et al 2002 furthermore evapotranspiration from irrigated fields can increase soil and irrigation return flow salinity foster et al 2018 the no3 model shows that nitrate in groundwater is associated primarily with urban areas followed by agricultural activities fig 7c in the study area human sewage in cities as well as many rural areas is traditionally discharged into absorbing wells which leads to high levels of nitrate in groundwater qasemi et al 2018 zendehbad et al 2019 furthermore there are about 752 500 ha of irrigated agriculture in razavi khorasan province on which nitrogenous and animal waste fertilizers containing high levels of nitrate are applied alighardashi et al 2017 the chromium model clearly indicates that ophiolite and ultramafic units are the main sources of chromium in groundwater these ophiolite and ultramafic units usually consisting of peridotite serpentinite gabbro and chromite deposits shafaii moghadam et al 2014 chromium is typically present as cr iii and cr vi with cr vi being very toxic and more soluble and mobile in groundwater coyte et al 2019 cr iii is found in minerals and can be oxidized and transformed to cr vi in the existence of an oxides such as mno2 bertolo et al 2011 6 cr iii 1 5 mno2 h2o hcr vi o4 1 5 mn2 h groundwater arsenic in razavi khorasan is associated mainly with granitoid rocks fig 7e this is consistent with reported geogenic arsenic contaminated groundwater in razavi khorasan province hamidian et al 2019 where arsenic release results from the weathering of sulfide minerals such as realgar orpiment and arsenopyrite in granitoid rocks ghasemzadeh et al 2011 alidadi et al 2015 alaminia et al 2016 taheri et al 2016 hamamipour et al 2018 some possible reactions leading to the release of arsenic from sulfide minerals can be found by the following reactions chelsea et al 2014 orpiment dissolution 7 0 5 as2s3 3h2o h3aso3 aq 1 5h2s arsenopyrite dissolution 8 feass s 1 5h2o 2 75 o2 aq fe2 2 h3aso3 aq so4 2 aq fig 7d shows that the presence of metal ore deposits is the dominant predictor of iron concentration in groundwater previous studies indicated that iron can originate from trachyandesite and pyroclastic rocks in some parts of razavi khorasan province zirjanizadeh et al 2016b taghadosi et al 2018 moreover the well known sangan iron skarn deposit which is located in the southeastern parts of the study area is another well known source of iron golmohammadi et al 2015 sepidbar et al 2017 the likely sources of groundwater contaminants based on the modeling results are summarized in table 5 3 4 health risk assessment a non carcinogenic health risk assessment was conducted to estimate the probability of harmful effects of exposure to as cr cu fe pb se v and zn in groundwater used for drinking purposes the average hazard quotient hq values indicate that as and cr make up 53 and 28 respectively of the total non carcinogenic risk hi due to groundwater constituents for the total population hi ranges between 0 33 and 7 33 average of 1 67 for children and between 0 13 and 3 01 average of 0 65 for adults fig 8 shows that areas with medium to high risk values for children largely coincide with zones of high as and cr concentrations fig 2 in addition to causing adverse non carcinogenic health effects arsenic and chromium are categorized as carcinogenic substances world health organization who 2017 the chronic consumption of as contaminated water may cause skin bladder or lung cancer polya and middleton 2017 world health organization who 2017 whereby chromium especially cr vi is known to cause dna damage agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2012 wang et al 2017 4 discussion despite there being separate alluvial aquifer systems in the study area separated by mountains the results show that the dominant lithology of the mountains is responsible for controlling groundwater chemistry and increasing the concentration of some ptes in groundwater such as as cr fe and v beyond the river basin aquifer boundaries this can be conceptualized by two phenomena presented in fig 9 if mountain block front recharge exists the chemistry of subsurface inflow directly affects the groundwater quality in alluvial aquifers fig 9a ajami et al 2011 joodavi et al 2016 that is common in karst alluvial aquifer systems in the northern parts of the study area where low salinity groundwater with ca mg hco3 water type can be found in alluvial aquifers moreover it is possible that this mountain system recharge is responsible for high concentrations of arsenic in the western parts of the province where arsenic is released by weathering of sulfide minerals in granitoid rocks even if the mountain block front recharge component is not significant the alluvial aquifers could contain particles from adjacent mountains fig 9b kaprara et al 2014 the random forest model suggests that high cr concentrations in groundwater are observed in the alluvial aquifers located not far from the ophiolitic rocks while these rocks do not have a developed fractured storage system the sediments of the alluvial aquifers originated from ophiolite and ultramafic units are likely the source of cr in groundwater furthermore the geological map show that marl evaporites are mainly found in the southern and western parts of the region hydrogeological studies have shown that these units form the bedrock of alluvial aquifers in these areas joodavi et al 2009 izady et al 2015 the random forest model results confirm that groundwater resources in these areas are more saline the approach provided here identification of the sources of major ions and toxic elements in groundwater in regions lacking adequate monitoring programs and sampling data therefore additional groundwater quality measurements and geochemical and mineralogical information as well as more information about the amount and chemistry of industrial wastewater would improve the robustness of the geostatistical models especially in locations close to contamination sources such as industrial areas another limitation of this study is that this method characterizes large scale macro scale spatial variation in the elements in groundwater however the chemical composition of groundwater samples may be affected by local hydrologic and hydrogeological factors future research will add consideration of these local factors such as residence time to accurately investigate the driving forces of groundwater quality 5 conclusion understanding the factors affecting and controlling groundwater quality is necessary to improve water security and public health through reducing water related risks although most hydrogeochemistry studies try to interpret geochemical reactions along groundwater flow paths in an aquifer or a watershed this paper proposed an approach to identify the sources of salinity nitrate and ptes in groundwater in large scale studies of broad geographical areas where there are large gaps in testing locations integrated approaches of statistical analysis conventional hydrogeochemical plots and machine learning were employed in this study to characterize the groundwater chemistry in razavi khorasan province and identify likely sources of contamination hydrogeochemical controls on groundwater quality and human health risk from harmful elements in the province were identified from 676 groundwater samples in the study area we found that the chemical composition of groundwater is determined predominantly by geology but also influenced by human activities the na cl water type along with high salinity levels in groundwater se and so4 2 can be related to the dissolution of salts from geological formations as well as evapotranspiration and irrigation return flow caused by groundwater irrigated agriculture random forest regression modeling has also shown that high concentrations of chromium arsenic and iron in groundwater are attributed to the presence of ophiolites granitoid intermediate to silicic volcanic rocks and metal ores formed in pyroclastic rocks and skarn deposits respectively moreover discharging sewage directly into aquifers and applying fertilizers in agricultural activities result in high levels of nitrate in groundwater a non carcinogenic health risk assessment of ptes as cr cu fe pb se v zn in groundwater indicates that as and cr constitute 53 and 28 of the total risk respectively the predictor variables used in the random forest modeling are readily available making this integrated approach relevant for identifying potential regional groundwater contamination sources the results can be used to develop cost effective water quality monitoring programs for water resource planning and management in razavi khorasan province iran credit authorship contribution

of independent variables and ntree was set to 1000 the relative importance of the predictor variables in each model was assessed through the rf measure of importance which gives the average model error when the independent variable values are randomly sorted the predictive ability of the rf models was evaluated by three criteria coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse legates and mccabe 1999 which are defined as follows 1 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o max o min 2 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is an observed value omin omax and o are the minimum maximum and average of the observed values respectively and pi is the model predicted value and n is the number of observed data if a model produces values that are the same as the observations nrmse and nse values are 0 and 1 respectively nrmse shows the square of the differences between the predicted and the observed values in relation to the variability in the observed data these three criteria together give insight into how well the models predict the observed data 2 4 non carcinogenic health risk assessment the health risk posed by exposure to the metal loid s as cr cu fe pb se v and zn in groundwater was quantified using the hazard quotient hq method of the usepa 1999 3 h q c d i r f d 4 c d i c i r b w where cdi is the dose of metal loid intake mg kg day rfd is the reference dose mg kg day which refers to the maximum acceptable dose of a toxic substance table 3 c is the concentration of metal loid mg l ir is the ingestion rate of water which was set to 3 49 for adults and 2 14 l day for children tirkey et al 2017 radfard et al 2019 and bw is body weight which was taken as 70 kg for adults and 22 3 for children fakhri et al 2015 in this study ingestion of contaminated groundwater was considered as the only exposure route to ptes ravindra et al 2019 as the risk assessment is done for multiple metals and metalloids the hazard index hi can be calculated from following equation qasemi et al 2019 sohrabi et al 2020 5 h i i 1 n h q i an hq or hi value greater than 1 indicates medium to high chronic health risk yousefi et al 2018 as outlined in supplementary table 2 3 results 3 1 groundwater hydrogeochemical characteristics and spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters table 4 provides a statistical summary of the measured major anions trace elements and other chemical parameters in the 676 data points along with the corresponding who guideline concentrations world health organization who 2017 the gridded maps of these parameters are shown in fig 2 the ranking of major cation concentrations is generally na ca2 mg2 k the ranking among the major anions is so4 2 cl hco3 the measures of ec so4 2 na mg2 and cr exceed the maximum permissible limits in more than 10 of the samples 3 2 factors controlling the major ions chemistry in groundwater plotting the samples on a piper diagram fig 3 reveals that 50 of the samples belongs to the na cl type followed by ca mg cl 27 ca hco3 15 ca na hco3 7 and ca cl 2 the ca mg hco3 water type is mostly found in the northern part of the province where ec values are all less than 1000 μs cm which is likely due to the dissolution of carbonates supplementary fig 6 the predominance of the na cl water type indicates that evaporites such as halite and gypsum anhydrite strongly affect the groundwater chemistry bivariate plots of ionic constituents of studied samples are presented in fig 4 the ratio of ca2 mg2 to total cations fig 4a for all samples is considerably less than one which implies that other cations such as na and k are abundant in groundwater samples the ratio of ca2 mg2 to hco3 so4 2 of most samples is less than one fig 4b which suggests that silicate weathering affects the ca2 and mg2 chemistry lakshmanan et al 2003 dehbandi et al 2017 the ratio of ca2 to hco3 for groundwater formed in dolomite and calcite aquifers is normally between 1 4 and 1 2 ledesma et al 2014 however only a few samples in fig 4c fall between these ratios whereas most are higher the ratio of some samples of ca2 vs so4 2 fig 4d is close to one which suggests that these samples are in contact with gypsum and anhydrite wu et al 2015 examination of fig 4c and d suggests that ca2 is removed from water by reactions such as cation exchange the plot of na k cl against ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 fig 4e confirms the cation exchange process with na increasing while ca2 decreases mclean et al 2000 the plot of the na cl ratio against cl concentrations fig 4f shows that the ratio increases with decreasing salinity with the na cl ratio of the water samples ranging from 0 3 to 8 6 the majority of samples 97 has a molar ratio 1 which indicates that the relative abundance of sodium na could be related to ion exchange and or silicate weathering this plot also shows that samples with high ec values have a molar ratio equal or close to one which is a sign of the dissolution of evaporite minerals sánchez martos et al 2002 taherian and joodavi 2021 furthermore ec is significantly corelated with na cl and so4 2 supplementary table 3 the hco3 cl ratio is an indicator of salinization whereby values greater than one indicate low salinity in carbonate zones dissolution of evaporite minerals enriches cl in groundwater which decreases the hco3 cl ratio fig 4f as seen in fig 4h the water samples have a wide range of ca2 na ratios 0 1 10 which are inversely related to salinity a high ca2 na molar ratio indicates that carbonate dissolution is the dominant process in the aquifer ayadi et al 2018 moreover the saturation index si calculated by phreeqc indicates that some groundwater samples are saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 5 a b e which confirms carbonate dissolution on the other hand all samples are undersaturated with respect to gypsum and halite sigypsum and sihalite increase with tds indicating dissolution of evaporite minerals fig 5c d plotting sihalite versus sicalcite fig 5f reveals two geochemical evolution trends in the aquifer in relatively low salinity groundwater samples mostly located in the northern areas and close to karst aquifers the precipitation of ca2 and the dissolution of evaporite minerals along the groundwater flow path lead to a decrease in sicalcite and increase in sihalite line i in fig 5f in contrast far from carbonate formations for example in the northeast off the study area the dissolution of evaporites and carbonate minerals in marl and loess formations causes a simultaneous increases in sicalcite and sihalite ec line ii in fig 5f 3 3 geostatistical modelling random forest rf regression models were used to help identify potential sources and processes of groundwater contamination based on the water quality assessment described above six parameters as cr ec fe no3 se were modeled using the variables listed in table 1 the model results are plotted against the observations in fig 6 which also includes the model performance measures r2 nrmse and nse the performance of the models are generally considered acceptable as nse and r2 for all models are greater than 0 5 zhou et al 2019 the variables importance in each regression model indicates the strength of the relationship between a contaminant and its potential sources fig 7 the ec model confirms that high salinity is found where evaporate deposits are found fig 7a and supplementary fig 1 and or considerable evapotranspiration has taken place evaporites can exist as geological formations such as marl halite gypsum loess or salt flats pans and their dissolution can considerably increase groundwater salinity sánchez martos et al 2002 furthermore evapotranspiration from irrigated fields can increase soil and irrigation return flow salinity foster et al 2018 the no3 model shows that nitrate in groundwater is associated primarily with urban areas followed by agricultural activities fig 7c in the study area human sewage in cities as well as many rural areas is traditionally discharged into absorbing wells which leads to high levels of nitrate in groundwater qasemi et al 2018 zendehbad et al 2019 furthermore there are about 752 500 ha of irrigated agriculture in razavi khorasan province on which nitrogenous and animal waste fertilizers containing high levels of nitrate are applied alighardashi et al 2017 the chromium model clearly indicates that ophiolite and ultramafic units are the main sources of chromium in groundwater these ophiolite and ultramafic units usually consisting of peridotite serpentinite gabbro and chromite deposits shafaii moghadam et al 2014 chromium is typically present as cr iii and cr vi with cr vi being very toxic and more soluble and mobile in groundwater coyte et al 2019 cr iii is found in minerals and can be oxidized and transformed to cr vi in the existence of an oxides such as mno2 bertolo et al 2011 6 cr iii 1 5 mno2 h2o hcr vi o4 1 5 mn2 h groundwater arsenic in razavi khorasan is associated mainly with granitoid rocks fig 7e this is consistent with reported geogenic arsenic contaminated groundwater in razavi khorasan province hamidian et al 2019 where arsenic release results from the weathering of sulfide minerals such as realgar orpiment and arsenopyrite in granitoid rocks ghasemzadeh et al 2011 alidadi et al 2015 alaminia et al 2016 taheri et al 2016 hamamipour et al 2018 some possible reactions leading to the release of arsenic from sulfide minerals can be found by the following reactions chelsea et al 2014 orpiment dissolution 7 0 5 as2s3 3h2o h3aso3 aq 1 5h2s arsenopyrite dissolution 8 feass s 1 5h2o 2 75 o2 aq fe2 2 h3aso3 aq so4 2 aq fig 7d shows that the presence of metal ore deposits is the dominant predictor of iron concentration in groundwater previous studies indicated that iron can originate from trachyandesite and pyroclastic rocks in some parts of razavi khorasan province zirjanizadeh et al 2016b taghadosi et al 2018 moreover the well known sangan iron skarn deposit which is located in the southeastern parts of the study area is another well known source of iron golmohammadi et al 2015 sepidbar et al 2017 the likely sources of groundwater contaminants based on the modeling results are summarized in table 5 3 4 health risk assessment a non carcinogenic health risk assessment was conducted to estimate the probability of harmful effects of exposure to as cr cu fe pb se v and zn in groundwater used for drinking purposes the average hazard quotient hq values indicate that as and cr make up 53 and 28 respectively of the total non carcinogenic risk hi due to groundwater constituents for the total population hi ranges between 0 33 and 7 33 average of 1 67 for children and between 0 13 and 3 01 average of 0 65 for adults fig 8 shows that areas with medium to high risk values for children largely coincide with zones of high as and cr concentrations fig 2 in addition to causing adverse non carcinogenic health effects arsenic and chromium are categorized as carcinogenic substances world health organization who 2017 the chronic consumption of as contaminated water may cause skin bladder or lung cancer polya and middleton 2017 world health organization who 2017 whereby chromium especially cr vi is known to cause dna damage agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 2012 wang et al 2017 4 discussion despite there being separate alluvial aquifer systems in the study area separated by mountains the results show that the dominant lithology of the mountains is responsible for controlling groundwater chemistry and increasing the concentration of some ptes in groundwater such as as cr fe and v beyond the river basin aquifer boundaries this can be conceptualized by two phenomena presented in fig 9 if mountain block front recharge exists the chemistry of subsurface inflow directly affects the groundwater quality in alluvial aquifers fig 9a ajami et al 2011 joodavi et al 2016 that is common in karst alluvial aquifer systems in the northern parts of the study area where low salinity groundwater with ca mg hco3 water type can be found in alluvial aquifers moreover it is possible that this mountain system recharge is responsible for high concentrations of arsenic in the western parts of the province where arsenic is released by weathering of sulfide minerals in granitoid rocks even if the mountain block front recharge component is not significant the alluvial aquifers could contain particles from adjacent mountains fig 9b kaprara et al 2014 the random forest model suggests that high cr concentrations in groundwater are observed in the alluvial aquifers located not far from the ophiolitic rocks while these rocks do not have a developed fractured storage system the sediments of the alluvial aquifers originated from ophiolite and ultramafic units are likely the source of cr in groundwater furthermore the geological map show that marl evaporites are mainly found in the southern and western parts of the region hydrogeological studies have shown that these units form the bedrock of alluvial aquifers in these areas joodavi et al 2009 izady et al 2015 the random forest model results confirm that groundwater resources in these areas are more saline the approach provided here identification of the sources of major ions and toxic elements in groundwater in regions lacking adequate monitoring programs and sampling data therefore additional groundwater quality measurements and geochemical and mineralogical information as well as more information about the amount and chemistry of industrial wastewater would improve the robustness of the geostatistical models especially in locations close to contamination sources such as industrial areas another limitation of this study is that this method characterizes large scale macro scale spatial variation in the elements in groundwater however the chemical composition of groundwater samples may be affected by local hydrologic and hydrogeological factors future research will add consideration of these local factors such as residence time to accurately investigate the driving forces of groundwater quality 5 conclusion understanding the factors affecting and controlling groundwater quality is necessary to improve water security and public health through reducing water related risks although most hydrogeochemistry studies try to interpret geochemical reactions along groundwater flow paths in an aquifer or a watershed this paper proposed an approach to identify the sources of salinity nitrate and ptes in groundwater in large scale studies of broad geographical areas where there are large gaps in testing locations integrated approaches of statistical analysis conventional hydrogeochemical plots and machine learning were employed in this study to characterize the groundwater chemistry in razavi khorasan province and identify likely sources of contamination hydrogeochemical controls on groundwater quality and human health risk from harmful elements in the province were identified from 676 groundwater samples in the study area we found that the chemical composition of groundwater is determined predominantly by geology but also influenced by human activities the na cl water type along with high salinity levels in groundwater se and so4 2 can be related to the dissolution of salts from geological formations as well as evapotranspiration and irrigation return flow caused by groundwater irrigated agriculture random forest regression modeling has also shown that high concentrations of chromium arsenic and iron in groundwater are attributed to the presence of ophiolites granitoid intermediate to silicic volcanic rocks and metal ores formed in pyroclastic rocks and skarn deposits respectively moreover discharging sewage directly into aquifers and applying fertilizers in agricultural activities result in high levels of nitrate in groundwater a non carcinogenic health risk assessment of ptes as cr cu fe pb se v zn in groundwater indicates that as and cr constitute 53 and 28 of the total risk respectively the predictor variables used in the random forest modeling are readily available making this integrated approach relevant for identifying potential regional groundwater contamination sources the results can be used to develop cost effective water quality monitoring programs for water resource planning and management in razavi khorasan province iran credit authorship contribution

8131,study region yangpota mountain in zhuanglang county loess plateau hilly area study focus in dry and degraded ecosystems water scarcity remains the most significant restriction to vegetation restoration and ecosystem rehabilitation plants cannot directly absorb groundwater in the loess plateau so soil moisture is very important for the growth of plants through the soil moisture observation system of yangpota mountain terraces we explore the influence mechanism of terrace construction on soil moisture new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the soil moisture of terraces is higher than that of slope farmland and natural vegetation surfaces in the 0 1 m soil depth range soil moisture was found to be 4 39 to 4 89 higher compared with slope farmland in different slope directions of the loess plateau the soil moisture on the northern slopes was higher than that on the southern slopes the soil moisture of abandoned terraces is higher than that of terraces in use also crop types and evaporation different were found to play an important role due to differences in root systems and water requirements keywords terracing soil moisture slope aspect abandonment loess plateau 1 introduction soil moisture content plays an important role in hydrology and vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions it controls the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of infiltration evaporation and vegetation penna et al 2013 chaney et al 2015 it means that soil moisture dynamics play an important role in vegetation growth and restoration josa et al 2012 liu and shao 2015 and play a key role in determining ecosystem structure and function stability especially in arid areas without or with little groundwater the soil moisture content is crucial in determining plant phenology and net primary productivity ferrante et al 2014 therefore using rainwater harvesting technology to improve soil moisture capacity in dryland especially in rain fed agricultural areas is very important to enhance ecosystem restoration and achieve neutral land degradation grainger 2015 however soil moisture varies greatly with time and space at different scales wang et al 2015 which is highly influenced by topography temperature land use vegetation type water demand and soil properties kassaye et al 2021 the change of micro topographical conditions may be substantial in hydrological processes the terrace construction reshapes the surface morphology and transforms natural slopes into steep slopes which can completely change the topography and improve the efficiency of rainwater collection therefore it can reduce soil erosion and increase soil stability on slopes alleviate drought severity and strengthen the ability of ecosystem rehabilitation ramos et al 2007 schuh et al 2017 xu et al 2016 and also increase crop yield kosmowski 2018 in many mountainous regions and hilly areas globally to stabilize slopes control soil and water erosion and increase crop yields terrace construction measures have been widely implemented wickama et al 2014 chen et al 2020a b the loess plateau is one of the regions with the most severe soil and water erosion in china for a long time the important issues faced by the ecological construction of the loess plateau are insufficient water resources unreasonable vegetation allocation and low ecosystem service functions the soil erosion of agricultural land especially slope farmland is a serious ecological problem it will lead to the increase of sediment content in rivers tang 2004 and lead to the decline of soil nutrient properties the devastation of agricultural ecological environment and the obstruction of agricultural economic growth lal 1993 the terrace construction can effectively improve this situation increase the storage time of rainwater on the ground increase the efficiency of rainwater collection increase the infiltration of soil water and then control soil erosion and water loss which benefits the ecosystem restoration wei et al 2019 mountainous regions account for 2 3 of china s land area and the rain fed farming regions account for 49 of arable land the terrace is the most important farmland model in rain fed agricultural areas which guarantees the food security of nearly 700 million people the change of soil moisture in the terrace is very important for terrace construction and agricultural management chen et al 2016 wei et al 2016 feng et al 2018 yang et al 2012 liancourt et al 2012 yu et al 2015 koster et al 2004 many scholars have studied the impact of terrace construction on soil moisture and have confirmed that different terrace measures have different effects on soil water use efficiency chen et al 2020a b due to terraces diversity and wide distribution soil moisture changes in rain fed agricultural areas are extremely sensitive comprehensive research on the influencing factors of soil moisture changes in typical rain fed areas and terraces in hilly loess areas plays a vital role in clarifying small scale agricultural management strategies and proposing specific management suggestions in order to explore the influence of horizontal terrace construction and vegetation slope direction and abandonment on soil moisture this paper takes the terrace construction area of yangpota mountain collapse in zhuanglang county a typical rain fed agricultural area in the loess plateau as the research area we collect the soil samples of terraces with different slope directions different crop types and different slope positions expecting to be clear 1 effects of terrace construction on soil moisture in the loess plateau 2 differences in soil moisture and its influencing factors in terraces with different slope directions 3 effects of different natural vegetation cover and crop types on soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area zhuanglang county 35 04 35 27 n 105 47 106 25 located in the western foot of liupan mountain and the eastern edge of loess plateau of west gansu is the first model terraced county in china and it s a typical representative of landform in the loess hilly and gully region fig 1 since the mid 1960s terrace construction has been carried out at present the terrace system in arid and semi arid areas with the longest time and the complete system has been built in china in 2020 an observation system was established in dazhuang town zhuanglang county on the loess plateau dazhuang town is a loess hilly area with complex terrain and its altitude is between 1 521 m qinglonggou village and 1 784 m wangshan village belonging to temperate continental monsoon climate the climate here is warm and humid and the accumulated temperature is low its annual average temperature varies from 7 4 to 7 9 the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn the annual rainfall is 500 550 mm the frost free period is as long as 159 days and the average annual sunshine time is as high as 2 179 h the main soil type in zhuanglang county is loess and the main crop types are wheat corn and potato the economic crops are rape flax and apple which have been developed in zhuanglang county in recent years before hanging fruit apples often intercrop with potatoes the source of water mainly depends on natural rainfall 2 2 monitoring system experimental design the sampling area is yangpota mountain dazhuang town zhuanglang county gansu province the terrace reclamation period is more than 30 years in order to avoid the impact of other meteorological factors on soil moisture the sampling period is concentrated on 3 october 2020 and the weather is cloudy in order to study the influence of slope on soil moisture we selected the north northwest south and southeast slopes of the yangpota mountain in dazhuang village dazhuang town for sampling in order to clarify the impact of terrace construction on soil moisture we collected soil samples from slope farms and terraces in lianwang village dazhuang town at the same time soil samples of sloping fields covered by different natural vegetation types were also collected to compare the soil moisture of terraces and natural sloping fields there are various types of agricultural planting in the study area mainly apple trees corn and wheat and there are also many types of interplanting such as apple trees vegetables apple trees wheat etc eight types of farmland soils were collected including apple trees vegetables corn buckwheat beans potatoes apple bean interplanting and apple potato interplanting in order to explore the impact of abandonment on soil moisture soil samples from abandoned terraced fields on the same slope in lianwang village were collected a soil depth of 1 0 m would represent the extent of vertical root distribution of herbaceous plants and crops and would also reflect the main root distribution of the forest han et al 2017 by using a cutting ring soil samples are taken for profile depth ranges of 0 0 1 m 0 1 0 2 m 0 2 0 3 m 0 3 0 4 m 0 4 0 5 m 0 5 0 6 m 0 6 0 7 m 0 7 0 8 m 0 8 0 9 m and 0 9 1 0 m a total of 840 samples are collected including 480 samples on the north slope 140 samples on the northwest slope 100 samples on the south slope and 110 samples on the southeast slope 2 3 experimental analysis each soil sample is placed in an aluminum box and seal it with tape after returning to the laboratory measure the weight of each aluminum box with moist soil m then uncover the lid of the aluminum box and put it in the oven with 105 c for 24 h when the moisture in the soil is completely dried the weight of the aluminum box containing the dry soil is measured ms the calculation formula of soil moisture is as follows soil moisture m ms ms 100 3 results and analysis 3 1 soil moisture characteristics of terraced fields with different slope directions different slope terraces are affected by light time rainfall and evaporation and soil moisture is significantly different the soil moisture values in the study area are between 15 99 and 32 56 and there are certain differences in different slope directions on the whole the soil moisture showed as follow northwest slope north slope southeast slope south slope the maximum value appeared the northwest slope and the minimum appeared on the south slope in which the average soil moisture on the northwest slope was 5 49 higher than that on the south slope fig 2 in the same natural vegetation or crop type in different slope directions soil moisture also has obvious differences it can be seen from fig 3 that except for the potato planting terraces on the northwest slope the soil moisture characteristics of the other sampling points showed a vertical feature of decreasing fluctuations the soil moisture of the southern slope grassland is higher than that of the northern slope grassland and the difference is the largest in the 0 0 1 m soil layer with a difference of 4 88 in the 0 0 4 m soil layer the soil moisture decreased in north slope south slope northwest slope southeast slope in the 0 8 1 m soil layer the soil moisture decreased in north slope northwest slope south slope southeast slope in potato planting land 0 10 cm soil moisture in the south slope is slightly higher than the northwest slope below 10 cm soil layer soil moisture in the northwest slope is significantly higher than the south slope fig 3 3 2 soil moisture characteristics of different crop types the differences in root depth and root length density of different crops will lead to different water use efficiency showing different soil moisture characteristics except for potato planting land and fruit potato intercropping land the soil moisture of other crop types showed a decreasing vertical distribution fig 4 potato planting land and fruit potato intercropping land showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the soil moisture in 0 0 1 m soil layer of all crop types is greater than other soil layers the largest difference between surface soil moisture 0 0 1 m and deep soil moisture 0 9 1 m is vegetable planting land 11 26 and the smallest difference is potato planting land 0 7 in the whole soil profile the soil moisture of different crops is significantly different potato 26 79 apple 24 33 legume 23 22 fruit tree potato 22 73 vegetable 22 11 maize 21 35 buckwheat 20 69 fruit tree legume 20 18 in 0 0 4 m soil layer soil moisture content of potato planting land 29 71 is the highest followed by legume planting land 28 36 fruit soybean intercropping land 27 79 vegetable planting land 27 36 apple native land 27 02 corn planting land 26 89 fruit potato intercropping land 23 54 wheat planting land 23 49 in 0 4 1 m deep soil the soil moisture of potato field 26 56 is significantly higher than that of other crop types and the crop type with the lowest deep soil moisture is corn 3 3 soil moisture characteristics of abandoned terraces and terraces due to unreasonable agricultural management measures resulting in reduced soil fertility or insufficient rural lab many terraces have been abandoned in the loess plateau it can be seen from fig 5 a that the average soil moisture of the 0 100 cm soil layer of the abandoned terraces is increased by 3 25 compared with the terraces in use the most obvious increase in soil moisture on the vertical gradient is the surface soil layer of 0 20 cm and the soil layer of 70 100 cm in the soil layer of 20 40 cm the difference in soil moisture between abandoned terraces and terraces in use becomes smaller and shows the same changing trend the difference in soil moisture below the 40 cm soil layer shows the trend gradually increases first and then slightly decreases the reason for the small difference in soil moisture between abandoned terraces and non abandoned terraces in the soil layer of 20 40 cm may be because shallow roots of the grass plants that grow after the abandonment and there is no obvious loosening effect on the soil layer below 20 cm the increase in soil moisture in the abandoned terraces deep soil may be because most of the apple trees on the abandoned farmland have died and the deep soil water is no longer absorbed and utilized thereby increasing the soil moisture the box represents 25 75 percentile and the line in the box represents the median 50 percentile indicating the fifth and 95th percentiles 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of slope direction on soil moisture in terraces slope direction mainly affects the different variation characteristics of soil moisture through surface temperature soil temperature and precipitation according to the comparison of soil moisture in different slope directions in the sampling area table 1 in the sampling area the soil moisture in the north slope of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 5 m soil layers is higher in the south slope the spatial variability of surface soil moisture depends on the changes of environmental factors such as precipitation and evaporation martínez murillo et al 2017 this difference in solar radiation between north and south slopes makes it present this result in 0 5 1 m deep soil the difference in soil moisture in different regions is very small mainly because the soil moisture in this layer is less affected by evaporation and more affected by soil infiltration and soil water holding capacity yong et al 2020 in the northern hemisphere the southern slope is a sunny slope and the light time and the amount of solar radiation received are greater than those of the northern slope in a local small area the precipitation does not have much difference at this time the evaporation plays an absolute leading role in the change of soil moisture therefore more fruit trees are planted in the south slope and more attention should be paid to the water retention of fruit trees on the southern slope in agricultural management light plays an extremely important role in apple an economic crop therefore there are more fruit trees planted in the south slope and more attention should be paid to the water retention of fruit trees on the southern slope in agricultural management in the southern hemisphere the corresponding phenomenon is that there is less solar radiation interception and higher soil moisture on the south slope galicia et al 1999 table 2 4 2 the effect of different land use types on soil moisture differences in land use vegetation coverage and management methods will affect soil moisture james et al 2003 gómez et al 2011 abazi et al 2013 and the difference in the absorption capacity of different crop roots is an important factor to control the dynamic changes of soil moisture yang et al 2014 this work shows that the soil moisture of farmland terraces is higher than that of natural woodland and grassland fig 5 the forest and grass covered areas in the loess hilly region are natural slopes with a certain slope and it is difficult for precipitation to accumulate on the surface thereby reducing infiltration after the construction of terraces the slope of the farmland s surface has slowed down the suspension time of rainfall has increased and the infiltration has increased lü et al 2009 chen et al 2020a b in addition the vegetation coverage of natural woodland is relatively large and the interception of precipitation by the leaf canopy reduces the amount of water accumulated on the surface woody plants always consume more water through evapotranspiration than cultivated crops so the soil moisture of natural forest land is lower than that of farmland jia et al 2017 therefore the soil moisture of farmland is significantly higher than that of natural vegetation coverage area mainly due to the comprehensive impact of vegetation type and terrace construction compared with the natural vegetation coverage area the soil moisture under different farmland crop types has more obvious differences potatoes have the highest soil moisture among all land use types the sampling season is the potato harvest season in comparing of single crop types the soil moisture of corn wheat and buckwheat is the lowest indicating that the growth of these three crops needs to consume more soil moisture comparing the intercropping of potatoes and apple trees legumes and legumes between apple trees it can be found that the soil moisture of intercropping is lower than that of monoculture compared with single planting potato soil moisture of apple tree intercropping potato decreased by 4 06 compared with single planting beans soil moisture of apple tree intercropping beans decreased by 3 04 this is because the intercropping makes the roots of different crops occupy different soil space and soil depth which improves the ability of plants to absorb and utilize water in each soil layer and the intercropping mode can improve the utilization rate of soil moisture fig 6 4 3 the effect of abandonment on soil moisture in terraces due to the migration of labour caused by urbanization land fertility decline or inability to achieve mechanization many farmland is abandoned deng et al 2013 romero díaz et al 2017 lizaga et al 2019 comparing the soil moisture of abandoned terraces and unabandoned terraces on the same slope before abandoned cultivation the planting type of terrace was apple tree due to the lack of agricultural management a large number of weeds grow the types of herbs grown include setaria viridis l beauv agropyron cristatum linn gaertn and so on a general rule is found the soil moisture of abandoned terraces is higher than that of unabandoned terraces fig 5 which may be mainly due to two reasons i the agricultural management mode of ploughing after fruit planting is not impossible and the weeds in the fruit tree rows are removed agricultural management during the growth and fruiting period of fruit trees requires farmers to operate in the open space between fruit trees making the orchard more compact and the water is not easy to infiltrate ii the abandoned orchards will not remove the existing fruit trees and other vegetation will be regrown on the land the growth of plant roots makes the soil begin to loosen the increase of plant litter also increases organic matter content in the soil and the clay content in the soil which improves its water retention ability therefore in the cultivated land of long term planting fruit trees soil compaction should be concerned studies have shown that there is no significant difference in soil moisture between abandoned and uncultivated land or that it is lower than cultivated land cao 2018 yang et al 2014 the reason for this difference may be related to the difference in the original planting type and sampling time of abandoned land abandoned farmland is more dry than cultivated land in use which can be explained by the similarity between annual vegetation coverage and natural vegetation water demand the reason why the soil in abandoned orchards is more humid than that in used orchards can be explained by the infiltration of soil water and the change of soil compaction manuel and sare 2018 the abandonment time of abandoned farmland will directly impact soil erosion vegetation coverage soil characteristics and environmental conditions arnaez et al 2015 which still needs further research and discussion 4 4 the effect of terrace construction on soil moisture terrace construction slows down the ground slope and increases the storage time of precipitation tarolli et al 2014 which increases the water storage efficiency of farmland in order to further analyze the influence of horizontal terrace construction on soil moisture this study compared the soil moisture values of horizontal terrace and slope farmland where wheat is grown in the same slope direction in the 0 1 m soil layer the soil moisture of terrace is higher than that of slope farmland fig 7 terrace construction significantly changed the surface morphology tarolli et al 2019 protected the soil from water erosion and reduced the loss of organic matter in the soil pabst et al 2016 and this morphological change also increased the residence time of precipitation in cultivated land wei et al 2016 which enabled more water to enter the soil to form soil water and provide water for the growth of plants there are differences in water storage efficiency among different terraces and horizontal terraces have higher water storage capacity than other types of terraces chen et al 2020a b in different soil layers of horizontal terraces the water storage capacity is also different compared with slope farmland in 0 0 1 m soil layer terrace the soil moisture increased by 4 39 indicating that the water storage capacity in the surface soil level terrace than slope farmland increased by 20 2 the difference in soil moisture between horizontal terraces and sloping fields in the 0 100 cm soil layer showed a decreasing trend and then increasing in the 0 9 1 m soil layer compared with the slope farmland the soil moisture of the terrace increased by 4 89 the increase rate is 23 5 indicating that the horizontal terrace for more than 30 years significantly increased the deep soil water compared with other research this work shows that the average soil moisture contents of 0 100 cm soil layer are 24 16 and 21 31 in terraced fields and sloping fields respectively table 3 the increase rate of soil moisture contents is 15 25 the results of this work are consistent with the results obtained in previous study on the impact of terrace construction in china on soil moisture chen et al 2020a b terracing changes the slope surface to a horizontal plane and the flow lines of the slope flow and the middle stream are continuously cut off thereby eliminating the redistribution of precipitation on the hill slopes rainfall is intercepted such that it can be infiltrated on the spot without causing run off and sediment flow xu et al 2013 groundwater is buried deep in the loess plateau and cannot be directly absorbed and used by plants therefore the interception of precipitation by terrace construction is extremely important for crop growth 4 5 suggestions on agricultural management in terrace construction area of loess plateau zhuanglang county is a rain fed agricultural area in the mature stage of crops the supply of water will directly affect the yield and quality of crops in areas where there is no significant difference in precipitation evaporation is an important factor affecting soil moisture so film mulching can reduce soil moisture evaporation and improve crop yield there are significant differences in the water consumption of different crops crop selection in arid areas lacking water resources should be adapted to local conditions promote the cultivation of drought resistant crops such as fruit trees and potatoes reduce water consuming crops such as corn and actively promote the intercropping planting mode to improve the utilization rate of soil moisture the terrace construction has changed the slope of farmland reduced soil erosion increased rainfall infiltration and thus significantly improved surface soil moisture wang et al 2017 for sloping farmland in the loess plateau surface water flow generated by precipitation will take away nutrients from the surface and cause further erosion and destruction of soil pimentel 2006 wei et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 according to the research results of this paper the soil moisture of farmland in horizontal terrace construction is higher than that in slope farmland so the terrace construction is extremely important and necessary in areas prone to soil erosion such as the loess plateau different terrace structures should be designed under different geographical conditions unreasonable terrace design not only does no affect soil and water conservation but also may aggravate gully erosion wen et al 2020 in the rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau which lacks irrigation water sources horizontal terraces are the most effective for improving land storage capacity and maintaining deep soil water chen et al 2017 therefore the construction of horizontal terraces should be promoted the improvement of soil moisture in abandoned lands cannot be ignored and studies have shown that abandoned lands even store more organic carbon than unabandoned lands cao 2020 the cost of new land reclamation is very high due to the lack of appropriate construction and regular maintenance the terrace after abandonment will lead to the risk of collapse and cause more serious soil erosion moreno de las heras et al 2019 therefore it is very necessary for the reuse of some abandoned lands most of the abandoned land is due to unmanned cultivation or mechanized farming is difficult to produce for some abandoned land with high mechanization difficulty some economic forests can be planted to realize its utilization for the abandoned land caused by insufficient labor force the land management right can be transferred to agricultural cooperatives or enterprises to realize the integration of abandoned land at the same time for long term use of farmland fallow should also be carried out in a planned way to improve soil properties and maintain soil fertility 5 conclusions based on the field observation of yangpota mountain this work carries out research on the influence of terrace construction on soil moisture in rain fed agricultural areas of the loess plateau the results show that the soil moisture of terraces is significantly higher than that of slope farmland and natural vegetation coverage areas especially in the soil layer of 0 10 cm and 90 100 cm the soil moisture of terraces increases by 4 39 and 4 89 respectively the construction of terraces is of great significance to the increase of soil moisture in surface and deep layers it is a key and effective measure for rainwater harvesting and soil water replenishment of cultivated land in arid areas there are differences in soil moisture of terraces with different slope directions in loess hilly areas the soil moisture of north slope is

8131,study region yangpota mountain in zhuanglang county loess plateau hilly area study focus in dry and degraded ecosystems water scarcity remains the most significant restriction to vegetation restoration and ecosystem rehabilitation plants cannot directly absorb groundwater in the loess plateau so soil moisture is very important for the growth of plants through the soil moisture observation system of yangpota mountain terraces we explore the influence mechanism of terrace construction on soil moisture new hydrological insights for the region the results show that the soil moisture of terraces is higher than that of slope farmland and natural vegetation surfaces in the 0 1 m soil depth range soil moisture was found to be 4 39 to 4 89 higher compared with slope farmland in different slope directions of the loess plateau the soil moisture on the northern slopes was higher than that on the southern slopes the soil moisture of abandoned terraces is higher than that of terraces in use also crop types and evaporation different were found to play an important role due to differences in root systems and water requirements keywords terracing soil moisture slope aspect abandonment loess plateau 1 introduction soil moisture content plays an important role in hydrology and vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions it controls the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of infiltration evaporation and vegetation penna et al 2013 chaney et al 2015 it means that soil moisture dynamics play an important role in vegetation growth and restoration josa et al 2012 liu and shao 2015 and play a key role in determining ecosystem structure and function stability especially in arid areas without or with little groundwater the soil moisture content is crucial in determining plant phenology and net primary productivity ferrante et al 2014 therefore using rainwater harvesting technology to improve soil moisture capacity in dryland especially in rain fed agricultural areas is very important to enhance ecosystem restoration and achieve neutral land degradation grainger 2015 however soil moisture varies greatly with time and space at different scales wang et al 2015 which is highly influenced by topography temperature land use vegetation type water demand and soil properties kassaye et al 2021 the change of micro topographical conditions may be substantial in hydrological processes the terrace construction reshapes the surface morphology and transforms natural slopes into steep slopes which can completely change the topography and improve the efficiency of rainwater collection therefore it can reduce soil erosion and increase soil stability on slopes alleviate drought severity and strengthen the ability of ecosystem rehabilitation ramos et al 2007 schuh et al 2017 xu et al 2016 and also increase crop yield kosmowski 2018 in many mountainous regions and hilly areas globally to stabilize slopes control soil and water erosion and increase crop yields terrace construction measures have been widely implemented wickama et al 2014 chen et al 2020a b the loess plateau is one of the regions with the most severe soil and water erosion in china for a long time the important issues faced by the ecological construction of the loess plateau are insufficient water resources unreasonable vegetation allocation and low ecosystem service functions the soil erosion of agricultural land especially slope farmland is a serious ecological problem it will lead to the increase of sediment content in rivers tang 2004 and lead to the decline of soil nutrient properties the devastation of agricultural ecological environment and the obstruction of agricultural economic growth lal 1993 the terrace construction can effectively improve this situation increase the storage time of rainwater on the ground increase the efficiency of rainwater collection increase the infiltration of soil water and then control soil erosion and water loss which benefits the ecosystem restoration wei et al 2019 mountainous regions account for 2 3 of china s land area and the rain fed farming regions account for 49 of arable land the terrace is the most important farmland model in rain fed agricultural areas which guarantees the food security of nearly 700 million people the change of soil moisture in the terrace is very important for terrace construction and agricultural management chen et al 2016 wei et al 2016 feng et al 2018 yang et al 2012 liancourt et al 2012 yu et al 2015 koster et al 2004 many scholars have studied the impact of terrace construction on soil moisture and have confirmed that different terrace measures have different effects on soil water use efficiency chen et al 2020a b due to terraces diversity and wide distribution soil moisture changes in rain fed agricultural areas are extremely sensitive comprehensive research on the influencing factors of soil moisture changes in typical rain fed areas and terraces in hilly loess areas plays a vital role in clarifying small scale agricultural management strategies and proposing specific management suggestions in order to explore the influence of horizontal terrace construction and vegetation slope direction and abandonment on soil moisture this paper takes the terrace construction area of yangpota mountain collapse in zhuanglang county a typical rain fed agricultural area in the loess plateau as the research area we collect the soil samples of terraces with different slope directions different crop types and different slope positions expecting to be clear 1 effects of terrace construction on soil moisture in the loess plateau 2 differences in soil moisture and its influencing factors in terraces with different slope directions 3 effects of different natural vegetation cover and crop types on soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area zhuanglang county 35 04 35 27 n 105 47 106 25 located in the western foot of liupan mountain and the eastern edge of loess plateau of west gansu is the first model terraced county in china and it s a typical representative of landform in the loess hilly and gully region fig 1 since the mid 1960s terrace construction has been carried out at present the terrace system in arid and semi arid areas with the longest time and the complete system has been built in china in 2020 an observation system was established in dazhuang town zhuanglang county on the loess plateau dazhuang town is a loess hilly area with complex terrain and its altitude is between 1 521 m qinglonggou village and 1 784 m wangshan village belonging to temperate continental monsoon climate the climate here is warm and humid and the accumulated temperature is low its annual average temperature varies from 7 4 to 7 9 the precipitation is mainly concentrated in summer and autumn the annual rainfall is 500 550 mm the frost free period is as long as 159 days and the average annual sunshine time is as high as 2 179 h the main soil type in zhuanglang county is loess and the main crop types are wheat corn and potato the economic crops are rape flax and apple which have been developed in zhuanglang county in recent years before hanging fruit apples often intercrop with potatoes the source of water mainly depends on natural rainfall 2 2 monitoring system experimental design the sampling area is yangpota mountain dazhuang town zhuanglang county gansu province the terrace reclamation period is more than 30 years in order to avoid the impact of other meteorological factors on soil moisture the sampling period is concentrated on 3 october 2020 and the weather is cloudy in order to study the influence of slope on soil moisture we selected the north northwest south and southeast slopes of the yangpota mountain in dazhuang village dazhuang town for sampling in order to clarify the impact of terrace construction on soil moisture we collected soil samples from slope farms and terraces in lianwang village dazhuang town at the same time soil samples of sloping fields covered by different natural vegetation types were also collected to compare the soil moisture of terraces and natural sloping fields there are various types of agricultural planting in the study area mainly apple trees corn and wheat and there are also many types of interplanting such as apple trees vegetables apple trees wheat etc eight types of farmland soils were collected including apple trees vegetables corn buckwheat beans potatoes apple bean interplanting and apple potato interplanting in order to explore the impact of abandonment on soil moisture soil samples from abandoned terraced fields on the same slope in lianwang village were collected a soil depth of 1 0 m would represent the extent of vertical root distribution of herbaceous plants and crops and would also reflect the main root distribution of the forest han et al 2017 by using a cutting ring soil samples are taken for profile depth ranges of 0 0 1 m 0 1 0 2 m 0 2 0 3 m 0 3 0 4 m 0 4 0 5 m 0 5 0 6 m 0 6 0 7 m 0 7 0 8 m 0 8 0 9 m and 0 9 1 0 m a total of 840 samples are collected including 480 samples on the north slope 140 samples on the northwest slope 100 samples on the south slope and 110 samples on the southeast slope 2 3 experimental analysis each soil sample is placed in an aluminum box and seal it with tape after returning to the laboratory measure the weight of each aluminum box with moist soil m then uncover the lid of the aluminum box and put it in the oven with 105 c for 24 h when the moisture in the soil is completely dried the weight of the aluminum box containing the dry soil is measured ms the calculation formula of soil moisture is as follows soil moisture m ms ms 100 3 results and analysis 3 1 soil moisture characteristics of terraced fields with different slope directions different slope terraces are affected by light time rainfall and evaporation and soil moisture is significantly different the soil moisture values in the study area are between 15 99 and 32 56 and there are certain differences in different slope directions on the whole the soil moisture showed as follow northwest slope north slope southeast slope south slope the maximum value appeared the northwest slope and the minimum appeared on the south slope in which the average soil moisture on the northwest slope was 5 49 higher than that on the south slope fig 2 in the same natural vegetation or crop type in different slope directions soil moisture also has obvious differences it can be seen from fig 3 that except for the potato planting terraces on the northwest slope the soil moisture characteristics of the other sampling points showed a vertical feature of decreasing fluctuations the soil moisture of the southern slope grassland is higher than that of the northern slope grassland and the difference is the largest in the 0 0 1 m soil layer with a difference of 4 88 in the 0 0 4 m soil layer the soil moisture decreased in north slope south slope northwest slope southeast slope in the 0 8 1 m soil layer the soil moisture decreased in north slope northwest slope south slope southeast slope in potato planting land 0 10 cm soil moisture in the south slope is slightly higher than the northwest slope below 10 cm soil layer soil moisture in the northwest slope is significantly higher than the south slope fig 3 3 2 soil moisture characteristics of different crop types the differences in root depth and root length density of different crops will lead to different water use efficiency showing different soil moisture characteristics except for potato planting land and fruit potato intercropping land the soil moisture of other crop types showed a decreasing vertical distribution fig 4 potato planting land and fruit potato intercropping land showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing the soil moisture in 0 0 1 m soil layer of all crop types is greater than other soil layers the largest difference between surface soil moisture 0 0 1 m and deep soil moisture 0 9 1 m is vegetable planting land 11 26 and the smallest difference is potato planting land 0 7 in the whole soil profile the soil moisture of different crops is significantly different potato 26 79 apple 24 33 legume 23 22 fruit tree potato 22 73 vegetable 22 11 maize 21 35 buckwheat 20 69 fruit tree legume 20 18 in 0 0 4 m soil layer soil moisture content of potato planting land 29 71 is the highest followed by legume planting land 28 36 fruit soybean intercropping land 27 79 vegetable planting land 27 36 apple native land 27 02 corn planting land 26 89 fruit potato intercropping land 23 54 wheat planting land 23 49 in 0 4 1 m deep soil the soil moisture of potato field 26 56 is significantly higher than that of other crop types and the crop type with the lowest deep soil moisture is corn 3 3 soil moisture characteristics of abandoned terraces and terraces due to unreasonable agricultural management measures resulting in reduced soil fertility or insufficient rural lab many terraces have been abandoned in the loess plateau it can be seen from fig 5 a that the average soil moisture of the 0 100 cm soil layer of the abandoned terraces is increased by 3 25 compared with the terraces in use the most obvious increase in soil moisture on the vertical gradient is the surface soil layer of 0 20 cm and the soil layer of 70 100 cm in the soil layer of 20 40 cm the difference in soil moisture between abandoned terraces and terraces in use becomes smaller and shows the same changing trend the difference in soil moisture below the 40 cm soil layer shows the trend gradually increases first and then slightly decreases the reason for the small difference in soil moisture between abandoned terraces and non abandoned terraces in the soil layer of 20 40 cm may be because shallow roots of the grass plants that grow after the abandonment and there is no obvious loosening effect on the soil layer below 20 cm the increase in soil moisture in the abandoned terraces deep soil may be because most of the apple trees on the abandoned farmland have died and the deep soil water is no longer absorbed and utilized thereby increasing the soil moisture the box represents 25 75 percentile and the line in the box represents the median 50 percentile indicating the fifth and 95th percentiles 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of slope direction on soil moisture in terraces slope direction mainly affects the different variation characteristics of soil moisture through surface temperature soil temperature and precipitation according to the comparison of soil moisture in different slope directions in the sampling area table 1 in the sampling area the soil moisture in the north slope of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 5 m soil layers is higher in the south slope the spatial variability of surface soil moisture depends on the changes of environmental factors such as precipitation and evaporation martínez murillo et al 2017 this difference in solar radiation between north and south slopes makes it present this result in 0 5 1 m deep soil the difference in soil moisture in different regions is very small mainly because the soil moisture in this layer is less affected by evaporation and more affected by soil infiltration and soil water holding capacity yong et al 2020 in the northern hemisphere the southern slope is a sunny slope and the light time and the amount of solar radiation received are greater than those of the northern slope in a local small area the precipitation does not have much difference at this time the evaporation plays an absolute leading role in the change of soil moisture therefore more fruit trees are planted in the south slope and more attention should be paid to the water retention of fruit trees on the southern slope in agricultural management light plays an extremely important role in apple an economic crop therefore there are more fruit trees planted in the south slope and more attention should be paid to the water retention of fruit trees on the southern slope in agricultural management in the southern hemisphere the corresponding phenomenon is that there is less solar radiation interception and higher soil moisture on the south slope galicia et al 1999 table 2 4 2 the effect of different land use types on soil moisture differences in land use vegetation coverage and management methods will affect soil moisture james et al 2003 gómez et al 2011 abazi et al 2013 and the difference in the absorption capacity of different crop roots is an important factor to control the dynamic changes of soil moisture yang et al 2014 this work shows that the soil moisture of farmland terraces is higher than that of natural woodland and grassland fig 5 the forest and grass covered areas in the loess hilly region are natural slopes with a certain slope and it is difficult for precipitation to accumulate on the surface thereby reducing infiltration after the construction of terraces the slope of the farmland s surface has slowed down the suspension time of rainfall has increased and the infiltration has increased lü et al 2009 chen et al 2020a b in addition the vegetation coverage of natural woodland is relatively large and the interception of precipitation by the leaf canopy reduces the amount of water accumulated on the surface woody plants always consume more water through evapotranspiration than cultivated crops so the soil moisture of natural forest land is lower than that of farmland jia et al 2017 therefore the soil moisture of farmland is significantly higher than that of natural vegetation coverage area mainly due to the comprehensive impact of vegetation type and terrace construction compared with the natural vegetation coverage area the soil moisture under different farmland crop types has more obvious differences potatoes have the highest soil moisture among all land use types the sampling season is the potato harvest season in comparing of single crop types the soil moisture of corn wheat and buckwheat is the lowest indicating that the growth of these three crops needs to consume more soil moisture comparing the intercropping of potatoes and apple trees legumes and legumes between apple trees it can be found that the soil moisture of intercropping is lower than that of monoculture compared with single planting potato soil moisture of apple tree intercropping potato decreased by 4 06 compared with single planting beans soil moisture of apple tree intercropping beans decreased by 3 04 this is because the intercropping makes the roots of different crops occupy different soil space and soil depth which improves the ability of plants to absorb and utilize water in each soil layer and the intercropping mode can improve the utilization rate of soil moisture fig 6 4 3 the effect of abandonment on soil moisture in terraces due to the migration of labour caused by urbanization land fertility decline or inability to achieve mechanization many farmland is abandoned deng et al 2013 romero díaz et al 2017 lizaga et al 2019 comparing the soil moisture of abandoned terraces and unabandoned terraces on the same slope before abandoned cultivation the planting type of terrace was apple tree due to the lack of agricultural management a large number of weeds grow the types of herbs grown include setaria viridis l beauv agropyron cristatum linn gaertn and so on a general rule is found the soil moisture of abandoned terraces is higher than that of unabandoned terraces fig 5 which may be mainly due to two reasons i the agricultural management mode of ploughing after fruit planting is not impossible and the weeds in the fruit tree rows are removed agricultural management during the growth and fruiting period of fruit trees requires farmers to operate in the open space between fruit trees making the orchard more compact and the water is not easy to infiltrate ii the abandoned orchards will not remove the existing fruit trees and other vegetation will be regrown on the land the growth of plant roots makes the soil begin to loosen the increase of plant litter also increases organic matter content in the soil and the clay content in the soil which improves its water retention ability therefore in the cultivated land of long term planting fruit trees soil compaction should be concerned studies have shown that there is no significant difference in soil moisture between abandoned and uncultivated land or that it is lower than cultivated land cao 2018 yang et al 2014 the reason for this difference may be related to the difference in the original planting type and sampling time of abandoned land abandoned farmland is more dry than cultivated land in use which can be explained by the similarity between annual vegetation coverage and natural vegetation water demand the reason why the soil in abandoned orchards is more humid than that in used orchards can be explained by the infiltration of soil water and the change of soil compaction manuel and sare 2018 the abandonment time of abandoned farmland will directly impact soil erosion vegetation coverage soil characteristics and environmental conditions arnaez et al 2015 which still needs further research and discussion 4 4 the effect of terrace construction on soil moisture terrace construction slows down the ground slope and increases the storage time of precipitation tarolli et al 2014 which increases the water storage efficiency of farmland in order to further analyze the influence of horizontal terrace construction on soil moisture this study compared the soil moisture values of horizontal terrace and slope farmland where wheat is grown in the same slope direction in the 0 1 m soil layer the soil moisture of terrace is higher than that of slope farmland fig 7 terrace construction significantly changed the surface morphology tarolli et al 2019 protected the soil from water erosion and reduced the loss of organic matter in the soil pabst et al 2016 and this morphological change also increased the residence time of precipitation in cultivated land wei et al 2016 which enabled more water to enter the soil to form soil water and provide water for the growth of plants there are differences in

than 30 years significantly increased the deep soil water compared with other research this work shows that the average soil moisture contents of 0 100 cm soil layer are 24 16 and 21 31 in terraced fields and sloping fields respectively table 3 the increase rate of soil moisture contents is 15 25 the results of this work are consistent with the results obtained in previous study on the impact of

8132,study area northeast china plain necp and north china plain ncp study focus groundwater resources in the northern plains of china are the primary source of domestic and irrigation water and long term overexploitation may cause groundwater depletion and deterioration in these plains in this study based on observations of groundwater depth i e the depth of phreatic water below the land surface from 2000 to 2019 in the necp and ncp the spatial distribution characteristics and long range correlation lrc of the regional groundwater depth are analyzed using the geostatistical method and fractal theory new hydrological insights in terms of the spatial distribution of groundwater depth an overall trend of decline and then recovery from 2000 to 2019 can be observed in the necp indicating that the persistent decline of groundwater depth is not conspicuous while there is a persistent decline of groundwater depth in the ncp regarding the lrc of groundwater depth the hurst exponents calculated using the r s analysis demonstrate the persistence of groundwater depth variation in the necp and positive persistence of groundwater depth decline in the ncp the hurst exponent reveals that the groundwater depth in the necp will likely remain stable in the future while the groundwater depth in most areas of the ncp may continue to decline if the dominant factors remain unchanged moreover the dynamic change in the groundwater depth of the necp may be mainly affected by natural structural factors while anthropogenic factors may trigger that response in the ncp keywords groundwater depth temporal and spatial variation geostatistics fractal theory northeast and north china plains 1 introduction groundwater provides a critical component of freshwater that is necessary to sustain society the environment and the economy e g aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 china has 18 of the world s total population and 5 7 of its global freshwater resources and therefore china relies heavily on groundwater resources for daily production and domestic water use qiu 2010 long term groundwater exploitation can disrupt the balance between the recharge and discharge of groundwater in china where the rational exploitation of groundwater remains a hot and practical research topic gorelick and zheng 2015 the input and output of groundwater cause dynamic changes in groundwater quantity and quality groundwater dynamics including groundwater level depth water chemistry storage flow velocity and other characteristics can be recorded by a hydrologic time series considering relevant statistical characteristics li and zhang 2007 this study focuses on the dynamics of groundwater depth i e the depth of phreatic water below the land surface groundwater depth mentioned in this article all refer to the depth of phreatic water below the land surface and its long range correlation lrc for time series in china to provide the scientific basis for regional scale groundwater management the northeast china plain necp and the north china plain ncp are two of the four great plains of china each of which contains a vast territory and a large population groundwater in both plains has been exploited for decades resulting in long term changes in groundwater depth thereby affecting groundwater resource evolution feng et al 2013 hu et al 2005 zhao et al 2019 however the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater in the necp and ncp their complex dynamics and patterns of change and the lrc all remain obscure jia et al 2019 the dynamics of groundwater depth change can directly affect residential industrial and agricultural water use wang et al 2007 sustainable groundwater exploration has become an urgent issue for managing water resources in the necp and ncp li and hou 2020 fractal theory which attempts to interpret complex processes by searching for the simple underlying process may be useful in exploring the complex dynamics of groundwater depth variation research on fractal behaviors began with hurst s dam storage investigations hurst 1951 mandelbrot 1967 first explicitly proposed fractal theory and expanded it it has since been applied in many fields mandelbrot and van ness 1968 mandelbrot and wallis 1968 many scholars have further deepened the content of fractal theory and applied it successfully habib et al 2017 li and zhang 2007 liu and molz 1997 rakhshandehroo and amiri 2012 yu et al 2016 groundwater depth dynamics with fractal characteristics have also been demonstrated for example zhang and schilling 2004 found temporal scaling in a time series of groundwater level fluctuations with spatially varied fractal dimension zhang and yang 2010 noted that groundwater levels might fluctuate as a temporal fractal little and bloomfield 2010 provided robust evidence of random fractal scaling of groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers joelson et al 2016 demonstrated that fluctuations in groundwater levels exhibit fractal scaling and persistent behavior due to the rainfall process sun et al 2019 investigated the fractal scaling behavior of a groundwater system affected by plant water use and river stage fluctuations in the riparian zone although there have been many efforts in fractal theory over several decades the application of the theory is relatively rare in exploring the temporal and spatial changes in groundwater depth dynamics in the mainland china plains this study analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater depth and its dynamic patterns in the necp and ncp the most important areas in china relying on groundwater from 2000 to 2019 using the geostatistical approach and fractal theory scientific predictions were also made for changes in the groundwater depth by the lrc approach the rest of this presentation is organized as follows first the groundwater depth data were collected and collated from groundwater monitoring stations in the necp and ncp second the geostatistical approach and fractal theory were applied to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics and dynamic changes in groundwater depth third the lrc of groundwater depth changes which may be used to predict the variable tendency of groundwater depth for the study area was systematically analyzed for both the necp and ncp finally discussions on the validation of the hurst exponent for predicting the lrc of groundwater depth and its underlying factors for induced changes in groundwater depth were implemented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the necp covers the southern part of heilongjiang western central jilin eastern part of inner mongolia and most of liaoning and consists mainly of three parts the songnen plain liaohe plain in the south and sanjiang plain in the northeast zhang 2004 fig 1 the necp has a temperate continental semiarid monsoon climate with windy and dry winters and springs warm and relatively wet summers and cool autumns huang and xu 2016 in recent years as the population and the area of arable land in the necp have continued to increase groundwater has become an essential resource for agricultural industrial and domestic water use overexploitation of groundwater has occurred in many areas of the necp zhong et al 2018 the ncp is the general name of the three principal basins in china namely the yellow river basin the huaihe river basin and the haihe river basin fig 1 the ncp belongs to the northern part of china including all the plains of hebei beijing and tianjin as well as the northern plains of shandong and henan where rich soils are formed by the sediments of the yellow river huaihe river and haihe river providing superior conditions for agricultural development liu et al 2018 the ncp s mature agricultural system feeds 400 million people and is one of the most densely populated areas in the world where the high demand for water resources has forced an increased amount of groundwater extraction kang and eltahir 2018 in recent years the groundwater of the ncp has experienced long term overexploitation resulting in a groundwater level drop of up to 1 m a in some areas liang et al 2016 2 2 data collection the groundwater monitoring data used were obtained from the information center of the ministry of water resources because the degree of exploitation and utilization of groundwater and climatic conditions have significantly changed over the last two decades compared with those in the last century liu et al 2001 we select the study period from january 1 2000 to december 31 2019 with a total time of 20 years groundwater extraction and precipitation data are collected from the water resources bulletin http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb szygb annual groundwater extraction and precipitation variation for the necp and ncp from 2000 to 2019 are visually presented in fig 2 four major aquifers exist in the north china plain and have been studied to assess and achieve sustainability of groundwater resources foster et al 2004 while the subject of this study is phreatic water therefore over 1200 groundwater monitoring stations which are located in the unconfined aquifer shown by the dots in fig 1 located in the necp and ncp are collected and collated these stations record the monthly groundwater depth over the past 20 years groundwater has been monitored by many manual observation methods continuous observation at some stations could be temporarily paused for one or several months and few stations are used in the beginning and are then out of service due to station network adjustment the groundwater depths of the lack of measurement area were interpolated to be analyzed systematically for the missing or outlier measurements due to the failure of groundwater monitoring stations or other unexpected reasons during a short period the newton interpolation method is used to interpolate the groundwater depth time series werner 1984 the overall situation of the data from groundwater monitoring stations is shown in table 1 and the groundwater depth in some areas is mainly obtained through spatial interpolation 2 3 methodology in this paper the spatial variability and correlation of groundwater depth in the necp and ncp are studied using geostatistical methods and performed in arcgis v10 3 the r s analysis method based on fractal theory is used to calculate the hurst exponent of the groundwater depth time series to analyze the temporal changes in groundwater and the lrc 2 3 1 geostatistical methods geostatistical methods are increasingly used in the fields of hydrology and ecology bodrud doza et al 2016 pebesma and de kwaadsteniet 1997 and have been introduced as management and decision tools by many researchers to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of groundwater depth fluctuations ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 delhomme 1979 the basic tools of geostatistical methods are semivariogram functions and kriging interpolation ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 in this paper the spatial variability of the groundwater depth in the study area is studied quantitatively using the above two tools the semivariogram function reflects the spatial relation between the sampling point and its adjacent sampling point and this work quantitatively evaluates the spatial variability of each monitoring point in the study area based on its semivariogram parameters the generalized formula of semivariogram function is as follows bilonick 1991 goovaerts 1997 kitanidis 1997 1 r h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where r h is the semivariogram function z x is a regionalized random variable satisfying the second order stationary assumption h is a step size i e the distance between ordered data z xi is the sample value at the spatial point xi and n h is the total number of sample point pairs at the separation distance h to quantitatively describe the variation characteristics of the study area it is necessary to define the theoretical model of its semivariogram the most commonly used models are spherical exponential gaussian and pure nugget effects bilonick 1991 by comparison the semivariogram function of groundwater depth in the necp can be described by the following exponential model kitanidis 1997 2 r h 0 h 0 c 0 c 1 e h a h 0 where c 0 is the nugget which refers to the value of the semivariogram function due to the measurement error and spatial variation when two sampling points are very close c 0 c is the sill a constant where the distance between sampling points increases by h when the semivariogram reaches a relatively stable value a is the range referring to the distance between the sampling point when the semivariogram reaches the sill from the nugget which defines the range of spatial correlation and c is the partial sill i e difference between the sill and nugget the semivariogram function of groundwater depth in the ncp can be sufficiently fitted with the spherical model the fitting diagram of the semivariogram function is shown in fig 3 and its generalized formula is 3 r h 0 h 0 c 0 c 3 h 2 a h 3 2 a 3 0 h a c 0 c 1 e h a h a both the nugget and the sill may be used to describe the degree of spatial variability of groundwater depths the nugget represents the variation caused by random factors on a small scale and the sill reflects the large scale variation caused by structural factors the ratio of nugget to sill may reflect the strength of the spatial correlation of groundwater depths if this ratio is 25 the system is strongly correlated in space if the ratio is between 25 and 75 the system is moderately correlated in space and if the ratio is 75 the system is slightly correlated in space wallace et al 2000 this ratio indicates the proportion of spatial variability caused by the random component to the total variability of the system the higher the ratio is the smaller the spatial correlation is and the more apparent spatial variability is caused by random factors a ratio close to 1 indicates that the variable exhibits constant variability at small scales delbari et al 2016 dem information as an auxiliary variable in groundwater depth interpolation is an effective method desbarats et al 2002 peeters et al 2010 we firstly used co kriging with dem to interpolate the groundwater depth after the comparison between co kriging and ordinary kriging ok in the necp and ncp the expected improvement of interpolation using co kriging did not arise because of the weak correlation between flat terrain and the uneven groundwater depth therefore in this paper the ok interpolation is used to interpolate the groundwater depth in the study area and plot the groundwater depth contour map the results of ok interpolation are more proficient when the data variables under training follow a normal distribution the kolmogorov smirnov single sample test k s test was conducted to check whether the data were normally or log normally distributed if the groundwater depth datasets conformed to a log normal distribution logarithmic transformation was performed to normalize the data descriptive statistics parameters were examined such as the median mean coefficient of variation kurtosis and skewness trend analysis was carried out to determine whether the dataset followed any particular trend rather than assuming that the mean groundwater depth is constant over the entire domain we recognize that it may contain a spatial trend which is appropriately interpolated by the ok procedure 2 3 2 r s analysis r s analysis is usually used to analyze the fractal characteristics and the lrc of a time series and was initially proposed by british hydrologist hurst 1951 when analyzing the hydrological data of the nile there are already several methods available to calculate the hurst exponent kendziorski et al 1999 sánchez granero et al 2008 taqqu et al 1995 among them r s analysis is widely used to calculate the hurst exponent which can well reveal the lrc of the time series of groundwater depth and its principle is briefly described as follows mandelbrot and wallis 1969 considering the time series x t for any positive integer τ 1 the mean value series is defined as 4 x τ 1 τ t 1 τ x t τ 1 2 t where t is the number of data points in x t the cumulative deviation x t τ is calculated as 5 x t τ u 1 t x u x τ 1 t τ the extreme deviation r τ is calculated as 6 r τ max 1 t τ x t τ min 1 t τ x t τ τ 1 2 t the standard deviation s τ is calculated as 7 s τ 1 τ t 1 τ x u x τ 2 1 2 τ 1 2 t when analyzing the statistical rule of r τ s τ r s hurst discovered the following relational expression 8 r s τ 2 h where h is the hurst exponent and eq 8 may be used to identify the persistence embedded in the time series apparently h is given by the slope coefficient of r s versus τ 2 according to τ r s h can be obtained by the least squares method in a log log grid hurst once demonstrated that if x t is an independently random series with limited variance the exponent h 0 5 and h 0 h 1 is dependent on an incidence function d t 9 d t 2 2 h 1 1 the value of h 0 5 indicates a random process for h 0 5 the process has positive persistence characteristics and the future trend of the time series will be consistent with the historical data when h 0 5 the process has anti persistence characteristics and the future trend of the time series will be opposite to the past data two aspects need to be considered when using r s analysis to calculate the hurst exponent of a groundwater depth time series first the presence of periodic and trend terms in the time series exerts a considerable influence on the calculation of the hurst exponent hence the spectral analysis series is needed to eliminate the periodic and trend terms influence in the time series before calculating hurst taqqu and teverovsky 1997 second how long the time series of the calculated hurst exponent is stable should be explored and the stability of the hurst exponent affects the accuracy of lrc the following two sets of experiments are designed in this study to address the second issue in the first experiment the hurst exponent is calculated using ten sets of random numbers with undetermined sizes of the sample that conform to the normal distribution and uniform distribution the hurst exponent calculated from a large number of random numbers should be close to 0 5 the greater the number of samples is the closer the calculated hurst exponent is to 0 5 this principle sequentially increases the number of samples of random numbers and the hurst exponent can calculated in the second experiment the hurst exponent is calculated using the preprocessed groundwater depth time series the length of the time series is increased sequentially to calculate the corresponding hurst exponents for different samples five monitoring stations in the necp and five monitoring stations in the ncp are selected in this experiment and the locations of the monitoring stations are shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial characteristics of groundwater depth 3 1 1 necp the k s single sample test shows that the groundwater depth data do not follow a normal distribution however after the logarithmic conversion of the groundwater depth the kurtosis and skewness of the resultant data are close to 0 which follows the normal distribution and can be used for geostatistical analysis then the statistics of the data are summarized in table 2 and the median and mean groundwater depths tend to increase and then decrease over time this pattern described the overall trend of increasing and then decreasing groundwater depths in the necp from 2000 to 2019 fig 4 shows the temporal evolution of the average groundwater depth in the necp in the past two decades there have been several turning points in the fluctuation of groundwater depth in the necp to explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of groundwater depth we select the turning points in fig 4 representing the starting and ending years and the turning years of the groundwater depth fluctuation which are 2000 2002 2006 2008 2014 and 2019 in the necp the exponential semivariogram function was found to be more accurate and appropriate fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of groundwater depths in the necp after using ok interpolation as shown in fig 5 the spatial distribution of groundwater depths in the necp is shallower in the north and south and deeper in the middle showing tremendous regional variability the groundwater depth first increases and then decreases although there was a rebound trend in the groundwater depth until 2019 it could not return to the depth presented in 2000 this study uses the parameters of the semivariogram to analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of groundwater depth autocorrelations as shown in fig 6 the sill c 0 c of the necp is smaller than that of the ncp but the ratio of the nugget to the sill c 0 c 0 c is larger which indicates that the necp has a weaker spatial correlation the parameters related to the semivariogram of the groundwater depth at the groundwater monitoring stations in the necp are shown in fig 6a including the nugget c 0 the sill c 0 c the ratio of the nugget to the sill c 0 c 0 c and the range a it is noteworthy that c 0 and c 0 c are considered to reflect the factors affecting the groundwater depth in particular c 0 captures the influence of small scale random factors including small scale human factors such as local irrigation and diversion and climatic factors such as local heavy precipitation c 0 c captures the influence of large scale structural factors including climate topography and geology and large scale human factors such as large scale irrigation and diversion fig 6a shows that the temporal evolution of the c 0 c 0 c value was between 38 and 63 during 2000 2008 indicating that the spatial correlation between the regions gradually decreased as shown in the first three graphs of fig 5 at 2000 2004 and 2006 the groundwater depth in some areas of the necp such as northeastern heilongjiang and the northern part of jilin has increased significantly while the groundwater depth in the remaining areas has not changed significantly which confirms the weakening spatial correlation regarding the influencing factors of the groundwater depth the value of c 0 remained at a low level while the value of c 0 c 0 c remained at a medium level indicating that the large scale structural factors mainly influenced the groundwater depth variation in this period large scale human activities such as the large scale exploitation of groundwater occurred during this period and groundwater extraction was also increased fig 2a this phenomenon was also consistent with feng et al 2018 after 2010 the three parameters c 0 c 0 c and c 0 c 0 c exhibit relatively synchronous fluctuations c 0 c 0 c fluctuates between 50 and 63 indicating a moderate spatial correlation in the groundwater depth in different areas of the necp and some areas may be subject to local variations due to random factors the three groundwater depth graphs in 2011 2014 and 2019 plotted in fig 5 show that not all areas of the necp groundwater depth exhibit an overall increase or decrease as the groundwater depth changes in different regions are inconsistent for provincial areas such as heilongjiang inner mongolia and jilin some regions with groundwater gradually become shallower while regions with deep groundwater evolve deeper c 0 and c 0 c also reflect that since 2009 the groundwater depth in the necp may have been simultaneously influenced by structural factors i e climate topography and geology and anthropogenic factors i e large scale mining and irrigation bian et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that the reader may have doubts about the reliability of the results of ok interpolation the interpolation results can be verified by considering the separated distance between each pair of monitoring stations the minimum range a and the resolution of the ok interpolation results since the groundwater monitoring stations in the necp collected in this study are densely distributed the average separated distance 16 033 m is far less than the minimum range a approximately 100 000 m even though the range a decreases each year furthermore the resolution of the results of ok interpolation in the necp is 10 000 m which is less than the minimum range a so the groundwater depth distribution obtained by ok interpolation can be reliably used for analysis herein 3 1 2 ncp fig 4 clearly shows the overall increasing trend of the groundwater depth in the ncp over the past two decades similarly the typical turning years of 2000 2003 2005 2011 2016 and 2019 are selected to analyze dynamic changes in the groundwater depth in the ncp statistics of the typical year groundwater depth at groundwater monitoring stations in the ncp are listed in table 2 the median and mean groundwater depths increased continuously over time showing a continuous increase in the groundwater depth from 2000 2019 similar to the necp the k s single sample test reveals that the groundwater depth data do not follow the normal distribution but the logarithmically transformed groundwater depth follows the normal distribution based on ok interpolation fig 7 shows that the groundwater depth in the ncp is deeper in the northwest and shallower in the south the pattern of groundwater variation is inconsistent across provincial regions and even the groundwater variation on the same scale within the same province is not identical somewhere for example in the western parts of hebei the groundwater depth was much more extensive and showed a cone of depression where the cone of depression continued to expand and the groundwater depth continued to increase in contrast the groundwater depth located in the eastern parts of hebei annually decreased compared to hebei the groundwater depth in shandong which is adjacent to hebei is less variable similarly the semivariogram function was used to analyze the spatial correlation of the regions in the ncp fig 6b shows that the c 0 c 0 c ratio was greater than 25 and gradually approached 25 during 2000 2005 indicating a tendency to shift from moderate to strong spatial correlation of the groundwater depth in the ncp at the same time the c 0 c value remains at a moderate level while the c 0 value remains at a low level indicating that the groundwater in each region of the ncp basically shows an overall change as shown in fig 7 the spatial correlation of groundwater changes shows an increase in the first three graphs at 2000 2003 and 2005 as the cone of depression continued to expand in the western part of the ncp and the groundwater rebounded in the southern part of the ncp the good overall groundwater depth variation indicates that the change in groundwater depth during this period was mainly due to the combination of structural factors and local level human factors cao et al 2013 since 2016 c 0 c 0 c tended to decrease and then increase but remained larger than 25 indicating a strong correlation between the groundwater depth in different regions of the ncp i e the groundwater depth of the ncp shows an overall change the three groundwater depth graphs in 2011 2016 and 2019 plotted in fig 7 show that the groundwater change was overall minor confirming the result of the strong spatial correlation in addition the c 0 value remains at a very low level however the c 0 c value remains at a high level indicating that the ncp s groundwater depth variation is mainly influenced by structural factors i e climate topography and geology and human factors i e large scale irrigation and mining zhai et al 2005 the groundwater monitoring stations in the ncp are densely distributed and the average separated distance 12 500 m is far less than the minimum range a approximately 400 000 m furthermore the resolution of the results of ok interpolation in the ncp is 8000 m which is less than the minimum range a so the groundwater depth distribution obtained by ok interpolation can be reliably used for analysis herein 3 2 long range correlation of groundwater depth in study areas 3 2 1 hurst exponent varied by sample size as mentioned above two sets of experiments were performed to explore the time length for the time series needed for the hurst exponent to remain stable in experiment i the value of hurst exponent around 0 5 with up and down beating when the number of random samples was less than 110 and then reached a stable value fig 8 a and b in experiment ii the variation in the hurst exponent by the sample number for ten selected groundwater monitoring stations fig 8c and d tended to be stable when the number of samples was larger than 130 consequently the minimum number of samples for calculating the hurst exponent was greater than 130 considering the hurst exponent s stability this study uses a sliding time series to calculate the hurst exponent by taking 144 monthly groundwater depth data point from the necp and ncp as the length of the time series based on the existing groundwater depth data measured from 2000 to 2019 sliding is performed with a sequence of 12 years and a step length of 1 year specifically for a particular groundwater monitoring station the first hurst exponent is calculated based on the groundwater depth time series from 2000 to 2011 and the second hurst exponent is calculated based on the groundwater depth time series from 2001 to 2012 and so on finally each groundwater monitoring station can provide a set of hurst exponent sequences of length 9 3 2 2 the lrc analysis of the necp fig 9 shows the resultant contour map of the hurst exponent of the groundwater depth time series in the necp which mainly contains the four provincial administrative regions heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia and liaoning overall the hurst exponent in the necp is more significant than 0 5 for all nine time periods showing positive persistence characteristics however the magnitude of the hurst exponent varies between regions showing varying degrees of the lrc generally the larger the hurst exponent is the stronger the memory is the longer it will remember the previous values and the more consistent the ability to maintain the previous change trend habib 2020 based on the type of changes in the hurst exponent we can roughly divide the necp into three regions including the region where the hurst exponent increases such as the northeastern and central parts of heilongjiang and the central part of jilin the region where the hurst exponent remains basically unchanged such as the southern part of heilongjiang liaoning and most of inner mongolia and the region where the hurst exponent decreases such as the western part of heilongjiang for the sliding hurst exponent an increase in the hurst exponent indicates that the time series better remember the later groundwater depth trends while a decrease in the hurst exponent indicates that the time series better remember the earlier groundwater depth trends accordingly combined with the spatial distribution of groundwater depths in the necp in fig 5 we can roughly determine that for the northeastern part of heilongjiang and the central part of jilin groundwater is expected to continue to maintain a decreasing trend in the coming period in contrast groundwater in the central part of heilongjiang may maintain a continuous rebounding trend for the southern part of heilongjiang groundwater in most of liaoning and inner mongolia continues to fluctuate up and down with no apparent trend for the western part of heilongjiang groundwater may show a slight downward trend in the coming period 3 2 3 the lrc analysis of the ncp fig 10 shows the hurst exponent contour map of the ncp the ncp covers seven chinese provincial administrative divisions beijing tianjin shandong hebei henan jiangsu and anhui overall the hurst exponent of the ncp is also greater than 0 5 in all nine time periods showing positive persistence characteristics similar to the necp the ncp is divided into three parts according to the type of hurst exponent change the region with an increasing hurst exponent such as the northern part of beijing the southern part of hebei and the southern part of henan the region has an essentially unchanged hurst exponent such as that in the northwestern part of henan and the central and southern parts of shandong the region with a decreasing hurst exponent such as the northern part of tianjin the southern part of jiangsu and the southern part of anhui combined with the spatial distribution of groundwater depth in the ncp in fig 7 we can roughly determine that for the northern area of beijing the southern area of hebei and the southern and northwestern areas of henan the groundwater depth will continue to maintain an increasing trend for some time in the future due to overexploitation in contrast the groundwater depth in the south central area of shandong and most of the northern areas of tianjin will continue to fluctuate up and down with no apparent trend the groundwater in the southern part of jiangsu and the southern part of anhui may show a weak rebound trend in the coming period 4 discussion 4 1 validation of hurst exponent for lrc prediction it is a common practice to use the hurst exponent to predict the lrc of hydrological systems such as precipitation evaporation cycles groundwater fluctuations and river runoff changes bierkens and van den hurk 2007 joelson et al 2016 markonis et al 2018 xu et al 2008 as stated in tong et al 2018 when the change in ndvi is predicted with the hurst exponent it is believed that a value of hurst over 0 5 indicates that the past trend is continuing and a value below 0 5 indicates that the past trend is reversing however there are few reports on the application of the hurst exponent to the lrc prediction of groundwater depth changes in large scale plain areas consequently many researchers may be concerned whether the prospective variation in groundwater depth in the ncep and ncp can be adequately predicted therefore the prediction performance of the hurst exponent deserves to be discussed the standard deviation sd of groundwater depth can reflect the variability of groundwater depth to validate the reliability of the prediction for the corresponding lrc of groundwater depth using the hurst exponent the necp and ncp are divided into four groups i e l low m medium m medium and h high based on the rank of the sd of groundwater depth as shown in fig 11 each class is classified against each quarter percentile 25 50 75 and 100 respectively the comparison between the hurst exponent and the measurement of dynamic change in average groundwater depth in the study area is shown in fig 12 the hurst exponent and the average groundwater depth i e arithmetic mean of groundwater depth data in the corresponding period are calculated by the time series collected in the corresponding period when the hurst exponent is 0 5 the evolution of groundwater depth will have positive persistence characteristics and when the hurst exponent is 0 5 the development of groundwater depth will have anti persistence characteristics in the view of practice successful prediction suggests that positive persistence characteristics correspond well with changes in groundwater depth or anti persistence characteristics correspond with opponent changes and vice versa regarding the necp fig 12a shows that the hurst exponent of all four groups is greater than 0 5 and even exceeds 0 75 indicating that the lrc of groundwater depth is predicted to be significant and the sliding average of groundwater depth in the figure shows a promising trend i e positive persistence in general which verifies the accuracy of the hurst exponent it is worth mentioning that the trend indicated by the hurst exponent in this paper refers to the overall increase or decrease of groundwater depth change over a long period of time and there may be some periods when the groundwater depth does not conform to the general trend which would be caused by short term drift error specifically the observed change in the average groundwater depth shown in fig 12a shows that some turning points appear in the process of annually increasing or decreasing groundwater depths in the necp and the sudden decrease in the hurst exponent indicates that it can reflect these sudden change points of groundwater dynamics the countertrend variation of partial groundwater depth does not affect the overall groundwater depth variation trend so it is reasonable that the hurst exponent is not reduced below 0 5 taking the m region as an example the overall groundwater depth shows a decreasing trend while the hurst exponent of each period is close to 0 75 reflecting this strong positive persistence when the measured groundwater depth increased from 2001 to 2012 against the overall decreasing trend the hurst exponent of this period suddenly decreased indicating a short term anti persistent change in groundwater depth this phenomenon also exists in the remaining three areas the results suggest that the hurst exponent could roughly predict the turning process of groundwater depth for the four marked regions mentioned above in the necp for the ncp the comparison between the hurst exponent and dynamic change in groundwater depth in the ncp is shown in fig 12b the hurst exponent in the l and m regions of the ncp fluctuates more sharply ranging from approximately 0 4 to 0 8 indicating that the groundwater depth variation in these two groups of areas is significant and that substantial anti persistence changes occur in contrast in the m and h regions the hurst exponent is greater than 0 75 indicating that the groundwater depth variation in these two area groups shows strong positive continuity and that the future trend will be consistent with the historical trend the measured groundwater depth fluctuations in the figure reflect the accuracy of hurst exponent prediction similar to the necp the inverse persistence of groundwater depth in the ncp can be accurately predicted by the abrupt change in the hurst exponent the hurst exponent is mainly less than 0 5 when the fluctuation of groundwater depth changes from positive to negative or from negative to positive in the corresponding time series specifically for the l region the hurst exponent cannot fully predict the opponent change in groundwater depth while a hurst exponent synchronously less than 0 5 during the period of 2003 2014 implicitly reveals the opponent trend of change in general the hurst exponent can well predict the dynamic evolution of groundwater depths in the ncp reflecting adequate reliability of the hurst exponent based on the comparison between the hurst exponent and the dynamic change in groundwater depth in the necp and ncp the good prediction performance of the hurst exponent is well supported under the same hydrologic conditions i e without changing the dominant influencing factors such as large scale groundwater exploitation the groundwater depth in the necp is predicted to remain stable and the groundwater depth in most areas of the ncp may continue to increase 4 2 influencing factors for interpreting the evolution of groundwater depth although the spatiotemporal variation and lrc of groundwater depth in the necp and ncp have been illustrated and analyzed in this study the underlying factors causing the hydrologic behaviors are still not apparent because these factors contribute to providing the scientific basis for regional scale groundwater management these probable factors need to be further discussed the main induced factors can interpret the evolution of groundwater depth and assumably include structural elements e g climate topography and geology and anthropogenic factors e g large scale mining and irrigation across the different periods yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 2 the patterns of annual groundwater extraction in the necp and ncp are discrepant where groundwater extraction in the necp increases first and then remains stable and moderately fluctuates but that in the ncp persistently declines from a long term perspective groundwater extraction in the necp can be considered to be mostly stable when the evolution of the hydrological system is generally steady groundwater extraction has little effect on changes in the groundwater depth it can be assumed that the groundwater balance of a particular region will likely remain stable in the long term when only structural factors i e climate topography and geology mainly contribute to the hydrological system and the positive persistence characteristic of the groundwater depth change in the necp has implicitly verified this point therefore the observed change in groundwater depth in the necp may be mainly influenced by structural factors i e climate topography and geology for the ncp it is worth noting that the groundwater depth varies greatly during these 20 years as seen from fig 12b some references to the interpretation yan et al 2013 zhai et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 that anthropogenic factors may have a significant impact on the change in groundwater depth in the ncp on the other hand because the increase in groundwater depth is caused by the imbalance of groundwater replenishment and discharge the continued use of groundwater will lead to the further imbalance of replenishment and discharge which is manifested in the continuous decline of groundwater it could be further interpreted that long term exploitation and irrigation for supporting numerous human beings could cause a large scale year on year increase in the groundwater depth as groundwater extraction declines annually fig 2 the increasing rate of groundwater depth slows down until it approaches a stable value indicating that anthropogenic activities dominantly contribute to the change in groundwater depth analysis of the lrc of groundwater depths in the necp and ncp also shows that the change in groundwater depths in the necp will be relatively stable as continued groundwater exploitation is observed while the groundwater depth in the ncp is predicted to increase continuously the different trends in the groundwater depth changes in the two plains show that anthropogenic factors could mainly influence the dynamic evolution of the groundwater depth in the ncp in the long term such as irrigation and mining cao et al 2013 at the same time the dynamic change in the groundwater depth in the necp may be influenced by more complex structural factors such as climate topography and geology zhang et al 2017 5 conclusion this study conducted geostatistical and fractal theory analyses to explore the spatial distribution and lrc of the groundwater depth in the necp and ncp over the past two decades the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the semivariogram function and ok interpolation analysis revealed that groundwater was shallower in the northern and southern necp and deeper in the middle of necp exhibiting significant spatial variability during 2000 2019 the groundwater depth in the necp first increased and then decreased i e without a monotonous increase in the groundwater depth in addition the groundwater depth was deeper in the northern ncp and shallower in the southern ncp with more significant spatial variability during 2000 2019 there was a continuous increase in the groundwater depth in the ncp 2 the hurst exponent obtained by r s analysis shows that the groundwater in the northeastern part of heilongjiang and the central part of jilin in the northeast plain is expected to continue declining in the coming period in contrast groundwater in the central part of heilongjiang is likely to maintain a continuous rebounding trend for the southern part of heilongjiang groundwater in most of liaoning and inner mongolia continues to fluctuate up and down with no apparent direction for the western part of heilongjiang groundwater may show a slight downward trend in the coming period in the northern part of beijing the southern part of hebei and the southern and northwestern parts of henan in the north china plain groundwater will continue to maintain a downward trend in the coming period due to overexploitation groundwater in the south central region of shandong and most of the northern part of tianjin fluctuated up and down with no evident trend in comparison the groundwater in the southern area of jiangsu and the southern region of anhui may show a weak rebound trend in the coming period the implications from the calculated hurst coefficient were consistent with those based on the measured groundwater depth changes the future patterns of groundwater depth changes also differ between the two plains in china 3 analysis of the lrc of the dynamic change in groundwater depths using the sd of groundwater depth variation showed that the hurst exponent is greater than 0 5 in most areas of the necp indicating that groundwater depth dynamics are persistent in the necp and that groundwater depths may exhibit a stable trend similarly the hurst exponent in the ncp region is larger than 0 5 i e the changes in the groundwater depth in all areas of the ncp have positive persistence this continuous trend of groundwater depths is confirmed using the measured groundwater depth at groundwater monitoring stations if there is no artificial intervention the groundwater in the ncp will continue to exhibit a steady downward trend in the future 4 the validation of the hurst exponent for lrc prediction was implemented well which shows good reliability for predicting long term changes in groundwater depth based on the resultant lrc and observed groundwater depth data the induced change in groundwater in the ncp could be mainly affected by anthropogenic factors while that in the necp is implicitly affected by structural factors further investigation is warranted in this area credit authorship contribution statement chengpeng lu conceptualization methodology supervision writing review editing

8132,study area northeast china plain necp and north china plain ncp study focus groundwater resources in the northern plains of china are the primary source of domestic and irrigation water and long term overexploitation may cause groundwater depletion and deterioration in these plains in this study based on observations of groundwater depth i e the depth of phreatic water below the land surface from 2000 to 2019 in the necp and ncp the spatial distribution characteristics and long range correlation lrc of the regional groundwater depth are analyzed using the geostatistical method and fractal theory new hydrological insights in terms of the spatial distribution of groundwater depth an overall trend of decline and then recovery from 2000 to 2019 can be observed in the necp indicating that the persistent decline of groundwater depth is not conspicuous while there is a persistent decline of groundwater depth in the ncp regarding the lrc of groundwater depth the hurst exponents calculated using the r s analysis demonstrate the persistence of groundwater depth variation in the necp and positive persistence of groundwater depth decline in the ncp the hurst exponent reveals that the groundwater depth in the necp will likely remain stable in the future while the groundwater depth in most areas of the ncp may continue to decline if the dominant factors remain unchanged moreover the dynamic change in the groundwater depth of the necp may be mainly affected by natural structural factors while anthropogenic factors may trigger that response in the ncp keywords groundwater depth

the environment and the economy e g aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 famiglietti 2014 china has 18 of the world s total population and 5 7 of its global freshwater resources and therefore china relies heavily on groundwater resources for daily production and domestic water use qiu 2010 long term groundwater exploitation can disrupt the balance between the recharge and discharge of groundwater in china where the rational exploitation of groundwater remains a hot and practical research topic gorelick and zheng 2015 the input and output of groundwater cause dynamic changes in groundwater quantity and quality groundwater dynamics including groundwater level depth water chemistry storage flow velocity and other characteristics can be recorded by a hydrologic time series considering relevant statistical characteristics li and zhang 2007 this study focuses on the dynamics of groundwater depth i e the depth of phreatic water below the land surface groundwater depth mentioned in this article all refer to the depth of phreatic water below the land surface and its long range correlation lrc for time series in china to provide the scientific basis for regional scale groundwater management the northeast china plain necp and the north china plain ncp are two of the four great plains of china each of which contains a vast territory and a large population groundwater in both plains has been exploited for decades resulting in long term changes in groundwater depth thereby affecting groundwater resource evolution feng et al 2013 hu et al 2005 zhao et al 2019 however the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater in the necp and ncp their complex dynamics and patterns of change and the lrc all remain obscure jia et al 2019 the dynamics of groundwater depth change can directly affect residential industrial and agricultural water use wang et al 2007 sustainable groundwater exploration has become an urgent issue for managing water resources in the necp and ncp li and hou 2020 fractal theory which attempts to interpret complex processes by searching for the simple underlying process may be useful in exploring the complex dynamics of groundwater depth variation research on fractal behaviors began with hurst s dam storage investigations hurst 1951 mandelbrot 1967 first explicitly proposed fractal theory and expanded it it has since been applied in many fields mandelbrot and van ness 1968 mandelbrot and wallis 1968 many scholars have further deepened the content of fractal theory and applied it successfully habib et al 2017 li and zhang 2007 liu and molz 1997 rakhshandehroo and amiri 2012 yu et al 2016 groundwater depth dynamics with fractal characteristics have also been demonstrated for example zhang and schilling 2004 found temporal scaling in a time series of groundwater level fluctuations with spatially varied fractal dimension zhang and yang 2010 noted that groundwater levels might fluctuate as a temporal fractal little and bloomfield 2010 provided robust evidence of random fractal scaling of groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers joelson et al 2016 demonstrated that fluctuations in groundwater levels exhibit fractal scaling and persistent behavior due to the rainfall process sun et al 2019 investigated the fractal scaling behavior of a groundwater system affected by plant water use and river stage fluctuations in the riparian zone although there have been many efforts in fractal theory over several decades the application of the theory is relatively rare in exploring the temporal and spatial changes in groundwater depth dynamics in the mainland china plains this study analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater depth and its dynamic patterns in the necp and ncp the most important areas in china relying on groundwater from 2000 to 2019 using the geostatistical approach and fractal theory scientific predictions were also made for changes in the groundwater depth by the lrc approach the rest of this presentation is organized as follows first the groundwater depth data were collected and collated from groundwater monitoring stations in the necp and ncp second the geostatistical approach and fractal theory were applied to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics and dynamic changes in groundwater depth third the lrc of groundwater depth changes which may be used to predict the variable tendency of groundwater depth for the study area was systematically analyzed for both the necp and ncp finally discussions on the validation of the hurst exponent for predicting the lrc of groundwater depth and its underlying factors for induced changes in groundwater depth were implemented 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the necp covers the southern part of heilongjiang western central jilin eastern part of inner mongolia and most of liaoning and consists mainly of three parts the songnen plain liaohe plain in the south and sanjiang plain in the northeast zhang 2004 fig 1 the necp has a temperate continental semiarid monsoon climate with windy and dry winters and springs warm and relatively wet summers and cool autumns huang and xu 2016 in recent years as the population and the area of arable land in the necp have continued to increase groundwater has become an essential resource for agricultural industrial and domestic water use overexploitation of groundwater has occurred in many areas of the necp zhong et al 2018 the ncp is the general name of the three principal basins in china namely the yellow river basin the huaihe river basin and the haihe river basin fig 1 the ncp belongs to the northern part of china including all the plains of hebei beijing and tianjin as well as the northern plains of shandong and henan where rich soils are formed by the sediments of the yellow river huaihe river and haihe river providing superior conditions for agricultural development liu et al 2018 the ncp s mature agricultural system feeds 400 million people and is one of the most densely populated areas in the world where the high demand for water resources has forced an increased amount of groundwater extraction kang and eltahir 2018 in recent years the groundwater of the ncp has experienced long term overexploitation resulting in a groundwater level drop of up to 1 m a in some areas liang et al 2016 2 2 data collection the groundwater monitoring data used were obtained from the information center of the ministry of water resources because the degree of exploitation and utilization of groundwater and climatic conditions have significantly changed over the last two decades compared with those in the last century liu et al 2001 we select the study period from january 1 2000 to december 31 2019 with a total time of 20 years groundwater extraction and precipitation data are collected from the water resources bulletin http www mwr gov cn sj tjgb szygb annual groundwater extraction and precipitation variation for the necp and ncp from 2000 to 2019 are visually presented in fig 2 four major aquifers exist in the north china plain and have been studied to assess and achieve sustainability of groundwater resources foster et al 2004 while the subject of this study is phreatic water therefore over 1200 groundwater monitoring stations which are located in the unconfined aquifer shown by the dots in fig 1 located in the necp and ncp are collected and collated these stations record the monthly groundwater depth over the past 20 years groundwater has been monitored by many manual observation methods continuous observation at some stations could be temporarily paused for one or several months and few stations are used in the beginning and are then out of service due to station network adjustment the groundwater depths of the lack of measurement area were interpolated to be analyzed systematically for the missing or outlier measurements due to the failure of groundwater monitoring stations or other unexpected reasons during a short period the newton interpolation method is used to interpolate the groundwater depth time series werner 1984 the overall situation of the data from groundwater monitoring stations is shown in table 1 and the groundwater depth in some areas is mainly obtained through spatial interpolation 2 3 methodology in this paper the spatial variability and correlation of groundwater depth in the necp and ncp are studied using geostatistical methods and performed in arcgis v10 3 the r s analysis method based on fractal theory is used to calculate the hurst exponent of the groundwater depth time series to analyze the temporal changes in groundwater and the lrc 2 3 1 geostatistical methods geostatistical methods are increasingly used in the fields of hydrology and ecology bodrud doza et al 2016 pebesma and de kwaadsteniet 1997 and have been introduced as management and decision tools by many researchers to reveal the spatial and temporal structure of groundwater depth fluctuations ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 delhomme 1979 the basic tools of geostatistical methods are semivariogram functions and kriging interpolation ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 in this paper the spatial variability of the groundwater depth in the study area is studied quantitatively using the above two tools the semivariogram function reflects the spatial relation between the sampling point and its adjacent sampling point and this work quantitatively evaluates the spatial variability of each monitoring point in the study area based on its semivariogram parameters the generalized formula of semivariogram function is as follows bilonick 1991 goovaerts 1997 kitanidis 1997 1 r h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where r h is the semivariogram function z x is a regionalized random variable satisfying the second order stationary assumption h is a step size i e the distance between ordered data z xi is the sample value at the spatial point xi and n h is the total number of sample point pairs at the separation distance h to quantitatively describe the variation characteristics of the study area it is necessary to define the theoretical model of its semivariogram the most commonly used models are spherical exponential gaussian and pure nugget effects bilonick 1991 by comparison the semivariogram function of groundwater depth in the necp can be described by the following exponential model kitanidis 1997 2 r h 0 h 0 c 0 c 1 e h a h 0 where c 0 is the nugget which refers to the value of the semivariogram function due to the measurement error and spatial variation when two sampling points are very close c 0 c is the sill a constant where the distance between sampling points increases by h when the semivariogram reaches a relatively stable value a is the range referring to the distance between the sampling point when the semivariogram reaches the sill from the nugget which defines the range of spatial correlation and c is the partial sill i e difference between the sill and nugget the semivariogram function of groundwater depth in the ncp can be sufficiently fitted with the spherical model the fitting diagram of the semivariogram function is shown in fig 3 and its generalized formula is 3 r h 0 h 0 c 0 c 3 h 2 a h 3 2 a 3 0 h a c 0 c 1 e h a h a both the nugget and the sill may be used to describe the degree of spatial variability of groundwater depths the nugget represents the variation caused by random factors on a small scale and the sill reflects the large scale variation caused by structural factors the ratio of nugget to sill may reflect the strength of the spatial correlation of groundwater depths if this ratio is 25 the system is strongly correlated in space if the ratio is between 25 and 75 the system is moderately correlated in space and if the ratio is 75 the system is slightly correlated in space wallace et al 2000 this ratio indicates the proportion of spatial variability caused by the random component to the total variability of the system the higher the ratio is the smaller the spatial correlation is and the more apparent spatial variability is caused by random factors a ratio close to 1 indicates that the variable exhibits constant variability at small scales delbari et al 2016 dem information as an auxiliary variable in groundwater depth interpolation is an effective method desbarats et al 2002 peeters et al 2010 we firstly used co kriging with dem to interpolate the groundwater depth after the comparison between co kriging and ordinary kriging ok in the necp and ncp the expected improvement of interpolation using co kriging did not arise because of the weak correlation between flat terrain and the uneven groundwater depth therefore in this paper the ok interpolation is used to interpolate the groundwater depth in the study area and plot the groundwater depth contour map the results of ok interpolation are more proficient when the data variables under training follow a normal distribution the kolmogorov smirnov single sample test k s test was conducted to check whether the data were normally or log normally distributed if the groundwater depth datasets conformed to a log normal distribution logarithmic transformation was performed to normalize the data descriptive statistics parameters were examined such as the median mean coefficient of variation kurtosis and skewness trend analysis was carried out to determine whether the dataset followed any particular trend rather than assuming that the mean groundwater depth is constant over the entire domain we recognize that it may contain a spatial trend which is appropriately interpolated by the ok procedure 2 3 2 r s analysis r s analysis is usually used to analyze the fractal characteristics and the lrc of a time series and was initially proposed by british hydrologist hurst 1951 when analyzing the hydrological data of the nile there are already several methods available to calculate the hurst exponent kendziorski et al 1999 sánchez granero et al 2008 taqqu et al 1995 among them r s analysis is widely used to calculate the hurst exponent which can well reveal the lrc of the time series of groundwater depth and its principle is briefly described as follows mandelbrot and wallis 1969 considering the time series x t for any positive integer τ 1 the mean value series is defined as 4 x τ 1 τ t 1 τ x t τ 1 2 t where t is the number of data points in x t the cumulative deviation x t τ is calculated as 5 x t τ u 1 t x u x τ 1 t τ the extreme deviation r τ is calculated as 6 r τ max 1 t τ x t τ min 1 t τ x t τ τ 1 2 t the standard deviation s τ is calculated as 7 s τ 1 τ t 1 τ x u x τ 2 1 2 τ 1 2 t when analyzing the statistical rule of r τ s τ r s hurst discovered the following relational expression 8 r s τ 2 h where h is the hurst exponent and eq 8 may be used to identify the persistence embedded in the time series apparently h is given by the slope coefficient of r s versus τ 2 according to τ r s h can be obtained by the least squares method in a log log grid hurst once demonstrated that if x t is an independently random series with limited variance the exponent h 0 5 and h 0 h 1 is dependent on an incidence function d t 9 d t 2 2 h 1 1 the value of h 0 5 indicates a random process for h 0 5 the process has positive persistence characteristics and the future trend of the time series will be consistent with the historical data when h 0 5 the process has anti persistence characteristics and the future trend of the time series will be opposite to the past data two aspects need to be considered when using r s analysis to calculate the hurst exponent of a groundwater depth time series first the presence of periodic and trend terms in the time series exerts a considerable influence on the calculation of the hurst exponent hence the spectral analysis series is needed to eliminate the periodic and trend terms influence in the time series before calculating hurst taqqu and teverovsky 1997 second how long the time series of the calculated hurst exponent is stable should be explored and the stability of the hurst exponent affects the accuracy of lrc the following two sets of experiments are designed in this study to address the second issue in the first experiment the hurst exponent is calculated using ten sets of random numbers with undetermined sizes of the sample that conform to the normal distribution and uniform distribution the hurst exponent calculated from a large number of random numbers should be close to 0 5 the greater the number of samples is the closer the calculated hurst exponent is to 0 5 this principle sequentially increases the number of samples of random numbers and the hurst exponent can calculated in the second experiment the hurst exponent is calculated using the preprocessed groundwater depth time series the length of the time series is increased sequentially to calculate the corresponding hurst exponents for different samples five monitoring stations in the necp and five monitoring stations in the ncp are selected in this experiment and the locations of the monitoring stations are shown in fig 1 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial characteristics of groundwater depth 3 1 1 necp the k s single sample test shows that the groundwater depth data do not follow a normal distribution however after the logarithmic conversion of the groundwater depth the kurtosis and skewness of the resultant data are close to 0 which follows the normal distribution and can be used for geostatistical analysis then the statistics of the data are summarized in table 2 and the median and mean groundwater depths tend to increase and then decrease over time this pattern described the overall trend of increasing and then decreasing groundwater depths in the necp from 2000 to 2019 fig 4 shows the temporal evolution of the average groundwater depth in the necp in the past two decades there have been several turning points in the fluctuation of groundwater depth in the necp to explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of groundwater depth we select the turning points in fig 4 representing the starting and ending years and the turning years of the groundwater depth fluctuation which are 2000 2002 2006 2008 2014 and 2019 in the necp the exponential semivariogram function was found to be more accurate and appropriate fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of groundwater depths in the necp after using ok interpolation as shown in fig 5 the spatial distribution of groundwater depths in the necp is shallower in the north and south and deeper in the middle showing tremendous regional variability the groundwater depth first increases and then decreases although there was a rebound trend in the groundwater depth until 2019 it could not return to the depth presented in 2000 this study uses the parameters of the semivariogram to analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of groundwater depth autocorrelations as shown in fig 6 the sill c 0 c of the necp is smaller than that of the ncp but the ratio of the nugget to the sill c 0 c 0 c is larger which indicates that the necp has a weaker spatial correlation the parameters related to the semivariogram of the groundwater depth at the groundwater monitoring stations in the necp are shown in fig 6a including the nugget c 0 the sill c 0 c the ratio of the nugget to the sill c 0 c 0 c and the range a it is noteworthy that c 0 and c 0 c are considered to reflect the factors affecting the groundwater depth in particular c 0 captures the influence of small scale random factors including small scale human factors such as local irrigation and diversion and climatic factors such as local heavy precipitation c 0 c captures the influence of large scale structural factors including climate topography and geology and large scale human factors such as large scale irrigation and diversion fig 6a shows that the temporal evolution of the c 0 c 0 c value was between 38 and 63 during 2000 2008 indicating that the spatial correlation between the regions gradually decreased as shown in the first three graphs of fig 5 at 2000 2004 and 2006 the groundwater depth in some areas of the necp such as northeastern heilongjiang and the northern part of jilin has increased significantly while the groundwater depth in the remaining areas has not changed significantly which confirms the weakening spatial correlation regarding the influencing factors of the groundwater depth the value of c 0 remained at a low level while the value of c 0 c 0 c remained at a medium level indicating that the large scale structural factors mainly influenced the groundwater depth variation in this period large scale human activities such as the large scale exploitation of groundwater occurred during this period and groundwater extraction was also increased fig 2a this phenomenon was also consistent with feng et al 2018 after 2010 the three parameters c 0 c 0 c and c 0 c 0 c exhibit relatively synchronous fluctuations c 0 c 0 c fluctuates between 50 and 63 indicating a moderate spatial correlation in the groundwater depth in different areas of the necp and some areas may be subject to local variations due to random factors the three groundwater depth graphs in 2011 2014 and 2019 plotted in fig 5 show that not all areas of the necp groundwater depth exhibit an overall increase or decrease as the groundwater depth changes in different regions are inconsistent for provincial areas such as heilongjiang inner mongolia and jilin some regions with groundwater gradually become shallower while regions with deep groundwater evolve deeper c 0 and c 0 c also reflect that since 2009 the groundwater depth in the necp may have been simultaneously influenced by structural factors i e climate topography and geology and anthropogenic factors i e large scale mining and irrigation bian et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that the reader may have doubts about the reliability of the results of ok interpolation the interpolation results can be verified by considering the separated distance between each pair of monitoring stations the minimum range a and the resolution of the ok interpolation results since the groundwater monitoring stations in the necp collected in this study are densely distributed the average separated distance 16 033 m is far less than the minimum range a approximately 100 000 m even though the range a decreases each year furthermore the resolution of the results of ok interpolation in the necp is 10 000 m which is less than the minimum range a so the groundwater depth distribution obtained by ok interpolation can be reliably used for analysis herein 3 1 2 ncp fig 4 clearly shows the overall increasing trend of the groundwater depth in the ncp over the past two decades similarly the typical turning years of 2000 2003 2005 2011 2016 and 2019 are selected to analyze dynamic changes in the groundwater depth in the ncp statistics of the typical year groundwater depth at groundwater monitoring stations in the ncp are listed in table 2 the median and mean groundwater depths increased continuously over time showing a continuous increase in the groundwater depth from 2000 2019 similar to the necp the k s single sample test reveals that the groundwater depth data do not follow the normal distribution but the logarithmically transformed groundwater depth follows the normal distribution based on ok interpolation fig 7 shows that the groundwater depth in the ncp is deeper in the northwest and shallower in the south the pattern of groundwater variation is inconsistent across provincial regions and even the groundwater variation on the same scale within the same province is not identical somewhere for example in the western parts of hebei the groundwater depth was much more extensive and showed a cone of depression where the cone of depression continued to expand and the groundwater depth continued to increase in contrast the groundwater depth located in the eastern parts of hebei annually decreased compared to hebei the groundwater depth in shandong which is adjacent to hebei is less variable similarly the semivariogram function was used to analyze the spatial correlation of the regions in the ncp fig 6b shows that the c 0 c 0 c ratio was greater than 25 and gradually approached 25 during 2000 2005 indicating a tendency to shift from moderate to strong spatial correlation of the groundwater depth in the ncp at the same time the c 0 c value remains at a moderate level while the c 0 value remains at a low level indicating that the groundwater in each region of the ncp basically shows an overall change as shown in fig 7 the spatial correlation of groundwater changes shows an increase in the first three graphs at 2000 2003 and 2005 as the cone of depression continued to expand in the western part of the ncp and the groundwater rebounded in the southern part of the ncp the good overall groundwater depth variation indicates that the change in groundwater depth during this period was mainly due to the combination of structural factors and local level human factors cao et al 2013 since 2016 c 0 c 0 c tended to decrease and then increase but remained larger than 25 indicating a strong correlation between the groundwater depth in different regions of the ncp i e the groundwater depth of the ncp shows an overall change the three groundwater depth graphs in 2011 2016 and 2019 plotted in fig 7 show that the groundwater change was overall minor confirming the result of the strong spatial correlation in addition the c 0 value remains at a very low level however the c 0 c value remains at a high level indicating that the ncp s groundwater depth variation is mainly influenced by structural factors i e climate topography and geology and human factors i e large scale irrigation and mining zhai et al 2005 the groundwater monitoring stations in the ncp are densely distributed and the average separated distance 12 500 m is far less than the minimum range a approximately 400 000 m furthermore the resolution of the results of ok interpolation in the ncp is 8000 m which is less than the minimum range a so the groundwater depth distribution obtained by ok interpolation can be reliably used for analysis herein 3 2 long range correlation of groundwater depth in study areas 3 2 1 hurst exponent varied by sample size as mentioned above two sets of experiments were performed to explore the time length for the time series needed for the hurst exponent to remain stable in experiment i the value of hurst exponent around 0 5 with up and down beating when the number of random samples was less than 110 and then reached a stable value fig 8 a and b in experiment ii the variation in the hurst exponent by the sample number for ten selected groundwater monitoring stations fig 8c and d tended to be stable when the number of samples was larger than 130 consequently the minimum number of samples for calculating the hurst exponent was greater than 130 considering the hurst exponent s stability this study uses a sliding time series to calculate the hurst exponent by taking 144 monthly groundwater depth data point from the necp and ncp as the length of the time series based on the existing groundwater depth data measured from 2000 to 2019 sliding is performed with a sequence of 12 years and a step length of 1 year specifically for a particular groundwater monitoring station the first hurst exponent is calculated based on the groundwater depth time series from 2000 to 2011 and the second hurst exponent is calculated based on the groundwater depth time series from 2001 to 2012 and so on finally each groundwater monitoring station can provide a set of hurst exponent sequences of length 9 3 2 2 the lrc analysis of the necp fig 9 shows the resultant contour map of the hurst exponent of the groundwater depth time series in the necp which mainly contains the four provincial administrative regions heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia and liaoning overall the hurst exponent in the necp is more significant than 0 5 for all nine time periods showing positive persistence characteristics however the magnitude of the hurst exponent varies between regions showing varying degrees of the lrc generally the larger the hurst exponent is the stronger the memory is the longer it will remember the previous values and the more consistent the ability to maintain the previous change trend habib 2020 based on the type of changes in the hurst exponent we can roughly divide the necp into three regions including the region where the hurst exponent increases such as the northeastern and central parts of heilongjiang and the central part of jilin the region where the hurst exponent remains basically unchanged such as the southern part of heilongjiang liaoning and most of inner mongolia and the region where the hurst exponent decreases such as the western part of heilongjiang for the sliding hurst exponent an increase in the hurst exponent indicates that the time series better remember the later groundwater depth trends while a decrease in the hurst exponent indicates that the time series better remember the earlier groundwater depth trends accordingly combined with the spatial distribution of groundwater depths in the necp in fig 5 we can roughly determine that for the northeastern part of heilongjiang and the central part of jilin groundwater is expected to continue to maintain a decreasing trend in the coming period in contrast groundwater in the central part of heilongjiang may maintain a continuous rebounding trend for the southern part of heilongjiang groundwater in most of liaoning and inner mongolia continues to fluctuate up and down with no apparent trend for the western part of heilongjiang groundwater may show a slight downward trend in the coming period 3 2 3 the lrc analysis of the ncp fig 10 shows the hurst exponent contour map of the ncp the ncp covers seven chinese provincial administrative divisions beijing tianjin shandong hebei henan jiangsu and anhui overall the hurst exponent of the ncp is also greater than 0 5 in all nine time periods showing positive persistence characteristics similar to the necp the ncp is divided into three parts according to the type of hurst exponent change the region with an increasing hurst exponent such as the northern part of beijing the southern part of hebei and the southern part of henan the region has an essentially unchanged hurst exponent such as that in the northwestern part of henan and the central and southern parts of shandong the region with a decreasing hurst exponent such as the northern part of tianjin the southern part of jiangsu and the southern part of anhui combined with the spatial distribution of groundwater depth in the ncp in fig 7 we can roughly determine that for the northern area of beijing the southern area of hebei and the southern and northwestern areas of henan the groundwater depth will continue to maintain an increasing trend for some time in the future due to overexploitation in contrast the groundwater depth in the south central area of shandong and most of the northern areas of tianjin will continue to fluctuate up and down with no apparent trend the groundwater in the southern part of jiangsu and the southern part of anhui may show a weak rebound trend in the coming period 4 discussion 4 1 validation of hurst exponent for lrc prediction it is a common practice to use the hurst exponent to predict the lrc of hydrological systems such as precipitation evaporation cycles groundwater fluctuations and river runoff changes bierkens and van den hurk 2007 joelson et al 2016 markonis et al 2018 xu et al 2008 as stated in tong et al 2018 when the change in ndvi is predicted with the hurst exponent it is believed that a value of hurst over 0 5 indicates that the past trend is continuing and a value below 0 5 indicates that the past trend is reversing however there are few reports on the application of the hurst exponent to the lrc prediction of groundwater depth changes in large scale plain areas consequently many researchers may be concerned whether the prospective variation in groundwater depth in the ncep and ncp can be adequately predicted therefore the prediction performance of the hurst exponent deserves to be discussed the standard deviation sd of groundwater depth can reflect the variability of groundwater depth to validate the reliability of the prediction for the corresponding lrc of groundwater depth using the hurst exponent the necp and ncp are divided into four groups i e l low m medium m medium and h high based on the rank of the sd of groundwater depth as shown in fig 11 each class is classified against each quarter percentile 25 50 75 and 100 respectively the comparison between the hurst exponent and the measurement of dynamic change in average groundwater depth in the study area is shown in fig 12 the hurst exponent and the average groundwater depth i e arithmetic mean of groundwater depth data in the corresponding period are calculated by the time series collected in the corresponding period when the hurst exponent is 0 5 the evolution of groundwater depth will have positive persistence characteristics and when the hurst exponent is 0 5 the development of groundwater depth will have anti persistence characteristics in the view of practice successful prediction suggests that positive persistence characteristics correspond well with changes in groundwater depth or anti persistence characteristics correspond with opponent changes and vice versa regarding the necp fig 12a shows that the hurst exponent of all four groups is greater than 0 5 and even exceeds 0 75 indicating that the lrc of groundwater depth is predicted to be significant and the sliding average of groundwater depth in the figure shows a promising trend i e positive persistence in general which verifies the accuracy of the hurst exponent it is worth mentioning that the trend indicated by the hurst exponent in this paper refers to the overall increase or decrease of groundwater depth change over a long period of time and there may be some periods when the groundwater depth does not conform to the general trend which would be caused by short term drift error specifically the observed change in the average groundwater depth shown in fig 12a shows that some turning points appear in the process of annually increasing or decreasing groundwater depths in the necp and the sudden decrease in the hurst exponent indicates that it can reflect these sudden change points of groundwater dynamics the countertrend variation of partial groundwater depth does not affect the overall groundwater depth variation trend so it is reasonable that the hurst exponent is not reduced below 0 5 taking the m region as an example the overall groundwater depth shows a decreasing trend while the hurst exponent of each period is close to 0 75 reflecting this strong positive persistence when the measured groundwater depth increased from 2001 to 2012 against the overall decreasing trend the hurst exponent of this period suddenly decreased indicating a short term anti persistent change in groundwater depth this phenomenon also exists in the remaining three areas the results suggest that the hurst exponent could roughly predict the turning process of groundwater depth for the four marked regions mentioned above in the necp for the ncp the comparison between the hurst exponent and dynamic change in groundwater depth in the ncp is shown in fig 12b the hurst exponent in the l and m regions of the ncp fluctuates more sharply ranging from approximately 0 4 to 0 8 indicating that the groundwater depth variation in these two groups of areas is significant and that substantial anti persistence changes occur in contrast in the m and h regions the hurst exponent is greater than 0 75 indicating that the groundwater depth variation in these two area groups shows strong positive continuity and that the future trend will be consistent with the historical trend the measured groundwater depth fluctuations in the figure reflect the accuracy of hurst exponent prediction similar to the necp the inverse persistence of groundwater depth in the ncp can be accurately predicted by the abrupt change in the hurst exponent the hurst exponent is mainly less than 0 5 when the fluctuation of groundwater depth changes from positive to negative or from negative to positive in the corresponding time series specifically for the l region the hurst exponent cannot fully predict the opponent change in groundwater depth while a hurst exponent synchronously less than 0 5 during the period of 2003 2014 implicitly reveals the opponent trend of change in general the hurst exponent can well predict the dynamic evolution of groundwater depths in the ncp reflecting adequate reliability of the hurst exponent based on the comparison between the hurst exponent and the dynamic change in groundwater depth in the necp and ncp the good prediction performance of the hurst exponent is well supported under the same hydrologic conditions i e without changing the dominant influencing factors such as large scale groundwater exploitation the groundwater depth in the necp is predicted to remain stable and the groundwater depth in most areas of the ncp may continue to increase 4 2 influencing factors for interpreting the evolution of groundwater depth although the spatiotemporal variation and lrc of groundwater depth in the necp and ncp have been illustrated and analyzed in this study the underlying factors causing the hydrologic behaviors are still not apparent because these factors contribute to providing the scientific basis for regional scale groundwater management these probable factors need to be further discussed the main induced factors can interpret the evolution of groundwater depth and assumably include structural elements e g climate topography and geology and anthropogenic factors e g large scale mining and irrigation across the different periods yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 2 the patterns of annual groundwater extraction in the necp and ncp are discrepant where groundwater extraction in the necp increases first and then remains stable and moderately fluctuates but that in the ncp persistently declines from a long term perspective groundwater extraction in the necp can be considered to be mostly stable when the evolution of the hydrological system is generally steady groundwater extraction has little effect on changes in the groundwater depth it can be assumed that the groundwater balance of a particular region will likely remain stable in the long term when only structural factors i e climate topography and geology mainly contribute to the hydrological system and the positive persistence characteristic of the groundwater depth change in the necp has implicitly verified this point therefore the observed change in groundwater depth in the necp may be mainly influenced by structural factors i e climate topography and geology for the ncp it is worth noting that the groundwater depth varies greatly during these 20 years as seen from fig 12b some references to the interpretation yan et al 2013 zhai et al 2005 zhang et al 2015 that anthropogenic factors may have a significant impact on the change in groundwater depth in the ncp on the other hand because the increase in groundwater depth is caused by the imbalance of groundwater replenishment and discharge the continued use of groundwater will lead to the further imbalance of replenishment and discharge which is manifested in the continuous decline of groundwater it could be further interpreted that long term exploitation and irrigation for supporting numerous human beings could cause a large scale year on year increase in the groundwater depth as groundwater extraction declines annually fig 2 the increasing rate of groundwater depth slows down until it approaches a stable value indicating that anthropogenic activities dominantly contribute to the change in groundwater depth analysis of the lrc of groundwater depths in the necp and ncp also shows that the change in groundwater depths in the necp will be relatively stable as continued groundwater exploitation is observed while the groundwater depth in the ncp is predicted to increase continuously the different trends in the groundwater depth changes in the two plains show that anthropogenic factors could mainly influence the dynamic evolution of the groundwater depth in the ncp in the long term such as irrigation and mining cao et al 2013 at the same time the dynamic change in the groundwater depth in the necp may be influenced by more complex structural factors such as climate topography and geology zhang et al 2017 5 conclusion this study conducted geostatistical and fractal theory analyses to explore the spatial distribution and lrc of the groundwater depth in the necp and ncp over the past two decades the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the semivariogram function and ok interpolation analysis revealed that groundwater was shallower in the northern and southern necp and deeper in the middle of necp exhibiting significant spatial variability during 2000 2019 the groundwater depth in the necp first increased and then decreased i e without a monotonous increase in the groundwater depth in addition the groundwater depth was deeper in the northern ncp and shallower in the southern ncp with more significant spatial variability during 2000 2019 there was a continuous increase in the groundwater depth in the ncp 2 the hurst exponent obtained by r s analysis shows that the groundwater in the northeastern part of heilongjiang and the central part of jilin in the northeast plain is expected to continue declining in the coming period in contrast groundwater in the central part of heilongjiang is likely to maintain a continuous rebounding trend for the southern part of heilongjiang groundwater in most of liaoning and inner mongolia continues to fluctuate up and down with no apparent direction for the western part of heilongjiang groundwater may show a slight downward trend in the coming period in the northern part of beijing the southern part of hebei and the southern and northwestern parts of henan in the north china plain groundwater will continue to maintain a downward trend in the coming period due to overexploitation groundwater in the south central region of shandong and most of the northern part of tianjin fluctuated up and down with no evident trend in comparison the groundwater in the southern area of jiangsu and the southern region of anhui may show a weak rebound trend in the coming period the implications from the calculated hurst coefficient were consistent with those based on the measured groundwater depth changes the future patterns of groundwater depth changes also differ between the two plains in china 3 analysis of the lrc of the dynamic change in groundwater depths using the sd of groundwater depth variation showed that the hurst exponent is greater than 0 5 in most areas of the necp indicating that groundwater depth dynamics are persistent in the necp and that groundwater depths may exhibit a stable trend similarly the hurst exponent in the ncp region is larger than 0 5 i e the changes in the groundwater depth in all areas of the ncp have positive persistence this continuous trend of groundwater depths is confirmed using the measured groundwater depth at groundwater monitoring stations if there is no artificial intervention the groundwater in the ncp will continue to exhibit a steady downward trend in the future 4 the validation of the hurst exponent for lrc prediction was implemented well which shows good reliability for predicting long term changes in groundwater depth based on the resultant lrc and observed groundwater depth data the induced change in groundwater in the ncp could be mainly affected by anthropogenic factors while that in the necp is implicitly affected by structural factors further investigation is warranted in this area credit authorship contribution statement chengpeng lu conceptualization methodology supervision writing review editing

8133,study region hong kong china study focus this paper aims to develop a flood analysis model to integrate the effects of multiple flooding triggers i e rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping during powerful tropical cyclones and investigate coastal flood hazards in an urban area at the street scale the process of wave overtopping is properly estimated and integrated in a dual drainage model in a maneuverable way as an inflow discharge hydrograph the inundation during typhoon mangkhut 2018 in tseung kwan o town center a coastal community of hong kong is taken as a case study new hydrological insights for the region the inundation scenario in tseung kwan o town center during tyhpoon mangkhut is reproduced and comparison between different drainage conditions demonstrates the key role of drainage facilities in the mitigation of flooding induced by wave overtopping although the varying sea level boundary could partly reduce the drainage efficiency in addition possible flood scenarios and pedestrian stability in flowing water upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and astronomical tide as well as the effectiveness of a 1 1 m wave wall are evaluated the overtopping discharge flooding severity and dangerous zones for pedestrian can be markedly reduced by the wave wall keywords flood risk wave overtopping storm surge tide drainage typhoon mangkhut 1 introduction two super typhoons hato and mangkhut made landfall on the pearl river delta in south china in 2017 and 2018 respectively hurricane signal no 10 the highest in hong kong and macao s warning systems which was only issued 15 times since 1946 hko 2020a was issued during the passage of both typhoons severe inundation due to torrential rainfall storm surges and huge waves occurred in low lying and coastal communities which posed threats to the safety of local residents the maximum inundation depth was estimated as 2 38 m and 2 01 m in inner harbor of macao during typhoon hato and mangkhut respectively yang et al 2019 takagi et al 2018 islam and takagi 2020 typhoon hato caused 12 deaths and at least 153 injuries in macao among which at least 5 people drowned in inundated stores and underground car parks in the recent decades flooding related to storm surges induced by tropical cyclones tc frequently happened around the world including hurricane katrina 2005 and hurricane sandy 2012 in the u s fritz et al 2007 bloomberg 2013 and typhoon haiyan 2013 in the philippines lagmay et al 2015 according to observations at the victoria harbor the mean sea level of hong kong rose at a rate of 31 mm per decade during 1954 2019 hko 2020b the superposition of sea level rise and frequent extreme weather events pose growing flooding risks to the low lying coastal areas woodruff et al 2013 dang et al 2018 some of which are densely populated neighborhoods coastal flooding during tcs involves surface runoff of stormwater and tidal flooding induced by high sea levels zellou and rahali 2019 tanim and goharian 2020 the sea level components with relatively long periods such as tides and storm surges can be considered as varying boundary conditions for flood analysis e g smith et al 2012 martinelli et al 2010 qiang et al 2021 however considering the contribution of waves seawater passed over the coastal protection structures and flew inland in the cases of typhoon hato and mangkhut even though the sea level was lower than the elevation of protection structure the coastal flooding would have been significantly underestimated if the wave component had been ignored lapidez et al 2015 in the literature the contribution of waves may be considered with simplified approaches by adding an empirical approximation of wave setup or wave run up and using a revised total sea level as the boundary condition vousdoukas et al 2016 stockdon et al 2006 in reality wave overtopping is a dynamic process which is random in time space and volume and is often described using the average discharge per linear unit width empirical models have been established from physical model tests and applied to estimate the mean overtopping discharge for different kinds of embankment structures for analysis and design purposes e g owen 1980 saville 1955 van der meer et al 2018 in recent years numerical models for simulating wave overtopping process have been developed such as the boussinesq model lynett et al 2010 a nonlinear shallow water model hu et al 2000 and a nonhydrostatic approach gallien 2016 suzuki et al 2017 lerma et al 2018 to investigate coastal inundation researchers have attempted to apply various hydrodynamic and wave models to predict the processes of sea level variation wave overtopping and flooding e g lerma et al 2018 gallien 2016 in addition to flooding erosion behind the seawall structures can be caused by repeated wave overtopping which is likely to affect the structural safety the consequence of seawall failures can be much more severe peng et al 2019 shen et al 2020 peng et al 2021 but is beyond the scope of this paper despite the growing public concern on flood risks posed by severe tcs studies on the flooding hazard in coastal regions upon the multiple tc driven triggers including rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping are still limited the complex coastal flooding problem may be solved by integrating different numerical models to describe coastal water dynamics which however requires significant computational efforts engineering measures including coastal defense structures and drainage facilities are important means of flood hazard mitigation in coastal regions the normal and extreme still water level with a return period of 100 or even 200 years in hong kong including components of tides and storm surges are considered for the seawall cope level cedd 2003 the design permissible value of wave overtopping depends on the use of receiving area and the consequence of wave effects a wave wall or storm wall may be constructed to minimize the amount of wave overtopping the wave wall is a relatively small structure compared to the seawall the reduction factor of wave overtopping by a wave wall constructed at different locations of the embankment structure has been investigated through model tests by van doorslaer et al 2015 2016 quang and van 2014 conducted experimental and numerical studies on the characteristics of wave overtopping on sea dikes with low vertical wave walls showing that the wave run up momentum decreases noticeably due to the impact with the wave walls in metropolitan areas the artificial stormwater drainage facilities provide an important means of urban drainage and may affect the propagation of flood water the drainage process can also be affected by multiple flooding triggers in coastal cities stormwater is usually drained to the sea through drainage facilities and the drainage capacity can be influenced by high sea levels during tcs shen et al 2019 tanim and goharian 2020 detailed description of the drainage network is necessary for the purpose of reproducing flooding hazards in urban areas two dimensional hydraulic models for overland flow are usually coupled with one dimensional sewer flow models to consider the bidirectional flow interactions between the urban drainage facilities and the ground surface e g chang et al 2015 seyoum et al 2012 leandro and martins 2016 the performance of the urban drainage facilities in rainfall driven urban flooding has been evaluated but the performance in the midst of multiple tc driven triggers including wave overtopping is barely understood in order to investigate the propagating and receding process of flooding in coastal urban regions and to evaluate the risk on residents upon multiple flooding triggers during powerful tcs a flood analysis model is developed in this paper to consider the compound effects of wave overtopping high sea levels and rainfall wave overtopping is integrated in the model in a maneuverable way as an inflow discharge hydrograph the model is applied to reproduce a coastal flooding case in tseung kwan o tko hong kong during the super typhoon mangkhut the impacts of engineering mitigation measures including urban drainage facilities and a wave wall are investigated in detail and the built environment is characterized using high resolution lidar data 2 coastal flood modeling considering multiple triggers during tropical cyclones 2 1 overview of coastal flooding in tropical cyclones multiple triggering variables are closely related to coastal flooding during tcs including rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping fig 1 the sea level can be abnormally high with the superposition of astronomical tides and storm surges caused by tcs the varying sea level boundaries at the coastline can affect the drainage process from the landside and a large amount of seawater can overflow inland when the sea level exceeds the crest of the seawall structure along the coastline seawater intrusion can also happen due to wave overtopping even though the still sea level is lower than the crest of seawall seawater can reach and pass over the crest of the protection structure if wave runs up high enough against the face of the seawall the intense rainfall brought by tcs can induce flash floods in the urban area where the storm water is normally drained through artificial facilities like an underground drainage network however the drainage efficiency can be affected by the variation of boundary conditions of drainage outfalls located along the coastline or tidal rivers if tidal control is not applied the process of propagating and receding of inundation during tcs in coastal urban areas are investigated in this paper a flood analysis model is adopted to simulate the dual drainage process between the ground surface and the drainage network and the wave overtopping process is integrated in the model as a predefined inflow hydrograph 2 2 overtopping discharge estimation seawater overtopping happens when the wave run up exceeds the crest of seawall the overtopping process is dynamic during which only some large waves can overtop the structure and the duration and volume of overtopping are random the wave overtopping process can be represented with the mean overtopping discharge q m3 s m in a unit time period the mean overtopping discharge can be estimated with an empirical formula derived from physical model data according to embankment geometry water level and wave conditions at the toe of the structure for example the overtopping discharge for a rubble mound seawall can be estimated with the following equation according to the eurotop manual van der meer et al 2018 1 q g h m 0 3 0 09 exp 1 5 r c γ f γ β h m 0 1 3 where g is the gravitational acceleration hm 0 is the incident significant wave height at the toe of seawall rc is the crest freeboard γf is the influence factor for roughness elements on a slope and γβ is the influence factor for oblique wave attack and can be calculated as 2 γ β 1 0 0063 β where β º is the angle of wave attack defined as the angle between the direction of wave propagation and the axis perpendicular to the structure the wave conditions for overtopping estimation should include wave transformations at the nearshore zone fig 1 to obtain the wave condition at the toe of seawall offshore wave data can be utilized in conjunction with a wave transformation model in this paper the depth limited wave height hm0 in the foreshore zone is estimated using a manual method that considers the effect of wave breaking design graphs are available from a simple 1d energy decay numerical model rock manual 2007 fig 4 40 as shown in fig 2 hm0 can be found from the design graphs according to local seawater depth at the toe of seawall h foreshore slope m deep water wave length lop and deep water wave steepness sop deep water wave length lop gtp 2 2π and deep water wave steepness sop hso lop can be calculated from deep water wave height hso and peak period tp the time series of shallow water significant wave height can be obtained from observed hso and tp values and local foreshore geometry and the process of overtopping discharge can then be computed with the varying sea level 2 3 flood analysis model for coastal urban areas to model the flooding process in coastal urban areas during tcs a grid based flow routing model flo 2d flo 2d 2018 is used the model has been widely applied for flooding analysis on land e g erena et al 2018 petroselli et al 2019 in this section the application of this model is expanded for tidal flooding analysis in the flow routing model the infiltration process is calculated with the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 the overland flow is described using one dimensional shallow water equations which are solved for a cell considering flows in eight directions i e four compass directions and four diagonal directions the depth averaged flow velocity in each flow direction is calculated with 3 h t h v x i f q 4 s f s 0 h x v g v x 1 g v t where h is the flow depth t is time v is the depth averaged flow velocity along x direction i is the rainfall intensity q is the ratio of volume flow rate into drainage inlets to the area of the cell containing the inlets sf is the frictional slope s0 is the bed slope and g is the gravitational acceleration apart from the overland flow the sewer flow in the urban drainage facilities is calculated with the storm water management model swmm rossman et al 2005 the overland flow and the sewer flow are coupled within each computational time step and the bi directional flow exchange between the ground surface and drainage conduits are calculated by comparing the pressure head at nodes of drainage inlets and the surface water elevations of the cells containing the drainage inlets the technical details on model integration can be found in flo 2d 2018 for the urban environment the effect of surface obstacles on the surface flow is reflected by two factors i e an area reduction factor arf for considering the reduction in water storage and a width reduction factor wrf for considering the reduction in flow width for a certain flow direction of the cell o brien et al 1993 one arf and eight wrfs are calculated for each cell according to the ratio of the occupied area of buildings to the cell area and to the area of a sub cell representing a certain flow direction respectively multiple flooding triggers during tcs are considered including rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping fig 3 adapted from qiang et al 2021 illustrates how the flooding triggers are considered in the model to simulate the process of seawater intrusion due to wave overtopping inflow cells with the estimated wave overtopping discharge hydrographs are set along the coastline in addition temporally varying stage boundary cells are assigned at the seaward side next to the coastal inflow cells which allows seawater to flow inland when the sea level is higher than the elevation of the coastal cells and to flow back to the sea when the sea level declines flow exchange between the drainage system and the sea at the drainage outfalls are also considered by setting a tidal boundary condition with the water head at outfalls determined by the sea level variation in this way the effects of storm surge on the drainage rate can be considered 3 coastal flooding in tseung kwan o town center during super typhoons 3 1 typhoon mangkhut and inundation in tseung kwan o town center typhoon mangkhut in 2018 was one of the most powerful tcs making landfall in the pearl river delta in the past decades hurricane signal no 10 was released by hong kong observatory in the morning of september 16 and lasted 10 h which was the second longest since 1946 hko 2020a fig 4 shows the path of typhoon mangkhut it formed over the western north pacific and developed into a super typhoon on september 11 weakened after passing across the northern part of luzon philippines but re constructed the eye before making landfall in jiangmen guangdong province on september 16 typhoon mangkhut caused severe damage in the philippines and china according to press reports there were at least 82 deaths 138 injuries and two missing in luzon and around 15 000 houses collapsed at least 458 injuries in hong kong and 40 injuries in macao were reported there were at least 6 fatalities and 4 64 million people affected in guangdong guangxi hainan guizhou hunan and yunnan provinces of china cma 2018 mangkhut passed to the south and southwest of hong kong which brought east and southeast onshore winds pushing seawater onshore the track of mangkhut along with its extensive circulation caused severe storm surges in hong kong the maximum storm surge at a number of tide stations were record breaking hko 2020c e g quarry bay station 2 35 m since 1954 tai po kau station 3 4 m since 1962 and tism bei tsui station 2 58 m since 1974 the return period of the storm surge level recorded at the quarry bay station is estimated to be around 200 years jba 2020 the severe storm surge and waves caused serious flooding in many coastal and low lying areas including neighborhoods in heng fa chuen tko lei yue mun and coastal structures including waterfront promenades public beaches and sewage treatment works were gravely damaged the tko town center fig 5 located in southeastern new territories was severely inundated during typhoon mangkhut upon the joint effect of rainfall storm surges and waves tko is one of the nine new towns in hong kong the location is shown in the supplementary data the town center is a residential area which was built on reclaimed land in junk bay from 1998 although the sea level did not necessarily exceed the seawall crest during typhoon mangkhut referring to measured data from the tide gauge nearby and videos the rising sea level and huge waves drove a large amount of seawater overtopping the seawall fig 6 a and forming a small tsunami as reported by local media the promenades and facilities in the tko waterfront park were substantially damaged fig 6b electricity and water supply were interrupted for some high rise buildings after typhoon mangkhut a wave wall was constructed at the tko waterfront park to reduce the threat from wave overtopping fig 6c 3 2 modeling of coastal flooding to model the inundation in tko during typhoon mangkhut the town center area and the surrounding catchments are included in the model with a grid cell size of 5 0 m which is fine enough to capture the characteristics of urban facilities in detail the total number of grid cell is 140 666 the elevation of each grid cell is obtained from the digital terrain model of hong kong sourced from aerial photographs taken between 2014 and 2015 available at data gov hk it should be noted that building foundation constructions were in process at some sites when these aerial photographs were taken so some modifications on the elevation data at these sites were made according to the adjacent elevations arf and wrf are assigned to cells containing buildings according to the intersection of cells and building shapes identified from satellite images the initial abstraction parameter accounting for rainfall interception by vegetation and ground surface objects the infiltration parameters and the manning s coefficient are determined according to local land cover types referring to flo 2d 2018 and lumb 1965 which are shown in table 1 major public drainage facilities in tko town center are set up in the swmm model fig 5 based on data from the geoinfo map 2020 the stormwater drainage systems in urban area of hong kong are classified into trunk systems and branch systems the branch drains normally with diameters smaller than 1 8 m collect and convey storm water to a trunk drain a river or the sea the recommended design return periods of flood level given by the stormwater drainage manual dsd 2018 for trunk systems and branch systems are 200 years and 50 years respectively the trunk drains and most of the branch drains in tko town center are built in the model with the information of location shape size and invert elevation most of the drainage facilities near the coastline are trunk drains including two large box culverts there are seven outfalls within the study area all of which are located along the coastline and can be affected by the varying sea level regarding the multiple triggers for flooding during typhoon mangkhut the rainfall process fig 7 a recorded at the tko rain station shown in fig 5 is used as the model input and regarded as spatially uniform in the whole study area fig 7b shows hourly data of predicted astronomical tide measured sea level above the chart datum and storm surge recorded at the quarry bay tide station fig 5 located in the victoria harbor the sea level peaked at 3 65 m at 15 00 hkt utc 8 on september 16 the sea level curve is used as the stage time boundary condition for the coastal cells of the model and the drainage outfalls the wave overtopping discharge is estimated with eq 1 for the rubble mound seawall at tko waterfront park and the estimated hydrograph is assigned to the inflow cells along the coastline in eq 1 the crest freeboard rc is calculated as the difference between the elevations of coastal cells and the sea level curves fig 7b for simplicity the elevations of the cells along the coastal boundary are regarded uniform which are approximately 7 146 m above the chart datum according to the eurotop manual γf is assigned as 0 6 for rock amour layer the wave attack angle β is regarded as 0 for the south shore and 58 for the east shore of the study area to obtain the significant wave height hm0 at the seawall toe the offshore wave conditions are transformed to the nearshore area with the rock manual method rock manual 2007 where the information on the seawater depth at the seawall toe foreshore slope gradient and offshore wave conditions are needed referring to the local bathymetric data from the hydrographic office of marine department the seawater depth near the seawall and the foreshore slope gradient are estimated as 7 m and 0 0125 respectively due to the lack of offshore wave measurement data hourly offshore significant wave heights hso and peak wave periods tp fig 7c are obtained from the simulated data at the location of 22 n 114 5 e from the wavewatch iii ww3 global wave model tolman 2009 with a resolution of approximately 0 5 with the calculated hourly nearshore significant wave height hm0 at the seawall toe and the crest freeboard rc varying with sea level curve a time series of overtopping discharge q can be computed which is shown in fig 7d the wave overtopping at the east shore is small due to the large wave attack angle and could be further reduced by a narrow bay which is not considered here in detail the seawall structure in tko complies with the design standards specified in the port works design manual cedd 2003 according to the manual the permissible value of mean overtopping discharge for damage to paved surface is 0 2 m3 s m the calculated overtopping rate during mangkhut exceeds the threshold for around 4 hours indeed the pavement of promenade and the cycle track behind the seawall were severely damaged during mangkhut fig 6b but the integrity of the seawall structure was not seriously affected 3 3 simulated flooding during typhoon mangkhut the tko town center was severely flooded during typhoon mangkhut the simulated maximum flow depths in the coastal area and some photos of inundation from the local press are shown in fig 8 from the water marks observed in a field study by the authors after typhoon mangkhut on september 17 2018 the seawater propagation was from the waterfront to the chin shin street location 8 along the tong chun street location 9 some estates within this area were reported to be inundated including alto residences location 1 the wings location 2 corinthia by the sea location 3 twin peaks location 4 and ocean wings location 5 the underground car park of location 4 where the electric meter room was located was submerged and power cut lasted to september 17 in blocks 1 and 2 dozens of vehicles were submerged and some residents had to leave their home temporarily due to electricity outage especially those who lived on upper floors widespread inundation was mainly in the coastal areas as a result of seawater intrusion from the simulated flood map the chin shin street the south tong chun street the grassy area between locations 2 and 4 and locations 3 and 5 were almost completely inundated which is consistent with the observation the flood water on the low lying section of chin shin street between the parkside location 6 and location 4 was particularly deep which is the location of entrance of the submerged underground car park the inundation is overestimated in the area of the papillons location 7 which was built from 2016 the elevation data of the model are sourced from aerial photographs taken in 2014 and 2015 when there was an undeveloped green field at location 7 the difference in elevation may be the cause for the inconsistence between the simulated results and the observations the evolution of inundation area i e region with flow depths larger than 0 15 m and the average flow depth for all the regions with water depth larger than the threshold of surface detention 0 03 m is shown in fig 9 the inundation area expanded before the peak time of wave overtopping 3 p m on september 16 and then declined slowly the maximum inundation area was 0 274 km2 in the first few hours there were only limited wet region caused by seawater during this period the average flow depth grew with the increase of wave overtopping discharge the average flow depth started to decline with the occurrence of extensive wet area to investigate the whole process how the overtopped seawater propagates in the coastal community the model is run with only the overtopped seawater as input the flow path and inundation caused by seawater intrusion can be distinguished in this way but there could be differences in flow depths fig 10 shows the simulated flow depths at several snapshots at 5 hour intervals showing the seawater propagation process during typhoon mangkhut according to the simulation results seawater flew into chin shin street at around 11 a m on september 16 the residential area from chin shin street to the waterfront including locations 2 3 4 5 were severely inundated from 1 p m to 6 p m on september 16 and the flood water gradually receded afterwards 3 4 effectiveness of drainage facilities in flood hazard mitigation drainage facilities are an important component of urban infrastructure to investigate the effectiveness of the drainage system on flood hazard mitigation upon multiple triggers simulations are conducted in six scenarios shown in table 2 the case of typhoon mangkhut which is validated in section 3 3 is used as the baseline scenario in this scenario rainfall and sea level curve recorded during mangkhut as well as the estimated wave overtopping discharge are considered in the simulation the varying sea level is used as the boundary condition for the drainage outfalls and backflows of seawater at through outfalls are allowed in scenario 1 it is assumed that tidal control structures are applied at drainage outfalls and no backflow is allowed while no drainage facilities are considered in scenario 2 in scenarios 3 5 wave overtopping is not included in the model input and simulations are conducted upon the three drainage conditions fig 11 shows the flood maps simulated in the six scenarios when wave overtopping is considered the net outflows off the drainage system through the outfalls are 892 245 m3 and 962 202 m3 respectively for the cases of drainage outfalls allowing backflow baseline scenario and not allowing backflow scenario 1 the flood extent defined as the area with maximum flow depths larger than 0 15 m becomes smaller around chin shin street when tidal control structures are applied which indicates that tidal control structures help reduce flooding at high sea level situations when wave overtopping is ignored in the analysis the flooding spots are scattered in space in the scenarios when the drainage facilities work scenarios 3 and 4 massive seawater intrusion and widespread inundation would not happen just due to high sea levels during mangkhut which indicates that the severe inundation in tko town center was mainly attributed to wave overtopping ignoring the influence of waves in coastal flooding analysis will underestimate the flooding severity in such cases as typhoon mangkhut regardless of whether wave overtopping is considered in the simulation the flooding both flow depth and flood extent is greatly reduced by the drainage system for both cases of outfall boundary condition backflows are observed in the two cases without tidal control structures which means the drainage process is impeded by the high sea level to some extent from this perspective apart from rainfall induced inundation flooding caused by multiple triggers including the wave overtopping can be reduced through enhancing local drainage capacity 3 5 effectiveness of engineering mitigation measures in extreme scenarios during typhoon mangkhut it was fortunate that the peak of storm surge did not coincide with the high astronomical tide the sea level could be more extreme in the case of the superposition of high tides and peak storm surges which happened during typhoon hato in 2017 to consider the unfavorable combination the recorded time series of storm surge is brought forward 14 hours with the peak of storm surge and the high tide superposed and a synthetic sea level is produced fig 12 b the peak of the synthetic sea level curve is 4 19 m above chart datum which is 0 54 m higher than the measured peak sea level during mangkhut after the incident of wave overtopping during mangkhut a project has been conducted by the civil engineering and development department to build a wave wall of 1 1 m in height at the tko waterfront promenade in this section the possible flood scenarios upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and astronomical tide as well as the effectiveness of the wave wall are investigated with the simulation scenarios shown in table 3 when the wave wall is higher than the embankment crest the crest freeboard rc in eq 1 should be regarded as the distance from the top of wave wall and the sea level van der meer et al 2018 fig 12 shows the sea level curves and overtopping discharges calculated for the four scenarios the case of typhoon mangkhut shown in section 3 3 is used as the baseline in this scenario the overtopping discharges are computed from the measured sea level curve and geometry of the seawall at the time of mangkhut in scenario 6 fig 12b the synthetic sea level curve is used as the shoreline and outfall boundary conditions the overtopping discharges are computed with the synthetic sea level and the geometry of seawall at the time of mangkhut compared to the baseline scenario the peak value of south shore overtopping discharge increases 0 14 m3 s m and the duration for exceeding the limit for paved surface damage extends 2 hours in scenario 7 fig 12a overtopping discharges are computed with the measured sea level and the geometry of sea wall with a wave wall with the peak of overtopping discharge at the south shore reduced by more than 60 compared to the baseline scenario both the synthetic sea level and wave wall are considered in the simulation of scenario 8 fig 12b the simulated maximum flow depths and maximum flow velocities for the four scenarios are compared in fig 13 the flooding would be more severe upon the superposition of the peak storm surge and the high astronomical tide and the flood extent would extend to the north along the chin shin street after the construction of the wave wall the inundation would be markedly eased when facing the measured sea level during mangkhut however upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and high tide there would still be some inundation in the residential area including locations 2 3 and 5 even with the wave wall in addition although outfalls are available at the bottom of the wave wall the wave wall can still reduce the drainage rate at the surface boundary the reduction of drainage efficiency at the coastal boundary due to the construction of wave walls is not considered in the simulations in scenarios 7 and 8 which may underestimate the flooding severity according to the research conducted by helsinki university of technology karvonen et al 2000 the product of flow depth and flow velocity vd can be used to describe the maneuverability and stability for an adult human in flowing water the approximate limit of vd for a petite build human with height times weight value around 70 m kg to keep stable in a normal environmental condition is 0 48 m2 s fig 14 and table 3 show the dangerous areas identified from the simulated maximum vd with this threshold for all the four scenarios it should be noted that the direct impact of the overtopped wave on human stability is not considered here the region identified as dangerous for human stability is very limited 1775 m2 in the residential area for the baseline scenario actually there was no report of injury due to inundation in the tko area during mangkhut largely due to the excellent warning system and precautionary measures in hong kong most people were well sheltered during the super typhoon however upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and astronomical tide scenario 6 quite a few locations 7950 m2 are identified as dangerous for a petite build human some of which are along the chin shin street after the construction of the wave wall dangerous areas almost vanish in both cases of sea level scenarios 7 and 8 the wave wall is therefore regarded effective for protecting the safety of local residents it should be noted that the stability of children in flowing water are not considered who are distinctly more vulnerable to flooding although the identified dangerous zone is very limited the residents should still keep away from low lying areas during typhoons 4 conclusions inundation in a coastal community caused by multiple tropical cyclone driven flooding triggers is investigated in this paper the major conclusions are as follows 1 a dual drainage flood analysis model capable of integrating rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping is proposed wave overtopping is integrated in the flood analysis model in a maneuverable way as an inflow discharge hydrograph estimated from an empirical model 2 a case study is conducted for the coastal flooding in tseung kwan o town center during super typhoon mangkhut in 2018 the flooding situations are well reproduced by the model the widespread inundation was mainly caused by wave overtopping and ignoring the contribution of wave would greatly underestimate the flooding severity 3 the physical drainage facilities are set up in detail in the model simulations upon different drainage scenarios show that the drainage facilities are also effective in mitigating flood hazards induced by wave overtopping although the drainage capacity is somewhat reduced by high sea levels and that tidal control structures can help reduce the flood severity 4 both the flooding scale and dangerous region for pedestrian can be more extensive in the case of unfavorable combinations of storm surge and high astronomical tide building a wave wall can effectively reduce the wave overtopping discharge and eliminate these dangerous zones credit authorship

8133,study region hong kong china study focus this paper aims to develop a flood analysis model to integrate the effects of multiple flooding triggers i e rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping during powerful tropical cyclones and investigate coastal flood hazards in an urban area at the street scale the process of wave overtopping is properly estimated and integrated in a dual drainage

hydrological insights for the region the inundation scenario in tseung kwan o town center during tyhpoon mangkhut is reproduced and comparison between different drainage conditions demonstrates the key role of drainage facilities in the mitigation of flooding induced by wave overtopping although the varying sea level boundary could partly reduce the drainage efficiency in addition possible flood scenarios and pedestrian stability in flowing water upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and astronomical tide as well as the effectiveness of a 1 1 m wave wall are evaluated the overtopping discharge flooding severity and dangerous zones for pedestrian can be markedly reduced by the wave wall keywords flood risk wave overtopping storm surge tide drainage typhoon mangkhut 1 introduction two super typhoons hato and mangkhut made landfall on the pearl river delta in south china in 2017 and 2018 respectively hurricane signal no 10 the highest in hong kong and macao s warning systems which was only issued 15 times since 1946 hko 2020a was issued during the passage of both typhoons severe inundation due to torrential rainfall storm surges and huge waves occurred in low lying and coastal communities which posed threats to the safety of local residents the maximum inundation depth was estimated as 2 38 m and 2 01 m in inner harbor of macao during typhoon hato and mangkhut respectively yang et al 2019 takagi et al 2018 islam and takagi 2020 typhoon hato caused 12 deaths and at least 153 injuries in macao among which at least 5 people drowned in inundated stores and underground car parks in the recent decades flooding related to storm surges induced by tropical cyclones tc frequently happened around the world including hurricane katrina 2005 and hurricane sandy 2012 in the u s fritz et al 2007 bloomberg 2013 and typhoon haiyan 2013 in the philippines lagmay et al 2015 according to observations at the victoria harbor the mean sea level of hong kong rose at a rate of 31 mm per decade during 1954 2019 hko 2020b the superposition of sea level rise and frequent extreme weather events pose growing flooding risks to the low lying coastal areas woodruff et al 2013 dang et al 2018 some of which are densely populated neighborhoods coastal flooding during tcs involves surface runoff of stormwater and tidal flooding induced by high sea levels zellou and rahali 2019 tanim and goharian 2020 the sea level components with relatively long periods such as tides and storm surges can be considered as varying boundary conditions for flood analysis e g smith et al 2012 martinelli et al 2010 qiang et al 2021 however considering the contribution of waves seawater passed over the coastal protection structures and flew inland in the cases of typhoon hato and mangkhut even though the sea level was lower than the elevation of protection structure the coastal flooding would have been significantly underestimated if the wave component had been ignored lapidez et al 2015 in the literature the contribution of waves may be considered with simplified approaches by adding an empirical approximation of wave setup or wave run up and using a revised total sea level as the boundary condition vousdoukas et al 2016 stockdon et al 2006 in reality wave overtopping is a dynamic process which is random in time space and volume and is often described using the average discharge per linear unit width empirical models have been established from physical model tests and applied to estimate the mean overtopping discharge for different kinds of embankment structures for analysis and design purposes e g owen 1980 saville 1955 van der meer et al 2018 in recent years numerical models for simulating wave overtopping process have been developed such as the boussinesq model lynett et al 2010 a nonlinear shallow water model hu et al 2000 and a nonhydrostatic approach gallien 2016 suzuki et al 2017 lerma et al 2018 to investigate coastal inundation researchers have attempted to apply various hydrodynamic and wave models to predict the processes of sea level variation wave overtopping and flooding e g lerma et al 2018 gallien 2016 in addition to flooding erosion behind the seawall structures can be caused by repeated wave overtopping which is likely to affect the structural safety the consequence of seawall failures can be much more severe peng et al 2019 shen et al 2020 peng et al 2021 but is beyond the scope of this paper despite the growing public concern on flood risks posed by severe tcs studies on the flooding hazard in coastal regions upon the multiple tc driven triggers including rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping are still limited the complex coastal flooding problem may be solved by integrating different numerical models to describe coastal water dynamics which however requires significant computational efforts engineering measures including coastal defense structures and drainage facilities are important means of flood hazard mitigation in coastal regions the normal and extreme still water level with a return period of 100 or even 200 years in hong kong including components of tides and storm surges are considered for the seawall cope level cedd 2003 the design permissible value of wave overtopping depends on the use of receiving area and the consequence of wave effects a wave wall or storm wall may be constructed to minimize the amount of wave overtopping the wave wall is a relatively small structure compared to the seawall the reduction factor of wave overtopping by a wave wall constructed at different locations of the embankment structure has been investigated through model tests by van doorslaer et al 2015 2016 quang and van 2014 conducted experimental and numerical studies on the characteristics of wave overtopping on sea dikes with low vertical wave walls showing that the wave run up momentum decreases noticeably due to the impact with the wave walls in metropolitan areas the artificial stormwater drainage facilities provide an important means of urban drainage and may affect the propagation of flood water the drainage process can also be affected by multiple flooding triggers in coastal cities stormwater is usually drained to the sea through drainage facilities and the drainage capacity can be influenced by high sea levels during tcs shen et al 2019 tanim and goharian 2020 detailed description of the drainage network is necessary for the purpose of reproducing flooding hazards in urban areas two dimensional hydraulic models for overland flow are usually coupled with one dimensional sewer flow models to consider the bidirectional flow interactions between the urban drainage facilities and the ground surface e g chang et al 2015 seyoum et al 2012 leandro and martins 2016 the performance of the urban drainage facilities in rainfall driven urban flooding has been evaluated but the performance in the midst of multiple tc driven triggers including wave overtopping is barely understood in order to investigate the propagating and receding process of flooding in coastal urban regions and to evaluate the risk on residents upon multiple flooding triggers during powerful tcs a flood analysis model is developed in this paper to consider the compound effects of wave overtopping high sea levels and rainfall wave overtopping is integrated in the model in a maneuverable way as an inflow discharge hydrograph the model is applied to reproduce a coastal flooding case in tseung kwan o tko hong kong during the super typhoon mangkhut the impacts of engineering mitigation measures including urban drainage facilities and a wave wall are investigated in detail and the built environment is characterized using high resolution lidar data 2 coastal flood modeling considering multiple triggers during tropical cyclones 2 1 overview of coastal flooding in tropical cyclones multiple triggering variables are closely related to coastal flooding during tcs including rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping fig 1 the sea level can be abnormally high with the superposition of astronomical tides and storm surges caused by tcs the varying sea level boundaries at the coastline can affect the drainage process from the landside and a large amount of seawater can overflow inland when the sea level exceeds the crest of the seawall structure along the coastline seawater intrusion can also happen due to wave overtopping even though the still sea level is lower than the crest of seawall seawater can reach and pass over the crest of the protection structure if wave runs up high enough against the face of the seawall the intense rainfall brought by tcs can induce flash floods in the urban area where the storm water is normally drained through artificial facilities like an underground drainage network however the drainage efficiency can be affected by the variation of boundary conditions of drainage outfalls located along the coastline or tidal rivers if tidal control is not applied the process of propagating and receding of inundation during tcs in coastal urban areas are investigated in this paper a flood analysis model is adopted to simulate the dual drainage process between the ground surface and the drainage network and the wave overtopping process is integrated in the model as a predefined inflow hydrograph 2 2 overtopping discharge estimation seawater overtopping happens when the wave run up exceeds the crest of seawall the overtopping process is dynamic during which only some large waves can overtop the structure and the duration and volume of overtopping are random the wave overtopping process can be represented with the mean overtopping discharge q m3 s m in a unit time period the mean overtopping discharge can be estimated with an empirical formula derived from physical model data according to embankment geometry water level and wave conditions at the toe of the structure for example the overtopping discharge for a rubble mound seawall can be estimated with the following equation according to the eurotop manual van der meer et al 2018 1 q g h m 0 3 0 09 exp 1 5 r c γ f γ β h m 0 1 3 where g is the gravitational acceleration hm 0 is the incident significant wave height at the toe of seawall rc is the crest freeboard γf is the influence factor for roughness elements on a slope and γβ is the influence factor for oblique wave attack and can be calculated as 2 γ β 1 0 0063 β where β º is the angle of wave attack defined as the angle between the direction of wave propagation and the axis perpendicular to the structure the wave conditions for overtopping estimation should include wave transformations at the nearshore zone fig 1 to obtain the wave condition at the toe of seawall offshore wave data can be utilized in conjunction with a wave transformation model in this paper the depth limited wave height hm0 in the foreshore zone is estimated using a manual method that considers the effect of wave breaking design graphs are available from a simple 1d energy decay numerical model rock manual 2007 fig 4 40 as shown in fig 2 hm0 can be found from the design graphs according to local seawater depth at the toe of seawall h foreshore slope m deep water wave length lop and deep water wave steepness sop deep water wave length lop gtp 2 2π and deep water wave steepness sop hso lop can be calculated from deep water wave height hso and peak period tp the time series of shallow water significant wave height can be obtained from observed hso and tp values and local foreshore geometry and the process of overtopping discharge can then be computed with the varying sea level 2 3 flood analysis model for coastal urban areas to model the flooding process in coastal urban areas during tcs a grid based flow routing model flo 2d flo 2d 2018 is used the model has been widely applied for flooding analysis on land e g erena et al 2018 petroselli et al 2019 in this section the application of this model is expanded for tidal flooding analysis in the flow routing model the infiltration process is calculated with the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 the overland flow is described using one dimensional shallow water equations which are solved for a cell considering flows in eight directions i e four compass directions and four diagonal directions the depth averaged flow velocity in each flow direction is calculated with 3 h t h v x i f q 4 s f s 0 h x v g v x 1 g v t where h is the flow depth t is time v is the depth averaged flow velocity along x direction i is the rainfall intensity q is the ratio of volume flow rate into drainage inlets to the area of the cell containing the inlets sf is the frictional slope s0 is the bed slope and g is the gravitational acceleration apart from the overland flow the sewer flow in the urban drainage facilities is calculated with the storm water management model swmm rossman et al 2005 the overland flow and the sewer flow are coupled within each computational time step and the bi directional flow exchange between the ground surface and drainage conduits are calculated by comparing the pressure head at nodes of drainage inlets and the surface water elevations of the cells containing the drainage inlets the technical details on model integration can be found in flo 2d 2018 for the urban environment the effect of surface obstacles on the surface flow is reflected by two factors i e an area reduction factor arf for considering the reduction in water storage and a width reduction factor wrf for considering the reduction in flow width for a certain flow direction of the cell o brien et al 1993 one arf and eight wrfs are calculated for each cell according to the ratio of the occupied area of buildings to the cell area and to the area of a sub cell representing a certain flow direction respectively multiple flooding triggers during tcs are considered including rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping fig 3 adapted from qiang et al 2021 illustrates how the flooding triggers are considered in the model to simulate the process of seawater intrusion due to wave overtopping inflow cells with the estimated wave overtopping discharge hydrographs are set along the coastline in addition temporally varying stage boundary cells are assigned at the seaward side next to the coastal inflow cells which allows seawater to flow inland when the sea level is higher than the elevation of the coastal cells and to flow back to the sea when the sea level declines flow exchange between the drainage system and the sea at the drainage outfalls are also considered by setting a tidal boundary condition with the water head at outfalls determined by the sea level variation in this way the effects of storm surge on the drainage rate can be considered 3 coastal flooding in tseung kwan o town center during super typhoons 3 1 typhoon mangkhut and inundation in tseung kwan o town center typhoon mangkhut in 2018 was one of the most powerful tcs making landfall in the pearl river delta in the past decades hurricane signal no 10 was released by hong kong observatory in the morning of september 16 and lasted 10 h which was the second longest since 1946 hko 2020a fig 4 shows the path of typhoon mangkhut it formed over the western north pacific and developed into a super typhoon on september 11 weakened after passing across the northern part of luzon philippines but re constructed the eye before making landfall in jiangmen guangdong province on september 16 typhoon mangkhut caused severe damage in the philippines and china according to press reports there were at least 82 deaths 138 injuries and two missing in luzon and around 15 000 houses collapsed at least 458 injuries in hong kong and 40 injuries in macao were reported there were at least 6 fatalities and 4 64 million people affected in guangdong guangxi hainan guizhou hunan and yunnan provinces of china cma 2018 mangkhut passed to the south and southwest of hong kong which brought east and southeast onshore winds pushing seawater onshore the track of mangkhut along with its extensive circulation caused severe storm surges in hong kong the maximum storm surge at a number of tide stations were record breaking hko 2020c e g quarry bay station 2 35 m since 1954 tai po kau station 3 4 m since 1962 and tism bei tsui station 2 58 m since 1974 the return period of the storm surge level recorded at the quarry bay station is estimated to be around 200 years jba 2020 the severe storm surge and waves caused serious flooding in many coastal and low lying areas including neighborhoods in heng fa chuen tko lei yue mun and coastal structures including waterfront promenades public beaches and sewage treatment works were gravely damaged the tko town center fig 5 located in southeastern new territories was severely inundated during typhoon mangkhut upon the joint effect of rainfall storm surges and waves tko is one of the nine new towns in hong kong the location is shown in the supplementary data the town center is a residential area which was built on reclaimed land in junk bay from 1998 although the sea level did not necessarily exceed the seawall crest during typhoon mangkhut referring to measured data from the tide gauge nearby and videos the rising sea level and huge waves drove a large amount of seawater overtopping the seawall fig 6 a and forming a small tsunami as reported by local media the promenades and facilities in the tko waterfront park were substantially damaged fig 6b electricity and water supply were interrupted for some high rise buildings after typhoon mangkhut a wave wall was constructed at the tko waterfront park to reduce the threat from wave overtopping fig 6c 3 2 modeling of coastal flooding to model the inundation in tko during typhoon mangkhut the town center area and the surrounding catchments are included in the model with a grid cell size of 5 0 m which is fine enough to capture the characteristics of urban facilities in detail the total number of grid cell is 140 666 the elevation of each grid cell is obtained from the digital terrain model of hong kong sourced from aerial photographs taken between 2014 and 2015 available at data gov hk it should be noted that building foundation constructions were in process at some sites when these aerial photographs were taken so some modifications on the elevation data at these sites were made according to the adjacent elevations arf and wrf are assigned to cells containing buildings according to the intersection of cells and building shapes identified from satellite images the initial abstraction parameter accounting for rainfall interception by vegetation and ground surface objects the infiltration parameters and the manning s coefficient are determined according to local land cover types referring to flo 2d 2018 and lumb 1965 which are shown in table 1 major public drainage facilities in tko town center are set up in the swmm model fig 5 based on data from the geoinfo map 2020 the stormwater drainage systems in urban area of hong kong are classified into trunk systems and branch systems the branch drains normally with diameters smaller than 1 8 m collect and convey storm water to a trunk drain a river or the sea the recommended design return periods of flood level given by the stormwater drainage manual dsd 2018 for trunk systems and branch systems are 200 years and 50 years respectively the trunk drains and most of the branch drains in tko town center are built in the model with the information of location shape size and invert elevation most of the drainage facilities near the coastline are trunk drains including two large box culverts there are seven outfalls within the study area all of which are located along the coastline and can be affected by the varying sea level regarding the multiple triggers for flooding during typhoon mangkhut the rainfall process fig 7 a recorded at the tko rain station shown in fig 5 is used as the model input and regarded as spatially uniform in the whole study area fig 7b shows hourly data of predicted astronomical tide measured sea level above the chart datum and storm surge recorded at the quarry bay tide station fig 5 located in the victoria harbor the sea level peaked at 3 65 m at 15 00 hkt utc 8 on september 16 the sea level curve is used as the stage time boundary condition for the coastal cells of the model and the drainage outfalls the wave overtopping discharge is estimated with eq 1 for the rubble mound seawall at tko waterfront park and the estimated hydrograph is assigned to the inflow cells along the coastline in eq 1 the crest freeboard rc is calculated as the difference between the elevations of coastal cells and the sea level curves fig 7b for simplicity the elevations of the cells along the coastal boundary are regarded uniform which are approximately 7 146 m above the chart datum according to the eurotop manual γf is assigned as 0 6 for rock amour layer the wave attack angle β is regarded as 0 for the south shore and 58 for the east shore of the study area to obtain the significant wave height hm0 at the seawall toe the offshore wave conditions are transformed to the nearshore area with the rock manual method rock manual 2007 where the information on the seawater depth at the seawall toe foreshore slope gradient and offshore wave conditions are needed referring to the local bathymetric data from the hydrographic office of marine department the seawater depth near the seawall and the foreshore slope gradient are estimated as 7 m and 0 0125 respectively due to the lack of offshore wave measurement data hourly offshore significant wave heights hso and peak wave periods tp fig 7c are obtained from the simulated data at the location of 22 n 114 5 e from the wavewatch iii ww3 global wave model tolman 2009 with a resolution of approximately 0 5 with the calculated hourly nearshore significant wave height hm0 at the seawall toe and the crest freeboard rc varying with sea level curve a time series of overtopping discharge q can be computed which is shown in fig 7d the wave overtopping at the east shore is small due to the large wave attack angle and could be further reduced by a narrow bay which is not considered here in detail the seawall structure in tko complies with the design standards specified in the port works design manual cedd 2003 according to the manual the permissible value of mean overtopping discharge for damage to paved surface is 0 2 m3 s m the calculated overtopping rate during mangkhut exceeds the threshold for around 4 hours indeed the pavement of promenade and the cycle track behind the seawall were severely damaged during mangkhut fig 6b but the integrity of the seawall structure was not seriously affected 3 3 simulated flooding during typhoon mangkhut the tko town center was severely flooded during typhoon mangkhut the simulated maximum flow depths in the coastal area and some photos of inundation from the local press are shown in fig 8 from the water marks observed in a field study by the authors after typhoon mangkhut on september 17 2018 the seawater propagation was from the waterfront to the chin shin street location 8 along the tong chun street location 9 some estates within this area were reported to be inundated including alto residences location 1 the wings location 2 corinthia by the sea location 3 twin peaks location 4 and ocean wings location 5 the underground car park of location 4 where the electric meter room was located was submerged and power cut lasted to september 17 in blocks 1 and 2 dozens of vehicles were submerged and some residents had to leave their home temporarily due to electricity outage especially those who lived on upper floors widespread inundation was mainly in the coastal areas as a result of seawater intrusion from the simulated flood map the chin shin street the south tong chun street the grassy area between locations 2 and 4 and locations 3 and 5 were almost completely inundated which is consistent with the observation the flood water on the low lying section of chin shin street between the parkside location 6 and location 4 was particularly deep which is the location of entrance of the submerged underground car park the inundation is overestimated in the area of the papillons location 7 which was built from 2016 the elevation data of the model are sourced from aerial photographs taken in 2014 and 2015 when there was an undeveloped green field at location 7 the difference in elevation may be the cause for the inconsistence between the simulated results and the observations the evolution of inundation area i e region with flow depths larger than 0 15 m and the average flow depth for all the regions with water depth larger than the threshold of surface detention 0 03 m is shown in fig 9 the inundation area expanded before the peak time of wave overtopping 3 p m on september 16 and then declined slowly the maximum inundation area was 0 274 km2 in the first few hours there were only limited wet region caused by seawater during this period the average flow depth grew with the increase of wave overtopping discharge the average flow depth started to decline with the occurrence of extensive wet area to investigate the whole process how the overtopped seawater propagates in the coastal community the model is run with only the overtopped seawater as input the flow path and inundation caused by seawater intrusion can be distinguished in this way but there could be differences in flow depths fig 10 shows the simulated flow depths at several snapshots at 5 hour intervals showing the seawater propagation process during typhoon mangkhut according to the simulation results seawater flew into chin shin street at around 11 a m on september 16 the residential area from chin shin street to the waterfront including locations 2 3 4 5 were severely inundated from 1 p m to 6 p m on september 16 and the flood water gradually receded afterwards 3 4 effectiveness of drainage facilities in flood hazard mitigation drainage facilities are an important component of urban infrastructure to investigate the effectiveness of the drainage system on flood hazard mitigation upon multiple triggers simulations are conducted in six scenarios shown in table 2 the case of typhoon mangkhut which is validated in section 3 3 is used as the baseline scenario in this scenario rainfall and sea level curve recorded during mangkhut as well as the estimated wave overtopping discharge are considered in the simulation the varying sea level is used as the boundary condition for the drainage outfalls and backflows of seawater at through outfalls are allowed in scenario 1 it is assumed that tidal control structures are applied at drainage outfalls and no backflow is allowed while no drainage facilities are considered in scenario 2 in scenarios 3 5 wave overtopping is not included in the model input and simulations are conducted upon the three drainage conditions fig 11 shows the flood maps simulated in the six scenarios when wave overtopping is considered the net outflows off the drainage system through the outfalls are 892 245 m3 and 962 202 m3 respectively for the cases of drainage outfalls allowing backflow baseline scenario and not allowing backflow scenario 1 the flood extent defined as the area with maximum flow depths larger than 0 15 m becomes smaller around chin shin street when tidal control structures are applied which indicates that tidal control structures help reduce flooding at high sea level situations when wave overtopping is ignored in the analysis the flooding spots are scattered in space in the scenarios when the drainage facilities work scenarios 3 and 4 massive seawater intrusion and widespread inundation would not happen just due to high sea levels during mangkhut which indicates that the severe inundation in tko town center was mainly attributed to wave overtopping ignoring the influence of waves in coastal flooding analysis will underestimate the flooding severity in such cases as typhoon mangkhut regardless of whether wave overtopping is considered in the simulation the flooding both flow depth and flood extent is greatly reduced by the drainage system for both cases of outfall boundary condition backflows are observed in the two cases without tidal control structures which means the drainage process is impeded by the high sea level to some extent from this perspective apart from rainfall induced inundation flooding caused by multiple triggers including the wave overtopping can be reduced through enhancing local drainage capacity 3 5 effectiveness of engineering mitigation measures in extreme scenarios during typhoon mangkhut it was fortunate that the peak of storm surge did not coincide with the high astronomical tide the sea level could be more extreme in the case of the superposition of high tides and peak storm surges which happened during typhoon hato in 2017 to consider the unfavorable combination the recorded time series of storm surge is brought forward 14 hours with the peak of storm surge and the high tide superposed and a synthetic sea level is produced fig 12 b the peak of the synthetic sea level curve is 4 19 m above chart datum which is 0 54 m higher than the measured peak sea level during mangkhut after the incident of wave overtopping during mangkhut a project has been conducted by the civil engineering and development department to build a wave wall of 1 1 m in height at the tko waterfront promenade in this section the possible flood scenarios upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and astronomical tide as well as the effectiveness of the wave wall are investigated with the simulation scenarios shown in table 3 when the wave wall is higher than the embankment crest the crest freeboard rc in eq 1 should be regarded as the distance from the top of wave wall and the sea level van der meer et al 2018 fig 12 shows the sea level curves and overtopping discharges calculated for the four scenarios the case of typhoon mangkhut shown in section 3 3 is used as the baseline in this scenario the overtopping discharges are computed from the measured sea level curve and geometry of the seawall at the time of mangkhut in scenario 6 fig 12b the synthetic sea level curve is used as the shoreline and outfall boundary conditions the overtopping discharges are computed with the synthetic sea level and the geometry of seawall at the time of mangkhut compared to the baseline scenario the peak value of south shore overtopping discharge increases 0 14 m3 s m and the duration for exceeding the limit for paved surface damage extends 2 hours in scenario 7 fig 12a overtopping discharges are computed with the measured sea level and the geometry of sea wall with a wave wall with the peak of overtopping discharge at the south shore reduced by more than 60 compared to the baseline scenario both the synthetic sea level and wave wall are considered in the simulation of scenario 8 fig 12b the simulated maximum flow depths and maximum flow velocities for the four scenarios are compared in fig 13 the flooding would be more severe upon the superposition of the peak storm surge and the high astronomical tide and the flood extent would extend to the north along the chin shin street after the construction of the wave wall the inundation would be markedly eased when facing the measured sea level during mangkhut however upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and high tide there would still be some inundation in the residential area including locations 2 3 and 5 even with the wave wall in addition although outfalls are available at the bottom of the wave wall the wave wall can still reduce the drainage rate at the surface boundary the reduction of drainage efficiency at the coastal boundary due to the construction of wave walls is not considered in the simulations in scenarios 7 and 8 which may underestimate the flooding severity according to the research conducted by helsinki university of technology karvonen et al 2000 the product of flow depth and flow velocity vd can be used to describe the maneuverability and stability for an adult human in flowing water the approximate limit of vd for a petite build human with height times weight value around 70 m kg to keep stable in a normal environmental condition is 0 48 m2 s fig 14 and table 3 show the dangerous areas identified from the simulated maximum vd with this threshold for all the four scenarios it should be noted that the direct impact of the overtopped wave on human stability is not considered here the region identified as dangerous for human stability is very limited 1775 m2 in the residential area for the baseline scenario actually there was no report of injury due to inundation in the tko area during mangkhut largely due to the excellent warning system and precautionary measures in hong kong most people were well sheltered during the super typhoon however upon the unfavorable combination of storm surge and astronomical tide scenario 6 quite a few locations 7950 m2 are identified as dangerous for a petite build human some of which are along the chin shin street after the construction of the wave wall dangerous areas almost vanish in both cases of sea level scenarios 7 and 8 the wave wall is therefore regarded effective for protecting the safety of local residents it should be noted that the stability of children in flowing water are not considered who are distinctly more vulnerable to flooding although the identified dangerous zone is very limited the residents should still keep away from low lying areas during typhoons 4 conclusions inundation in a coastal community caused by multiple tropical cyclone driven flooding triggers is investigated in this paper the major conclusions are as follows 1 a dual drainage flood analysis model capable of integrating rainfall high sea levels and wave overtopping is proposed wave overtopping is integrated in the flood analysis model in a maneuverable way as an inflow discharge hydrograph estimated from an empirical model 2 a case study is conducted for the coastal flooding in tseung kwan o town center during super typhoon mangkhut in 2018 the flooding situations are well reproduced by the model the widespread inundation was mainly caused by wave overtopping and ignoring the contribution of wave would greatly underestimate the flooding severity 3 the physical drainage facilities are set up in detail in the model simulations upon different drainage scenarios show that the drainage facilities are also effective in mitigating flood hazards induced by wave overtopping although the drainage capacity is somewhat reduced by high sea levels and that tidal control structures can help reduce the flood severity 4 both the flooding scale and dangerous region for pedestrian can be more extensive in the case of unfavorable combinations of storm surge and high astronomical tide building a wave wall can effectively reduce the wave overtopping discharge and eliminate these dangerous zones credit authorship

8134,study region nile basin africa study focus the accurate representation of precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration eta patterns is crucial for water resources management yet there remains a high spatial and temporal variability among gridded products particularly over data scarce regions we evaluated the performance of eleven state of the art p products and seven eta products over the nile basin using a four step procedure i p products were evaluated at the monthly scale through a point to pixel approach ii streamflow was modelled using the random forest machine learning technique and simulated for well performing catchments for 2009 2018 to correspond with eta product availability iii eta products were evaluated at the multiannual scale using the water balance method and iv the ability of the best performing p and eta products to represent monthly variations in terrestrial water storage δ tws was assessed through a comparison with grace level 3 data new hydrological insights for the region chirpsv2 was the best performing p product median monthly kge of 0 80 and pmlv2 and waporv2 1 the best performing eta products over the majority of the evaluated catchments the application of the water balance using these best performing products captures the seasonality of δ tws well over the white nile basin but overestimates seasonality over the blue nile basin our study demonstrates how gridded p and eta products can be evaluated over extremely data scarce conditions using an easily transferable methodology keywords precipitation evapotranspiration water balance remote sensing random forest grace 1 introduction precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration eta also referred to as evaporation see miralles et al 2020 are two major components of the water cycle and their accurate characterisation in time and space is of vital importance in hydrology water resources management agricultural planning and many other fields p can be measured directly by rain gauges which provide accurate information at the point scale however a dense station network is required to obtain reliable estimates of its spatial patterns garcia et al 2008 villarini et al 2008 adhikary et al 2015 while p is directly measured methods such as the bowen ratio and the eddy covariance are commonly used to derive estimates of eta rates from ground based measurements at discrete locations but in addition to the high density of measurements required to understand spatial patterns of eta the installation of these instruments can be labour and cost intensive wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 over the previous decades high quality gridded p and eta datasets based on novel techniques have become widely available which account for the spatial and temporal distributions of these variables gridded p products are typically based on i the interpolation of ground based measurements ii satellite based retrievals using infrared and or passive microwave data and iii reanalysis models sun et al 2018 on the other hand remote sensing based eta estimates are mainly derived through calculation methods such as the surface energy balance seb bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007 penman monteith pm mu et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 priestley taylor pt fisher et al 2008 and t s vi space methods price 1990 among others e g ryu et al 2011 wang and bras 2011 for comprehensive reviews on methodologies used to derive p and eta products the reader is referred to sun et al 2018 and zhang et al 2016 respectively gauge based gridded p products lose accuracy over areas where the gauge network density is low xie et al 1996 schneider et al 2014 satellite based p products perform better at longer temporal scales maggioni and massari 2018 sun et al 2018 and their performance is influenced by climate with lower performances over arid regions sun et al 2018 as well as for intense p events herold et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2020 satellite based products tend to perform better in the tropics because the convective systems are more related to cold cloud top temperatures levizzani et al 2001 nauss and kokhanovsky 2006 while reanalysis products are consistent with large scale circulation systems gehne et al 2016 because of their ability of simulate synoptic scale weather systems haiden et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 the performance of p products is commonly evaluated through point to pixel analyses hydrological modelling and triple collocation procedures e g stisen and sandholt 2010 beck et al 2017 massari et al 2017 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2018 gridded eta products are typically derived through the extrapolation of methodologies that were initially developed for local scale applications mccabe et al 2016 because eta in gridded products is derived as an energy variable i e energy flux its estimation relies on accurate representations of numerous input variables most notably net radiation near surface air temperature water vapour pressure and visible and near infrared vnir measurements for phenology and vegetation cover fisher et al 2017 some relevant conclusions from global evaluations of eta products are reanalysis based datasets have the highest global mean estimates followed by remote sensing based datasets and then land surface models mueller et al 2011 not all products account for irrigated areas pan et al 2020 and that there is an increased variability in eta estimates over arid and semi arid regions pan et al 2020 assessing the water balance closure is a common approach to evaluate the accuracy of these products when insufficient ground based eta measurements are available e g senay et al 2011 liu et al 2016 moreira et al 2019 weerasinghe et al 2020 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 there is no best performing p product or eta product worldwide with the relative performance of products specific to the study area miralles et al 2016 beck et al 2017 meaning that the performance of a product over a particular area should be assessed prior to any application zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 khan et al 2018 zandler et al 2019 in the data scarce continent of africa there is a high spatial and temporal variability among estimates from gridded p and eta products mueller et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 awange et al 2016 beck et al 2017 sun et al 2018 weerasinghe et al 2020 while in the nile basin relatively few ground based observations are used by some of these gridded products to correct their estimates resulting in a reduced reliability karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 for instance systematic underestimations of p have been reported over the northern arid regions of the nile beck et al 2020 and of eta over the blue nile weerasinghe et al 2020 table 1 presents a summary of the most relevant studies that have assessed the performances of gridded p and eta products over or within the nile basin where it is evident that most studies assess either p products or eta products rather than both of the identified studies that assess both p and eta product performance over the nile basin bastiaanssen et al 2014 considers only two p products trmm 3b43v7 and fews net and one eta product ssebop to evaluate water balance closure at the multiannual scale over the upper blue nile basin abera et al 2017 used one p product sm2r cci to force a hydrological model and compared the eta model outputs with two gridded eta products gleamv3 beta and mod16 while koukoula et al 2020 assessed 18 reanalysis datasets at the monthly temporal scale against in situ p and q measurements as well as a satellite based eta dataset in addition two studies listed in table 1 used the water balance approach to only evaluate eta product performance weerasinghe et al 2020 used a mean ensemble of gridded p inputs to evaluate eta products at the multiannual scale and blatchford et al 2020 evaluated only one eta product waporv2 1 over the nile basin to the best of our knowledge there is no study that comprehensively assesses the performance of both gridded p and eta products at different temporal scales and over multiple catchments in the nile basin a greater understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of the key components of the water balance over this basin will greatly assist many decision making processes related to water resources management such as the optimisation of agricultural practices streamflow q modelling drought characterisation and the development of national and transboundary water plans mohamed et al 2006 bayissa et al 2015 abdelmoneim et al 2020 shokr 2020 ayyad and khalifa 2021 through the implementation of statistical comparisons between point based measurements and gridded product estimates machine learning techniques to simulate q and the application of the water balance this study evaluates the spatial and temporal performance of numerous gridded p and eta products over the nile basin based on these results we assess whether the best performing p and eta products are able to represent i seasonality of the terrestrial water storage tws over nile subcatchments and ii the multiannual water balance of the entire nile basin 2 study area the nile river basin extends over eleven african countries and has a drainage area of about 3 15 million km 2 the upper areas of the basin are located in a tropical

2018 dahle et al 2019 wiese et al 2019 save 2020 as described by landerer and swenson 2012 grace level 3 data are generated by downscaling the filtered standard native grace products with an approximate spatial resolution of 3 330 km at the equator cell size of approximately 100 000 km 2 to a resolution of 1 110 km at the equator because of this downscaling process adjacent cells are highly correlated to each other meaning that more representative results are obtained when evaluating catchments larger than the 100 000 km 2 footprint of the native grace data scanlon et al 2016 cooley and landerer 2020 the level 3 products provide information of tws deviation from a mean condition calculated over 2005 2010 4 methods fig 2 illustrates the four step procedure implemented to evaluate the performance of the gridded p and eta products the evaluation period for each step was selected based on data availability of ground based observations and gridded products first we evaluated p products at the monthly temporal scale through a statistical comparison against the rain gauge data over the period where the majority of p products are available section 4 1 because all evaluated eta products are available for 2009 2018 and we did not have sufficient q data for that period we simulated q using a random forest rf model over the 23 catchments from 1981 when all gridded rf model inputs were available to the end of the q observations corresponding to each catchment for the catchments where modelling performed well we then simulated q for 2009 2018 section 4 2 third adopting the identified best performing p product and the simulated q time series we evaluated eta product performance for each catchment by determining the relative error in closing the water balance at the multiannual scale under the assumption that the multiannual change in storage can be neglected section 4 3 finally we compared the derived monthly δ tws values obtained using the best performing p and eta products δ tws wb with those obtained from grace level 3 data δ tws grace starting in 2009 due to eta product availability and finishing in 2017 due to grace data availability we also validated the assumption that δ tws is negligible in the application of the water balance at the multiannual scale section 4 4 for steps 3 and 4 we applied the water balance method at the catchment scale see senay et al 2011 long et al 2014 liu et al 2016 moreira et al 2019 weerasinghe et al 2020 according to eq 1 1 p q eta δ tws where p is the precipitation q is the catchment runoff eta is the actual evapotranspiration and δ tws is the change in terrestrial water storage all values are expressed in mm averaged over the area of the catchment 4 1 evaluation of precipitation products the p product performances were evaluated using a point to pixel approach at the monthly temporal scale over 1983 2011 the start of the evaluation period was selected because the majority nine of the eleven p products have data from 1983 onwards while the end of the evaluation period was selected because ground based p data were only available until 2011 in this method the time series of observed data here rain gauge data are compared against simulated data here the corresponding grid cells from the p products using a performance index the point to pixel approach assumes that the rain gauge measurements are representative values over the corresponding grid cell e g thiemig et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2018 the p products that were obtained at a sub monthly scale were aggregated to the monthly scale except for when temporal data gaps existed in which case no monthly values were calculated to ensure a consistent point to pixel comparison all products were resampled to the same spatial resolution 0 25 using bilinear interpolation some p products use data from rain gauge stations to correct their estimates hence the inclusion of these stations in the product evaluation may bias the results from the 90 stations described in section 3 1 the 31 that form part of the fao or ghcn networks which are used by chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 to correct their estimates were discarded for the evaluation for performance assessment to evaluate the p products against the remaining 59 stations we selected the modified kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 because i it can be decomposed into three components that allow a better understanding of the origin of mismatches ii in contrast to typical measures of performance based on squared residuals it avoids assigning a disproportional weight to high values and iii it allows a fair intercomparison of performance across different climatic conditions schaefli and gupta 2007 criss and winston 2008 gupta et al 2009 thiemig et al 2013 baez villanueva et al 2018 the kge is described in eq 2 2 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 the kge compares observed data with simulated data and consists of three components the pearson s linear correlation r eq 3 which measures the temporal dynamics the bias ratio β eq 4 which measures the total volume a value greater than 1 represents an overestimation of the simulations while a value less than 1 represents an underestimation and the variability ratio γ eq 5 which measures the relative dispersion between simulations and observations gupta et al 2009

balance reliable q data were required for the period where all eta estimates are available 2009 2018 because only one q station had multiple years of observed data after 2009 we implemented an rf model to simulate monthly q for 2009 2018 over more catchments machine learning techniques have been widely applied in q modelling studies for reviews see tyralis et al 2019 sit et al 2020 in this study we selected an rf model to simulate q based on gridded p t and pet data rf methods have been widely used in q prediction for many reasons including i their demonstrated high predictive performance shortridge et al 2016 tyralis et al 2019 schoppa et al 2020 ii their ability to represent non linear relationships between climatological variables and q shortridge et al 2016 yang et al 2017 konapala and mishra 2020 and iii their ability to not produce biased estimates or lead to overfitting díaz uriarte and alvarez de andrés 2006 biau and scornet 2016 hengl et al 2018 tyralis et al 2019 rf is an ensemble machine learning method that works by constructing numerous decision trees using the relationship between independent and dependent variables and can be used for supervised classification and regression tasks breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 biau and scornet 2016 a lumped model was implemented using catchment averaged monthly time series of the best performing p product as well as era5 pet and t as inputs the year 1981 was selected as the start date for modelling because it is the first year where both the best performing p product see section 5 1 and era5 datasets are available the end date for modelling each catchment corresponded to the availability of q data the general formulation used to model the monthly q was adapted from the approach outlined in shortridge et al 2016 6 q t f p t p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 p t 4 t t t t 1 t t 2 t t 3 t t 4 pet t pet t 1 pet t 2 pet t 3 pet t 4 ε t where p t t t and pet t are the catchment averaged monthly total precipitation mean temperature and mean potential evaporation at month t respectively and ε t is the model error the subscript t n represents n months before the month t the modelled period for each catchment was divided into a calibration period using the first 70 of the available q time series and a validation period using the remaining 30 due to the differing length of available time series of q observations in each catchment the lengths of these periods varied accordingly the rf model was trained over the calibration period using the formulation described in eq 6 with the following rf configuration number of trees set to 1000 number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split set as the number of predictors divided by 3 and minimum size of terminal nodes set to 5 the performance of q simulations was evaluated using the kge and its components during the validation period based on thiemig et al 2013 a kge greater than 0 75 was used to select a well performing model furthermore the β component eq 4 of the kge was used to evaluate the ability of the model to represent the total volume of estimated q because its accurate estimation is crucial in the application of the simplified water balance therefore in addition to ensuring a kge 0 75 only catchments with a β component within the range of 0 80 β 1 20 were selected to avoid introducing bias into the evaluation the implementation of these selection criteria may result in a smaller selection of catchments to evaluate the performance of the eta products but at the same time guarantees a higher degree of reliability in the q estimates for the well performing catchments monthly q time series were generated for 2009 2018 to ensure that the widest possible range of input variables were captured by the rf model we re trained the model for each selected catchment using the observed data from the entire period available post 1981 instead of only the calibration period that was used to test model performance 4 3 evaluation of actual evapotranspiration products we evaluated the performances of the gridded eta products at the multiannual scale through the application of the water balance method eq 1 over the catchments where q modelling performed well assuming that δ tws is negligible at the multiannual scale liu et al 2016 we calculated the theoretical value of eta according to the water balance eta wb as 7 eta wb p q where all values are mean annual catchment averaged accumulations expressed in mm and p is calculated using the best performing p product we then compared the mean annual eta for each gridded product with eta wb and the closer that the two results are to each other the better performing the eta product is inferred to be over that catchment note that this method only indicates whether the total eta estimated over the catchment is accurate regardless of the spatial distribution of eta some of the evaluated eta products have data gaps because estimates are not calculated over certain areas gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and pmlv2 do not calculate eta over water bodies while in addition the mod16 product does not provide eta for non vegetated grid cells running et al 2019 we did not consider these missing values when calculating catchment averaged eta values for products with data gaps furthermore pmlv2 values over large water bodies which are provided as zeroes were discarded 4 4 ability to represent changes in total water storage we selected the most downstream catchments with well performing simulated q for both the blue nile and white nile to evaluate the best performing p and eta products at the monthly temporal scale we extracted monthly catchment averaged time series of the best performing p and eta products and combined with the simulated q derived monthly time series of expected changes in storage δ tws wb for 01 2009 06 2017 according to eq 1 we compared these expected values with δ tws grace which we derived from the arithmetic mean of the level 3 solutions from the three official grace data centres the arithmetic mean was used to reduce noise in the gravity field solutions sakumura et al 2014 because of the low spatial resolution of the product we accounted for the percentage of each grid cell that lies within the respective catchment boundary furthermore we used δ tws grace to evaluate the assumption that δ tws is negligible our application of the water balance used for eta product evaluation at the multiannual scale grace level 3 data from the first mission are available for 04 2002 06 2017 and the evaluation of eta products was selected as 01 2009 12 2018 we calculated the trend of δ tws per catchment over the overlap period 01 2009 06 2017 based on fitting a linear trendline to the 12 month rolling average tws as recommended by scanlon et al 2016 and cooley and landerer 2020 we did not evaluate catchments with an area less than 100 000 km 2 because of their smaller size relative to the native spatial resolution of grace data see section 3 2 4 for all analyses we used the r environment 3 6 0 r core team 2013 and the following r packages raster hijmans 2020 for the processing and statistical analyses of gridded datasets hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2020a for the calculation of performance indices hydrotsm zambrano bigiarini 2020b for managing time series data randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 for building the rf model to predict q and rgdal bivand 2020 for working with vector data for more information on these r packages the reader is referred to their respective literature 5 results 5 1 performance of precipitation products the performances of the eleven p products at the monthly temporal scale at the locations of the 59 evaluated rain gauge stations are presented as boxplots in fig 3 the results indicate that chirpsv2 with a median kge of 0 80 was the overall best performing product followed by gpccv2020 0 78 cru ts4 04 0 77 and mswepv2 2 0 75 chirpsv2 exhibited the best median bias 1 00 as well as showing the smallest interquartile range for bias 0 11 gpccv2020 had the best median r 0 89 however it presented a higher dispersion in the r values compared to chirpsv2 and cru ts4 04 cru ts4 04 exhibited the best median variability ratio 1 01 followed by chirpsv2 0 99 all products showed similar performances except for era5 arc2 and cmorphv1 indicating that the products can represent to some extent the monthly p patterns over the nile basin fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the kge values demonstrating that the best performing p products i e chirpsv2 gpccv2020 and cru ts4 04 perform consistently well over the spatial extent of the study area where stations were available the northernmost station evaluated i e after excluding fao and ghcn stations is located at a longitude of 18 1 which means that there are no rain gauge data available to evaluate product performance in the arid north of the nile basin chirpsv2 was considered as the best performing p product at the monthly scale because i it outperformed all other p products see fig 3 ii it showed a consistent high performance throughout the study area at the evaluated locations see fig 4 and iii it is almost unbiased with a median β of 1 00 and low dispersion compared to the other products these results demonstrate that chirpsv2 can be deemed suitable for application in the evaluation of eta products using the water balance 5 2 streamflow modelling table 4 summarises the results obtained for modelling q over all catchments listing the kge values for the calibration and validation periods as well as the β values for the validation period note that due to q data availability the modelling period varied among catchments and the calibration period was always selected as the first 70 of the available time series for each catchment leaving the remaining 30 for validation the catchments fulfilling the performance criteria for the validation period i e kge 0 75 and 0 80 β 1 20 are underlined and shown in bold text the results in table 4 show that nine catchments fulfilled the designated criteria to be considered as suitable for q simulation for 2009 2018 for our case study all nine catchments with kge 0 75 also yielded β values within the range 0 80 β 1 20 fig 5 illustrates the hydrographs for these nine catchments displaying both the monthly observed and simulated q in billion cubic metres bcm for all nine catchments the simulated q matches the observations relatively well over both the calibration and the validation periods however some of the observed high q values were underestimated this is evident from the β values reported in table 4 which are consistently slightly lower than one for each catchment with good performance we calculated the difference between total observed and modelled water volumes over the validation period these differences varied from 1 to 60 mm yr mean of 24 mm yr averaged over the spatial extents of the corresponding catchments in general our rf model performed better in the blue nile kge values for the validation period of 0 80 where the majority of p is generated in the tropical and temperate upstream highlands where a high seasonality in q is present in the upstream tropical areas of the white nile which is dominated by the african great lakes our model had a reduced performance kge values of 0 35 in contrast at the locations further downstream in the white nile as well as the main nile the model performance improved kge values of 0 75 here the catchment outlets are located in arid climates yet the vast majority of q is generated in the upstream areas 5 3 performance of actual evapotranspiration products the water balance at the multiannual scale was assessed for the nine catchments where q was simulated for 2009 2018 for each catchment fig 6 lists the value of mean annual eta calculated according to the water balance etawb as well as the respective mean annual eta for all evaluated products the closer the values of the products are to etawb the better performing the product is inferred to be over that catchment the numbers in brackets represent the values of eta according to the evaluated products minus etawb meaning that a positive value indicates that the product overestimates eta and a negative value indicates underestimation the results show pmlv2 as the best performing of the eta products under the assumption that p and q are accurately captured pmlv2 eta values were the closest to etawb in seven of the nine catchments while waporv2 1 and era5 performed the best in one catchment each waporv2 1 was the second closest in seven catchments pmlv2 in one and ssebop in one in general era5 gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and ssebop all appear to systematically underestimate total eta amounts 5 4 changes in terrestrial water storage 5 4 1 monthly comparison of changes in terrestrial water storage figs 7 and 8 plot the key components of the water balance at the monthly scale for two catchments blue nile khartoum and white nile malakal respectively here we selected the largest of the assessed catchments corresponding to the blue nile and white nile because i these catchments correspond to the most downstream stations that showed good q modelling performance ii these two basins contribute the majority of q for the main nile hence it is important to understand their hydrological behaviour and iii errors associated with the relatively coarse footprint of grace are minimised when larger catchments are evaluated for this assessment we used chirpsv2 to characterise p as it performed the best at the monthly scale to characterise eta we selected the two best performing eta products because their evaluation was carried out only at the multiannual scale using aggregated eta values over each catchment meaning that there was higher uncertainty related to the spatio temporal distribution of eta in the analysis the two figures represent the water entering the catchment as p blue bars and leaving the catchment as eta green and orange bars for pmlv2 and waporv2 1 respectively and q blue grey bars two time series representing the change in storage are included as lines the derived monthly change in tws from the p eta and q components δ twswb in red and the derived monthly change in tws from the arithmetic mean of the three official level 3 grace products δ twsgrace in grey these results illustrate how the derived monthly δ tws using the water balance and the best performing p and eta products corresponds well to the monthly δ tws estimates from grace over the white nile however this agreement is lost to some extent over the blue nile furthermore these results suggest that the seasonality of δ tws is better captured through the combination of chirpsv2 and pmlv2 than the combination of chirpsv2 and waporv2 1 5 4 2 annual trends in terrestrial water storage the annual trends in δ tws according to the arithmetic mean of the three grace solutions were calculated for the eight of the nine evaluated catchments see fig 5 that have an area greater than 100 000 km 2 for the four catchments in the blue nile basin mean annual δ tws ranged from positive 4 6 to 5 1 mm yr for white nile malakal the value was 10 0 mm yr and for the three catchments in the main nile the values ranged from 6 2 to 8 4 mm yr there was a consistent trend of a slight increase in tws throughout the evaluated catchments over the period 01 2009 07 2017 but the magnitudes of these increases are small compared to the p eta and q components of the water balance because these observed changes are small and because the grace data were not available over the entire period of eta product evaluation the storage component was not considered in the evaluation of the eta products at the multiannual temporal scale 6 discussion 6 1 on the performance of p products chirpsv2 had the best performance of all the evaluated p products which is in agreement with numerous studies that evaluated p products over regions within the nile basin bayissa et al 2017 ayehu et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 nashwan et al 2020 the two solely gauge based products gpccv2020 and cru ts4 04 also performed quite well second and third best performance although this could be attributed to the possible inclusion of regional gauges by these products in addition there was a relatively good performance exhibited by all satellite and gauge products with the exception of arc2 and cmorphv1 era5 the only reanalysis product assessed performed poorly which is expected of reanalysis products over the tropics beck et al 2017 although the β component of the kge showed that chirpsv2 is almost unbiased when compared to the available ground based stations median value of β 1 00 and low dispersion see fig 3 these stations are typically not placed at high elevations thus making it difficult to accurately represent the gradient of p related to elevation derin and yilmaz 2014 studies have shown that satellite based p products often underestimate p over high elevations beck et al 2020 which is evident over the ethiopian highlands romilly and gebremichael 2011 thiemig et al 2012 bayissa et al 2017 dinku et al 2018 evaluated the chirpsv2 dataset against approximately 500 rain gauge stations in ethiopia where a substantial portion of q in the nile basin is generated finding that this product underestimated the total volume of p bias equal to 0 94 similar results were obtained by abebe et al 2020 who reported chirpsv2 median bias ratios of 0 95 for elevations 2500 m a s l concerning product performance over the arid north of the nile basin nashwan et al 2020 concluded that the performances of various p products over egypt are relatively poor which is in agreement with the reported lower performance of p products over arid areas zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2020 the network of rain gauges used in this study fig 4 after excluding fao and ghcn stations does not include stations over the northern arid region of the nile basin 6 2 on the application of the water balance to evaluate eta products the rf model used to estimate q performed well over the data scarce nile basin with nine of the 23 modelled catchments fulfilling the designated criteria for good performance kge 0 75 and 0 80 β 1 20 see table 4 however there was a slight underestimation of the total volume of simulated q due to an inability of the model to accurately capture extreme q values see fig 5 as rf models average all individual tree predictions they are likely to underestimate the extreme values bachmair et al 2017 schoppa et al 2020 this is consistent with the results reported by shortridge et al 2016 where rf simulated q was underestimated during the wet season and overestimated during the dry season despite this the results of our study show that the effect of this bias on the total q volume modelled is small compared to the volumes of water represented by p and eta after evaluating p and q we were able to evaluate eta using the simplified water balance and concluded that both pmlv2 and waporv2 1 are the best performing products our results are also in agreement with those of trambauer et al 2014 and weerasinghe et al 2020 who note the large differences in total eta estimates over africa according to the different products the systematic underestimation of the majority of eta products era5 gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and ssebop see fig 6 is consistent with the results of weerasinghe et al 2020 who evaluated nine eta products including gleamv3 2a mod16 ssebop and waporv1 1 using the water balance method and found that all products underestimated eta over the blue nile basin while all products except cmrset and waporv1 1 underestimated eta over the entire nile basin the large variation in product estimates is not surprising given that the eta products we assessed are derived from a range of calculation methods of varying complexity see section 3 2 2 furthermore the estimation of eta in these products relies on accurate representations of numerous input variables fisher et al 2017 with the estimation of the transpiration component identified as having the largest uncertainty pan et al 2020 the accurate representation of evaporation over water bodies is important for water balance calculations and four of the seven evaluated eta products gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and pmlv2 do not provide eta estimates over large water bodies the largest water bodies in the nile are located in the upstream areas of the white nile see fig 1 in the calculation of mean eta over each catchment we excluded cells without eta estimates considering the two best performing eta products over the nile basin according to our analysis pmlv2 does not provide estimates over large water bodies and waporv2 1 is considered to underestimate evaporation from water bodies fao and ihe delft 2020 in the nile basin the upstream areas correspond to tropical and temperate climates while the downstream areas are classified as arid see fig 1 although the nine catchments assessed in our study extend over multiple climate zones only a small contribution to total p and eta comes from the arid climate areas therefore our evaluation of eta products provides low informative value about product performance over the arid climate over arid areas blatchford et al 2020 compared waporv2 1 estimates to those derived from eddy covariance towers at three locations with irrigated agriculture in egypt finding that waporv2 1 overestimates eta over these areas furthermore ayyad et al 2019 compared estimates from eta products with measurements from a lysimeter system over irrigated areas in egypt and found that ssebop performed better than mod16 to the best of our knowledge no published studies have evaluated the performance of pmlv2 over the nile basin 6 3 ability of p and eta products to represent monthly changes in tws the monthly δ tws derived from applying the water balance eq 1 using the best performing p and eta products corresponded well to the monthly δ tws estimates from grace over the white nile fig 8 in contrast the seasonality of the δ tws derived from the water balance was more pronounced than that of grace over the blue nile fig 7 over the blue nile basin abebe et al 2020 showed that there is no substantial seasonal bias in chirpsv2 estimates based on an evaluation over 38 rain gauges in the upper blue nile basin furthermore the validation of our rf model showed that the seasonality of q was well captured over this basin assuming that the seasonality of p and q is captured well by chirpsv2 and the modelled q respectively the discrepancy between the derived monthly δ twswb and δ twsgrace should be mainly due to the performance of the eta products or the performance of grace related to measurement and leakage errors as noted by landerer and swenson 2012 our results suggest that pmlv2 and waporv2 1 eta products tend to underestimate the seasonal variability over the blue nile basin these results suggest that although some eta products perform relatively well at multiannual temporal scales they are not yet able to capture the intra annual variability over this area which is in agreement with the reported marked seasonal differences between eta products and calculation methods mueller et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 pan et al 2020 in the case of waporv2 1 a reason for this could be attributed to the fact that the blue nile has large areas of rainfed agriculture for which blatchford et al 2020 concluded that the product overestimates and underestimates low and high eta values respectively additionally abera et al 2017 obtained a very good agreement between the δ tws resulting from a hydrological model forced with a specific p product and calibrated solely with q data and δ tws of grace over the upper blue nile their results indicate that two eta products gleamv3 beta and mod16 underestimate the seasonal variability of eta over this region when compared to the resulting modelled eta reinforcing the idea that eta products do not capture the intra annual variability of eta over the blue nile basin 6 4 role of p and eta product selection in establishing the water balance for the nile basin considering the major water balance components over the entire nile basin for 2009 2018 based on the identified best performing products the mean annual p according to chirpsv2 is 636 mm yr while the mean annual eta according to pmlv2 and waporv2 1 is 616 mm yr and 698 mm yr respectively according to molle et al 2018 the discharge of the nile into the mediterranean sea is approximately 14 bcm yr calculated for 2000 2013 which is equivalent to 4 4 mm yr over the entire basin literature indicates that components such as groundwater discharge to the mediterranean sea and seawater extractions for desalination are negligible in the context of the water balance over the entire nile basin nofal et al 2015 el rawy et al 2020 therefore if using the p product and one of the eta products recommended in this paper the derived q discharging from the nile will either be too high pmlv2 or negative waporv2 1 furthermore with pmlv2 the total volumes will be affected by the missing eta values over large water bodies fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the estimates from the evaluated p and eta products the upper panels plot the mean annual p and eta for 2009 2018 for the best performing products while the lower panels plot the spatial distribution of the coefficient of variation cv calculated for all evaluated products as expected the cv for the p products is highest over the arid regions where awange et al 2016 reported a low correlation between estimates from different products and because of the very low annual p slight changes between these products result in a high cv values of cv for p are also relatively high over regions of the basin where most of the q is generated namely the ethiopian highlands and some upstream areas in the white nile the cv for the eta products is also higher over the arid regions where annual accumulated eta values are low which is in agreement with the results reported by trambauer et al 2014 and pan et al 2020 in addition the cv is also high over large irrigation schemes in the arid climates with a key reason for this being that neither gldasv2 1 nor gleamv3 5b appear to detect the increased eta associated with these irrigated croplands the water bodies and sudd wetlands are the other areas with a relatively high cv for eta 7 conclusions we evaluated the performance of eleven gridded p products through a point to pixel analysis and seven gridded eta products through the water balance over the data scarce nile basin for the water balance analysis we generated time series of simulated q through a machine learning approach and used data from level 3 grace products to evaluate the changes in tws we evaluated the gridded p and eta products using ground based data from 90 rain gauges and 23 q stations and made the following conclusions a based on a point to pixel analysis and using the kge and its components chirpsv2 was the best performing p product over the nile basin at the monthly scale median kge of 0 80 furthermore chirpsv2 had a median bias of 1 00 and showed a much lower dispersion than all other evaluated p products b the rf model used to simulate monthly q performed well for nine of the 23 evaluated catchments and was able to capture the seasonality and magnitude of q model performance was generally better for catchments in the blue nile and downstream in the main nile c the multiannual water balance was evaluated over nine catchments for 2009 2018 with chirpsv2 as the p input and with simulated q pmlv2 and waporv2 1 were the best performing products over the majority of the catchments d over two catchments monthly δ tws calculated from the water balance using the best performing p and two best performing eta products was compared with δ tws derived from grace level 3 products the seasonality of tws derived from the best performing p and eta products is well captured over the white nile basin but not as well captured over the blue nile basin and e based on the results of our study we recommend the use of chirpsv2 and either pmlv2 or waporv2 1 over the nile basin sheffield et al 2018 identified the pivotal role played by satellite based products in water resources management in data scarce regions and our paper answers this call by providing recommendations of the best performing p and eta products over the nile basin the nile basin has low data availability and minimal data sharing hence this study provides an important step in the improved understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of p and eta in the region furthermore the study uses novel techniques that can be transferred to other data scarce basins around the world greater data availability such as a higher density of rain gauge data point based eta data and updated q data would also serve a great purpose in enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of the best performing products author contributions ian mcnamara conceptualisation methodology analysis writing review editing oscar m baez villanueva conceptualisation methodology analysis writing review

8134,study region nile basin africa study focus the accurate representation of precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration eta patterns is crucial for water resources management yet there remains a high spatial and temporal variability among gridded products particularly over data scarce regions we evaluated the performance of eleven state of the art p products and seven eta products over the nile basin using a four step procedure i p products were evaluated at the monthly scale through a point to pixel approach ii streamflow was modelled using the random forest machine learning technique and simulated for well performing catchments for 2009 2018 to correspond with eta product availability iii eta products were evaluated at the multiannual scale using the water balance method and iv the ability of the best performing p and eta products to represent monthly variations in terrestrial water storage δ tws was assessed through a comparison with grace level 3 data new hydrological insights for the region chirpsv2 was the best performing p product median monthly kge of 0 80 and pmlv2 and waporv2 1 the best performing eta products over the majority of the evaluated catchments the application of the water balance using these best performing products captures the seasonality of δ tws well over the white nile basin but overestimates seasonality over the blue nile basin our study demonstrates how gridded p and eta products can be evaluated over extremely data scarce conditions using an easily transferable methodology keywords precipitation evapotranspiration water balance remote sensing random forest grace 1 introduction precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration eta also referred to as evaporation see miralles et al 2020 are two major components of the water cycle and their accurate characterisation in time and space is of vital importance in hydrology water resources management agricultural planning and many other fields p can be measured directly by rain gauges which provide accurate information at the point scale however a dense station network is required to obtain reliable estimates of its spatial patterns garcia et al 2008 villarini et al 2008 adhikary et al 2015 while p is directly measured methods such as the bowen ratio and the eddy covariance are commonly used to derive estimates of eta rates from ground based measurements at discrete locations but in addition to the high density of measurements required to understand spatial patterns of eta the installation of these instruments can be labour and cost intensive wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 over the previous decades high quality gridded p and eta datasets based on novel techniques have become widely available which account for the spatial and temporal distributions of these variables gridded p products are typically based on i the interpolation of ground based measurements ii satellite based retrievals using infrared and or passive microwave data and iii reanalysis models sun et al 2018 on the other hand remote sensing based eta estimates are mainly derived through calculation methods such as the surface energy balance seb bastiaanssen et al 1998

comprehensive reviews on methodologies used to derive p and eta products the reader is referred to sun et al 2018 and zhang et al 2016 respectively gauge based gridded p products lose accuracy over areas where the gauge network density is low xie et al 1996 schneider et al 2014 satellite based p products perform better at longer temporal scales maggioni and massari 2018 sun et al 2018 and their performance is influenced by climate with lower performances over arid regions sun et al 2018 as well as for intense p events herold et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2020 satellite based products tend to perform better in the tropics because the convective systems are more related to cold cloud top temperatures levizzani et al 2001 nauss and kokhanovsky 2006 while reanalysis products are consistent with large scale circulation systems gehne et al 2016 because of their ability of simulate synoptic scale weather systems haiden et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 the performance of p products is commonly evaluated through point to pixel analyses hydrological modelling and triple collocation procedures e g stisen and sandholt 2010 beck et al 2017 massari et al 2017 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2018 gridded eta products are typically derived through the extrapolation of methodologies that were initially developed for local scale applications mccabe et al 2016 because eta in gridded products is derived as an energy variable i e energy flux its estimation relies on accurate representations of numerous input variables most notably net radiation near surface air temperature water vapour pressure and visible and near infrared vnir measurements for phenology and vegetation cover fisher et al 2017 some relevant conclusions from global evaluations of eta products are reanalysis based datasets have the highest global mean estimates followed by remote sensing based datasets and then land surface models mueller et al 2011 not all products account for irrigated areas pan et al 2020 and that there is an increased variability in eta estimates over arid and semi arid regions pan et al 2020 assessing the water balance closure is a common approach to evaluate the accuracy of these products when insufficient ground based eta measurements are available e g senay et al 2011 liu et al 2016 moreira et al 2019 weerasinghe et al 2020 abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 there is no best performing p product or eta product worldwide with the relative performance of products specific to the study area miralles et al 2016 beck et al 2017 meaning that the performance of a product over a particular area should be assessed prior to any application zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 khan et al 2018 zandler et al 2019 in the data scarce continent of africa there is a high spatial and temporal variability among estimates from gridded p and eta products mueller et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 awange et al 2016 beck et al 2017 sun et al 2018 weerasinghe et al 2020 while in the nile basin relatively few ground based observations are used by some of these gridded products to correct their estimates resulting in a reduced reliability karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 for instance systematic underestimations of p have been reported over the northern arid regions of the nile beck et al 2020 and of eta over the blue nile weerasinghe et al 2020 table 1 presents a summary of the most relevant studies that have assessed the performances of gridded p and eta products over or within the nile basin where it is evident that most studies assess either p products or eta products rather than both of the identified studies that assess both p and eta product performance over the nile basin bastiaanssen et al 2014 considers only two p products trmm 3b43v7 and fews net and one eta product ssebop to evaluate water balance closure at the multiannual scale over the upper blue nile basin abera et al 2017 used one p product sm2r cci to force a hydrological model and compared the eta model outputs with two gridded eta products gleamv3 beta and mod16 while koukoula et al 2020 assessed 18 reanalysis datasets at the monthly temporal scale against in situ p and q measurements as well as a satellite based eta dataset in addition two studies listed in table 1 used the water balance approach to only evaluate eta product performance weerasinghe et al 2020 used a mean ensemble of gridded p inputs to evaluate eta products at the multiannual scale and blatchford et al 2020 evaluated only one eta product waporv2 1 over the nile basin to the best of our knowledge there is no study that comprehensively assesses the performance of both gridded p and eta products at different temporal scales and over multiple catchments in the nile basin a greater understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of the key components of the water balance over this basin will greatly assist many decision making processes related to water resources management such as the

assess whether the best performing p and eta products are able to represent i seasonality of the terrestrial water storage tws over nile subcatchments and ii the multiannual water balance of the

2018 dahle et al 2019 wiese et al 2019 save 2020 as described by landerer and swenson 2012 grace level 3 data are generated by downscaling the filtered standard native grace products with an approximate spatial resolution of 3 330 km at the equator cell size of approximately 100 000 km 2 to a resolution of 1 110 km at the equator because of this downscaling process adjacent cells are highly correlated to each other meaning that more representative results are obtained when evaluating catchments larger than the 100 000 km 2 footprint of the native grace data scanlon et al 2016 cooley and landerer 2020 the level 3 products provide information of tws deviation from a mean condition calculated over 2005 2010 4 methods fig 2 illustrates the four step procedure implemented to evaluate the performance of the gridded p and eta products the evaluation period for each step was selected based on data availability of ground based observations and gridded products first we evaluated p products at the monthly temporal scale through a statistical comparison against the rain gauge data over the period where the majority of p products are available section 4 1 because all evaluated eta products are available for 2009 2018 and we did not have sufficient q data for that period we simulated q using a random forest rf model over the 23 catchments from 1981 when all gridded rf model inputs were available to the end of the q observations corresponding to each catchment for the catchments where modelling performed well we then simulated q for 2009 2018 section 4 2 third adopting the identified best performing p product and the simulated q time series we evaluated eta product performance for each catchment by determining the relative error in closing the water balance at the multiannual scale under the assumption that the multiannual change in storage can be neglected section 4 3 finally we compared the derived monthly δ tws values obtained using the best performing p and eta products δ tws wb with those obtained from grace level 3 data δ tws grace starting in 2009 due to eta product availability and finishing in 2017 due to grace data availability we also validated the assumption that δ tws is negligible in the application of the water balance at the multiannual scale section 4 4 for steps 3 and 4 we applied the water balance method at the catchment scale see senay et al 2011 long et al 2014 liu et al 2016 moreira et al 2019 weerasinghe et al 2020 according to eq 1 1 p q eta δ tws where p is the precipitation q is the catchment runoff eta is the actual evapotranspiration and δ tws is the change in terrestrial water storage all values are expressed in mm averaged over the area of the catchment 4 1 evaluation of precipitation products the p product performances were evaluated using a point to pixel approach at the monthly temporal scale over 1983 2011 the start of the evaluation period was selected because the majority nine of the eleven p products have data from 1983 onwards while the end of the evaluation period was selected because ground based p data were only available until 2011 in this method the time series of observed data here rain gauge data are compared against simulated data here the corresponding grid cells from the p products using a performance index the point to pixel approach assumes that the rain gauge measurements are representative values over the corresponding grid cell e g thiemig et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2018 the p products that were obtained at a sub monthly scale were aggregated to the monthly scale except for when temporal data gaps existed in which case no monthly values were calculated to ensure a consistent point to pixel comparison all products were resampled to the same spatial resolution 0 25 using bilinear interpolation some p products use data from rain gauge stations to correct their estimates hence the inclusion of these stations in the product evaluation may bias the results from the 90 stations described in section 3 1 the 31 that form part of the fao or ghcn networks which are used by chirpsv2 and mswepv2 2 to correct their estimates were discarded for the evaluation for performance assessment to evaluate the p products against the remaining 59 stations we selected the modified kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 because i it can be decomposed into three components that allow a better understanding of the origin of mismatches ii in contrast to typical measures of performance based on squared residuals it avoids assigning a disproportional weight to high values and iii it allows a fair intercomparison of performance across different climatic conditions schaefli and gupta 2007 criss and winston 2008 gupta et al 2009 thiemig et al 2013 baez villanueva et al 2018 the kge is described in eq 2 2 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 the kge compares observed data with simulated data and consists of three components the pearson s linear correlation r eq 3 which measures the temporal dynamics the bias ratio β eq 4 which measures the total volume a value greater than 1 represents an overestimation of the simulations while a value less than 1 represents an underestimation and the variability ratio γ eq 5 which measures the relative dispersion between simulations and observations gupta et al 2009

that time step o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively at time i o and s are the arithmetic means of the observations and the simulations respectively σ is the standard deviation and μ is the mean the kge and its three components present their optimal value at 1 4 2 streamflow modelling and evaluation to assess the performance of eta products through the water balance reliable q data were required for the period where all eta estimates are available 2009 2018 because only one q station had multiple years of observed data after 2009 we implemented an rf model to simulate monthly q for 2009 2018 over more catchments machine learning techniques have been widely applied in q modelling studies for reviews see tyralis et al 2019 sit et al 2020 in this study we selected an rf model to simulate q based on gridded p t and pet data rf methods have been widely used in q prediction for many reasons including i their demonstrated high predictive performance shortridge et al 2016 tyralis et al 2019 schoppa et al 2020 ii their ability to represent non linear relationships between climatological variables and q shortridge et al 2016 yang et al 2017 konapala and mishra 2020 and iii their ability to not produce biased estimates or lead to overfitting díaz uriarte and alvarez de andrés 2006 biau and scornet 2016 hengl et al 2018 tyralis et al 2019 rf is an ensemble machine learning method that works by constructing numerous decision trees using the relationship between independent and dependent variables and can be used for supervised classification and regression tasks breiman 2001 prasad et al 2006 biau and scornet 2016 a lumped model was implemented using catchment averaged monthly time series of the best performing p product as well as era5 pet and t as inputs the year 1981 was selected as the start date for modelling because it is the first year where both the best performing p product see section 5 1 and era5 datasets are available the end date for modelling each catchment corresponded to the availability of q data the general formulation used to model the monthly q was adapted from the approach outlined in shortridge et al 2016 6 q t f p t p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 p t 4 t t t t 1 t t 2 t t 3 t t 4 pet t pet t 1 pet t 2 pet t 3 pet t 4 ε t where p t t t and pet t are the catchment averaged monthly total precipitation mean temperature and mean potential evaporation at month t respectively and ε t is the model error the subscript t n represents n months before the month t the modelled period for each catchment was divided into a calibration period using the first 70 of the available q time series and a validation period using the remaining 30 due to the differing length of available time series of q observations in each catchment the lengths of these periods varied accordingly the rf model was trained over the calibration period using the formulation described in eq 6 with the following rf configuration number of trees set to 1000 number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split set as the number of predictors divided by 3 and minimum size of terminal nodes set to 5 the performance of q simulations was evaluated using the kge and its components during the validation period based on thiemig et al 2013 a kge greater than 0 75 was used to select a well performing model furthermore the β component eq 4 of the kge was used to evaluate the ability of the model to represent the total volume of estimated q because its accurate estimation is crucial in the application of the simplified water balance therefore in addition to ensuring a kge 0 75 only catchments with a β component within the range of 0 80 β 1 20 were selected to avoid introducing bias into the evaluation the implementation of these selection criteria may result in a smaller selection of catchments to evaluate the performance of the eta products but at the same time guarantees a higher degree of reliability in the q estimates for the well performing catchments monthly q time series were generated for 2009 2018 to ensure that the widest possible range of input variables were captured by the rf model we re trained the model for each selected catchment using the observed data from the entire period available post 1981 instead of only the calibration period that was used to test model performance 4 3 evaluation of actual evapotranspiration products we evaluated the performances of the gridded eta products at the multiannual scale through the application of the water balance method eq 1 over the catchments where q modelling performed well assuming that δ tws is negligible at the multiannual scale liu et al 2016 we calculated the theoretical value of eta according to the water balance eta wb as 7 eta wb p q where all values are mean annual catchment averaged accumulations expressed in mm and p is calculated using the best performing p product we then compared the mean annual eta for each gridded product with eta wb and the closer that the two results are to each other the better performing the eta product is inferred to be over that catchment note that this method only indicates whether the total eta estimated over the catchment is accurate regardless of the spatial distribution of eta some of the evaluated eta products have data gaps because estimates are not calculated over certain areas gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and pmlv2 do not calculate eta over water bodies while in addition the mod16 product does not provide eta for non vegetated grid cells running et al 2019 we did not consider these missing values when calculating catchment averaged eta values for products with data gaps furthermore pmlv2 values over large water bodies which are provided as zeroes were discarded 4 4 ability to represent changes in total water storage we selected the most downstream catchments with well performing simulated q for both the blue nile and white nile to evaluate the best performing p and eta products at the monthly temporal scale we extracted monthly catchment averaged time series of the best performing p and eta products and combined with the simulated q derived monthly time series of expected changes in storage δ tws wb for 01 2009 06 2017 according to eq 1 we compared these expected values with δ tws grace which we derived from the arithmetic mean of the level 3 solutions from the three official grace data centres the arithmetic mean was used to reduce noise in the gravity field solutions sakumura et al 2014 because of the low spatial resolution of the product we accounted for the percentage of each grid cell that lies within the respective catchment boundary furthermore we used δ tws grace to evaluate the assumption that δ tws is negligible our application of the water balance used for eta product evaluation at the multiannual scale grace level 3 data from the first mission are available for 04 2002 06 2017 and the evaluation of eta products was selected as 01 2009 12 2018 we calculated the trend of δ tws per catchment over the overlap period 01 2009 06 2017 based on fitting a linear trendline to the 12 month rolling average tws as recommended by scanlon et al 2016 and cooley and landerer 2020 we did not evaluate catchments with an area less than 100 000 km 2 because of their smaller size relative to the native spatial resolution of grace data see section 3 2 4 for all analyses we used the r environment 3 6 0 r core team 2013 and the following r packages raster hijmans 2020 for the processing and statistical analyses of gridded datasets hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2020a for the calculation of performance indices hydrotsm zambrano bigiarini 2020b for managing time series data randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 for building the rf model to predict q and rgdal bivand 2020 for working with vector data for more information on these r packages the reader is referred to their respective literature 5 results 5 1 performance of precipitation products the performances of the eleven p products at the monthly temporal scale at the locations of the 59 evaluated rain gauge stations are presented as boxplots in fig 3 the results indicate that chirpsv2 with a median kge of 0 80 was the overall best performing product followed by gpccv2020 0 78 cru ts4 04 0 77 and mswepv2 2 0 75 chirpsv2 exhibited the best median bias 1 00 as well as showing the smallest interquartile range for bias 0 11 gpccv2020 had the best median r 0 89 however it presented a higher dispersion in the r values compared to chirpsv2 and cru ts4 04 cru ts4 04 exhibited the best median variability ratio 1 01 followed by chirpsv2 0 99 all products showed similar performances except for era5 arc2 and cmorphv1 indicating that the products can represent to some extent the monthly p patterns over the nile basin fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the kge values demonstrating that the best performing p products i e chirpsv2 gpccv2020 and cru ts4 04 perform consistently well over the spatial extent of the study area where stations were available the northernmost station evaluated i e after excluding fao and ghcn stations is located at a longitude of 18 1 which means that there are no rain gauge data available to evaluate product performance in the arid north of the nile basin chirpsv2 was considered as the best performing p product at the monthly scale because i it outperformed all other p products see fig 3 ii it showed a consistent high performance throughout the study area at the evaluated locations see fig 4 and iii it is almost unbiased with a median β of 1 00 and low dispersion compared to the other products these results demonstrate that chirpsv2 can be deemed suitable for application in the evaluation of eta products using the water balance 5 2 streamflow modelling table 4 summarises the results obtained for modelling q over all catchments listing the kge values for the calibration and validation periods as well as the β values for the validation period note that due to q data availability the modelling period varied among catchments and the calibration period was always selected as the first 70 of the available time series for each catchment leaving the remaining 30 for validation the catchments fulfilling the performance criteria for the validation period i e kge 0 75 and 0 80 β 1 20 are underlined and shown in bold text the results in table 4 show that nine catchments fulfilled the designated criteria to be considered as suitable for q simulation for 2009 2018 for our case study all nine catchments with kge 0 75 also yielded β values within the range 0 80 β 1 20 fig 5 illustrates the hydrographs for these nine catchments displaying both the monthly observed and simulated q in billion cubic metres bcm for all nine catchments the simulated q matches the observations relatively well over both the calibration and the validation periods however some of the observed high q values were underestimated this is evident from the β values reported in table 4 which are consistently slightly lower than one for each catchment with good performance we calculated the difference between total observed and modelled water volumes over the validation period these differences varied from 1 to 60 mm yr mean of 24 mm yr averaged over the spatial extents of the corresponding catchments in general our rf model performed better in the blue nile kge values for the validation period of 0 80 where the majority of p is generated in the tropical and temperate upstream highlands where a high seasonality in q is present in the upstream tropical areas of the white nile which is dominated by the african great lakes our model had a reduced performance kge values of 0 35 in contrast at the locations further downstream in the white nile as well as the main nile the model performance improved kge values of 0 75 here the catchment outlets are located in arid climates yet the vast majority of q is generated in the upstream areas 5 3 performance of actual evapotranspiration products the water balance at the multiannual scale was assessed for the nine catchments where q was simulated for 2009 2018 for each catchment fig 6 lists the value of mean annual eta calculated according to the water balance etawb as well as the respective mean annual eta for all evaluated products the closer the values of the products are to etawb the better performing the product is inferred to be over that catchment the numbers in brackets represent the values of eta according to the evaluated products minus etawb meaning that a positive value indicates that the product overestimates eta and a negative value indicates underestimation the results show pmlv2 as the best performing of the eta products under the assumption that p and q are accurately captured pmlv2 eta values were the closest to etawb in seven of the nine catchments while waporv2 1 and era5 performed the best in one catchment each waporv2 1 was the second closest in seven catchments pmlv2 in one and ssebop in one in general era5 gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and ssebop all appear to systematically underestimate total eta amounts 5 4 changes in terrestrial water storage 5 4 1 monthly comparison of changes in terrestrial water storage figs 7 and 8 plot the key components of the water balance at the monthly scale for two catchments blue nile khartoum and white nile malakal respectively here we selected the largest of the assessed catchments corresponding to the blue nile and white nile because i these catchments correspond to the most downstream stations that showed good q modelling performance ii these two basins contribute the majority of q for the main nile hence it is important to understand their hydrological behaviour and iii errors associated with the relatively coarse footprint of grace are minimised when larger catchments are evaluated for this assessment we used chirpsv2 to characterise p as it performed the best at the monthly scale to characterise eta we selected the two best performing eta products because their evaluation was carried out only at the multiannual scale using aggregated eta values over each catchment meaning that there was higher uncertainty related to the spatio temporal distribution of eta in the analysis the two figures represent the water entering the catchment as p blue bars and leaving the catchment as eta green and orange bars for pmlv2 and waporv2 1 respectively and q blue grey bars two time series representing the change in storage are included as lines the derived monthly change in tws from the p eta and q components δ twswb in red and the derived monthly change in tws from the arithmetic mean of the three official level 3 grace products δ twsgrace in grey these results illustrate how the derived monthly δ tws using the water balance and the best performing p and eta products corresponds well to the monthly δ tws estimates from grace over the white nile however this agreement is lost to some extent over the blue nile furthermore these results suggest that the seasonality of δ tws is better captured through the combination of chirpsv2 and pmlv2 than the combination of chirpsv2 and waporv2 1 5 4 2 annual trends in terrestrial water storage the annual trends in δ tws according to the arithmetic mean of the three grace solutions were calculated for the eight of the nine evaluated catchments see fig 5 that have an area greater than 100 000 km 2 for the four catchments in the blue nile basin mean annual δ tws ranged from positive 4 6 to 5 1 mm yr for white nile malakal the value was 10 0 mm yr and for the three catchments in the main nile the values ranged from 6 2 to 8 4 mm yr there was a consistent trend of a slight increase in tws throughout the evaluated catchments over the period 01 2009 07 2017 but the magnitudes of these increases are small compared to the p eta and q components of the water balance because these observed changes are small and because the grace data were not available over the entire period of eta product evaluation the storage component was not considered in the evaluation of the eta products at the multiannual temporal scale 6 discussion 6 1 on the performance of p products chirpsv2 had the best performance of all the evaluated p products which is in agreement with numerous studies that evaluated p products over regions within the nile basin bayissa et al 2017 ayehu et al 2018 dinku et al 2018 nashwan et al 2020 the two solely gauge based products gpccv2020 and cru ts4 04 also performed quite well second and third best performance although this could be attributed to the possible inclusion of regional gauges by these products in addition there was a relatively good performance exhibited by all satellite and gauge products with the exception of arc2 and cmorphv1 era5 the only reanalysis product assessed performed poorly which is expected of reanalysis products over the tropics beck et al 2017 although the β component of the kge showed that chirpsv2 is almost unbiased when compared to the available ground based stations median value of β 1 00 and low dispersion see fig 3 these stations are typically not placed at high elevations thus making it difficult to accurately represent the gradient of p related to elevation derin and yilmaz 2014 studies have shown that satellite based p products often underestimate p over high elevations beck et al 2020 which is evident over the ethiopian highlands romilly and gebremichael 2011 thiemig et al 2012 bayissa et al 2017 dinku et al 2018 evaluated the chirpsv2 dataset against approximately 500 rain gauge stations in ethiopia where a substantial portion of q in the nile basin is generated finding that this product underestimated the total volume of p bias equal to 0 94 similar results were obtained by abebe et al 2020 who reported chirpsv2 median bias ratios of 0 95 for elevations 2500 m a s l concerning product performance over the arid north of the nile basin nashwan et al 2020 concluded that the performances of various p products over egypt are relatively poor which is in agreement with the reported lower performance of p products over arid areas zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 baez villanueva et al 2020 the network of rain gauges used in this study fig 4 after excluding fao and ghcn stations does not include stations over the northern arid region of the nile basin 6 2 on the application of the water balance to evaluate eta products the rf model used to estimate q performed well over the data scarce nile basin with nine of the 23 modelled catchments fulfilling the designated criteria for good performance kge 0 75 and 0 80 β 1 20 see table 4 however there was a slight underestimation of the total volume of simulated q due to an inability of the model to accurately capture extreme q values see fig 5 as rf models average all individual tree predictions they are likely to underestimate the extreme values bachmair et al 2017 schoppa et al 2020 this is consistent with the results reported by shortridge et al 2016 where rf simulated q was underestimated during the wet season and overestimated during the dry season despite this the results of our study show that the effect of this bias on the total q volume modelled is small compared to the volumes of water represented by p and eta after evaluating p and q we were able to evaluate eta using the simplified water balance and concluded that both pmlv2 and waporv2 1 are the best performing products our results are also in agreement with those of trambauer et al 2014 and weerasinghe et al 2020 who note the large differences in total eta estimates over africa according to the different products the systematic underestimation of the majority of eta products era5 gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and ssebop see fig 6 is consistent with the results of weerasinghe et al 2020 who evaluated nine eta products including gleamv3 2a mod16 ssebop and waporv1 1 using the water balance method and found that all products underestimated eta over the blue nile basin while all products except cmrset and waporv1 1 underestimated eta over the entire nile basin the large variation in product estimates is not surprising given that the eta products we assessed are derived from a range of calculation methods of varying complexity see section 3 2 2 furthermore the estimation of eta in these products relies on accurate representations of numerous input variables fisher et al 2017 with the estimation of the transpiration component identified as having the largest uncertainty pan et al 2020 the accurate representation of evaporation over water bodies is important for water balance calculations and four of the seven evaluated eta products gldasv2 1 gleamv3 5b mod16 and pmlv2 do not provide eta estimates over large water bodies the largest water bodies in the nile are located in the upstream areas of the white nile see fig 1 in the calculation of mean eta over each catchment we excluded cells without eta estimates considering the two best performing eta products over the nile basin according to our analysis pmlv2 does not provide estimates over large water bodies and waporv2 1 is considered to underestimate evaporation from water bodies fao and ihe delft 2020 in the nile basin the upstream areas correspond to tropical and temperate climates while the downstream areas are classified as arid see fig 1 although the nine catchments assessed in our study extend over multiple climate zones only a small contribution to total p and eta comes from the arid climate areas therefore our evaluation of eta products provides low informative value about product performance over the arid climate over arid areas blatchford et al 2020 compared waporv2 1 estimates to those derived from eddy covariance towers at three locations with irrigated agriculture in egypt finding that waporv2 1 overestimates eta over these areas furthermore ayyad et al 2019 compared estimates from eta products with measurements from a lysimeter system over irrigated areas in egypt and found that ssebop performed better than mod16 to the best of our knowledge no published studies have evaluated the performance of pmlv2 over the nile basin 6 3 ability of p and eta products to represent monthly changes in tws the monthly δ tws derived from applying the water balance eq 1 using the best performing p and eta products corresponded well to the monthly δ tws estimates from grace over the white nile fig 8 in contrast the seasonality of the δ tws derived from the water balance was more pronounced than that of grace over the blue nile fig 7 over the blue nile basin abebe et al 2020 showed that there is no substantial seasonal bias in chirpsv2 estimates based on an evaluation over 38 rain gauges in the upper blue nile basin furthermore the validation of our rf model showed that the seasonality of q was well captured over this basin assuming that the seasonality of p and q is captured well by chirpsv2 and the modelled q respectively the discrepancy between the derived monthly δ twswb and δ twsgrace should be mainly due to the performance of the eta products or the performance of grace related to measurement and leakage errors as noted by landerer and swenson 2012 our results suggest that pmlv2 and waporv2 1 eta products tend to underestimate the seasonal variability over the blue nile basin these results suggest that although some eta products perform relatively well at multiannual temporal scales they are not yet able to capture the intra annual variability over this area which is in agreement with the reported marked seasonal differences between eta products and calculation methods mueller et al 2011 trambauer et al 2014 pan et al 2020 in the case of waporv2 1 a reason for this could be attributed to the fact that the blue nile has large areas of rainfed agriculture for which blatchford et al 2020 concluded that the product overestimates and underestimates low and high eta values respectively additionally abera et al 2017 obtained a very good agreement between the δ tws resulting from a hydrological model forced with a specific p product and calibrated solely with q data and δ tws of grace over the upper blue nile their results indicate that two eta products gleamv3 beta and mod16 underestimate the seasonal variability of eta over this region when compared to the resulting modelled eta reinforcing the idea that eta products do not capture the intra annual variability of eta over the blue nile basin 6 4 role of p and eta product selection in establishing the water balance for the nile basin considering the major water balance components over the entire nile basin for 2009 2018 based on the identified best performing products the mean annual p according to chirpsv2 is 636 mm yr while the mean annual eta according to pmlv2 and waporv2 1 is 616 mm yr and 698 mm yr respectively according to molle et al 2018 the discharge of the nile into the mediterranean sea is approximately 14 bcm yr calculated for 2000 2013 which is equivalent to 4 4 mm yr over the entire basin literature indicates that components such as groundwater discharge to the mediterranean sea and seawater extractions for desalination are negligible in the context of the water balance over the entire nile basin nofal et al 2015 el rawy et al 2020 therefore if using the p product and one of the eta products recommended in this paper the derived q discharging from the nile will either be too high pmlv2 or negative waporv2 1 furthermore with pmlv2 the total volumes will be affected by the missing eta values over large water bodies fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the estimates from the evaluated p and eta products the upper panels plot the mean annual p and eta for 2009 2018 for the best performing products while the lower panels plot the spatial distribution of the coefficient of variation cv calculated for all evaluated products as expected the cv for the p products is highest over the arid regions where awange et al 2016 reported a low correlation between estimates from different products and because of the very low annual p slight changes between these products result in a high cv values of cv for p are also relatively high over regions of the basin where most of the q is generated namely the ethiopian highlands and some upstream areas in the white nile the cv for the eta products is also higher over the arid regions where annual accumulated eta values are low which is in agreement with the results reported by trambauer et al 2014 and pan et al 2020 in addition the cv is also high over large irrigation schemes in the arid climates with a key reason for this being that neither gldasv2 1 nor gleamv3 5b appear to detect the increased eta associated with these irrigated croplands the water bodies and sudd wetlands are the other areas with a relatively high cv for eta 7 conclusions we evaluated the performance of eleven gridded p products through a point to pixel analysis and seven gridded eta products through the water balance over the data scarce nile basin for the water balance analysis we generated time series of simulated q through a machine learning approach and used data from level 3 grace products to evaluate the changes in tws we evaluated the gridded p and eta products using ground based data from 90 rain gauges and 23 q stations and made the following conclusions a based on a point to pixel analysis and using the kge and its components chirpsv2 was the best performing p product over the nile basin at the monthly scale median kge of 0 80 furthermore chirpsv2 had a median bias of 1 00 and showed a much lower dispersion than all other evaluated p products b the rf model used to simulate monthly q performed well for nine of the 23 evaluated catchments and was able to capture the seasonality and magnitude of q model performance was generally better for catchments in the blue nile and downstream in the main nile c the multiannual water balance was evaluated over nine catchments for 2009 2018 with chirpsv2 as the p input and with simulated q pmlv2 and waporv2 1 were the best performing products over the majority of the catchments d over two catchments monthly δ tws calculated from the water balance using the best performing p and two best performing eta products was compared with δ tws derived from grace level 3 products the seasonality of tws derived from the best performing p and eta products is well captured over the white nile basin but not as well captured over the blue nile basin and e based on the results of our study we recommend the use of chirpsv2 and either pmlv2 or waporv2 1 over the nile basin sheffield et al 2018 identified the pivotal role played by satellite based products in water resources management in data scarce regions and our paper answers this call by providing recommendations of the best performing p and eta products over the nile basin the nile basin has low data availability and minimal data sharing hence this study provides an important step in the improved understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of p and eta in the region furthermore the study uses novel techniques that can be transferred to other data scarce basins around the world greater data availability such as a higher density of rain gauge data point based eta data and updated q data would also serve a great purpose in enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of the best performing products author contributions ian mcnamara conceptualisation methodology analysis writing review editing oscar m baez villanueva conceptualisation methodology analysis writing review
