3470,wetland plants are a key factor in ecosystems but are threatened by water extraction and water resource exploitation ecological water supplementation is a common solution to the water scarcity problem in wetlands in this study the zhalong wetland with a complex water regime was divided into several subareas with relatively strong hydrologic connectivity based on a hydrodynamic model and cluster analysis the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dynamics were simulated and verified with long short term memory lstm neural network models established for the various wetland subareas based on the subarea water levels and temperature and sunshine duration data to evaluate the effects of different ecological water supplementation scenarios on the spatiotemporal ndvi variation across the wetland the water levels of subareas under different scenarios were used to drive the lstm model the results indicate that 1 the spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi at most nodes within the wetland was accurately simulated but large errors generally occurred in regions with small lakes 2 ecological water supplementation with continuous and low flow discharge imposed highly positive influences on the annual maximum ndvi in the wetland against the background of limited water resources 3 the lower reach in the largest subarea was less positively affected by wetland ecological water supplementation 4 water supplementation with discharge in april and september was recommended because of the benefits for the nidification and breeding of water fowl species and the limited conflict between agricultural and ecological water this study provides important references for both wetland and water resource managers keywords recurrent neural network water resource management wetland partition wetland restoration zhalong wetland 1 introduction wetlands which provide high quality and diverse ecosystem services to abundant plant and animal communities represent some of the most vital aquatic systems on the earth s surface costanza et al 1989 however rapid socioeconomic development especially in developing countries has exerted enormous stresses on wetlands thereby intensifying wetland degradation and deterioration kirwan and megonigal 2013 in general the main objective of wetland protection and restoration is species diversity restoration which depends on the protection and restoration of plant communities whigham 1999 wetland plants are the most common producers and vegetation coverage determines the productivity of wetlands skidmore et al 2003 suggested that species become more specialized when resources are abundant and reliable which is beneficial to a larger number of species per unit area since the quantity of consumer individuals increases due to higher productivity species diversity also increases diamond 1988 moreover plants provide natural refuge and habitat to consumers orrock et al 2010 suitable vegetation coverage is partly beneficial to a high species diversity hacker and gaines 1997 in wetlands water resources and climate conditions play vital roles in vegetation growth thus wetland water shortages attributed to water use associated with socioeconomic development may lead to vegetation degradation and species loss hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yu et al 2021 considering that water is a critical influencing factor of the development and evolution of wetlands rational mitigation of the water scarcity problem in wetlands has become a major research focus the zhalong wetland the terminal wetland of the wuyuer river is an internationally important wetland and the largest breeding centre of red crowned cranes in china geng et al 2020 however water became scarce following the construction of the dongsheng reservoir which is located at the junction between the wuyuer river and the core region of the zhalong wetland wetlands that function as aquatic habitats are highly sensitive to water level fluctuations ray et al 2019 moreover water scarcity causes vegetation degradation and damages aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2021 wetland ecological water supplementation is the most common solution to this problem docker and robinson 2014 hodge and mcnally 2000 zhao et al 2016 therefore the evaluation of vegetation dynamics under ecological water supplementation yields important implications for wetland ecological restoration the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi a widely recognized indicator in vegetation related studies is a numerical indicator of the greenness of vegetation calculated in the visible and near infrared bands based on remote sensing images powell et al 2014 the ndvi ranges from 1 to 1 a high positive ndvi value indicates greener and denser vegetation whereas more negative ndvi values reflect non vegetation classes such as water snow bare land and urban land the profile of the annual ndvi value increases with vegetation growth and gradually reaches a peak or plateau over time however the ndvi profile eventually declines as vegetation wilts and dies on a yearly time scale the ndvi also increases and decreases under vegetation restoration and degeneration respectively time series ndvi prediction methods can be grouped into two types the first type of prediction method is the traditional regression based method manobavan et al 2002 forecasted the interannual trends of terrestrial ndvi dynamics in south america after climatic perturbations with the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model jiang et al 2010 predicted the trend intra annual variation and seasonal cycle of the leaf area index lai with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima model based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai product over the last five years liu et al 2018 investigated the sensitivity of vegetation dynamics to climate variability based on multiple linear regression however the temporal interactions inherent to vegetation ecosystem processes are difficult to adequately represent with these parameters and linear models reddy and prasad 2018 moreover it remains a challenge to extract useful information from remote sensing images containing vast amounts of pixels for application in traditional regression based models yu et al 2022 the other type of prediction method entails machine learning methods the markov chain model incrementally calculates possible next states via a probability mass function stepchenko and chizhov 2015 artificial neural networks anns such as backpropagation bp neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been adopted to forecast vegetation change kang et al 2016 zhou and yang 2008 recurrent neural networks rnns are a type of artificial neural network characterized by internal self connections that can accurately learn and represent dynamic input output relationships for time series prediction as they have both feedback and feedforward connections smith and jin 2014 therefore an rnn is especially suitable for ndvi time series prediction tasks because the model possesses the memory to store information obtained from past data in a time series format a long short term memory lstm network is an rnn variant that can internally store received information for a long period until a specified time this property results in a highly preferable model for time series prediction that avoids the exploding gradient phenomenon gamboa 2017 the water level in wetlands greatly impacts the vegetation dynamics therein and thus is an important input parameter of the lstm model however the zhalong wetland exhibits large water level discrepancies and a complex water regime attributed to complex topography and land utilization processes gao et al 2021 for example many villages exist upstream and human activities such as agricultural activities water conservancy projects road construction and tourism change the natural topography and hydrology within wetlands zhang and zhang 2019 nevertheless because hydrodynamic processes dominate the energy and material cycles in wetlands brinson 1993 song et al 2007 ward et al 2020 a single water level or water depth cannot represent the water regime throughout the entire wetland therefore a new wetland partitioning method was suggested based on hydrologic connectivity and cluster analysis this wetland partitioning method is more convenient and efficient than the traditional methods usually based on vast sampling results or simple geographic segmentation lv et al 2013 yang et al 2016 in this study wetland hydrodynamic processes were simulated by a hydrodynamic model based on historical reservoir discharge data the wetland was divided into several subareas with relatively strong hydrologic connectivity according to the water level variations of all elements within the hydrodynamic model furthermore one element of each subarea was selected and the water level variation of that element was extracted to represent the water regime within the corresponding subarea the lstm models of these subareas were established based on the water level of the element in addition to temperature and sunshine duration data to simulate and verify the ndvi of all elements then ecological water supplementation scenarios were designed and input into the hydrodynamic model to simulate the water regime of the wetland under each different scenario the spatiotemporal distributions of the ndvi within the zhalong wetland over the next five years under the different water supplementation scenarios were predicted by the trained lstm models which were driven by the water level variations of the selected elements in these subareas and meteorological data spanning the past five years 2 study area the zhalong wetland which was listed as an internationally important wetland protectorate in 1992 is located in the lower reaches of the wuyuer river the second largest inland river in china fig 1 a this wetland is one of the largest marsh wetlands in china and exhibits a drainage area of approximately 2100 km2 extending between 46 52 47 32 n and 123 47 124 37 e the wetland which exhibits weather conditions including warm and rainy summers and cold and dry winters ranges in elevation from 137 16 to 150 67 m above sea level fig 1c and this area experiences a typical inland semiarid climate the annual mean temperature ranges from 1 5 to 3 c and the annual precipitation reaches 427 mm the wetland contains many villages roads and ditches which causes complex topography and water regimes gao et al 2021 moreover the substrates of the zhalong wetland have relatively high viscosity and low permeability typically 0 5 mm d which slows the surface water groundwater exchange feng et al 2013 this wetland which hosts more than 260 bird species is the largest artificial breeding area for red crowned cranes grus japonensis in china hu et al 2021 moreover this area is an important habitat for many other wildlife species especially several endangered cranes such as red crowned cranes grus japonensis siberian cranes grus leucogeranus and white naped cranes grus vipio based on its ecological and environmental functions the wetland was divided into core buffer and experimental regions the core region of the wetland is surrounded by highways in the north and south and ditches in the east and west fig 1b the study area is covered by monodominant stands of reed phragmites communis whereas other species are interspersed and include narrow leaved cattail typha angustifolia bur reed sparganium stoloniferum soft stem bulrush scirpus validus lesser duckweed lemna minor and floating leaved pondweed potamogeton natans reeds flourish and are the dominant vegetation type covering 80 of the land area in the core region water storage in the dongsheng reservoir received from the upper river and the water diversion project comprise the main water sources in the core wetland region however the aquatic ecosystems within this wetland have been notably affected by excessive water withdrawals in the upstream basin gao et al 2021 according to data provided by water resources planning of the zhalong wetland zhalong nature reserve administration bureau the reed yield was reduced to half of the yield reported in the 1980s furthermore the number of birds decreased from 100 000 to fewer than 50 000 due to a decrease in primary producers and habitat destruction hu et al 2021 3 method 3 1 data collection ndvi data acquired by modis sensors were obtained in this study the ndvi from april to november was chosen to describe the vegetation dynamics in the core region of the zhalong wetland spatiotemporally continuous modis ndvi data with a spatial resolution of 250 m at a 16 day interval between 2015 and 2020 were obtained from the collection 6 mod13q1 product didan 2015 the modis data are available from the nasa land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov many smoothing techniques or noise reduction filters are generally implemented to eliminate perturbations and interpolate time series data in this study the linear interpolation method was adopted to fill gaps in the data because of the relatively stable vegetation dynamics within a short period the savitzky golay filter was applied to eliminate perturbations in the ndvi time series data this method has generally been applied to reconstruct high quality ndvi time series datasets cao et al 2018 finally the obtained ndvi values were normalized between 0 and 1 the daily inflow into the wetland from the dongsheng reservoir was obtained from the reservoir management meteorological data including daily precipitation temperature and sunshine duration from 2015 to 2020 were considered in the lstm models and were obtained from daily surface climatological datasets in china high resolution topographic data with a 30 m spatial resolution for the study area were considered to represent the wetland topography in the hydrodynamic model 3 2 hydrodynamic model the zhalong wetland is a large shallow freshwater wetland with a spatially heterogeneous water depth hu et al 2021 the depth of the wetland generally ranges from 0 1 to 0 7 m and the depth of lakes within the wetland generally ranges from 3 to 5 m therefore a two dimensional mathematical equation was adopted to describe the characteristics of the water depth distribution within the core wetland region mike21 is a widely adopted state of the art modelling system developed by the danish hydraulic institute that includes hydrodynamics advection dispersion sediment transport environment and particle tracking modules dhi 2017 shumilova et al 2018 hu et al 2019 mike21 employs triangular grid elements instead of a fixed grid system based on the cell centred finite volume method which is a highly flexible approach moreover mike21 can greatly reduce the calculation time and preserve accuracy by using longer strides in this study mike21 was employed to simplify the modelling process ensure the robustness of the simulation method and reduce the number of simulation calculation steps in the zhalong wetland hydrodynamic simulation process the scope and boundary of the model were determined by the water diversion canals outside the wetland in the east and west and the highway and railway in the north and south respectively fig 1b the wetland topography was established based on measured dem 30 30 m data provided by the zhalong nature reserve administration bureau furthermore the simulation area was divided into 158 085 triangular elements and 7702 nodes in this model to ensure the precision and stability of the model the dynamic time step interval was set to 120 s hydrological factors including rainfall evaporation transpiration and runoff in the wetland were adopted as model inputs daily discharge data of the dongsheng reservoir between 2019 9 1 and 2019 11 16 were applied as the inflow boundary conditions additionally the q h curves of the four discharge outlets were selected as the outflow boundary conditions the water regime of the zhalong wetland was simulated with the established hydrodynamic model the water level variations at four monitoring points in the wetland were obtained by td diver schlumberger water services netherlands and the observation data were adopted to verify the simulation results the root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse have been widely considered to evaluate model performance in this study these two indicators between the simulated and observation data were adopted to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulated water levels nse values typically range from minus infinity to 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated and observed values whereas nse 0 indicates that the simulated values are no better than the mean of the observation data smaller rmse values indicate smaller actual simulation errors and therefore a lower deviation between the observed and simulated values the calculation equations are as follows 1 rmse t 1 n w s t w o t 2 n 2 nse 1 t 1 n w s t w o t 2 t 1 n w s t μ o 2 where n is the total number of time steps w s t and w o t are the simulated and observed water levels respectively at time step t and μ o is the mean observed water level value 3 3 wetland partitioning method the water regime of the zhalong wetland is complicated due to the complex topography and high hydraulic slope gao et al 2021 therefore the study area was divided into several subareas based on relatively strong hydrologic connectivity in the first step the water level variation in all wetland elements simulated with mike21 was extracted via python time series data comprising 15 085 elements were obtained in this step then to reduce the dimensionality time series data at these 15 085 elements were fitted with the data of one arbitrarily selected element furthermore a 15 085 element based correlation coefficient r was calculated as a one dimensional dataset the obtained one dimensional dataset could be regarded as characteristic values representing the water level variation of each element the similar r values indicate that the water level variations of these elements were similar in the next step the one dimensional dataset was subjected to cluster analysis to divide the wetland into several subareas with strong hydrologic connectivity the k means clustering method is an unsupervised learning algorithm introduced by macqueen 1967 that can solve the well known clustering problem the dataset was divided into k subsets such that all points within a given subset were the closest to the same centre the k centres were randomly distributed within the dataset subsequently the euclidean distances between the data and cluster centres were measured the similarity between the data and centre was defined by the euclidean distance and the average of each cluster was calculated after all data were assigned to a centre these average values were regarded as the new centres of the clusters the k means clustering process was repeated until the centres no longer changed between iterations large datasets can be efficiently processed with this algorithm in this study two cluster analyses were employed for wetland partitioning large patches with strong hydrologic connectivity were obtained in the first cluster analysis subsequently several wetland subareas were divided in the second cluster analysis based on the characteristic values representing the water level variation within each patch the water level variations of the elements within a subarea were consistent therefore the water level variation of one element can be extracted to reflect the water level variation within a subarea 3 4 lstm network model the lstm network is an advanced technique developed from the traditional rnn in this study an lstm network was adopted to predict the spatiotemporal variations in the ndvi within this wetland based on the daily water depth temperature sunshine duration and vegetation growth period rnns which include a feedback loop and internal memory remember information in a sequential order similar to humans gamboa 2017 the sequence is stored in the internal memory for a long time which contributes to more accurate decisions in the next step nevertheless traditional rnns generally exhibit exploding and disappearing gradients in the training process reddy and prasad 2018 to resolve these problems the memory cell contains a gate that determines what information should be stored read or written and is developed in lstm networks therefore lstm can learn from a large number of time steps and is suitable for time series prediction an lstm memory cell includes a forget gate an input gate an output gate and a hidden state fig 2 different levels of information are passed through these gates comprising a sigmoid layer the sigmoid layer output value varies between 0 and 1 where values of zero and one indicate that no information and all information respectively are passed through the network in the lstm network the first step is to determine the nonessential information that should be removed from the cell this process is governed by the forget gate f t which receives the hidden state output of the last unit and the current input the forget gate outputs a value ranging from 0 to 1 where a value of zero indicates that the information should be completely forgotten and a value of one indicates that all information should be retained by the network 3 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where ft is a sigmoid function and determines the weight matrices and bias within the forget gate the input gate i t is calculated via the sigmoid function with a linear relationship between x t and h t 1 which determines what new information should be remembered by adding this information to the cell state c t is calculated via the tanh function with a linear relationship between x t and h t 1 which yields a candidate new cell state 4 i τ σ w i h t 1 x t b i 5 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c where i t is the input gate state c t is a new candidate value and w and b are the weight matrices and bias respectively in the cell state then the cell state c t is updated based on i t and c t and new memory is added to the previous memory c t 1 resulting in c t 6 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where c t 1 and c t are the cell states at times t 1 and t respectively finally the output gate o t controls what information from the current cell state is generated as output and the output result at the current step h t is the product of o t and the new values created by the tanh layer from the cell state c t 7 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 8 h t o t tanh c t in this study an lstm network is selected as the neural network algorithm to predict the ndvi time series of each wetland element because the ndvi generally depends on the water level temperature and sunshine duration over the past several days therefore the daily water level at the nodes reflecting the water regimes in the subareas were applied in conjunction with temperature and sunshine duration data as the input data to simulate the ndvi time series of all elements the lstm layer was built with modern machine learning software packages tensorflow and keras based on python 3 5 ecological water supplementation scenario design the wuyuer river is an historic source of water that flows into the zhalong wetland as a result of rapid socioeconomic development many reservoirs and diversion engineering projects have been implemented in the basin one such project the dongsheng reservoir is located at the junction between the wuyuer river and the core region of the zhalong wetland and eliminates natural hydraulic interactions between the river and wetland chen et al 2020 because most water resources within the dongsheng reservoir are employed for agricultural irrigation and aquaculture downstream wetland ecosystems have been damaged by intense water resource exploitation resulting in the loss of high quality water and diverse ecosystem services therefore approximately 0 3 million megalitres of water each year is diverted to this wetland via diversion engineering to meet the wetland ecological water requirements under the common efforts and cooperation of wetland managers and superior administrative units three reservoir discharge scenarios were established as follows table 1 the study area is covered by monodominant stands of reed phragmites communis whereas other species are interspersed and include narrow leaved cattail typha angustifolia bur reed sparganium stoloniferum soft stem bulrush scirpus validus lesser duckweed lemna minor and floating leaved pondweed potamogeton natans p communis is usually found in deep and shallow marshes and is a widely occurring wetland plant worldwide the tall dense cane like stands of this persistent emergent provide an excellent habitat for species such as g japonensis in particular p communis is the major vegetation type occurring within the zhalong wetland in the cold region of northeast china this reed germinates and grows in may and june respectively blooms in july and august and reaches maturation in september therefore under this scenario the reservoir discharge was set to 22 7 m3 s and the wetland ecological water supplementation period was set to last for 153 days from may to september the supplied water quantity reached 0 3 million megalitres under this scenario wetland ecological water supplementation could cause a loss of agricultural income because of the conflict between ecological and agricultural water cai and rosegrant 2004 april is the most vital period for reed growth reeds are perennial emergent plants that germinate in april in april appropriate ecological water supplementation may contribute to the germination and growth of more reed stalks hu et al 2021 moreover considering the conflict between ecological and agricultural water another ecological water supplementation period was implemented in september representing the end of the irrigation season to retain additional water in this wetland li et al 2005 therefore under this scenario the first ecological water supplementation period started in april and lasted a total of 31 days another ecological water supplementation period occurred in september spanning a total of 30 days the reservoir discharge was set to 56 92 m3 s the supplied water quantity reached 0 3 million megalitres this wetland ecological water supplementation scenario considered the wetland ecosystem and regional agricultural development to avoid the conflict between agricultural and ecological water all the ecological water of the wetland is released from the dongsheng reservoir in september which is the end of the irrigation season in the wuyuer basin moreover the zhalong wetland is located in a cold region of northeast china during the freezing period from december to march of the following year consequently wetland ecological water supplementation in september allows this wetland to retain considerable amounts of water that can contribute to vegetation growth in the following year therefore under this scenario the discharge from the reservoir was set to 115 m3 s and discharge occurred from september 1 to 30 the supplied water quantity reached approximately 0 3 million megalitres furthermore reservoir discharge as a boundary condition was input into the established hydrodynamic model to simulate the water level distribution within the wetland the daily water level at each node reflecting the water regime of each subarea was extracted and input into the corresponding lstm model to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of the ndvi within the zhalong wetland over the next five years under the three different water supplementation scenarios 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic model performance the water regime of the zhalong wetland was simulated with the established hydrodynamic model the variations in the water level at the four monitoring points within the wetland were extracted and observations were adopted to verify the simulation results the model was verified against the observed water level variations at four stations tumuke zhaokai woniugang and erdaoqiao from 2019 7 to 2019 11 fig 3 the nse values during the validation period at the four stations were 0 96 0 96 0 97 and 0 97 respectively and the rmse values at these stations were 0 04 0 04 0 04 and 0 05 m these results indicate that the established hydrodynamic model yielded good agreement between the simulated water level values and observation data within the wetland moreover the model accurately simulated the real water regime demonstrating that the parameter selection process was reasonable 4 2 wetland partitioning hydrodynamic processes dominate the energy and material cycles within this wetland brinson 1993 song et al 2007 ward et al 2020 a region with a relatively high degree of hydrologic connectivity generally provides similar ecosystem services and ecosystems throughout hwang et al 2012 pringle 2001 thus the variation in the water level of each element was simulated with the hydrodynamic model and the characteristic value of the water level variation the correlation coefficient r was calculated and analysed to determine the wetland subareas the characteristic values were divided into 24 categories according to the first cluster analysis results fig 4 a accordingly the wetland was divided into 24 patches fig 5 a the water level variation of each element within these patches was uniform however on the basis of the characteristic value distribution of each patch many patches with similar water level variations should be merged thus a second cluster analysis based on the characteristic values representing the above 24 patches was employed to merge patches with similar hydrodynamic processes to ensure applicability in wetland management the number of subareas should be smaller than 10 the results of the second cluster analysis indicated that all characteristic values could be divided into 7 categories the mean characteristic values of the water level variation in subareas 7 6 3 2 1 4 and 5 were 0 11 0 36 0 67 0 75 0 88 0 96 and 0 98 respectively with corresponding ranges of 0 05 0 14 0 19 0 54 0 59 0 81 0 51 0 95 0 73 0 96 0 88 0 98 and 0 95 1 00 respectively fig 4b there was a large overlap in the characteristic values between subareas 2 and 3 but these subareas were spatially separated the number of elements in subareas 7 6 3 2 1 4 and 5 in the hydrodynamic model were 335 508 118 385 740 2186 and 47 respectively and the areas of these seven subareas reached 31 84 61 12 14 76 34 51 95 58 199 97 and 21 73 km2 fig 5b however the areas of these seven subareas were not constant as the surrounding land areas could become floodplains during extreme flood events therefore the obtained wetland partitions may not remain constant in this study the water level variation in a normal flow year was considered for wetland partitioning the complex topography and terrain barriers resulted in wetland subareas with relatively high degrees of hydrologic connectivity within this wetland in low flow years the number of subareas could increase whereas the number of subareas could decrease in high flow years because flows with higher flow rates and water levels can flow through obstacles feng et al 2013 4 3 lstm model performance subareas 2 and 3 were more independent than the other subareas fig 5b this resulted in comparatively limited effects of reservoir discharge on the water level variation in subareas 2 and 3 therefore the ndvi values within these two subareas were not simulated in this study the nse and rmse values of the lstm model for each of the five remaining subareas are shown in fig 6 the ndvi dataset from 2015 to 2018 was applied as the training set and the dataset from 2019 to 2020 was employed for simulation and verification the nse and rmse values of the model of subarea 1 ranged from 0 80 to 0 99 and 0 01 to 0 08 respectively in subarea 1 the nse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 953 and the rmse values at 75 of all nodes were smaller than 0 04 in subarea 4 the nse and rmse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 931 and smaller than 0 061 respectively in subarea 5 the nse and rmse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 887 and smaller than 0 071 respectively in subarea 6 the nse and rmse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 825 and smaller than 0 076 respectively additionally these two parameters within subarea 7 were higher than 0 853 and smaller than 0 071 respectively these results indicate that the ndvi values at most nodes were accurately simulated within the zhalong wetland however in subareas 4 6 and 7 many nodes exhibited relatively large rmse and high nse values indicating that the ndvi at these nodes was inaccurately simulated in these subareas many puddles had formed in small lakes within this wetland the water depths of these lakes change with the wetland water level and are generally large because of the low terrain furthermore the large water depth prevented reeds from growing in these lakes fig 7 shows that the northwestern sections of subareas 4 and 6 and the eastern section of subarea 7 display low ndvi values year round 4 4 ndvi dynamics under the three reservoir discharge scenarios the lstm model was employed to predict the spatiotemporal distributions of the ndvi within the zhalong wetland over the next five years under the different water supplementation scenarios the maximum ndvi at each node in each year was extracted as shown in fig 7 under all three scenarios the ndvi generally decreased due to changes in the natural hydrological conditions the average yearly water supply amount reached 0 35 million megalitres from 2015 to 2020 because of successive high flow years the average maximum ndvi of all nodes within the wetland under the three scenarios reached 0 819 in the first year and 0 793 in the fifth year table 2 through manual intervention in one year the mean ndvi values within this wetland generally remained stable under the three scenarios the small interannual difference may be due to the climate conditions such as temperature and sunshine duration hou et al 2018 compared to the natural hydrological regime artificial ecological water supplementation under limited water resources imposed limited effects on vegetation growth meng et al 2019 however artificial ecological water supplementation could generally maintain the vegetation ecosystem of this wetland chen et al 2020 as evidenced in fig 7 the ndvi in subarea 4 was significantly lower than that in the other subareas in the lower reach of subarea 4 the largest subarea vegetation degradation was caused by water scarcity nevertheless the supplementation of water hardly influenced the lower reach of subarea 4 in contrast the ndvi values in subareas 5 and 6 were not notably reduced water retention caused by the railway in the southern wetland area and the barrier between subareas 5 and 6 resulted in a constant water depth within these subareas therefore the vegetation dynamics in subareas 5 and 6 remained relatively stable fig 8 shows the average monthly maximum ndvi of all nodes within the wetland under the three reservoir discharge scenarios generally the ndvi increased beginning in april and peaked in july within the wetland li et al 2013 na et al 2018 regardless of the water supply this trend remained unaltered the three water supplementation scenarios slightly affected the ndvi in april and november which are periods in which wetland vegetation desiccates in may and june the ndvi values under scenario 2 were relatively high while the ndvi values under scenario 1 were relatively high in june august and september however in june and july which are peak periods of wetland vegetation the ndvi values under scenarios 1 and 2 were very similar the ndvi values in scenario 1 and scenario 2 were relatively high because the two ecological water supplementation scenarios considered the growth period of p communis which dominates the zhalong wetland moreover the results indicate that an approximately one month delay was needed to reveal the ndvi response to wetland ecological water supplementation according to the five year average ndvi values in this wetland under the three scenarios table 2 scenario 1 with continuous water supplementation and low flow conditions imposed suitable effects on the wetland vegetation ecosystem against the background of limited water resources however this scenario could cause agricultural water shortages which could result in economic losses over the other scenarios cai and rosegrant 2004 liu et al 2005 the lower reach of subarea 4 should be highlighted as other methods of wetland ecological water supplementation aimed at the lower reach of subarea 4 could be required in this wetland in the zhalong wetland red crowned cranes grus japonensis siberian cranes grus leucogeranus key protected species in this wetland generally nidificate and breed from april to june hu et al 2021 a region suitably covered with vegetation is beneficial for the nidification and breeding of water fowl species during this vital period na et al 2015 wang et al 2019 under scenario 2 the ndvi reached its maximum value in may and june and the peak ndvi value in july was relatively high in addition the conflict between agricultural and ecological water was less pronounced in scenario 2 than in scenario 1 therefore scenario 2 is recommended to wetland managers and administrative units 4 5 implications for wetland restoration the zhalong wetland is highly valued for its ecological service functions water scarcity has resulted in vegetation degradation and habitat destruction therefore local government officials are strongly concerned with protecting and restoring the zhalong wetland supplying water to the wetland is the most efficient and direct way to restore the ecosystem by revitalizing the vegetation and enhancing the biodiversity therein yu et al 2021 many wetlands have been restored and protected by ecological water supplementation such as the ecosystems of the everglades and yellow river delta lockwood et al 2003 yu et al 2021 this study suggested a new partitioning scheme for wetlands based on hydrologic connectivity this method can support site selection efforts for hydrologic monitoring or for ecological monitoring in wetlands with complex topography furthermore this study evaluated vegetation dynamics under different ecological water supplementation scenarios in the zhalong wetland the proposed workflow can be used to evaluate the ecological benefits of different ecological water supplementation schemes in many wetlands that have degraded due to water scarcity however long term hydrological data and ecological data are crucial for the lstm model moreover in this study the ndvi values of scenario 1 and scenario 2 were relatively high because these two ecological water supplementation scenarios considered the growth period of p communis which dominates the zhalong wetland fig 8 while appropriate ecological water supplementation contributed to the growth of p communis under both scenarios the vegetation type varies in different wetlands across the globe therefore the design of ecological water supplementation scenarios should be adjusted according to the vegetation types and water use in different geographic regions it is worth noting that vegetation dynamics are not the only determining factor when assessing the success of ecological restoration the ndvi response provided by inundation may not be sufficient for the nidification and breeding of waterfowl species the duration and depth of inundation in the habitats of wildlife species are also important considerations wetlands with shallower water depths and longer water inundation times generally provide more abundant benthic macroinvertebrates and small fishes which are major food sources for wildlife species jeffres et al 2020 meanwhile field observations of 38 nests of red crowned cranes in the zhalong wetland indicated that the water depths around their nesting sites generally ranged from 10 to 30 cm hu et al 2021 persistent high water levels have adverse effects on bird nesting and foraging habitats due to the body length limits of the shorebird and their fledglings jiang et al 2016 strategically reducing the water levels and managing for appropriate land water ratios may increase the overall area of suitable habitat in many wetlands liu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 thus the complex coupling mechanisms among hydrology vegetation and habitats in wetland ecosystems should be clarified in future studies 5 conclusion excessive water extraction over the past decade has seriously deteriorated the ecological water requirements within the wuyuer river basin and damaged the ecosystems of downstream wetlands wetland ecological water supplementation is the most common method for protecting wetland ecosystems in this study the zhalong wetland was divided into 7 subareas with relatively high hydrologic connectivity based on a hydrodynamic model and cluster analysis the lstm neural network models were constructed for 5 subareas notably affected by water supplementation to simulate and verify the spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi based on water level temperature and sunshine duration data to evaluate vegetation dynamics under different wetland ecological water supplementation conditions the water levels of these 5 subareas under different scenarios were defined using historical meteorological data to drive the lstm model this study revealed the following 1 the spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi at most nodes was accurately simulated within this wetland but large errors generally occurred in regions with small lakes 2 scenario 1 characterized by continuous and low flow water supplementation imposed highly positive influences on the annual maximum ndvi in this wetland against the background of limited water resources however agricultural economic losses could occur under this scenario 3 the lower reach of subarea 4 the largest subarea was less positively affected by ecological water supplementation and should be emphasized as additional channels of water supplementation aimed at this region could be needed 4 scenario 2 in which water supplementation occurred in april and september is recommended because of the positive effects on the nidification and breeding of water fowl species and the limited conflict between agricultural and ecological water these results can provide important references for both wetland and water resource managers in the region credit authorship contribution statement weize wang

3470,wetland plants are a key factor in ecosystems but are threatened by water extraction and water resource exploitation ecological water supplementation is a common solution to the water scarcity problem in wetlands in this study the zhalong wetland with a complex water regime was divided into several subareas with relatively strong hydrologic connectivity based on a hydrodynamic model and cluster analysis the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dynamics were simulated and verified with long short term memory lstm neural network models established for the various wetland subareas based on the subarea water levels and temperature and sunshine duration data to evaluate the effects of different ecological water supplementation scenarios on the spatiotemporal ndvi variation across the wetland the water levels of subareas under different scenarios were used to drive the lstm model the results indicate that 1 the spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi at most nodes within the wetland was accurately simulated but large errors generally occurred in regions with small lakes 2 ecological water supplementation with continuous and low flow discharge imposed highly positive influences on the annual maximum ndvi in the wetland against the background of limited water resources 3 the lower reach in the largest subarea was less positively affected by wetland ecological water supplementation 4 water supplementation with discharge in april and september was recommended because of the benefits for the nidification and breeding of water fowl species and the limited conflict between agricultural and ecological water this study provides important references for both wetland and water resource managers keywords recurrent neural network water resource management wetland partition wetland restoration zhalong wetland 1 introduction wetlands which provide high quality and diverse ecosystem services to abundant plant and animal communities represent some of the most vital aquatic systems on the earth s surface costanza et al 1989 however rapid socioeconomic development especially in developing countries has exerted enormous stresses on wetlands thereby intensifying wetland degradation and deterioration kirwan and megonigal 2013 in general the main objective of wetland protection and restoration is species diversity restoration which depends on the protection and restoration of plant communities whigham 1999 wetland plants are the most common producers and vegetation coverage determines the productivity of wetlands skidmore et al 2003 suggested that species become more specialized when resources are abundant and reliable which is beneficial to a larger number of species per unit area since the quantity of consumer individuals increases due to higher productivity species diversity also increases diamond 1988 moreover plants provide natural refuge and habitat to consumers orrock et al 2010 suitable vegetation coverage is partly beneficial to a high species diversity hacker and gaines 1997 in wetlands water resources and climate conditions play vital roles in vegetation growth thus wetland water shortages attributed to water use associated with socioeconomic development may lead to vegetation degradation and species loss hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 yu et al 2021 considering that water is a critical influencing factor of the development and evolution of wetlands rational mitigation of the water scarcity problem in wetlands has become a major research focus the zhalong wetland the terminal wetland of the wuyuer river is an internationally important wetland and the largest breeding centre of red crowned cranes in china geng et al 2020 however water became scarce following the construction of the dongsheng reservoir which is located at the junction between the wuyuer river and the core region of the zhalong wetland wetlands that function as aquatic habitats are highly sensitive to water level fluctuations ray et al 2019 moreover water scarcity causes vegetation degradation and damages aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2021 wetland ecological water supplementation is the most common solution to this problem docker and robinson 2014 hodge and mcnally 2000 zhao et al 2016 therefore the evaluation of vegetation dynamics under ecological water supplementation yields important implications for wetland ecological restoration the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi a widely recognized indicator in vegetation related studies is a numerical indicator of the greenness of vegetation calculated in the visible and near infrared bands based on remote sensing images powell et al 2014 the ndvi ranges from 1 to 1 a high positive ndvi value indicates greener and denser vegetation whereas more negative ndvi values reflect non vegetation classes such as water snow bare land and urban land the profile of the annual ndvi value increases with vegetation growth and gradually reaches a peak or plateau over time however the ndvi profile eventually declines as vegetation wilts and dies on a yearly time scale the ndvi also increases and decreases under vegetation restoration and degeneration respectively time series ndvi prediction methods can be grouped into two types the first type of prediction method is the traditional regression based method manobavan et al 2002 forecasted the interannual trends of terrestrial ndvi dynamics in south america after climatic perturbations with the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model jiang et al 2010 predicted the trend intra annual variation and seasonal cycle of the leaf area index lai with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima model based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai product over the last five years liu et al 2018 investigated the sensitivity of vegetation dynamics to climate variability based on multiple linear regression however the temporal interactions inherent to vegetation ecosystem processes are difficult to adequately represent with these parameters and linear models reddy and prasad 2018 moreover it remains a challenge to extract useful information from remote sensing images containing vast amounts of pixels for application in traditional regression based models yu et al 2022 the other type of prediction method entails machine learning methods the markov chain model incrementally calculates possible next states via a probability mass function stepchenko and chizhov 2015 artificial neural networks anns such as backpropagation bp neural networks and convolutional neural networks have been adopted to forecast vegetation change kang et al 2016 zhou and yang 2008 recurrent neural networks rnns are a type of artificial neural network characterized by internal self connections that can accurately learn and represent dynamic input output relationships for time series prediction as they have both feedback and feedforward connections smith and jin 2014 therefore an rnn is especially suitable for ndvi time series prediction tasks because the model possesses the memory to store information obtained from past data in a time series format a long short term memory lstm network is an rnn variant that can internally store received information for a long period until a specified time this property results in a highly preferable model for time series prediction that avoids the exploding gradient phenomenon gamboa 2017 the water level in wetlands greatly impacts the vegetation dynamics therein and thus is an important input parameter of the lstm model however the zhalong wetland exhibits large water level discrepancies and a complex water regime attributed to complex topography and land utilization processes gao et al 2021 for example many villages exist upstream and human activities such as agricultural activities water conservancy projects road construction and tourism change the natural topography and hydrology within wetlands zhang and zhang 2019 nevertheless because hydrodynamic processes dominate the energy and material cycles in wetlands brinson 1993 song et al 2007 ward et al 2020 a single water level or water depth cannot represent the water regime throughout the entire wetland therefore a new wetland partitioning method was suggested based on hydrologic connectivity and cluster analysis this wetland partitioning method is more convenient and efficient than the traditional methods usually based on vast sampling results or simple geographic segmentation lv et al 2013 yang et al 2016 in this study wetland hydrodynamic processes were simulated by a hydrodynamic model based on historical reservoir discharge data the wetland was divided into several subareas with relatively strong hydrologic connectivity according to the water level variations of all elements within the hydrodynamic model furthermore one element of each subarea was selected and the water level variation of that element was extracted to represent the water regime within the corresponding subarea the lstm models of these subareas were established based on the water level of the element in addition to temperature and sunshine duration data to simulate and verify the ndvi of all elements then ecological water supplementation scenarios were designed and input into the hydrodynamic model to simulate the water regime of the wetland under each different scenario the spatiotemporal distributions of the ndvi within the zhalong wetland over the next five years under the different water supplementation scenarios were predicted by the trained lstm models which were driven by the water level variations of the selected elements in these subareas and meteorological data spanning the past five years 2 study area the zhalong wetland which was listed as an internationally important wetland protectorate in 1992 is located in the lower reaches of the wuyuer river the second largest inland river in china fig 1 a this wetland is one of the largest marsh wetlands in china and exhibits a drainage area of approximately 2100 km2 extending between 46 52 47 32 n and 123 47 124 37 e the wetland which exhibits weather conditions including warm and rainy summers and cold and dry winters ranges in elevation from 137 16 to 150 67 m above sea level fig 1c and this area experiences a typical inland semiarid climate the annual mean temperature ranges from 1 5 to 3 c and the annual precipitation reaches 427 mm the wetland contains many villages roads and ditches which causes complex topography and water regimes gao et al 2021 moreover the substrates of the zhalong wetland have relatively high viscosity and low permeability typically 0 5 mm d which slows the surface water groundwater exchange feng et al 2013 this wetland which hosts more than 260 bird species is the largest artificial breeding area for red crowned cranes grus japonensis in china hu et al 2021 moreover this area is an important habitat for many other wildlife species especially several endangered cranes such as red crowned cranes grus japonensis siberian cranes grus leucogeranus and white naped cranes grus vipio based on its ecological and environmental functions the wetland was divided into core buffer and experimental regions the core region of the wetland is surrounded by highways in the north and south and ditches in the east and west fig 1b the study area is covered by monodominant stands of reed phragmites communis whereas other species are interspersed and include narrow leaved cattail typha angustifolia bur reed sparganium stoloniferum soft stem bulrush scirpus validus lesser duckweed lemna minor and floating leaved pondweed potamogeton natans reeds flourish and are the dominant vegetation type covering 80 of the land area in the core region water storage in the dongsheng reservoir received from the upper river and the water diversion project comprise the main water sources in the core wetland region however the aquatic ecosystems within this wetland have been notably affected by excessive water withdrawals in the upstream basin gao et al 2021 according to data provided by water resources planning of the zhalong wetland zhalong nature reserve administration bureau the reed yield was reduced to half of the yield reported in the 1980s furthermore the number of birds decreased from 100 000 to fewer than 50 000 due to a decrease in primary producers and habitat destruction hu et al 2021 3 method 3 1 data collection ndvi data acquired by modis sensors were obtained in this study the ndvi from april to november was chosen to describe the vegetation dynamics in the core region of the zhalong wetland spatiotemporally continuous modis ndvi data with a spatial resolution of 250 m at a 16 day interval between 2015 and 2020 were obtained from the collection 6 mod13q1 product didan 2015 the modis data are available from the nasa land processes distributed active archive center https lpdaac usgs gov many smoothing techniques or noise reduction filters are generally implemented to eliminate perturbations and interpolate time series data in this study the linear interpolation method was adopted to fill gaps in the data because of the relatively stable vegetation dynamics within a short period the savitzky golay filter was applied to eliminate perturbations in the ndvi time series data this method has generally been applied to reconstruct high quality ndvi time series datasets cao et al 2018 finally the obtained ndvi values were normalized between 0 and 1 the daily inflow into the wetland from the dongsheng reservoir was obtained from the reservoir management meteorological data including daily precipitation temperature and sunshine duration from 2015 to 2020 were considered in the lstm models and were obtained from daily surface climatological datasets in china high resolution topographic data with a 30 m spatial resolution for the study area were considered to represent the wetland topography in the hydrodynamic model 3 2 hydrodynamic model the zhalong wetland is a large shallow freshwater wetland with a spatially heterogeneous water depth hu et al 2021 the depth of the wetland generally ranges from 0 1 to 0 7 m and the depth of lakes within the wetland generally ranges from 3 to 5 m therefore a two dimensional mathematical equation was adopted to describe the characteristics of the water depth distribution within the core wetland region mike21 is a widely adopted state of the art modelling system developed by the danish hydraulic institute that includes hydrodynamics advection dispersion sediment transport environment and particle tracking modules dhi 2017 shumilova et al 2018 hu et al 2019 mike21 employs triangular grid elements instead of a fixed grid system based on the cell centred finite volume method which is a highly flexible approach moreover mike21 can greatly reduce the calculation time and preserve accuracy by using longer strides in this study mike21 was employed to simplify the modelling process ensure the robustness of the simulation method and reduce the number of simulation calculation steps in the zhalong wetland hydrodynamic simulation process the scope and boundary of the model were determined by the water diversion canals outside the wetland in the east and west and the highway and railway in the north and south respectively fig 1b the wetland topography was established based on measured dem 30 30 m data provided by the zhalong nature reserve administration bureau furthermore the simulation area was divided into 158 085 triangular elements and 7702 nodes in this model to ensure the precision and stability of the model the dynamic time step interval was set to 120 s hydrological factors including rainfall evaporation transpiration and runoff in the wetland were adopted as model inputs daily discharge data of the dongsheng reservoir between 2019 9 1 and 2019 11 16 were applied as the inflow boundary conditions additionally the q h curves of the four discharge outlets were selected as the outflow boundary conditions the water regime of the zhalong wetland was simulated with the established hydrodynamic model the water level variations at four monitoring points in the wetland were obtained by td diver schlumberger water services netherlands and the observation data were adopted to verify the simulation results the root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse have been widely considered to evaluate model performance in this study these two indicators between the simulated and observation data were adopted to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulated water levels nse values typically range from minus infinity to 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated and observed values whereas nse 0 indicates that the simulated values are no better than the mean of the observation data smaller rmse values indicate smaller actual simulation errors and therefore a lower deviation between the observed and simulated values the calculation equations are as follows 1 rmse t 1 n w s t w o t 2 n 2 nse 1 t 1 n w s t w o t 2 t 1 n w s t μ o 2 where n is the total number of time steps w s t and w o t are the simulated and observed water levels respectively at time step t and μ o is the mean observed water level value 3 3 wetland partitioning method the water regime of the zhalong wetland is complicated due to the complex topography and high hydraulic slope gao et al 2021 therefore the study area was divided into several subareas based on relatively strong hydrologic connectivity in the first step the water level variation in all wetland elements simulated with mike21 was extracted via python time series data comprising 15 085 elements were obtained in this step then to reduce the dimensionality time series data at these 15 085 elements were fitted with the data of one arbitrarily selected element furthermore a 15 085 element based correlation coefficient r was calculated as a one dimensional dataset the obtained one dimensional dataset could be regarded as characteristic values representing the water level variation of each element the similar r values indicate that the water level variations of these elements were similar in the next step the one dimensional dataset was subjected to cluster analysis to divide the wetland into several subareas with strong hydrologic connectivity the k means clustering method is an unsupervised learning algorithm introduced by macqueen 1967 that can solve the well known clustering problem the dataset was divided into k subsets such that all points within a given subset were the closest to the same centre the k centres were randomly distributed within the dataset subsequently the euclidean distances between the data and cluster centres were measured the similarity between the data and centre was defined by the euclidean distance and the average of each cluster was calculated after all data were assigned to a centre these average values were regarded as the new centres of the clusters the k means clustering process was repeated until the centres no longer changed between iterations large datasets can be efficiently processed with this algorithm in this study two cluster analyses were employed for wetland partitioning large patches with strong hydrologic connectivity were obtained in the first cluster analysis subsequently several wetland subareas were divided in the second cluster analysis based on the characteristic values representing the water level variation within each patch the water level variations of the elements within a subarea were consistent therefore the water level variation of one element can be extracted to reflect the water level variation within a subarea 3 4 lstm network model the lstm network is an advanced technique developed from the traditional rnn in this study an lstm network was adopted to predict the spatiotemporal variations in the ndvi within this wetland based on the daily water depth temperature sunshine duration and vegetation growth period rnns which include a feedback loop and internal memory remember information in a sequential order similar to humans gamboa 2017 the sequence is stored in the internal memory for a long time which contributes to more accurate decisions in the next step nevertheless traditional rnns generally exhibit exploding and disappearing gradients in the training process reddy and prasad 2018 to resolve these problems the memory cell contains a gate that determines what information should be stored read or written and is developed in lstm networks therefore lstm can learn from a large number of time steps and is suitable for time series prediction an lstm memory cell includes a forget gate an input gate an output gate and a hidden state fig 2 different levels of information are passed through these gates comprising a sigmoid layer the sigmoid layer output value varies between 0 and 1 where values of zero and one indicate that no information and all information respectively are passed through the network in the lstm network the first step is to determine the nonessential information that should be removed from the cell this process is governed by the forget gate f t which receives the hidden state output of the last unit and the current input the forget gate outputs a value ranging from 0 to 1 where a value of zero indicates that the information should be completely forgotten and a value of one indicates that all information should be retained by the network 3 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where ft is a sigmoid function and determines the weight matrices and bias within the forget gate the input gate i t is calculated via the sigmoid function with a linear relationship between x t and h t 1 which determines what new information should be remembered by adding this information to the cell state c t is calculated via the tanh function with a linear relationship between x t and h t 1 which yields a candidate new cell state 4 i τ σ w i h t 1 x t b i 5 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c where i t is the input gate state c t is a new candidate value and w and b are the weight matrices and bias respectively in the cell state then the cell state c t is updated based on i t and c t and new memory is added to the previous memory c t 1 resulting in c t 6 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where c t 1 and c t are the cell states at times t 1 and t respectively finally the output gate o t controls what information from the current cell state is generated as output and the output result at the current step h t is the product of o t and the new values created by the tanh layer from the cell state c t 7 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 8 h t o t tanh c t in this study an lstm network is selected as the neural network algorithm to predict the ndvi time series of each wetland element because the ndvi generally depends on the water level temperature and sunshine duration over the past several days therefore the daily water level at the nodes reflecting the water regimes in the subareas were applied in conjunction with temperature and sunshine duration data as the input data to simulate the ndvi time series of all elements the lstm layer was built with modern machine learning software packages tensorflow and keras based on python 3 5 ecological water supplementation scenario design the wuyuer river is an historic source of water that flows into the zhalong wetland as a result of rapid socioeconomic development many reservoirs and diversion engineering projects have been implemented in the basin one such project the dongsheng reservoir is located at the junction between the wuyuer river and the core region of the zhalong wetland and eliminates natural hydraulic interactions between the river and wetland chen et al 2020 because most water resources within the dongsheng reservoir are employed for agricultural irrigation and aquaculture downstream wetland ecosystems have been damaged by intense water resource exploitation resulting in the loss of high quality water and diverse ecosystem services therefore approximately 0 3 million megalitres of water each year is diverted to this wetland via diversion engineering to meet the wetland ecological water requirements under the common efforts and cooperation of wetland managers and superior administrative units three reservoir discharge scenarios were established as follows table 1 the study area is covered by monodominant stands of reed phragmites communis whereas other species are interspersed and include narrow leaved cattail typha angustifolia bur reed sparganium stoloniferum soft stem bulrush scirpus validus lesser duckweed lemna minor and floating leaved pondweed potamogeton natans p communis is usually found in deep and shallow marshes and is a widely occurring wetland plant worldwide the tall dense cane like stands of this persistent emergent provide an excellent habitat for species such as g japonensis in particular p communis is the major vegetation type occurring within the zhalong wetland in the cold region of northeast china this reed germinates and grows in may and june respectively blooms in july and august and reaches maturation in september therefore under this scenario the reservoir discharge was set to 22 7 m3 s and the wetland ecological water supplementation period was set to last for 153 days from may to september the supplied water quantity reached 0 3 million megalitres under this scenario wetland ecological water supplementation could cause a loss of agricultural income because of the conflict between ecological and agricultural water cai and rosegrant 2004 april is the most vital period for reed growth reeds are perennial emergent plants that germinate in april in april appropriate ecological water supplementation may contribute to the germination and growth of more reed stalks hu et al 2021 moreover considering the conflict between ecological and agricultural water another ecological water supplementation period was implemented in september representing the end of the irrigation season to retain additional water in this wetland li et al 2005 therefore under this scenario the first ecological water supplementation period started in april and lasted a total of 31 days another ecological water supplementation period occurred in september spanning a total of 30 days the reservoir discharge was set to 56 92 m3 s the supplied water quantity reached 0 3 million megalitres this wetland ecological water supplementation scenario considered the wetland ecosystem and regional agricultural development to avoid the conflict between agricultural and ecological water all the ecological water of the wetland is released from the dongsheng reservoir in september which is the end of the irrigation season in the wuyuer basin moreover the zhalong wetland is located in a cold region of northeast china during the freezing period from december to march of the following year consequently wetland ecological water supplementation in september allows this wetland to retain considerable amounts of water that can contribute to vegetation growth in the following year therefore under this scenario the discharge from the reservoir was set to 115 m3 s and discharge occurred from september 1 to 30 the supplied water quantity reached approximately 0 3 million megalitres furthermore reservoir discharge as a boundary condition was input into the established hydrodynamic model to simulate the water level distribution within the wetland the daily water level at each node reflecting the water regime of each subarea was extracted and input into the corresponding lstm model to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of the ndvi within the zhalong wetland over the next five years under the three different water supplementation scenarios 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic model performance the water regime of the zhalong wetland was simulated with the established hydrodynamic model the variations in the water level at the four monitoring points within the wetland were extracted and observations were adopted to verify the simulation results the model was verified against the observed water level variations at four stations tumuke zhaokai woniugang and erdaoqiao from 2019 7 to 2019 11 fig 3 the nse values during the validation period at the four stations were 0 96 0 96 0 97 and 0 97 respectively and the rmse values at these stations were 0 04 0 04 0 04 and 0 05 m these results indicate that the established hydrodynamic model yielded good agreement between the simulated water level values and observation data within the wetland moreover the model accurately simulated the real water regime demonstrating that the parameter selection process was reasonable 4 2 wetland partitioning hydrodynamic processes dominate the energy and material cycles within this wetland brinson 1993 song et al 2007 ward et al 2020 a region with a relatively high degree of hydrologic connectivity generally provides similar ecosystem services and ecosystems throughout hwang et al 2012 pringle 2001 thus the variation in the water level of each element was simulated with the hydrodynamic model and the characteristic value of the water level variation the correlation coefficient r was calculated and analysed to determine the wetland subareas the characteristic values were divided into 24 categories according to the first cluster analysis results fig 4 a accordingly the wetland was divided into 24 patches fig 5 a the water level variation of each element within these patches was uniform however on the basis of the characteristic value distribution of each patch many patches with similar water level variations should be merged thus a second cluster analysis based on the characteristic values representing the above 24 patches was employed to merge patches with similar hydrodynamic processes to ensure applicability in wetland management the number of subareas should be smaller than 10 the results of the second cluster analysis indicated that all characteristic values could be divided into 7 categories the mean characteristic values of the water level variation in subareas 7 6 3 2 1 4 and 5 were 0 11 0 36 0 67 0 75 0 88 0 96 and 0 98 respectively with corresponding ranges of 0 05 0 14 0 19 0 54 0 59 0 81 0 51 0 95 0 73 0 96 0 88 0 98 and 0 95 1 00 respectively fig 4b there was a large overlap in the characteristic values between subareas 2 and 3 but these subareas were spatially separated the number of elements in subareas 7 6 3 2 1 4 and 5 in the hydrodynamic model were 335 508 118 385 740 2186 and 47 respectively and the areas of these seven subareas reached 31 84 61 12 14 76 34 51 95 58 199 97 and 21 73 km2 fig 5b however the areas of these seven subareas were not constant as the surrounding land areas could become floodplains during extreme flood events therefore the obtained wetland partitions may not remain constant in this study the water level variation in a normal flow year was considered for wetland partitioning the complex topography and terrain barriers resulted in wetland subareas with relatively high degrees of hydrologic connectivity within this wetland in low flow years the number of subareas could increase whereas the number of subareas could decrease in high flow years because flows with higher flow rates and water levels can flow through obstacles feng et al 2013 4 3 lstm model performance subareas 2 and 3 were more independent than the other subareas fig 5b this resulted in comparatively limited effects of reservoir discharge on the water level variation in subareas 2 and 3 therefore the ndvi values within these two subareas were not simulated in this study the nse and rmse values of the lstm model for each of the five remaining subareas are shown in fig 6 the ndvi dataset from 2015 to 2018 was applied as the training set and the dataset from 2019 to 2020 was employed for simulation and verification the nse and rmse values of the model of subarea 1 ranged from 0 80 to 0 99 and 0 01 to 0 08 respectively in subarea 1 the nse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 953 and the rmse values at 75 of all nodes were smaller than 0 04 in subarea 4 the nse and rmse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 931 and smaller than 0 061 respectively in subarea 5 the nse and rmse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 887 and smaller than 0 071 respectively in subarea 6 the nse and rmse values at 75 of all nodes were higher than 0 825 and smaller than 0 076 respectively additionally these two parameters within subarea 7 were higher than 0 853 and smaller than 0 071 respectively these results indicate that the ndvi values at most nodes were accurately simulated within the zhalong wetland however in subareas 4 6 and 7 many nodes exhibited relatively large rmse and high nse values indicating that the ndvi at these nodes was inaccurately simulated in these subareas many puddles had formed in small lakes within this wetland the water depths of these lakes change with the wetland water level and are generally large because of the low terrain furthermore the large water depth prevented reeds from growing in these lakes fig 7 shows that the northwestern sections of subareas 4 and 6 and the eastern section of subarea 7 display low ndvi values year round 4 4 ndvi dynamics under the three reservoir discharge scenarios the lstm model was employed to predict the spatiotemporal distributions of the ndvi within the zhalong wetland over the next five years under the different water supplementation scenarios the maximum ndvi at each node in each year was extracted as shown in fig 7 under all three scenarios the ndvi generally decreased due to changes in the natural hydrological conditions the average yearly water supply amount reached 0 35 million megalitres from 2015 to 2020 because of successive high flow years the average maximum ndvi of all nodes within the wetland under the three scenarios reached 0 819 in the first year and 0 793 in the fifth year table 2 through manual intervention in one year the mean ndvi values within this wetland generally remained stable under the three scenarios the small interannual difference may be due to the climate conditions such as temperature and sunshine duration hou et al 2018 compared to the natural hydrological regime artificial ecological water supplementation under limited water resources imposed limited effects on vegetation growth meng et al 2019 however artificial ecological water supplementation could generally maintain the vegetation ecosystem of this wetland chen et al 2020 as evidenced in fig 7 the ndvi in subarea 4 was significantly lower than that in the other subareas in the lower reach of subarea 4 the largest subarea vegetation degradation was caused by water scarcity nevertheless the supplementation of water hardly influenced the lower reach of subarea 4 in contrast the ndvi values in subareas 5 and 6 were not notably reduced water retention caused by the railway in the southern wetland area and the barrier between subareas 5 and 6 resulted in a constant water depth within these subareas therefore the vegetation dynamics in subareas 5 and 6 remained relatively stable fig 8 shows the average monthly maximum ndvi of all nodes within the wetland under the three reservoir discharge scenarios generally the ndvi increased beginning in april and peaked in july within the wetland li et al 2013 na et al 2018 regardless of the water supply this trend remained unaltered the three water supplementation scenarios slightly affected the ndvi in april and november which are periods in which wetland vegetation desiccates in may and june the ndvi values under scenario 2 were relatively high while the ndvi values under scenario 1 were relatively high in june august and september however in june and july which are peak periods of wetland vegetation the ndvi values under scenarios 1 and 2 were very similar the ndvi values in scenario 1 and scenario 2 were relatively high because the two ecological water supplementation scenarios considered the growth period of p communis which dominates the zhalong wetland moreover the results indicate that an approximately one month delay was needed to reveal the ndvi response to wetland ecological water supplementation according to the five year average ndvi values in this wetland under the three scenarios table 2 scenario 1 with continuous water supplementation and low flow conditions imposed suitable effects on the wetland vegetation ecosystem against the background of limited water resources however this scenario could cause agricultural water shortages which could result in economic losses over the other scenarios cai and rosegrant 2004 liu et al 2005 the lower reach of subarea 4 should be highlighted as other methods of wetland ecological water supplementation aimed at the lower reach of subarea 4 could be required in this wetland in the zhalong wetland red crowned cranes grus japonensis siberian cranes grus leucogeranus key protected species in this wetland generally nidificate and breed from april to june hu et al 2021 a region suitably covered with vegetation is beneficial for the nidification and breeding of water fowl species during this vital period na et al 2015 wang et al 2019 under scenario 2 the ndvi reached its maximum value in may and june and the peak ndvi value in july was relatively high in addition the conflict between agricultural and ecological water was less pronounced in scenario 2 than in scenario 1 therefore scenario 2 is recommended to wetland managers and administrative units 4 5 implications for wetland restoration the zhalong wetland is highly valued for its ecological service functions water scarcity has resulted in vegetation degradation and habitat destruction therefore local government officials are strongly concerned with protecting and restoring the zhalong wetland supplying water to the wetland is the most efficient and direct way to restore the ecosystem by revitalizing the vegetation and enhancing the biodiversity therein yu et al 2021 many wetlands have been restored and protected by ecological water supplementation such as the ecosystems of the everglades and yellow river delta lockwood et al 2003 yu et al 2021 this study suggested a new partitioning scheme for wetlands based on hydrologic connectivity this method can support site selection efforts for hydrologic monitoring or for ecological monitoring in wetlands with complex topography furthermore this study evaluated vegetation dynamics under different ecological water supplementation scenarios in the zhalong wetland the proposed workflow can be used to evaluate the ecological benefits of different ecological water supplementation schemes in many wetlands that have degraded due to water scarcity however long term hydrological data and ecological data are crucial for the lstm model moreover in this study the ndvi values of scenario 1 and scenario 2 were relatively high because these two ecological water supplementation scenarios considered the growth period of p communis which dominates the zhalong wetland fig 8 while appropriate ecological water supplementation contributed to the growth of p communis under both scenarios the vegetation type varies in different wetlands across the globe therefore the design of ecological water supplementation scenarios should be adjusted according to the vegetation types and water use in different geographic regions it is worth noting that vegetation dynamics are not the only determining factor when assessing the success of ecological restoration the ndvi response provided by inundation may not be sufficient for the nidification and breeding of waterfowl species the duration and depth of inundation in the habitats of wildlife species are also important considerations wetlands with shallower water depths and longer water inundation times generally provide more abundant benthic macroinvertebrates and small fishes which are major food sources for wildlife species jeffres et al 2020 meanwhile field observations of 38 nests of red crowned cranes in the zhalong wetland indicated that the water depths around their nesting sites generally ranged from 10 to 30 cm hu et al 2021 persistent high water levels have adverse effects on bird nesting and foraging habitats due to the body length limits of the shorebird and their fledglings jiang et al 2016 strategically reducing the water levels and managing for appropriate land water ratios may increase the overall area of suitable habitat in many wetlands liu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 thus the complex coupling mechanisms among hydrology vegetation and habitats in wetland ecosystems should be clarified in future studies 5 conclusion excessive water extraction over the past decade has seriously deteriorated the ecological water requirements within the wuyuer river basin and damaged the ecosystems of downstream wetlands wetland ecological water supplementation is the most common method for protecting wetland ecosystems in this study the zhalong wetland was divided into 7 subareas with relatively high hydrologic connectivity based on a hydrodynamic model and cluster analysis the lstm neural network models were constructed for 5 subareas notably affected by water supplementation to simulate and verify the spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi based on water level temperature and sunshine duration data to evaluate vegetation dynamics under different wetland ecological water supplementation conditions the water levels of these 5 subareas under different scenarios were defined using historical meteorological data to drive the lstm model this study revealed the following 1 the spatiotemporal variation in the ndvi at most nodes was accurately simulated within this wetland but large errors generally occurred in regions with small lakes 2 scenario 1 characterized by continuous and low flow water supplementation imposed highly positive influences on the annual maximum ndvi in this wetland against the background of limited water resources however agricultural economic losses could occur under this scenario 3 the lower reach of subarea 4 the largest subarea was less positively affected by ecological water supplementation and should be emphasized as additional channels of water supplementation aimed at this region could be needed 4 scenario 2 in which water supplementation occurred in april and september is recommended because of the positive effects on the nidification and breeding of water fowl species and the limited conflict between agricultural and ecological water these results can provide important references for both wetland and water resource managers in the region credit authorship contribution statement weize wang

3471,land subsidence is an increasing human induced disaster that not only damages building and transportation structures but also diminishes the water storage capacity of the aquifers land subsidence is a very complex phenomenon impacted by various geo environmental and hydrological factors application of the interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar is becoming a common approach to detect land subsidence rates though it suffers from the lack of continuity over the spatial surfaces due to the vegetation decorrelation coverage alterations cultivation and non cultivation seasons in the agricultural areas and rough topography the lack of continuity can however be resolved using artificial intelligence in our case study while insar deformation data only covered 2 of the plain s surface we employed boosted regression trees brt and extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithms to provide a full coverage map of the groundwater induced land subsidence based on the insar analysis for this a set of topographical hydrological hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors was selected the insar and input factors resolution data were resampled to a 100 by 100 m to match the implemented models predicted the long term deformation rate with the acceptable performances of the brt rmse 3 3 mm year mae 2 0 mm year r2 0 985 and the xgb with linear booster rmse 3 5 mm year mae 2 1 mm year r2 0 983 considering the substantial ground deformation in the studied area from 216 to 49 mm year rmse values of 3 3 and 3 5 mm year between the insar measurement and model predictions show great potential for combined insar machine learning technique for pumping driven land subsidence studies thus the introduced approach is suggested for other areas being damaged by excessive pumping and agricultural development to produce an accurate full coverage map of subsidence keywords insar machine learning ground deformation land subsidence groundwater hydrogeology 1 introduction groundwater gw depletion is an increasing concern in the arid and semi arid regions of the world which is caused by higher water consumption due to the ever increasing population growth climate change as well has been affecting surface waters by increasing the frequency of floods and droughts making them less reliable water resources this has also put extra pressure on gw resources which are to some extent non renewable further more frequent flood and drought occurrences due to alterations in rainfall patterns diminish the capability of storing water both on and under the ground smith and majumdar 2020 all these issues have led to over exploitation of gw supplies which results in water table drop and consequent land subsidence in confined and semi confined aquifers and ultimately loss of gw storage smith et al 2017 other consequences of such phenomenon are damages to infrastructures and gw quality degradation land subsidence mainly occurs due to the over exploitation of gw resources caused by the lack of balance between pumping and natural artificial recharge the extraction of a huge amount of gw from the fine grained sediment leads to the decrease of the pore pressure compaction of the layer and finally the land subsidence other reasons causing land subsidence include but are not limited to anthropogenic activities such as mining tunnelling extraction of gas and underground water transfer systems in general land subsidence causes a fundamental adverse impact on the economy of the society julio miranda et al 2012 through deteriorating farmlands buildings transportation systems and power lines two common traditional approaches of monitoring ground deformation are through global positioning system gps stations and leveling data however they are expensive and produce limited spatial and temporal data one alternative to the traditional methods is interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar having mm to cm scale accuracy and spatial resolution of 5 20 m for sentinel 1 and 2 3 3 m for terrasar x images bai et al 2016 two common approaches for deriving land deformation rates are the persistent scatterer ps insar ferretti et al 2000 and small baseline subsets sbas insar berardino et al 2002 in the ps insar approach the pixels which have persistent phase stability over time are detected by considering a stack of single master interferograms these interferograms are generated by considering an image located in the middle spatially and temporally named master image this results in reliably measured deformation rates at only the ps points which are abundant in the urban areas with a high concentration of man made features crosetto et al 2016 karamvasis and karathanassi 2020 ps points however are highly sparse in the farming and high vegetated areas which we typically expect higher rates of subsidence due to pumping where the pixels usually have non dominant scatterers due to the fast rate of growth in vegetation and crops sbas insar on the other hand applies spectral filtering to reduce the phase variation due to decorrelation and identifies pixels with no dominant scatterers but constant phase response over time called slowly decorrelating filtered pixels sdfp this technique generates a gapless network of multi master interferograms between the images with short temporal and spatial separation the scatterers response in the sbas insar could be from the distributed small scattering objects instead of strong scatterers which is the case in the ps approach leading to the inclusion of more sdfp pixels in the line of sight los direction resulting in a higher spatial coverage tiwari et al 2016 smith et al 2021 filtering of highly decorrelated and noisy pixels however leads to gaps in the map which is also undesirable for many applications particularly agricultural water management the standard free source processors used to calculate ground deformation captured in radar images based on sbas algorithm are generic mapping tools synthetic aperture radar gmtsar and stanford method for persistent scatterers stamps in this study we used stamps hooper 2008 to determine the ground motion at the sdfp points producing a partial coverage deformation map of the studied plain due to the intense agricultural activities and vegetation coverage previous studies have mainly focused on investigating land subsidence susceptibility looking at the problem as a binary classification problem e g najafi et al 2020 mohammady et al 2021 thus the spatial coverage and pattern of the ground deformation changes have not been addressed properly in recent years some scholars have implemented insar to investigate land subsidence and landslide hakim et al 2020a b zhou et al 2020 aslan et al 2020 fadhillah et al 2020 fiorentini et al 2020 from those hakim et al 2020a used machine learning algorithms to produce landslide susceptibility maps based on the presence and absence points fiorentini et al 2020 applied boosted regression trees brt random forest and support vector machine algorithms to interpolate ground deformation rates as a regression problem for road monitoring and construction purposes while useful these common methods of interpolation of insar data points do not provide a reliable deformation map due to the aquifer complexities leading to nonlinear ground deformation considering discontinuity in the deformation map produced by insar techniques this study applies advanced machine learning algorithms mla including boosted regression trees brt and extreme gradient boosting xgb with different boosters using insar derived deformation data to obtain an accurate full coverage spatial map of deformation rate over an agricultural region the brt algorithm was selected as it employs regression trees and bosting techniques to increase the prediction efficiency compared to single tree algorithms through creating and integrating a large number of trees on the dataset elith et al 2008 the xgb algorithm is developed for diminishing the overfitting issue relative to its initial version i e gradient boosting chen et al 2017 the xgb has been used to generate high accuracy outputs in various disciplines such as gw potential banking system studies e g climent et al 2019 carmona et al 2019 naghibi et al 2020 the other advantage of the xgb algorithm is that it works in parallel leading to a lower required time considering the fact that this study deals with a huge number of datasets of driving factors and persistent scatterer points according to above the primary objectives of this research are i generating a full coverage ground deformation map at the plain scale using insar mlas and geo environmental factors and ii detecting the contribution of various factors to land subsidence occurrence to conduct this study we selected the mashhad plain in northeastern iran known to exhibit substantial land subsidence over the past years khorrami et al 2020 the underlying aquifer system is complex considering geology and is heavily impacted by anthropogenic factors such as land use change and water consumption considering the complex relationship between the detected ground deformation and aforementioned factors as well availability of data we selected this area to develop an artificial intelligence based approach to model aquifer deformation and identify the critical factors inducing subsidence thus the core novelty of this research lies in the spatial modeling of ground deformation rates using the combined insar mlas technique at the plain scale and focusing on the relevance of the hydrogeological and topographical factors on the human induced land subsidence the final result is the full coverage map of ground deformation measurement that can be used to investigate the impact of human induced land subsidence especially in agricultural areas forests and other lands with higher vegetation densities the map can also be used for gw management land surface management and land use planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current study was conducted in the mashhad plain situated in north eastern iran between 35 59 56 and 37 03 12 n latitudes and 58 31 44 and 59 58 25 e longitudes fig 1 the mashhad plain covers an area of about 4 375 km2 the area receives mean annual precipitation of 253 mm which mostly precipitates during february march period khalili et al 2016 mashhad plain has a mean temperature of about 13 5c with the minimum and maximum values of 21 and 44c in january and july respectively the area is categorized as arid to semi arid climatic condition having hot dry summers and wet cold winters khalili et al 2016 the statistics acknowledge that the per capita water usage of the residents of this area is above 120 l day which is greater than the average world s water consumption mashhad city which is located in the lower part of the plain is a tourist attractive city with a high construction rate and a huge growth of agricultural activities that ultimately leads to the overuse of gw supplies the annual water demand of the mashhad city is approximately 220 million m3 and its daily water consumption alters from 270 000 to 830 000 m3 felfelani and kerachian 2016 one reason for these significant changes in water consumption is the high number of tourists around 20 million visiting the city especially during the summer months felfelani and kerachian 2016 khorrami et al 2020 the mashhad plain has experienced a 12 m water table drop during the last twenty years akbari et al 2009 2 2 insar processing 2 2 1 data in this study we used a set of interferometric wide iw swath level 1 sentinel 1 a images in ascending track covering five years from 2014 to 2019 to derive the deformation rate in the study region as the vertical displacement due to over pumping is the dominant deformation in the study area we assumed negligible horizontal displacement in this study and only used ascending track the mashhad plain appeared to be shared between the middle and eastern sub swaths covered by images acquired from the relative orbit number of 86 the acquisition time interval of the images is 24 days spanning from october 23rd 2014 till march 17th 2019 having a three month gap between july 26th 2015 and october 30th 2015 in which there were no acquired images 2 2 2 insar analysis due to high vegetation coverage on one hand and the existence of urban and topographical features on the other hand a wide range of scattering characteristics exists in the study area in the agricultural areas the pixels generally have no dominant scatterers as opposed to the urban areas the importance of the agricultural areas as the main sources of gw exploitation in our study area mandated us to use the sbas method for deformation mapping using the pixels with distributed scattering properties sdfp by assuming a gapless network of interferograms formed by images with short time intervals and almost the same viewing angles considering the small spatial baselines decorrelation between sdfp would be minimized such networks consist of multiple interferograms with different master images i e multiple master interferograms in which the interferograms are fully interconnected in the first step we co registered the single look complex slc images with a selected reference image called super master image for this we used the pre processing module in the gmtsar software package which is an open source software developed by scripps institution of oceanography and san diego state university this module implements a geometric based approach for co registration of images employing a down sampled digital elevation model dem considering the super master image xu et al 2017 concerning dem a void filled version of shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem with a resolution of 3 arc second was used it is noteworthy that the super master image is often picked from the central point of the acquired images spatially and temporally however due to the existence of a three month gap in the sar time series from july 2nd 2015 till october 30th 2015 and longer time interval of the first set of images before the gap we shifted the time location of the master image towards the end of the acquisition time interval while the central spatial location condition was kept unchanged accordingly the image acquired on june 4th 2018 was chosen as the super master image a set of 507 multiple master interferograms considering temporal and spatial baseline of 80 days and 150 m respectively were used in the sbas calculation by considering 80 days temporal baseline and due to the gap between the used images we added six extra interferograms to build a gapless network and a more reliable connection between images which is needed for the sbas processing to mask out the pixels with low temporal coherence we set the threshold value equal to 0 42 deemed to be an acceptable value for the study area accordingly 513 interferograms were generated from 108 sar images which were then used to build the sbas network perpendicular and temporal baseline distribution of the sbas analysis is represented in fig 2 fig 2 shows the network of interferograms which have been used for sbas analysis the axes show temporal versus perpendicular intervals or baselines for selected scenes the distance among the 2 acquisition spots perpendicular to the satellite viewing direction is represented by the term perpendicular baseline each line can be considered as the interferogram formed between every two scenes it is important to have a gapless network of interferograms with a sufficiently short baseline for a successful sbas analysis the defined thresholds are meant for this purpose consequently we processed the slc images to identify the pixels with low decorrelation rates over consecutive time intervals sdfp from the network of interferograms the sdfps were identified based on their phase characteristics and were extracted using the stamps open source package hooper 2008 we separated a set of pixels named candidate pixels with a high probability of being in sdfp pixel s group using the amplitude difference dispersion index dδa defined as 1 d δ a σ δ a μ a where ϭδa is the standard deviation of the difference in amplitudes between master and slave images and μa is the mean amplitude hooper 2008 the threshold of dδa for identifying the candidate pixels was set to 0 42 considering a good balance between the sufficient number of initial pixels and the volume of files to be processed then the phase stability for each candidate pixel was estimated using a phase analysis equation defined as 2 φ x i w d x i a x i s x i θ x i n x i where the w is the wrapping operator d x i is the phase change due to the pixel s movement along the los direction a x i is the phase mismatch due to atmospheric delay of the two different passes of microwave signal s x i is the residual phase due to the orbit inaccuracies θ x i is the residual phase of look angle error and n x i is the noise component in phase consequently the pixels with small n x i values were selected as the final sdfp pixels hooper et al 2007 the next step was to unwrap the phase values which means adding up the right number of 2π cycles to the wrapped phase values due to two dimensional spatial phase data in the time domain the 3d phase unwrapping algorithm was used hooper and zebker 2007 this algorithm has a good ability to detect a higher magnitude of deformation with acceptable accuracy the least squares ls method was used to invert the unwrapped phases of the final sdfp pixels to derive a time series change of the phase for each pixel schmidt and bürgmann 2003 finally the phase of each pixel was retrieved for the location of the selected reference point used as a spatial reference and the master image used as the time reference master image the reference point for each sub scene is unique and it is chosen to have the minimum overall movements in corresponding time since there was not any stable positioning data to choose as the reference point in the area we set the reference point to 00 when processing sar data in the next step one insar pixel with minimum long term velocities and standard deviation of displacement in time was selected as the reference point for each scene to calculate the relative deformation rate the final map produced by this method shows the displacements in the los direction assuming negligible horizontal displacement the long term vertical displacement can be derived as d v d los cos θ i where θ i is the look angle computed by the sbas algorithm in the stamps environment for each sdfp pixel 2 3 ground deformation driving factors the literature implies that topographical factors such as altitude slope angle topographic wetness index twi distance from rivers river density plan curvature profile curvature geological factors such as geology distance to lineament lineament density soil type aquifer related factors such as gw drawdown land use and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have been used for modeling land subsidence occurrence e g pradhan et al 2014 bui et al 2018 arabameri et al 2020 at a larger spatial scale smith and majumdar 2020 considered some other factors including evapotranspiration total water storage produced by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission sediment thickness precipitation water stress aquifer type and urban land use in this research based on the literature and the spatial resolution of the available data four different categories of factors were prepared to be used along with the insar measurement in mlas described below it needs to be stated that due to the computational costs of the modeling process and also the fact that for water resources management a spatial resolution of 100 100 m is acceptable both insar data and driving factors were resampled to this spatial resolution to match each other 2 3 1 topographical factors in general topography impacts different aspects of the hydrological cycle including rainfall pattern and intensity direct sunshine duration runoff generation soil moisture soil infiltration drainage network and gw potential zapata rios et al 2016 yeh et al 2016 kamali maskooni et al 2020 hence they can potentially influence ground deformation this research considered altitude slope angle the vertical distance from rivers relative slope position profile curvature plan curvature curvature convergence and slope length the factors were created using an aster dem of the mashhad plain and then were resampled to 100 100 m to match the insar data 2 3 2 hydrological and climatic factors curve number cn twi soil permeability distance from rivers and river density layers were selected cn layer is calculated based on the combination of land use land covers lu lc and hydrologic soil groups united states department of agriculture usda 1986 soil permeability is generated through the soil conservation service method and hydrologic soil groups chow et al 1998 cn and soil permeability determine direct runoff and infiltration impacting gw recharge and subsequently ground deformation rates both of these factors were obtained from krrwc 2019 twi specifies the degree of water accumulation at different locations in a watershed which is also considered in this study and is calculated as follows beven and kirkby 1979 3 twi a t a n β where β depicts slope angle and a refers to the contributing area which flows to that certain pixel streams can influence ground deformation in different ways due to their recharge and drainage roles in this respect distance from rivers and river density layers were implemented in the algorithms 2 3 3 hydrogeological factors several aquifer parameters including aquifer thickness transmissivity existence and location of aquitards and clay percentage in the vertical profile that influence the ground deformation caused by water table fluctuation need to be considered however detailed aquifer parameters are hardly available particularly in developing countries based on data availability we only considered aquifer thickness and transmissivity transmissivity outlines the ability of an aquifer to transfer gw through its saturated section and affects soil compressibility mohebbi tafreshi et al 2019 transmissivity data were obtained from the results of the pumping test conducted by the krrwc 2019 the aquifer thickness data were also obtained from the krrwc 2019 transmissivity and aquifer thickness were interpolated for the studied aquifer mashhad aquifer is a quaternary unconfined aquifer zendehbad et al 2019 with a thickness reaching up to around 270 m depth in the central parts jaafari 2015 based on krrwc 2019 wells are categorized into shallow and deep with depths ranging from 3 to around 270 m mostly used for agricultural and orchard activities groundwater flow direction in the aquifer is from the northwest to the southeast central parts of the aquifer have finer sediments and are deeper than other parts the soil texture becomes finer from north to south transmissivity in different parts of the mashhad plain changes from 50 to 3 168 m2 day further to the abovementioned hydrogeological factors lithology and fault related variables were also considered fault activities are also involved in ground deformation brunori et al 2015 for instance faults can act as a conduit draining out recharging gw leading to water table drop rise causing subsidence uplift to consider the impact of faults we regarded distance from faults and fault density layers also over pumping of gw resources in the clay rich aquifers causes soil compaction and land subsidence observed on the ground to consider the impact of geology we considered lithological characteristics in this research presented in fig 3 2 3 4 anthropogenic factors in addition to the overexploitation of gw supplies road infrastructures mining activities and surface loadings are some important anthropogenic factors that cause land subsidence wang et al 2009 xu et al 2015 in this work we considered roads pumping wells qanat layers ndvi and land use land cover lu lc data a qanat includes a lightly sloping underground canal that is constructed to gather and transfer gw from the upstream aquifer to downstream places where it is used this system has been used for millennia in iran mainly because of the lower construction and water transfer costs as it is solely based on gravity some qanats in the mashhad plain are still in use while others are out of use and might cause ground subsidence although qanats are constructed at areas with higher gw potential it might have a stabilizing effect in this manner the distance from qanats and qanat density layers were created for the analysis another common means of gw extraction in the mashhad plain is through pumping wells comprising deep and semi deep wells thus we considered three well related factors such as distance from wells well density created based on pumping wells and water table changes created based on the piezometric heads measured in the monitoring wells water table changes were calculated for a longer period from 2010 to 2019 to consider the delay between the gw table fluctuation and the observed ground deformation by the insar technique further the lu lc map was generated using landsat 8 operational land imager images of 19th and 28th july 2019 different classification algorithms were tested and the final map was obtained by the neural network algorithm with the accuracy and kappa values of 95 and 93 respectively the lu lc map of the mashhad plain includes five major classes including agriculture orchard rangeland urban and water bodies the same landsat images were also used to calculate ndvi which resulted in values changing between 0 57 and 0 88 2 4 modeling procedure at the first step to assure that there is no multicollinearity between the input factors we calculated the variance inflation factor vif and tolerance multicollinearity stems from the high correlation among the input driving factors leading them to be non independent dormann et al 2013 to resolve this we removed the variables with a vif of greater than 10 or a tolerance of less than 0 1 keith 2006 factors without multicollinearity issues were then used in the mlas to predict ground deformation and produce a full coverage spatial map the sdfps measured by insar were resampled by calculating the average values of sdfps to a 100 100 m pixel size i e 61 487 cases to match the input driving factors pixel sizes of those long term ground deformation rates measured by insar 70 and 30 were randomly selected for training and validation of the mlas respectively naghibi et al 2021 lastly to produce a full coverage ground deformation map for the study area a dataset of all factors for the mashhad plain was fed into the algorithms and the final maps were obtained the used mlas are explained below 2 4 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 introduced the xgb as a novel mla that is currently one of the exceptionally efficient algorithms in spatial mapping bandara et al 2020 xgb utilizes gradient boosting to integrate multiple weak learners to compute the outcome i e ground deformation but in a parallel mode which makes it unique from the common gradient boosting another difference is that the xgb overcomes overfitting by implementing a highly regularized algorithm leading to higher performance bandara et al 2020 the parallelization is another advantage of xgb which decreases the required computation time fan et al 2018 in this study we used three different boosters of xgb including the linear tree and dropouts meet multiple additive regression trees dart based on artificial neural networks all the processes were applied in the r statistical software 2 4 2 boosted regression trees brt algorithm the brt combines mla and statistical approaches and attempts to integrate the outcomes of several trees to achieve accurate results schapire 2003 the brt algorithm employs regression to detect nonlinear relationships amongst the insar derived ground deformation and its driving factors as well it implements boosting to enhance algorithm sensitivity ridgeway 2007 further multiple preliminary steps such as data transformation and outlier deletion are not required when using the brt algorithm another advantage is that the brt adapts with different variables including categorical and continuous variables in this research the brt was implemented using the r statistical software through gbm and caret scripts ridgeway 2006 2 4 3 frequency ratio analysis fr algorithm to produce interpretable outputs considering the relationships between the long term ground deformation rates and the primary driving factors causing deformation we used the fr analysis fr denotes the probability of occurrence of a phenomenon to its non occurrence regarding each driving factor bonham carter 1994 considering uncertainty in insar processing and due to the calculated rmse between the mashhad gps station and its surrounding insar pixels i e 2 8 mm year and to have conservative threshold we assumed values less than 1 5 and values greater than 1 5 mm year represent subsidence and uplift respectively to apply this analysis the most important driving factors by the brt were selected and classified we used two different approaches for classifying factors such as equal and natural break classification schemes the former was used for altitude distance from faults aquifer thickness transmissivity distance from wells and water table changes the latter scheme was used for density layers of qanat river road and well as we typically expect sudden jumps in these datasets ayalew and yamagishi 2005 then the number of long term deformations at sdfps of less than 1 5 mm year and area of each class of the factors were defined and employed to compute fr as below 4 fr d d a a where d depicts the number of pixels with ls d depicts the total number of pixels with ls a is the area of the class and a is the total area of the study region 2 5 evaluation of the results we validated the performance of the used insar technique in measuring the ground deformation using the permanent gps stations data available in the study area using root mean square error rmse concerning the evaluation of the performance of the mlas in training and validation phases known as success and predictive rates respectively we calculated mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 additionally taylor diagram taylor 2001 was plotted to better represent the differences of the algorithms performances in predicting long term ground deformation rates relative to the insar grids using standard deviation r2 and rmse the stated indices are calculated as below 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 6 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 7 r 2 1 ss res ss tot 8 ss res i o i p i 2 9 ss tot i o i o

from 1 to n ss tot the total sum of squares ss res is residual sum of squares 3 results and discussion 3 1 insar analysis the main objective of this study is to produce a full coverage long term deformation map based on the sparse insar measurement using mlas as well as identifying the driving factors inducing subsidence in the study case for this we first validated the insar data using the existing permanent gps stations in the area to ensure the accuracy of insar the used insar technique resulted in 871 242 ground deformation data points throughout the entire mashhad plain with deformation rates ranging from 216 to 49 mm year fig 4 the insar computation resulted in 871 242 ps with the potential spatial resolution based on sar data which is around 5 by 20 m in the satellite coordinate system however the concentration of the detected ps points depends on the scattering properties of the area ps points in the entire mashhad plain were resampled to 100 100 m spatial resolution leading to 61 487 grids to investigate the uplift locations a statistical analysis of the points was carried out and it was seen that the deformation data had an average of 6 4 min of 216 max of 49 and std of 27 8 regarding the uplift values it was seen that only 0 1 of data belonged to uplifts greater than 20 mm year and only 9 of the data belonged to uplifts greater than 10 mm year leading to 90 of the data to be less than 10 mm year to define the coverage of the insar deformation data we considered the sentinel 1 pixel size 5 20 m assuming that each ps point represents an area corresponding to 100 m2 this resulted in only 2 coverage of the mashhad plain however for visualization we used a higher pixel size to show the deformation velocity changes over the area fig 4 while we only focused on the long term map of deformation in this study we also produced the deformation time series using the insar technique to be able to check the accuracy of the insar data compared to the permanent gps positioning time series for this the rmse values were calculated considering the fitted line s slope as the displacement rates over each gps station s time series and the average of ten nearest insar pixels for the overlapping period according to the results at the mshn station an rmse value of 12 8 mm for 4 5 years was calculated which leads to an rmse of 2 8 mm year assuming the gps deformation time series are the true measurements and the consistency of the achieved insar with that of the gps measurements we can conclude the acceptable accuracy of the insar derived deformation measurement in this study fig 5 shows the comparison between the insar results and mashhad gps station data 3 2 optimization results of the algorithms for the training phase before running the algorithms we assessed the multicollinearity among the driving factors using the vif and tolerance techniques consequently five topographical factors encompassing curvature plan and profile curvatures slope length and slope were found to have collinearity issues and were removed from the analysis therefore we only applied the algorithms using the rest of the driving factors described in the materials and methods section from the gridded insar deformation data 70 42 840 and 30 18 365 were randomly divided into training and validation datasets to be inputted to the mlas respectively the brt was optimized on the training dataset by 1 000 trees interaction depth of 11 shrinkage of 0 1 and minimum terminal node size of 20 leading to rmse r2 and mae values of 3 4 mm year 0 983 and 2 1 mm year respectively fig 6 a as seen the rmse diminishes with the increase of boosting iterations or the number of trees and the best results are obtained by the maximum tree depth of 11 the xgb linear was optimized with a learning rate eta of 0 3 150 trees lambda of 0 1 and alpha of 0 1 leading to rmse r2 and mae values of 3 7 mm year 0 981 and 2 1 mm year respectively fig 6b the xgb dart was optimized with a gamma of 0 minimum child weight of 1 150 trees colsample bytree of 0 8 rate drop of 0 01 skip drop of 0 95 and minimum child weight of 1 resulting in rmse r2 and mae values of 5 83 mm year 0 955 and 3 47 mm year respectively fig 6c the xgb tree was optimized with a gamma of 0 minimum child weight of 1 150 trees a colsample bytree of 0 8 and a subsample of 1 maximum tree depth of 3 and learning rate of 0 4 resulting in rmse r2 and mae values of 5 8 mm year 0 954 and 3 4 mm year respectively fig 6d 3 3 validation of the algorithms in principle the evaluation results of the training phase success rate of the applied algorithms presented in table 1 depicted that the xgb linear and brt algorithms yielded the best efficiency in predicting training cases with rmse values of 2 1 and 2 5 mm year respectively according to the predictive rates the brt and xgb linear had the best predictions of ground deformation rates with rmse values of 3 3 and 3 5 mm year over the study period respectively table 1 further the results of both predictive and success rates implied that the two other algorithms the xgb dart and xgb tree predicted the long term ground deformation rate with acceptable but lower efficiency other indices such as r2 and mae followed the same pattern as the reported rmse results above fig 7 illustrates the scatter plot of the ground deformation data obtained by insar vs mlas in the validation phase based on the figure it can be seen that the brt and xgb linear predictions are well correlated with the insar data and the trendlines of these two models are very close to the 45 degree reference line red line also it can be seen that the scatter plots of the brt and xgb linear against insar data are more condensed compared to the xgb dart and xgb tree fig 8 depicts the taylor diagram plotted based on the validation dataset providing a visual comparison of the algorithm s performance against insar results using r2 rmse and standard deviation indices based on the figure the brt and xgb linear provided more accurate long term deformation data over the study period relative to other algorithms the results show that the implemented algorithms worked well in modeling ground deformation rates with rmse values less than 5 7 mm year for the mashhad plain with extensive long term deformation rates ranging from 216 to 49 mm year the outputs of the brt and xgb linear however were more promising compared to the other algorithms the promising results of the brt algorithm can be associated with its ability to address interactions elect highly important variables and eliminate the cases with the missing values carty 2011 another positive feature of the brt is the ability to detect nonlinear complex connections between the target and input factors naghibi et al 2020 showed higher performance of the xgb linear compared to the two other boosters in assessing gw potential in an arid area that is in line with the findings of this study similarly babajide mustapha and saeed 2016 assessed the capability of the xgb in investigating bioactive molecules they concluded that the algorithm is highly competent in biological analysis and copes well with homogenous and heterogenous variables another strong feature of the xgb is its capability to prevent overfitting to the training dataset and makes the model more generalized fan et al 2018 the xgb does not account for variables pre processing and missing values and relies on the normal distribution of the data which makes it less time consuming than other more complicated mlas naghibi et al 2020 the faster process of xgb and more precisely xgb linear stands out when there is a huge amount of data which was the case of the current study 3 4 ground deformation maps fig 9 a d shows the long term ground deformation maps generated by the implemented algorithms in the mashhad plain to compare the changes in the maps they were grouped into 7 classes based on the deformation rates of 0 0 24 9 25 49 9 50 74 9 75 99 9 100 124 9 and 125 mm year which are referred to as stable very low low moderate high very high and extensive land subsidence rates respectively further table 2 presents the area percentage of each class it is seen that for the brt as the best algorithm 82 3 of the mashhad plain was defined as stable and very low subsidence classes while 17 7 of the region showed a higher subsidence rate of more than 25 mm year referring to the extreme land subsidence the xgb linear as the second algorithm in terms of accuracy generated a similar map assigning 83 of the mashhad plain to stable and very low subsidence and 17 of the area to a high subsidence class of more than 25 mm year all algorithms showed that the central part of the plain encompassing mashhad city and its adjacent farming areas are severely impacted by subsidence during the 2014 2019 period fig 9a d this area is under intense agricultural activities and the aquifer is severely tapped by a very dense network of pumping wells and an extreme irrigation scheme the other region recognized with a significant subsidence signature is located at the northern part of the plain which is also under agricultural activity and extensive pumping 3 5 importance of the driving factors and their relationship with land subsidence occurrence fig 10 shows the importance score of each driving factor in modeling long term ground deformation rate by the brt algorithm the brt scores were reported as this model acquired the best performance in this study according to the findings well density distance from faults altitude water table changes transmissivity and road density were the most important driving factors contributing to the observed subsidence followed by the aquifer thickness qanat density distance from wells river density and qanat density to generate interpretable outputs for the high contributing factors the fr analysis was performed table 3 the well density showed a direct relationship with land subsidence occurrence that relates to the higher pumping pressure on the aquifer at the higher well density regions motagh et al 2008 also stated that gw exploitation is an essential variable that has affected the incidence of land subsidence in iranian plains during the past years minderhoud et al 2017 and abdollahi et al 2019 declared that areas with higher densities of the pumping wells experience greater rates of water table decline leading to land subsidence faults are important geological features having various impacts on aquifers through either draining or recharging the aquifers leading to subsidence and stability respectively the findings of the fr analysis implied a direct relationship between land subsidence and distance from faults a visual investigation of the distance from the fault layer and subsidence zones predicted by the brt algorithm revealed that the closer areas to the faults the more stable the ground surface which might relate to the recharging characteristics of the existing faults in the study area based on our findings the second class of altitude lower altitudes yielded the greatest fr value however we observed no evident linear pattern between the altitudes and subsidence occurrence meaning that there is not a decreasing or increasing linear relationship between these factors it seems that the observed subsidence could be associated with the farming activities that are mainly concentrated at the lower altitudes the results also showed that the portions of the aquifer with the water table rise are associated with fewer land subsidence occurrences more stable while areas with water table drop over exploitation of gw are associated with notable land subsidence zones a direct relationship was observed between transmissivity and land subsidence which shows the higher gw capacity of the aquifer allowing more pumping through the irrigation wells road density proved to have a direct relationship with land subsidence incidence as the two top road density classes owned the highest fr values this can be associated with the link between the road density and the level of development which defines the extent of gw exploitation for farming activities concerning aquifer thickness the areas with higher values than 56 4 m were found to be more prone to land subsidence while the shallower parts of the aquifer showed less subsidence rate it seems that the deeper part of the aquifer contains more fine grained materials such as clay and silt that are prone to compaction under gw extraction we found an inverse relationship between the qanat density and land subsidence this might be related to the fact that qanats are constructed in regions with higher gw potential and natural recharge with a low aquifer thickness qanat diverts gw from high land areas naturally thus areas with higher qanat densities are more likely to be stable as there is less pressure on the aquifer in the dense qanat regions the findings approve the prominent recharge role of the rivers in the area as there is a distinct inverse relationship between the river density and the observed land subsidence in principle it was understood that there are no simple and linear connections between ground deformation and its driving factors the connections seem to be non linear with a highly complex nature the implemented algorithms i e the brt and xgb can extract those complex connections from the implemented datasets and produce an acceptable prediction of the long term ground deformation over the study area 4 conclusion despite an accurate high spatiotemporal map of ground displacement in both urban and rural areas produced by the insar technique the spatial discontinuity due to the vegetation decorrelation in the farming area poses difficulty to obtain an insight concerning gw induced subsidence this study modeled the long term ground deformation rates by combing the mlas and insar discrete measurements on a set of geo environmental factors to produce full coverage deformation maps over the studied area the results showed acceptable performance of the brt and xgb linear algorithms in modeling long term deformation rates the other important aim was to assess the contribution of the factors to land subsidence occurrence as well as investigate their relationships the most contributing factors to subsidence occurrences were identified as the well density distance from faults altitude gw table changes transmissivity road density aquifer thickness and qanat density in the mashhad plain it was concluded that land subsidence has direct relationships with well density transmissivity road density aquifer thickness and inverse relationships with distance from faults qanat density and river density these relationships were not found to be simple and linear and tend to be highly complicated in addition to the mentioned driving factors other factors such as clay thickness which substantially influences land subsidence can be considered in future studies to further improve the performance of the algorithms looking upon the acceptable performance of the brt and xgb linear algorithms they are recommended for future studies of insar ground deformation analysis the highly contributing factors to land deformation identified in this study are suggested to be included in relevant future studies generation of accurate high resolution ground deformation maps by insar and mlas can be of utmost importance to water sector managers to gain useful insights to spot the crucial areas and appropriately assign financial resources to control land subsidence optimizing water allocation changing cultivation patterns and establishing artificial recharge systems for the areas under high pumping combined with the results of this study can help to reverse the dramatic impacts of land subsidence in the mashhad plain credit authorship contribution statement seyed

3471,land subsidence is an increasing human induced disaster that not only damages building and transportation structures but also diminishes the water storage capacity of the aquifers land subsidence is a very complex phenomenon impacted by various geo environmental and hydrological factors application of the interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar is becoming a common approach to detect land subsidence rates though it suffers from the lack of continuity over the spatial surfaces due to the vegetation decorrelation coverage alterations cultivation and non cultivation seasons in the agricultural areas and rough topography the lack of continuity can however be resolved using artificial intelligence in our case study while insar deformation data only covered 2 of the plain s surface we employed boosted regression trees brt and extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithms to provide a full coverage map of the groundwater induced land subsidence based on the insar analysis for this a set of topographical hydrological hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors was selected the insar and input factors resolution data were resampled to a 100 by 100 m to match the implemented models predicted the long term deformation rate with the acceptable performances of the brt rmse 3 3 mm year mae 2 0 mm year r2 0 985 and the xgb with linear booster rmse 3 5 mm year mae 2 1 mm year r2 0 983 considering the substantial ground deformation in the studied area from 216 to 49 mm year rmse values of 3 3 and 3 5 mm year between the insar measurement and model predictions show great potential for combined insar machine learning technique for pumping driven land subsidence studies thus the introduced approach is suggested for other areas being damaged by excessive pumping and agricultural development to produce an accurate full coverage map of subsidence keywords insar machine learning ground deformation land subsidence groundwater hydrogeology 1 introduction groundwater gw depletion is an increasing concern in the arid and semi arid regions of the world which is caused by higher water consumption due to the ever increasing population growth climate change as well has been affecting surface waters by increasing the frequency of floods and droughts making them less reliable water resources this has also put extra pressure on gw resources which are to some extent non renewable further more frequent flood and drought occurrences due to alterations in rainfall patterns diminish the capability of storing water both on and under the ground smith and majumdar 2020 all these issues have led to over exploitation of gw supplies which results in water table drop and consequent land subsidence in confined and semi confined aquifers and ultimately loss of gw storage smith et al 2017 other consequences of such phenomenon are damages to infrastructures and gw quality degradation land subsidence mainly occurs due to the over exploitation of gw resources caused by the lack of balance between pumping and natural artificial recharge the extraction of a huge amount of gw from the fine grained sediment leads to the decrease of the pore pressure compaction of the layer and finally the land subsidence other reasons causing land subsidence include but are not limited to anthropogenic activities such as mining tunnelling extraction of gas and underground water transfer systems in general land subsidence causes a fundamental adverse impact on the economy of the society julio miranda et al 2012 through deteriorating farmlands buildings transportation systems and power lines two common traditional approaches of monitoring ground deformation are through global positioning system gps stations and leveling data however they are expensive and produce limited spatial and temporal data one alternative to the traditional methods is interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar having mm to cm scale accuracy and spatial resolution of 5 20 m for sentinel 1 and 2 3 3 m for terrasar x images bai et al 2016 two common approaches for deriving land deformation rates are the persistent scatterer ps insar ferretti et al 2000 and small baseline subsets sbas insar berardino et al 2002 in the ps insar approach the pixels which have persistent phase stability over time are detected by considering a stack of single master interferograms these interferograms are generated by considering an image located in the middle spatially and temporally named master image this results in reliably measured deformation rates at only the ps points which are abundant in the urban areas with a high concentration of man made features crosetto et al 2016 karamvasis and karathanassi 2020 ps points however are highly sparse in the farming and high vegetated areas which we typically expect higher rates of subsidence due to pumping where the pixels usually have non dominant scatterers due to the fast rate of growth in vegetation and crops sbas insar on the other hand applies spectral filtering to reduce the phase variation due to decorrelation and identifies pixels with no dominant scatterers but constant phase response over time called slowly decorrelating filtered pixels sdfp this technique generates a gapless network of multi master interferograms between the images with short temporal and spatial separation the scatterers response in the sbas insar could be from the distributed small scattering objects instead of strong scatterers which is the case in the ps approach leading to the inclusion of more sdfp pixels in the line of sight los direction resulting in a higher spatial coverage tiwari et al 2016 smith et al 2021 filtering of highly decorrelated and noisy pixels however leads to gaps in the map which is also undesirable for many applications particularly agricultural water management the standard free source processors used to calculate ground deformation captured in radar images based on sbas algorithm are generic mapping tools synthetic aperture radar gmtsar and stanford method for persistent scatterers stamps in this study we used stamps hooper 2008 to determine the ground motion at the sdfp points producing a partial coverage deformation map of the studied plain due to the intense agricultural activities and vegetation coverage previous studies have mainly focused on investigating land subsidence susceptibility looking at the problem as a binary classification problem e g najafi et al 2020 mohammady et al 2021 thus the spatial coverage and pattern of the ground deformation changes have not been addressed properly in recent years some scholars have implemented insar to investigate land subsidence and landslide hakim et al 2020a b zhou et al 2020 aslan et al 2020 fadhillah et al 2020 fiorentini et al 2020 from those hakim et al 2020a used machine learning algorithms to produce landslide susceptibility maps based on the presence and absence points fiorentini et al 2020 applied boosted regression trees brt random forest and support vector machine algorithms to interpolate ground deformation rates as a regression problem for road monitoring and construction purposes while useful these common methods of interpolation of insar data points do not provide a reliable deformation map due to the aquifer complexities leading to nonlinear ground deformation considering discontinuity in the deformation map produced by insar techniques this study applies advanced machine learning algorithms mla including boosted regression trees brt and extreme gradient boosting xgb with different boosters using insar derived deformation data to obtain an accurate full coverage spatial map of deformation rate over an agricultural region the brt algorithm was selected as it employs regression trees and bosting techniques to increase the prediction efficiency compared to single tree algorithms through creating and integrating a large number of trees on the dataset elith et al 2008 the xgb algorithm is developed for diminishing the overfitting issue relative to its initial version i e gradient boosting chen et al 2017 the xgb has been used to generate high accuracy outputs in various disciplines such as gw potential banking system studies e g climent et al 2019 carmona et al 2019 naghibi et al 2020 the other advantage of the xgb algorithm is that it works in parallel leading to a lower required time considering the fact that this study deals with a huge number of datasets of driving factors and persistent scatterer points according to above the primary objectives of this research are i generating a full coverage ground deformation map at the plain scale using insar mlas and geo environmental factors and ii detecting the contribution of various factors to land subsidence occurrence to conduct this study we selected the mashhad plain in northeastern iran known to exhibit substantial land subsidence over the past years khorrami et al 2020 the underlying aquifer system is complex considering geology and is heavily impacted by anthropogenic factors such as land use change and water consumption considering the complex relationship between the detected ground deformation and aforementioned factors as well availability of data we selected this area to develop an artificial intelligence based approach to model aquifer deformation and identify the critical factors inducing subsidence thus the core novelty of this research lies in the spatial modeling of ground deformation rates using the combined insar mlas technique at the plain scale and focusing on the relevance of the hydrogeological and topographical factors on the human induced land subsidence the final result is the full coverage map of ground deformation measurement that can be used to investigate the impact of human induced land subsidence especially in agricultural areas forests and other lands with higher vegetation densities the map can also be used for gw management land surface management and land use planning 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current study was conducted in the mashhad plain situated in north eastern iran between 35 59 56 and 37 03 12 n latitudes and 58 31 44 and 59 58 25 e longitudes fig 1 the mashhad plain covers an area of about 4 375 km2 the area receives mean annual precipitation of 253 mm which mostly precipitates during february march period khalili et al 2016 mashhad plain has a mean temperature of about 13 5c with the minimum and maximum values of 21 and 44c in january and july respectively the area is categorized as arid to semi arid climatic condition having hot dry summers and wet cold winters khalili et al 2016 the statistics acknowledge that the per capita water usage of the residents of this area is above 120 l day which is greater than the average world s water consumption mashhad city which is located in the lower part of the plain is a tourist attractive city with a high construction rate and a huge growth of agricultural activities that ultimately leads to the overuse of gw supplies the annual water demand of the mashhad city is approximately 220 million m3 and its daily water consumption alters from 270 000 to 830 000 m3 felfelani and kerachian 2016 one reason for these significant changes in water consumption is the high number of tourists around 20 million visiting the city especially during the summer months felfelani and kerachian 2016 khorrami et al 2020 the mashhad plain has experienced a 12 m water table drop during the last twenty years akbari et al 2009 2 2 insar processing 2 2 1 data in this study we used a set of interferometric wide iw swath level 1 sentinel 1 a images in ascending track covering five years from 2014 to 2019 to derive the deformation rate in the study region as the vertical displacement due to over pumping is the dominant deformation in the study area we assumed negligible horizontal displacement in this study and only used ascending track the mashhad plain appeared to be shared between the middle and eastern sub swaths covered by images acquired from the relative orbit number of 86 the acquisition time interval of the images is 24 days spanning from october 23rd 2014 till march 17th 2019 having a three month gap between july 26th 2015 and october 30th 2015 in which there were no acquired images 2 2 2 insar analysis due to high vegetation coverage on one hand and the existence of urban and topographical features on the other hand a wide range of scattering characteristics exists in the study area in the agricultural areas the pixels generally have no dominant scatterers as opposed to the urban areas the importance of the agricultural areas as the main sources of gw exploitation in our study area mandated us to use the sbas method for deformation mapping using the pixels with distributed scattering properties sdfp by assuming a gapless network of interferograms formed by images with short time intervals and almost the same viewing angles considering the small spatial baselines decorrelation between sdfp would be minimized such networks consist of multiple interferograms with different master images i e multiple master interferograms in which the interferograms are fully interconnected in the first step we co registered the single look complex slc images with a selected reference image called super master image for this we used the pre processing module in the gmtsar software package which is an open source software developed by scripps institution of oceanography and san diego state university this module implements a geometric based approach for co registration of images employing a down sampled digital elevation model dem considering the super master image xu et al 2017 concerning dem a void filled version of shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem with a resolution of 3 arc second was used it is noteworthy that the super master image is often picked from the central point of the acquired images spatially and temporally however due to the existence of a three month gap in the sar time series from july 2nd 2015 till october 30th 2015 and longer time interval of the first set of images before the gap we shifted the time location of the master image towards the end of the acquisition time interval while the central spatial location condition was kept unchanged accordingly the image acquired on june 4th 2018 was chosen as the super master image a set of 507 multiple master interferograms considering temporal and spatial baseline of 80 days and 150 m respectively were used in the sbas calculation by considering 80 days temporal baseline and due to the gap between the used images we added six extra interferograms to build a gapless network and a more reliable connection between images which is needed for the sbas processing to mask out the pixels with low temporal coherence we set the threshold value equal to 0 42 deemed to be an acceptable value for the study area accordingly 513 interferograms were generated from 108 sar images which were then used to build the sbas network perpendicular and temporal baseline distribution of the sbas analysis is represented in fig 2 fig 2 shows the network of interferograms which have been used for sbas analysis the axes show temporal versus perpendicular intervals or baselines for selected scenes the distance among the 2 acquisition spots perpendicular to the satellite viewing direction is represented by the term perpendicular baseline each line can be considered as the interferogram formed between every two scenes it is important to have a gapless network of interferograms with a sufficiently short baseline for a successful sbas analysis the defined thresholds are meant for this purpose consequently we processed the slc images to identify the pixels with low decorrelation rates over consecutive time intervals sdfp from the network of interferograms the sdfps were identified based on their phase characteristics and were extracted using the stamps open source package hooper 2008 we separated a set of pixels named candidate pixels with a high probability of being in sdfp pixel s group using the amplitude difference dispersion index dδa defined as 1 d δ a σ δ a μ a where ϭδa is the standard deviation of the difference in amplitudes between master and slave images and μa is the mean amplitude hooper 2008 the threshold of dδa for identifying the candidate pixels was set to 0 42 considering a good balance between the sufficient number of initial pixels and the volume of files to be processed then the phase stability for each candidate pixel was estimated using a phase analysis equation defined as 2 φ x i w d x i a x i s x i θ x i n x i where the w is the wrapping operator d x i is the phase change due to the pixel s movement along the los direction a x i is the phase mismatch due to atmospheric delay of the two different passes of microwave signal s x i is the residual phase due to the orbit inaccuracies θ x i is the residual phase of look angle error and n x i is the noise component in phase consequently the pixels with small n x i values were selected as the final sdfp pixels hooper et al 2007 the next step was to unwrap the phase values which means adding up the right number of 2π cycles to the wrapped phase values due to two dimensional spatial phase data in the time domain the 3d phase unwrapping algorithm was used hooper and zebker 2007 this algorithm has a good ability to detect a higher magnitude of deformation with acceptable accuracy the least squares ls method was used to invert the unwrapped phases of the final sdfp pixels to derive a time series change of the phase for each pixel schmidt and bürgmann 2003 finally the phase of each pixel was retrieved for the location of the selected reference point used as a spatial reference and the master image used as the time reference master image the reference point for each sub scene is unique and it is chosen to have the minimum overall movements in corresponding time since there was not any stable positioning data to choose as the reference point in the area we set the reference point to 00 when processing sar data in the next step one insar pixel with minimum long term velocities and standard deviation of displacement in time was selected as the reference point for each scene to calculate the relative deformation rate the final map produced by this method shows the displacements in the los direction assuming negligible horizontal displacement the long term vertical displacement can be derived as d v d los cos θ i where θ i is the look angle computed by the sbas algorithm in the stamps environment for each sdfp pixel 2 3 ground deformation driving factors the literature implies that topographical factors such as altitude slope angle topographic wetness index twi distance from rivers river density plan curvature profile curvature geological factors such as geology distance to lineament lineament density soil type aquifer related factors such as gw drawdown land use and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have been used for modeling land subsidence occurrence e g pradhan et al 2014 bui et al 2018 arabameri et al 2020 at a larger spatial scale smith and majumdar 2020 considered some other factors including evapotranspiration total water storage produced by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission sediment thickness precipitation water stress aquifer type and urban land use in this research based on the literature and the spatial resolution of the available data four different categories of factors were prepared to be used along with the insar measurement in mlas described below it needs to be stated that due to the computational costs of the modeling process and also the fact that for water resources management a spatial resolution of 100 100 m is acceptable both insar data and driving factors were resampled to this spatial resolution to match each other 2 3 1 topographical factors in general topography impacts different aspects of the hydrological cycle including rainfall pattern and intensity direct sunshine duration runoff generation soil moisture soil infiltration drainage network and gw potential zapata rios et al 2016 yeh et al 2016 kamali maskooni et al 2020 hence they can potentially influence ground deformation this research considered altitude slope angle the vertical distance from rivers relative slope position profile curvature plan curvature curvature convergence and slope length the factors were created using an aster dem of the mashhad plain and then were resampled to 100 100 m to match the insar data 2 3 2 hydrological and climatic factors curve

united states department of agriculture usda 1986 soil permeability is generated through the soil conservation service method and hydrologic soil groups chow et al 1998 cn and soil permeability determine direct runoff and infiltration impacting gw recharge and subsequently ground deformation rates both of these factors were obtained from krrwc 2019 twi specifies the degree of water accumulation at different locations in a watershed which is also considered in this study and is calculated as follows beven and kirkby 1979 3 twi a t a n β where β depicts slope angle and a refers to the contributing area which flows to that certain pixel streams can influence ground deformation in different ways due to their recharge and drainage roles in this respect distance from rivers and river density layers were implemented in the algorithms 2 3 3 hydrogeological factors several aquifer parameters including aquifer thickness transmissivity existence and location of aquitards and clay percentage in the vertical profile that influence the ground deformation caused by water table fluctuation need to be considered however detailed aquifer parameters are hardly available particularly in developing countries based on data availability we only considered aquifer thickness and transmissivity transmissivity outlines the ability of an aquifer to transfer gw through its saturated section and affects soil compressibility mohebbi tafreshi et al 2019 transmissivity data were obtained from the results of the pumping test conducted by the krrwc 2019 the aquifer thickness data were also obtained from the krrwc 2019 transmissivity and aquifer thickness were interpolated for the studied aquifer mashhad aquifer is a quaternary unconfined aquifer zendehbad et al 2019 with a thickness reaching up to around 270 m depth in the central parts jaafari 2015 based on krrwc 2019 wells are categorized into shallow and deep with depths ranging from 3 to around 270 m mostly used for agricultural and orchard activities groundwater flow direction in the aquifer is from the northwest to the southeast central parts of the aquifer have finer sediments and are deeper than other parts the soil texture becomes finer from north to south transmissivity in different parts of the mashhad plain changes from 50 to 3 168 m2 day further to the abovementioned hydrogeological factors lithology and fault related variables were also considered fault activities are also involved in ground deformation brunori et al 2015 for instance faults can act as a conduit draining out recharging gw leading to water table drop rise causing subsidence uplift to consider the impact of faults we regarded distance from faults and fault density layers also over pumping of gw resources in the clay rich aquifers causes soil compaction and land subsidence observed on the ground to consider the impact of geology we considered lithological characteristics in this research presented in fig 3 2 3 4 anthropogenic factors in addition to the overexploitation of gw supplies road infrastructures mining activities and surface loadings are some important anthropogenic factors that cause land subsidence wang et al 2009 xu et al 2015 in this work we considered roads pumping wells qanat layers ndvi and land use land cover lu lc data a qanat includes a lightly sloping underground canal that is constructed to gather and transfer gw from the upstream aquifer to downstream places where it is used this system has been used for millennia in iran mainly because of the lower construction and water transfer costs as it is solely based on gravity some qanats in the mashhad plain are still in use while others are out of use and might cause ground subsidence although qanats are constructed at areas with higher gw potential it might have a stabilizing effect in this manner the distance from qanats and qanat density layers were created for the analysis another common means of gw extraction in the mashhad plain is through pumping wells comprising deep and semi deep wells thus we considered three well related factors such as distance from wells well density created based on pumping wells and water table changes created based on the piezometric heads measured in the monitoring wells water table changes were calculated for a longer period from 2010 to 2019 to consider the delay between the gw table fluctuation and the observed ground deformation by the insar technique further the lu lc map was generated using landsat 8 operational land imager images of 19th and 28th july 2019 different classification algorithms were tested and the final map was obtained by the neural network algorithm with the accuracy and kappa values of 95 and 93 respectively the lu lc map of the mashhad plain includes five major classes including agriculture orchard rangeland urban and water bodies the same landsat images were also used to calculate ndvi which resulted in values changing between 0 57 and 0 88 2 4 modeling procedure at the first step to assure that there is no multicollinearity between the input factors we calculated the variance inflation factor vif and tolerance multicollinearity stems from the high correlation among the input driving factors leading them to be non independent dormann et al 2013 to resolve this we removed the variables with a vif of greater than 10 or a tolerance of less than 0 1 keith 2006 factors without multicollinearity issues were then used in the mlas to predict ground deformation and produce a full coverage spatial map the sdfps measured by insar were resampled by calculating the average values of sdfps to a 100 100 m pixel size i e 61 487 cases to match the input driving factors pixel sizes of those long term ground deformation rates measured by insar 70 and 30 were randomly selected for training and validation of the mlas respectively naghibi et al 2021 lastly to produce a full coverage ground deformation map for the study area a dataset of all factors for the mashhad plain was fed into the algorithms and the final maps were obtained the used mlas are explained below 2 4 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 introduced the xgb as a novel mla that is currently one of the exceptionally efficient algorithms in spatial mapping bandara et al 2020 xgb utilizes gradient boosting to integrate multiple weak learners to compute the outcome i e ground deformation but in a parallel mode which makes it unique from the common gradient boosting another difference is that the xgb overcomes overfitting by implementing a highly regularized algorithm leading to higher performance bandara et al 2020 the parallelization is another advantage of xgb which decreases the required computation time fan et al 2018 in this study we used three different boosters of xgb including the linear tree and dropouts meet multiple additive regression trees dart based on artificial neural networks all the processes were applied in the r statistical software 2 4 2 boosted regression trees brt algorithm the brt combines mla and statistical approaches and attempts to integrate the outcomes of several trees to achieve accurate results schapire 2003 the brt algorithm employs regression to detect nonlinear relationships amongst the insar derived ground deformation and its driving factors as well it implements boosting to enhance algorithm sensitivity ridgeway 2007 further multiple preliminary steps such as data transformation and outlier deletion are not required when using the brt algorithm another advantage is that the brt adapts with different variables including categorical and continuous variables in this research the brt was implemented using the r statistical software through gbm and caret scripts ridgeway 2006 2 4 3 frequency ratio analysis fr algorithm to produce interpretable outputs considering the relationships between the long term ground deformation rates and the primary driving factors causing deformation we used the fr analysis fr denotes the probability of occurrence of a phenomenon to its non occurrence regarding each driving factor bonham carter 1994 considering uncertainty in insar processing and due to the calculated rmse between the mashhad gps station and its surrounding insar pixels i e 2 8 mm year and to have conservative threshold we assumed values less than 1 5 and values greater than 1 5 mm year represent subsidence and uplift respectively to apply this analysis the most important driving factors by the brt were selected and classified we used two different approaches for classifying factors such as equal and natural break classification schemes the former was used for altitude distance from faults aquifer thickness transmissivity distance from wells and water table changes the latter scheme was used for density layers of qanat river road and well as we typically expect sudden jumps in these datasets ayalew and yamagishi 2005 then the number of long term deformations at sdfps of less than 1 5 mm year and area of each class of the factors were defined and employed to compute fr as below 4 fr d d a a where d depicts the number of pixels with ls d depicts the total number of pixels with ls a is the area of the class and a is the total area of the study region 2 5 evaluation of the results we validated the performance of the used insar technique in measuring the ground deformation using the permanent gps stations data available in the study area using root mean square error rmse concerning the evaluation of the performance of the mlas in training and validation phases known as success and predictive rates respectively we calculated mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 additionally taylor diagram taylor 2001 was plotted to better represent the differences of the algorithms performances in predicting long term ground deformation rates relative to the insar grids using standard deviation r2 and rmse the stated indices are calculated as below 5 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 6 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 7 r 2 1 ss res ss tot 8 ss res i o i p i 2 9 ss tot i o i o 2 where p i is the predicted value for the i th case o i is the observed value insar measurement for the i th case o is the average of the observed values i is the index of observed values ranging from 1 to n ss tot the total sum of squares ss res is residual sum of squares 3 results and discussion 3 1 insar analysis the main objective of this study is to produce a full coverage long term deformation map based on the sparse insar measurement using mlas as well as identifying the driving factors inducing subsidence in the study case for this we first validated the insar data using the existing permanent gps stations in the area to ensure the accuracy of insar the used insar technique resulted in 871 242 ground deformation data points throughout the entire mashhad plain with deformation rates ranging from 216 to 49 mm year fig 4 the insar computation resulted in 871 242 ps with the potential spatial resolution based on sar data which is around 5 by 20 m in the satellite coordinate system however the concentration of the detected ps points depends on the scattering properties of the area ps points in the entire mashhad plain were resampled to 100 100 m spatial resolution leading to 61 487 grids to investigate the uplift locations a statistical analysis of the points was carried out and it was seen that the deformation data had an average of 6 4 min of 216 max of 49 and std of 27 8 regarding the uplift values it was seen that only 0 1 of data belonged to uplifts greater than 20 mm year and only 9 of the data belonged to uplifts greater than 10 mm year leading to 90 of the data to be less than 10 mm year to define the coverage of the insar deformation data we considered the sentinel 1 pixel size 5 20 m assuming that each ps point represents an area corresponding to 100 m2 this resulted in only 2 coverage of the mashhad plain however for visualization we used a higher pixel size to show the deformation velocity changes over the area fig 4 while we only focused on the long term map of deformation in this study we also produced the deformation time series using the insar technique to be able to check the accuracy of the insar data compared to the permanent gps positioning time series for this the rmse values were calculated considering the fitted line s slope as the displacement rates over each gps station s time series and the average of ten nearest insar pixels for the overlapping period according to the results at the mshn station an rmse value of 12 8 mm for 4 5 years was calculated which leads to an rmse of 2 8 mm year assuming the gps deformation time series are the true measurements and the consistency of the achieved insar with that of the gps measurements we can conclude the acceptable accuracy of the insar derived deformation measurement in this study fig 5 shows the comparison between the insar results and mashhad gps station data 3 2 optimization results of the algorithms for the training phase before running the algorithms we assessed the multicollinearity among the driving factors using the vif and tolerance techniques consequently five topographical factors encompassing curvature plan and profile curvatures slope length and slope were found to have collinearity issues and were removed from the analysis therefore we only applied the algorithms using the rest of the driving factors described in the materials and methods section from the gridded insar deformation data 70 42 840 and 30 18 365 were randomly divided into training and validation datasets to be inputted to the mlas respectively the brt was optimized on the training dataset by 1 000 trees interaction depth of 11 shrinkage of 0 1 and minimum terminal node size of 20 leading to rmse r2 and mae values of 3 4 mm year 0 983 and 2 1 mm year respectively fig 6 a as seen the rmse diminishes with the increase of boosting iterations or the number of trees and the best results are obtained by the maximum tree depth of 11 the xgb linear was optimized with a learning rate eta of 0 3 150 trees lambda of 0 1 and alpha of 0 1 leading to rmse r2 and mae values of 3 7 mm year 0 981 and 2 1 mm year respectively fig 6b the xgb dart was optimized with a gamma of 0 minimum child weight of 1 150 trees colsample bytree of 0 8 rate drop of 0 01 skip drop of 0 95 and minimum child weight of 1 resulting in rmse r2 and mae values of 5 83 mm year 0 955 and 3 47 mm year respectively fig 6c the xgb tree was optimized with a gamma of 0 minimum child weight of 1 150 trees a colsample bytree of 0 8 and a subsample of 1 maximum tree depth of 3 and learning rate of 0 4 resulting in rmse r2 and mae values of 5 8 mm year 0 954 and 3 4 mm year respectively fig 6d 3 3 validation of the algorithms in principle the evaluation results of the training phase success rate of the applied algorithms presented in table 1 depicted that the xgb linear and brt algorithms yielded the best efficiency in predicting training cases with rmse values of 2 1 and 2 5 mm year respectively according to the predictive rates the brt and xgb linear had the best predictions of ground deformation rates with rmse values of 3 3 and 3 5 mm year over the study period respectively table 1 further the results of both predictive and success rates implied that the two other algorithms the xgb dart and xgb tree predicted the long term ground deformation rate with acceptable but lower efficiency other indices such as r2 and mae followed the same pattern as the reported rmse results above fig 7 illustrates the scatter plot of the ground deformation data obtained by insar vs mlas in the validation phase based on the figure it can be seen that the brt and xgb linear predictions are well correlated with the insar data and the trendlines of these two models are very close to the 45 degree reference line red line also it can be seen that the scatter plots of the brt and xgb linear against insar data are more condensed compared to the xgb dart and xgb tree fig 8 depicts the taylor diagram plotted based on the validation dataset providing a visual comparison of the algorithm s performance against insar results using r2 rmse and standard deviation indices based on the figure the brt and xgb linear provided more accurate long term deformation data over the study period relative to other algorithms the results show that the implemented algorithms worked well in modeling ground deformation rates with rmse values less than 5 7 mm year for the mashhad plain with extensive long term deformation rates ranging from 216 to 49 mm year the outputs of the brt and xgb linear however were more promising compared to the other algorithms the promising results of the brt algorithm can be associated with its ability to address interactions elect highly important variables and eliminate the cases with the missing values carty 2011 another positive feature of the brt is the ability to detect nonlinear complex connections between the target and input factors naghibi et al 2020 showed higher performance of the xgb linear compared to the two other boosters in assessing gw potential in an arid area that is in line with the findings of this study similarly babajide mustapha and saeed 2016 assessed the capability of the xgb in investigating bioactive molecules they concluded that the algorithm is highly competent in biological analysis and copes well with homogenous and heterogenous variables another strong feature of the xgb is its capability to prevent overfitting to the training dataset and makes the model more generalized fan et al 2018 the xgb does not account for variables pre processing and missing values and relies on the normal distribution of the data which makes it less time consuming than other more complicated mlas naghibi et al 2020 the faster process of xgb and more precisely xgb linear stands out when there is a huge amount of data which was the case of the current study 3 4 ground deformation maps fig 9 a d shows the long term ground deformation maps generated by the implemented algorithms in the mashhad plain to compare the changes in the maps they were grouped into 7 classes based on the deformation rates of 0 0 24 9 25 49 9 50 74 9 75 99 9 100 124 9 and 125 mm year which are referred to as stable very low low moderate high very high and extensive land subsidence rates respectively further table 2 presents the area percentage of each class it is seen that for the brt as the best algorithm 82 3 of the mashhad plain was defined as stable and very low subsidence classes while 17 7 of the region showed a higher subsidence rate of more than 25 mm year referring to the extreme land subsidence the xgb linear as the second algorithm in terms of accuracy generated a similar map assigning 83 of the mashhad plain to stable and very low subsidence and 17 of the area to a high subsidence class of more than 25 mm year all algorithms showed that the central part of the plain encompassing mashhad city and its adjacent farming areas are severely impacted by subsidence during the 2014 2019 period fig 9a d this area is under intense agricultural activities and the aquifer is severely tapped by a very dense network of pumping wells and an extreme irrigation scheme the other region recognized with a significant subsidence signature is located at the northern part of the plain which is also under agricultural activity and extensive pumping 3 5 importance of the driving factors and their relationship with land subsidence occurrence fig 10 shows the importance score of each driving factor in modeling long term ground deformation rate by the brt algorithm the brt scores were reported as this model acquired the best performance in this study according to the findings well density distance from faults altitude water table changes transmissivity and road density were the most important driving factors contributing to the observed subsidence followed by the aquifer thickness qanat density distance from wells river density and qanat density to generate interpretable outputs for the high contributing factors the fr analysis was performed table 3 the well density showed a direct relationship with land subsidence occurrence that relates to the higher pumping pressure on the aquifer at the higher well density regions motagh et al 2008 also stated that gw exploitation is an essential variable that has affected the incidence of land subsidence in iranian plains during the past years minderhoud et al 2017 and abdollahi et al 2019 declared that areas with higher densities of the pumping wells experience greater rates of water table decline leading to land subsidence faults are important geological features having various impacts on aquifers through either draining or recharging the aquifers leading to subsidence and stability respectively the findings of the fr analysis implied a direct relationship between land subsidence and distance from faults a visual investigation of the distance from the fault layer and subsidence zones predicted by the brt algorithm revealed that the closer areas to the faults the more stable the ground surface which might relate to the recharging characteristics of the existing faults in the study area based on our findings the second class of altitude lower altitudes yielded the greatest fr value however we observed no evident linear pattern between the altitudes and subsidence occurrence meaning that there is not a decreasing or increasing linear relationship between these factors it seems that the observed subsidence could be associated with the farming activities that are mainly concentrated at the lower altitudes the results also showed that the portions of the aquifer with the water table rise are associated with fewer land subsidence occurrences more stable while areas with water table drop over exploitation of gw are associated with notable land subsidence zones a direct relationship was observed between transmissivity and land subsidence which shows the higher gw capacity of the aquifer allowing more pumping through the irrigation wells road density proved to have a direct relationship with land subsidence incidence as the two top road density classes owned the highest fr values this can be associated with the link between the road density and the level of development which defines the extent of gw exploitation for farming activities concerning aquifer thickness the areas with higher values than 56 4 m were found to be more prone to land subsidence while the shallower parts of the aquifer showed less subsidence rate it seems that the deeper part of the aquifer contains more fine grained materials such as clay and silt that are prone to compaction under gw extraction we found an inverse relationship between the qanat density and land subsidence this might be related to the fact that qanats are constructed in regions with higher gw potential and natural recharge with a low aquifer thickness qanat diverts gw from high land areas naturally thus areas with higher qanat densities are more likely to be stable as there is less pressure on the aquifer in the dense qanat regions the findings approve the prominent recharge role of the rivers in the area as there is a distinct inverse relationship between the river density and the observed land subsidence in principle it was understood that there are no simple and linear connections between ground deformation and its driving factors the connections seem to be non linear with a highly complex nature the implemented algorithms i e the brt and xgb can extract those complex connections from the implemented datasets and produce an acceptable prediction of the long term ground deformation over the study area 4 conclusion despite an accurate high spatiotemporal map of ground displacement in both urban and rural areas produced by the insar technique the spatial discontinuity due to the vegetation decorrelation in the farming area poses difficulty to obtain an insight concerning gw induced subsidence this study modeled the long term ground deformation rates by combing the mlas and insar discrete measurements on a set of geo environmental factors to produce full coverage deformation maps over the studied area the results showed acceptable performance of the brt and xgb linear algorithms in modeling long term deformation rates the other important aim was to assess the contribution of the factors to land subsidence occurrence as well as investigate their relationships the most contributing factors to subsidence occurrences were identified as the well density distance from faults altitude gw table changes transmissivity road density aquifer thickness and qanat density in the mashhad plain it was concluded that land subsidence has direct relationships with well density transmissivity road density aquifer thickness and inverse relationships with distance from faults qanat density and river density these relationships were not found to be simple and linear and tend to be highly complicated in addition to the mentioned driving factors other factors such as clay thickness which substantially influences land subsidence can be considered in future studies to further improve the performance of the algorithms looking upon the acceptable performance of the brt and xgb linear algorithms they are recommended for future studies of insar ground deformation analysis the highly contributing factors to land deformation identified in this study are suggested to be included in relevant future studies generation of accurate high resolution ground deformation maps by insar and mlas can be of utmost importance to water sector managers to gain useful insights to spot the crucial areas and appropriately assign financial resources to control land subsidence optimizing water allocation changing cultivation patterns and establishing artificial recharge systems for the areas under high pumping combined with the results of this study can help to reverse the dramatic impacts of land subsidence in the mashhad plain credit authorship contribution statement seyed

3472,lake eutrophication has become a critical environmental issue due to the global effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change and has been comprehensively studied for many years a series of models and indicators have been proposed to assess the trophic state of lakes the trophic state index tsi is a synthetic index that integrates chlorophyll a water clarity and total phosphorus and is widely used to evaluate the trophic state of aquatic environments in this study we collected in situ lake samples n 431 from typical lakes to match sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi imagery data using the case 2 regional coast color processor then we developed a new empirical model tsi 34 04 band 4 band 5 1 114 band 1 band 4 97 376 this model is valid for all of china with good performance and few errors rmse 7 36 mae 6 25 for the validation dataset recognizing that over 94 of the chinese population located along eastern watersheds and large lakes have competing water uses and given the tsi model on the seasonal scales we further estimated the mean tsi and trophic state in eastern chinese lakes 100 km2 from 2019 to 2020 the results revealed that more lakes were eutrophic in autumn 94 28 than in spring 77 14 indicating a serious eutrophication of eastern lakes although the eastern lakes have been studied in more detail this study found that eutrophication still has markedly negative impacts on lake ecosystems in addition no significant improvement was observed in spring most likely due to the months of curfew lockdown from january 2020 onwards due to covid 19 this may be due to the enrichment of nutrients deposited in sediment or watershed soil which can be characterized as autochthonous sources of lake eutrophication over decades with high rates of economic development this study demonstrates the applicability of sentinel 2 msi data to monitor lake eutrophication as well as the feasibility of blue red and red red edge combinations the framework and tsi model used bands available on msi sensors to develop a novel approach for generating historical eutrophication data for large scale evaluation of and decision making related aquatic environmental changes even in poorly studied areas keywords trophic state index eutrophication chinese eastern lakes sentinel 2 1 introduction lakes are important ecosystems that are sensitive to anthropogenic activities and climate change mortsch and quinn 1996 they are currently widely acknowledged to be in crisis characterized by a global increase in the frequency duration and extent of algal blooms michalak et al 2013 song et al 2021 algal decay depletes oxygen and kills domestic or bottom dwelling aquatic organisms giving rise to ecological dead zones carpenter 2008 and over 400 dead zones caused by eutrophication have been reported diaz and rosenberg 2008 high productivity or eutrophication begins with excessive quantities of nutrients being discharged into lakes khan et al 2014 and this is one of the greatest stressors for lakes on both regional liang et al 2021 and global scales thackeray and hampton 2020 increasing green lakes requires the development of eutrophication mitigation strategies with the sole focus of monitoring eutrophication in a timely manner as the evaluation of water quality involves the study of phytoplankton biomass and nutrients eutrophication is vital for assessing and understanding the structure and functioning of lake ecosystem yao et al 2018 the trophic state index tsi is commonly adopted by ecosystem scientists and managers to characterize the biogeochemical features of lakes it was created by carlson 1977 and built using trophic parameters such as total phosphorus chlorophyll a and secchi disk depth therefore characterizing the tsi is a common requirement for the monitoring of ecosystem level changes in lakes smith and schindler 2009 the rapid increase in economic growth in china over the past 30 years has come at a huge cost to the environment guo et al 2014 due to its vast territory china contains a variety of different terrains and is characterized by an unbalanced distribution of population and economic wealth cao et al 2014 song et al 2021 the heihe tengchong line represents the fact that 94 of the population lives in the eastern regions of china which are densely populated urbanized economically developed and account for 40 of the landmass of the country cao et al 2014 of the many natural lakes in china 53 are statistically distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau average altitude 4000 m where they are less exposed to anthropogenic activities ma et al 2011 in contrast the eastern region has fewer lakes and high levels of human activity which puts great pressure on the former the eastern lakes provide critical ecological functions including supplying drinking water for residents of the surrounding regions guan et al 2020 thus the protection and sustainable management of the trophic state of eastern lakes using extensive spatial and temporal information is a high priority considering recent degradations of water quality at the beginning of 2020 the novel coronavirus disease covid 19 spread to almost all countries and territories around the globe world health organization 2020 governments quickly imposed a series of strict regulations and most economic activities including factories transportation and lakeside tourist attractions were reduced or stopped askitas et al 2020 bates et al 2020 the resulting lockdowns partially drove changes in human interactions with lakes with some published studies reporting positive effects including reduced air pollutants in china liu et al 2020 reports included a fall in the mean turbidity in the lakes in wuhan of 24 9 sun et al 2021 many international studies reported on the impact of lockdown on surface water quality yunus et al 2020 and air quality mahato and ghosh 2020 etc despite positive results the impacts of a sudden halt in anthropogenic activities on the lake trophic state remain unclear particularly for the eastern lakes in china the ongoing covid 19 lockdown allows for a unique and unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into human eutrophication interactions in aquatic environments traditionally tsi has been determined by combinations of one or more trophic parameters using field and lab methods carlson 1977 these processes including sampling transportation filtration and chemical analyses e g of chlorophyll a chl a and total phosphorus tp are usually labor and time consuming particularly the analyses which require several days and for large or remote lakes with limited accessibility kutser et al 2020 likewise dispersed samples poorly represent the comprehensive trophic state within a lake because of the patchy distribution of nutrients carlson 1977 it is also difficult to carry out monitoring when taking into consideration nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics and the interference of environmental changes on algal blooms duan et al 2014 huang et al 2014 michalak et al 2013 this undoubtedly limits the rapid characterization of tsis in lakes undergoing dynamic variation additionally both fieldwork and laboratory work have been hindered by the imposition of sudden lockdowns due to the covid 19 pandemic more importantly the field lab method is ill suited for large scale e g regional or global monitoring to assess and understand changing mechanisms while also considering anthropogenic activities and climate change to support scientific catchment management nakayama and watanabe 2008 shi et al 2019 these questions have been increasingly supervised through efforts that rely on other methods to characterize trophic state in bodies of water satellite remote sensing is an effective method for rapidly collecting water quality observations kutser et al 2020 several studies have employed different sensors for this purpose including a series of methods to obtain the tsi of lakes li et al 2021 woerd and wernand 2015 1 deriving every trophic indicator including e g chl a secchi disk depth sdd and tp gitelson et al 2008 li et al 2021 and group them into a tsi song et al 2012 2 deriving intermediate indicators including absorption coefficients of optical active substances zhang et al 2018 and correlating them to the tsi and 3 deriving tsi directly shi et al 2019 zhu and mao 2021 respectively however nutrients e g tp have no optical responses which makes it difficult to derive their concentrations babin et al 2003 data are therefore based mostly on the relationships between nutrients and other optical water qualities such as chl a kutser 1997 in addition estimating every trophic indicator or using indirect methods based on intermediate indicators could result in overlapping uncertainties because of the limited precision of every tsi related parameter song et al 2012 previous studies have developed a series of chl a gitelson et al 2008 gower et al 2005 gurlin et al 2011 and sdd binding et al 2007 olmanson et al 2008 however these could not be used as universal models due to the optical complexity of individual lakes establishing a direct relationship between reflectance and tsi can consider a rapid method for evaluating lakes zhu and mao 2021 developed a tsi estimation model using remote sensing for urban waters in gongqingcheng china using 18 sampling sites however this may be insufficient for training a robust model that aims to qualify the trophic state of lakes with transferability and feasibility for other scenes and modalities owing to the dynamic optical complexity of water qualities shi et al 2019 also developed a tsi semi analytical algorithm based on optical properties and applied it to lake taihu china although the semi analytical algorithm showed a good performance its applications were limited to offering different adaptive model parameters varying with different water bodies lee et al 2002 li et al 2016 these results demonstrate the difficulty in applying this method to large scale studies on the trophic state assessment of lakes thus there is a need to develop an effective and rapid way to monitor tsi directly and to use relevant strategies to address multiple environmental stressors in this study a new tsi empirical model was developed considering the need to engage in forward looking and robust algorithms as well as for use under conditions of time pressure namely during the covid 19 lockdowns considering the suitability of the multispectral instrument msi sensor for monitoring water quality with higher radiometric sensitivity and their signal to noise ratios improved accuracy level 1c products were used to evaluate reflectance in this study samples were collected from 45 lakes across china during 2017 2019 the msi aboard sentinel 2 was launched in 2015 and significantly improved the data quality and spectral coverage pahlevan et al 2019 with high spatial 10 20 and 60 m and a revisit time of 3 5 days meanwhile the sensor can derive physical and chemical compositions using empirical models owing to narrow 10 nm spectral bands in the optical domain 380 780 nm toming et al 2016 this model was applied to the eastern region of china which has fewer lakes and a large population that puts high levels of pressure on them guan et al 2020 because the impacts of sudden changes in anthropogenic activities on the lake trophic state remain unclear we took advantage of the rare field conditions arising from the covid 19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns to gain insights into human eutrophication interactions in this region of china using our novel tsi empirical model designed for use in large scale observation studies and under time pressure based on the measurements and remote sensing data our goal was three fold 1 to evaluate the trophic parameters of lakes across china using in situ measurements 2 to establish an empirical model for tsi estimations using sentinel 2 msi imagery data 3 to map the tsi of eastern lakes 100 km2 and evaluate their spatiotemporal variations during the covid 19 pandemic 2 materials and methods

quality and to conduct atmospheric corrections of the satellite images used in this study in step 2 the tsi was calculated in situ and randomly divided into a calibration dataset 70 287 lake samples and validation dataset 30 144 lake samples in matlab 14 0 in step 3 we calibrated and validated the tsi empirical models with single band or band combinations using multiple linear regression in spss 17 0 in step 4 we evaluated their performance considering the regression coefficient fitting slope and errors and used our findings to establish the tsi model in step 5 the resulting tsi model was used to map the distributions of the trophic state of lakes in the study region the tsi values were calculated from mapped pixels within a lake to represent the trophic state 3 1 data collection 3 1 1 in situ sampling process efforts were made to collect samples from lakes with different trophic state and biogeochemical backgrounds a total of 431 samples from 45 lakes were collected from 2016 to 2019 among which some were sampled once and others were sampled frequently table s2 these in situ water samples were previously published by song et al 2020 and li et al 2021 as well as in unpublished eutrophication research using machine learning algorithms samples were taken from approximately 0 5 m below the surface of the water covering as much of the surface of the lakes as possible the samples were immediately stored in a portable refrigerator 4 c and delivered to the laboratory within 2 3 days the secchi disk depth sdd was determined using a black and white disk 3 1 2 multispectral instrument imagery the sentinel 2 satellite with a multispectral instrument msi sensor was launched in 2015 with 12 bands table s3 the msi level 1c product of the sentinel satellite can be freely downloaded from the european space agency esa website first 210 scenes of cloud free images for 7 days covering the relevant lakes were required to extract the reflectance and further build a tsi model second the trophic state of 35 lakes with areas 100 km2 across eastern china were mapped and evaluated using the tsi model developed in this study a total of 148 cloud free images covering mapped lakes were acquired it should be noted that we selected the images from march april 2020 and october november 2019 covering these 35 lakes to map trophic state with the derived tsi model tsi maps of lakes were constructed using envi 5 3 and arcgis 10 3 software 3 2 data analysis 3 2 1 laboratory analysis of water quality parameters in the laboratory the concentrations of chl a were measured using a uv 2600pc spectrophotometer shimadzu kyoto japan and total phosphorus tp concentrations were determined using a continuous flow analyzer skalar san plus system the netherlands apha awwa wef 1998 further details can be found in the studies by song et al 2020 and li et al 2021 in addition we used the modified carlson s trophic state to calculate the tsi with three levels carlson 1977 table s1 eutrophic 50 tsi 100 mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 and oligotrophic tsi 30 using eq 1 4 supplementary data 3 2 2 atmospheric correction of msi imagery case 2 regional coast color c2rcc atmospheric correction processor in sentinel application platform snap version 7 0 0 developed by esa was used for atmospheric correction it can be used to transfer the bottom of atmospheric reflectance of level 1c product to normalized water leaving reflectance at 443 492 560 665 704 and 740 nm rhown in snap c2rcc uses artificial neural networks to process 550 000 entries of simulated data generated by hydrolight simulations and a bio optical model doerffer and schiller 2007 the performance of the c2rcc processor has been evaluated in previous studies warren et al 2019 li et al 2021 in the present study a 3 3 pixel 30 m 30 m centered reflectance was used and band 1 6 were used to represent rhown λ 3 2 3 statistical analyses and accuracy assessment of tsi model statistical analyses including descriptive statistics correlation correlation coefficient r regression regression coefficient r2 and one way anova analyses significance levels p 0 05 were conducted using spss software version 16 0 statistical program for social science chicago il usa the mean normalized error mae and root mean square error rmse were used to assess the performance of the tsi model as described by li et al 2021 4 results 4 1 in situ measured water qualities the average value of chl a concentrations from in situ measured lakes was 7 56 11 28 µg l 1 with a chl a concentration ranging from 0 13 to 100 0 µg l 1 table s2 the mean sdd of the lakes was 1 6 1 5 m with a range of 0 17 9 47 m overlapping with the sdd results reported by song et al 2020 in terms of nutrient tp concentration the average value was 0 16 0 42 mg l 1 with a range of 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 these tsi results indicate that the quality of lake water collected from across china showed the lakes to be mostly eutrophic fig 3 4 2 the empirical tsi model multiple linear regression was used to test all possible band ratios and determine correlated relationships between spectral band ratios in situ tsi was used to determine some sensitive combinations ratios for band 2 band 6 band 3 band 5 band 4 band 5 and bands 4 5 and 1 were significantly associated with tsi table s4 in addition empirical models based on these sensitive band combinations with two or more variables achieved regression coefficients of determination r2 0 77 for the calibration dataset of these models the combination of bands 4 5 and 1 played an important role in correlations with tsi where r2 values were higher than 0 80 for the calibration dataset the combinations of band 4 and band 5 did the same in particular our trial analysis showed that for the validation dataset the empirical regression model based on bands 4 5 and 1 performed the best r2 0 60 fig 4 with relatively small errors rmse 7 36 mae 6 25 contrasting band 4 and band 5 combinations as follows 1 tsi 34 04 band 4 b a n d 5 1 114 band 1 b a n d 4 97 376 this model could also be used with bands 4 5 and 1 to map the tsi of the eastern lakes to assess the eutrophic state of the lakes studied 4 3 trophic state assessment of eastern lakes 100 km2 the trophic state of 35 lakes with areas 100 km2 across eastern china was evaluated using our derived tsi model figs 5 6 and table s5 because the eutrophication state of these lakes was space dependent the tsi values within a lake were averaged considering the representativeness when the standard deviation was less than the average values for every lake table s5 as a result eutrophic lakes accounted for 77 14 97 14 80 00 and 94 28 of the lakes sample in spring 2019 autumn 2019 spring 2020 and autumn 2020 respectively fig 5a indicating that most of the eastern lakes had a tsi 50 fig 5b despite the imposition of a covid 19 lockdown these results indicate that there was no significant improvement in lake eutrophication in spring 2020 compared to spring 2019 fig s1 a decrease in the number of eutrophic lakes was only observed in autumn 2020 compared to 2019 notably the tsis and sd from lakes located in northeast china were steadily eutrophic and lakes distributed in the reaches of the yangtze river were significantly variable fig 6e h only one lake fuxian lake located in the yungui plateau was characterized by an oligotrophic state both in autumn 2019 and 2020 similarly significant differences were observed in the seasonal variations f 8 57 p 0 01 and spatial variations associated with their environmental backgrounds we compared the seasonal differences for the tsi values within a lake and found that the tsi was stable with low sd in autumn ranges 0 3 11 12 in 2019 and 0 47 7 35 in 2020 compared to spring 0 41 14 in 2019 and 0 5 15 5 in 2020 5 discussion 5 1 new empirical tsi model in response to the rare field conditions arising from the covid 19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns a new tsi empirical model was developed based on the msi based satellite images to conduct a long term study of lake eutrophication instead of a traditional monitoring and early warning of trophic state this unified model was tested for eastern lakes 100 km2 during lockdowns to understand the evolution prospects of lakes with reduced anthropogenic activities our study provides a new empirical tsi model 1 using sentinel 2 remote sensing data to quantify the trophic state rapidly figs 4 5 this model was calibrated and validated using in situ data across china which could have large scale applicability and robustness compared to previous studies huang et al 2014 shi et al 2019 our method can be used to avoid the need for traditional time and labor consuming measurements the traditional field lab method limits the availability of water quality for analysis in spatiotemporal applications meanwhile we found that the blue red green red red red edge and blue red combinations could be sensitive to the tsi considering the significant performance r2 0 77 fig 4 the results showed an increase in the r2 value r2 0 80 of the calibration datasets with red and red edge combinations fig 4c and d the validation results also indicated an improvement error rmse 7 36 mape 6 25 this result was in line with that reported by an earlier study kutser et al 1994 wherein a variety of band combinations including band ratio original band values and base line were used to establish the relationship between water quality and remotely sensed signals which affected the strength of applications it is important to note that for our tsi models these sensitive bands were synthesized bands they were blue red green red and red red edges it was also not surprising that the tsi was calculated as a compressive result reflecting phytoplankton biomass chl a turbidity suspended matter sdd and nutrients although there were no systematic optical responses to tsi as a function of the trophic state some sensitive bands confirmed by independent trophic parameters could support the estimation of tsi song et al 2020 applied red blue and red green combinations to build a universal sdd model with a large number of lake datasets n 2032 these studies have attempted to build relationships between water quality and inherent optical properties which have an impact on reflectance gordon et al 1988 hence most algorithms for trophic parameters employ band combinations to amplify their spectral characteristics although reflectance is comprised of the inherent optical properties of water qualities related to the trophic state it is also related to light field conditions lee et al 2002 in this study sentinel 2 msi data with multi spatial resolution resampled 10 m and time windows of 7 days were used likewise a c2rcc atmospheric correction processor based on the bio optical model and radiative transfer equation was used to extract the normalized leaving water reflectance warren et al 2019 pahlevan et al 2019 toming et al 2016 the results showed that red blue and red red edges can be used as a suitable proxy for estimating tsi we aimed to reduce the dependence of every trophic parameter to determine the trophic state index using a cost effective empirical model for large scale applications 5 2 lake eutrophication of eastern lakes many efforts have been devoted to qualifying the trophic state index of lake eutrophication carlson 1977 dodds et al 1998 khan et al 2014 huang et al 2014 shi et al 2019 sheela et al 2011 approaches to classify the trophic levels have been proposed using combinations of water column variables including phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter cunha et al 2013 the tsi serves as a widely recognized as an acceptable paradigm of trophic state via the organization and grouping of these parameters and is used as a decision making strategy by lake managers zhang et al 2018 in general based on our in situ observations from lake samples the majority of the sampled lakes were eutrophic and mesotrophic with tsi values 30 fig 3 these results were not surprising because of the intrinsic economic and population gap between the eastern and western regions of china fig 1 in terms of the tp 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 and chl a 0 13 100 0 µg l 1 concentration the average values were 0 16 0 42 mg l 1 and 7 56 11 28 µg l 1 indicating that water qualities are provided with highly spatially information the nutrient levels in our measured lakes were significantly higher than those in lake erie stow et al 2015 lake balaton hatvani et al 2014 and saginaw bay steinman et al 2012 as a result it needs to be emphasized that chinese lakes are facing serious eutrophication and regional differences fig 3 lake eutrophication is the main factor affecting the degradation of lake ecosystems khan and ansari 2005 for most developed regions in china eastern lake catchments are subject to intensive human activities cao et al 2017 and provide critical ecological functions guan et al 2020 in addition this region contains numerous lakes with highly changed suspended matter levels e g poyang lake and dongting lake and phytoplankton production e g taihu lake considering the ecosystem service function of eastern lakes we selected eastern lakes 100 km2 divided by hu s line to which we applied our tsi model and evaluated their trophic state consistent with our in situ observations the application of our tsi model to eastern lakes area 100 km2 demonstrated serious levels of eutrophication in line with previous studies fig 5 duan et al 2014 the trophic state in different lakes at times within a single lake varied greatly spatially and resulted in large standard deviations fig 6e h this demonstrated the significant seasonal variations f 8 57 p 0 01 and spatial distributions associated with the environmental backgrounds of the lakes under study overall lake eutrophication is subject to rainfall wind speed aquaculture and agricultural fertilizer leaching from lake catchments to illustrate this further for the eastern lakes 100 km2 investigated in this study the proportion of eutrophic lakes was larger in autumn 94 28 than in spring 77 14 fig 5a this indicates that seasonal variations include increased temperature and a rather large proportional contribution of nutrient loadings due to the seasonality of hydrological forces wind and river flow and phytoplankton development yin 2002 wind and river flow may play an important role in carrying nutrient loadings impacted by human activities into lakes nõges et al 2007 for instance some lakes such as dongting lake and poyang lake in the yangtze river floodplain are of oxbow or riverine types with an average residence time of 30 days whereas the isolated taihu lake has an average of 310 days wang dou 1998 likewise lake characteristics such as water depth and soil type can cause additional eutrophication kong and gao 2005 pierson et al 2003 for example for shallow lakes in the eastern region above 5 m wind could resuspend sediment and release nutrients into the overlying water shallow lakes with a small storage capacity were subject to conditions that were favorable to eutrophication e g warm water temperature and dynamic nutrients compared to deeper lakes in comparison only one lake fuxian in the yungui plateau was characterized by an oligotrophic state tsi 30 in autumn fig 7 d fuxian lake is one of the deepest lake in southwest china with an average depth of 87 m cui and wang 2009 allowing it to have a large storage capacity and self purifying abilities nutrient sources are mainly the result of anthropogenic activities including aquaculture sewerage soil nutrients and loss of fertilizers in drained agricultural lands paerl et al 2011 as a result the nutrient and trophic state indices showed higher values in these lakes based on the trophic results of spatial patterns addressing eutrophication issues requires a better understanding of the complex effects caused by interactions between anthropogenic activities climate and lake characteristics 5 3 current covid 19 perspective for lake eutrophication 100 km2 a new acute respiratory disease coronavirus disease covid 19 spread globally at the beginning of 2020 and continues to spread today world health organization 2020 as a result many countries have implemented various emergency policies to limit the spread of the virus including lockdowns and isolation askitas et al 2020 bates et al 2020 anthropogenic activities such as factories and lakeside tourist attractions have been shut down in an attempt to reduce transmission yunus et al 2020 our results indicate that the decrease in numerous pollutants in lakes including nutrients from terrestrial inputs was the main driving force for eutrophication sun et al 2021 reported that the turbidity of lakes in wuhan changed from 33 4 ntu to 25 1 ntu after the lockdown yunus et al 2020 also reported that the concentration of suspended particulate matter in vembanad lake also decreased during the lockdown period these findings suggest that a sudden lockdown reduces anthropogenic activities in lake ecosystems by minimizing nutrient inputs patel et al 2020 huang et al 2020 it is interesting to note that for the lakes studied herein 100 km2 figs 4 5 no significant improvement was observed in lake eutrophication after the halt of anthropic activities due to the lockdown in spring 2020 compared to spring 2019 fig s1 these results can be observed in liangzihu lake from mesotrophic in may 2019 to eutrophic in may 2020 and nvshan lake from eutrophic in may 2019 to mesotrophic in may 2020 recognizing that over 94 of the chinese population lives in eastern watersheds competing for water use including potable water irrigation needs for agriculture despite several months of the curfew lockdown period from january 2020 onwards eutrophication still has a significant negative impact on lake ecosystems particularly when coupled with unfavorable hydrological processes for liangzi lake fig s1 many outlets ditches input agricultural nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and wastewater from surrounding villages into the lake via runoff or rainfall fan et al 2016 xiong et al 2008 found that the nutrient and organic matter pollution levels in sediments were higher than those in eastern lakes considering the recent decades of economic development the enriched nutrients that accumulate in sediments nakayama and watanabe 2008 can be characterized as autochthonous sources of lake eutrophication berthold et al 2019 demonstrated that sediments could accelerate the progress of lake eutrophication via the enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus our results also illustrated that from a long term perspective the nutrients from sediment catchment remain a serious environmental issue for eutrophication in large scale observations duan et al 2014 michalak et al 2013 taken together these results indicate that the improvement of eutrophication by minimizing anthropogenic activities could be a long term solution 5 4 implications for remote sensing of tsi we recommended the use of msi sentinel 2 data to qualify and evaluate the trophic state of lakes with full 13 spectral bands a spatial resolution of 10 60 m in most of the visible and all of the nir bands and a temporal resolution of 3 5 days revisit time drusch et al 2012 msi sentinel 2 and operational land imager oli landsat have a similar design that offers even more spectral measurements within the near infrared band msi demonstrated that additional spectral bands and high spatial resolution are advantageous over optically complex inland waters kutser et al 2016 thus msi has the potential to provide eutrophic information for lake monitoring at regional and global scales pahlevan et al 2017 for retrieving tsi chl a follows wavelength dependent bands lyu et al 2015 sdd could be related to the scattering spectra of spm suspended particulate matter and tp has no optical response making it difficult to differentiate them using solely their optical properties based on the empirical relationships between reflectance and tsi band combinations are able to characterize the trophic state rapidly in comparison to traditional independent retrieves of trophic parameters hence our analysis and results include a large dataset that covers the large variability of water quality the tsi model can be applicable for most lakes with similar ranges of eutrophic parameters as those found in this study chl a 0 13 100 0 µg l 1 tp 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 sdd 0 17 9 47 m according to verpoorter et al 2014 there are over 11 7 million bodies of water 0 2 ha most of which are accessible with the requirements of global inventory the trophic state evaluation records are not available making it difficult to conduct large scale trend analyses olmanson et al 2008 song et al 2020 as mentioned above a new tsi model was developed with which to evaluate the trophic state of lakes which is particularly pertinent considering the marked effects of climate change in recent years this model allows for the identification of appropriate algorithms with which to qualify the trophic state of water bodies via satellite remote sensing mccullough et al 2012 5 5 limitation and future perpectives the red band e g 665 nm and red edge band e g 704 nm were demonstrated to be capable of quantifying tsi in this study as a synthetic parameter tsi was calculated using chl a sdd and tp and chl a was provided with maximum weighted matching carlson 1977 hence the band combinations responding to synthetic tsi showed a greater spectral configuration consistency of chl a considering satellite sensors than in previous studies chl a algorithms gitelson et al 2008 gower et al 2005 gurlin et al 2011 the tsi model can be applied to similar sensors to produce records of tsi variations and can be used to compare more traditional ocean color missions e g modis olci and meris likewise the machine learning algorithms based on computer technology and statistical learning theory have successfully improved the accuracy of water quality models in recent years cao et al 2020 li et al 2021 both the empirical and machine learning tsi model required a highly calibrated dataset including high nutrients 2 50 mg l 1 and chl a concentrations 100 µg l 1 considering the machine learning algorithms the extensive field lab materials with complex source variations from different lakes will be required for the formation of robust agreements especially in regions subject to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and industry nevertheless we aim to provide technical operations and national scale tsi products which should then prompt more targeted validation efforts and driving factors analysis particularly in large spatial scale lake observations the strong relationships between tsi or other eutrophic indexes to qualify trophic state and several trophic state defining parameters should be also studied in future in a broader perspective our ambition for future work is to provide an immediate solution to the uptake of sensor products in a wider range of lakes which should then prompt more analysis responding to rapid urbanization effects and warming temperature 6 conclusions recognizing that the traditional field lab approach has limited temporal and spatial heterogeneity for estimating the trophic state index of lakes we aimed to provide a new unified model based on band combination through the development and validation of in situ measurements we assessed the trophic parameters of samples collected in situ from 45 productive lakes and used normalized water leaving reflectance acquired with sentinel 2a b msi images and a c2rcc processor to calibrate and validate our model trophic parameters included the concentrations of sdd 0 17 9 47 m tp 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 and chl a 0 13 100 0 µg l 1 the unified model was combined with msi reflectance data to obtain a snapshot of tsi in lakes 100 km2 in eastern china between 2019 and 2020 at a time when local and national lockdowns were imposed due to covid 19 the mapping results demonstrated that 77 of the eastern lakes 100 km2 were eutrophic notable our results confirmed that eutrophication was not improved during lockdowns in response to the covid 19 pandemic this suggests that more attention should be paid to nutrients or pollution via soil or sediment around lakes our novel empirical tsi model eq 1 was used to characterize the trophic state index both spatially and temporally and showed promising results for use in large scale study scenarios wishing to determine the trophic state of lakes this model shows potential for use as an efficient alternative tool for the monitoring of eutrophication and a guide to be used by lake managers to assess possible solutions such as mitigating

3472,lake eutrophication has become a critical environmental issue due to the global effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change and has been comprehensively studied for many years a series of models and indicators have been proposed to assess the trophic state of lakes the trophic state index tsi is a synthetic index that integrates chlorophyll a water clarity and total phosphorus and is widely used to evaluate the trophic state of aquatic environments in this study we collected in situ lake samples n 431 from typical lakes to match sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi imagery data using the case 2 regional coast color processor then we developed a new empirical model tsi 34 04 band 4 band 5 1 114 band 1 band 4 97 376 this model is valid for all of china with good performance and few errors rmse 7 36 mae 6 25 for the validation dataset recognizing that over 94 of the chinese population located along eastern watersheds and large lakes have competing water uses and given the tsi model on the seasonal scales we further estimated the mean tsi and trophic state in eastern chinese lakes 100 km2 from 2019 to 2020 the results revealed that more lakes were eutrophic in autumn 94 28 than in spring 77 14 indicating a serious eutrophication of eastern lakes although the eastern lakes have been studied in more detail this study found that eutrophication still has markedly negative impacts on lake ecosystems in addition no significant improvement was observed in spring most likely due to the months of curfew lockdown from january 2020 onwards due to covid 19 this may be due to the enrichment of nutrients deposited in sediment or watershed soil which can be characterized as autochthonous sources of lake eutrophication over decades with high rates of economic development this study demonstrates the applicability of sentinel 2 msi data to monitor lake eutrophication as well as the feasibility of blue red and red red edge combinations the framework and tsi model used bands available on msi sensors to develop a novel approach for generating historical eutrophication data for large scale evaluation of and decision making related aquatic environmental changes even in poorly studied areas keywords trophic state index eutrophication chinese eastern lakes sentinel 2 1 introduction lakes are important ecosystems that are sensitive to anthropogenic activities and climate change mortsch and quinn 1996 they are currently widely acknowledged to be in crisis characterized by a global increase in the frequency duration and extent of algal blooms michalak et al 2013 song et al 2021 algal decay depletes oxygen and kills domestic or bottom dwelling aquatic organisms giving rise to ecological dead zones carpenter 2008 and over 400 dead zones caused by eutrophication have been reported diaz and rosenberg 2008 high productivity or eutrophication begins with excessive quantities of nutrients being discharged into lakes khan et al 2014 and this is one of the greatest stressors for lakes on both regional liang et al 2021 and global scales thackeray and hampton 2020 increasing green lakes requires the development of eutrophication mitigation strategies with the sole focus of monitoring eutrophication in a timely manner as the evaluation of water quality involves the study of phytoplankton biomass and nutrients eutrophication is vital for assessing and understanding the structure and functioning of lake ecosystem yao et al 2018 the trophic state index tsi is commonly adopted by ecosystem scientists and managers to characterize the biogeochemical features of lakes it was created by carlson 1977 and built using trophic parameters such as total phosphorus chlorophyll a and secchi disk depth therefore characterizing the tsi is a common requirement for the monitoring of ecosystem level changes in lakes smith and schindler 2009 the rapid increase in economic growth in china over the past 30 years has come at a huge cost to the environment guo et al 2014 due to its vast territory china contains a variety of different terrains and is characterized by an unbalanced distribution of population and economic wealth cao et al 2014 song et al 2021 the heihe tengchong line represents the fact that 94 of the population lives in the eastern regions of china which are densely populated urbanized economically developed and account for 40 of the landmass of the country cao et al 2014 of the many natural lakes in china 53 are statistically distributed in the qinghai tibet plateau average altitude 4000 m where they are less exposed to anthropogenic activities ma et al 2011 in contrast the eastern region has fewer lakes and high levels of human activity which puts great pressure on the former the eastern lakes provide critical ecological functions including supplying drinking water for residents of the surrounding regions guan et al 2020 thus the protection and sustainable management of the trophic state of eastern lakes using extensive spatial and temporal information is a high priority considering recent degradations of water quality at the beginning of 2020 the novel coronavirus disease covid 19 spread to almost all countries and territories around the globe world health organization 2020 governments quickly imposed a series of strict regulations and most economic activities including factories transportation and lakeside tourist attractions were reduced or stopped askitas et al 2020 bates et al 2020 the resulting lockdowns partially drove changes in human interactions with lakes with some published studies reporting positive effects including reduced air pollutants in china liu et al 2020 reports included a fall in the mean turbidity in the lakes in wuhan of 24 9 sun et al 2021 many international studies reported on the impact of lockdown on surface water quality yunus et al 2020 and air quality mahato and ghosh 2020 etc despite positive results the impacts of a sudden halt in anthropogenic activities on the lake trophic state remain unclear particularly for the eastern lakes in china the ongoing covid 19 lockdown allows for a unique and unprecedented opportunity to gain insights into human eutrophication interactions in aquatic environments traditionally tsi has been determined by combinations of one or more trophic parameters using field and lab methods carlson 1977 these processes including sampling transportation filtration and chemical analyses e g of chlorophyll a chl a and total phosphorus tp are usually labor and time consuming particularly the analyses which require several days and for large or remote lakes with limited accessibility kutser et al 2020 likewise dispersed samples poorly represent the comprehensive trophic state within a lake because of the patchy distribution of nutrients carlson 1977 it is also difficult to carry out monitoring when taking into consideration nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics and the interference of environmental changes on algal blooms duan et al 2014 huang et al 2014 michalak et al 2013 this undoubtedly limits the rapid characterization of tsis in lakes undergoing dynamic variation additionally both fieldwork and laboratory work have been hindered by the imposition of sudden lockdowns due to the covid 19 pandemic more importantly the field lab method is ill suited for large scale e g regional or global monitoring to assess and understand changing mechanisms while also considering anthropogenic activities and climate change to support scientific catchment management nakayama and watanabe 2008 shi et al 2019 these questions have been increasingly supervised through efforts that rely on other methods to characterize trophic state in bodies of water satellite remote sensing is an effective method for rapidly collecting water quality observations kutser et al 2020 several studies have employed different sensors for this purpose including a series of methods to obtain the tsi of lakes li et al 2021 woerd and wernand 2015 1 deriving every trophic indicator including e g chl a secchi disk depth sdd and tp gitelson et al 2008 li et al 2021 and group them into a tsi song et al 2012 2 deriving intermediate indicators including absorption coefficients of optical active substances zhang et al 2018 and correlating them to the tsi and 3 deriving tsi directly shi et al 2019 zhu and mao 2021 respectively however nutrients e g tp have no optical responses which makes it difficult to derive their concentrations babin et al 2003 data are therefore based mostly on the relationships between nutrients and other optical water qualities such as chl a kutser 1997 in addition estimating every trophic indicator or using indirect methods based on intermediate indicators could result in overlapping uncertainties because of the limited precision of every tsi related parameter song et al 2012 previous studies have developed a series of chl a gitelson et al 2008 gower et al 2005 gurlin et al 2011 and sdd binding et al 2007 olmanson et al 2008 however these could not be used as universal models due to the optical complexity of individual lakes establishing a direct relationship between reflectance and tsi can consider a rapid method for evaluating lakes zhu and mao 2021 developed a tsi estimation model using remote sensing for urban waters in gongqingcheng china using 18 sampling sites however this may be insufficient for training a robust model that aims to qualify the trophic state of lakes with transferability and feasibility for other scenes and modalities owing to the dynamic optical complexity of water qualities shi et al 2019 also developed a tsi semi analytical algorithm based on optical properties and applied it to lake taihu china although the semi analytical algorithm showed a good performance its applications were limited to offering different adaptive model parameters varying with different water bodies lee et al 2002 li et al 2016 these results demonstrate the difficulty in applying this method to large scale studies on the trophic state assessment of lakes thus there is a need to develop an effective and rapid way to monitor tsi directly and to use relevant strategies to address multiple environmental stressors in this study a new tsi empirical model was developed considering the need to engage in forward looking and robust algorithms as well as for use under conditions of time pressure namely during the covid 19 lockdowns considering the suitability of the multispectral instrument msi sensor for monitoring water quality with higher radiometric sensitivity and their signal to noise ratios improved accuracy level 1c products were used to evaluate reflectance in this study samples were collected from 45 lakes across china during 2017 2019 the msi aboard sentinel 2 was launched in 2015 and significantly improved the data quality and spectral coverage pahlevan et al 2019 with high spatial 10 20 and 60 m and a revisit time of 3 5 days meanwhile the sensor can derive physical and chemical compositions using empirical models owing to narrow 10 nm spectral bands in the optical domain 380 780 nm toming et al 2016 this model was applied to the eastern region of china which has fewer lakes and a large population that puts high levels of pressure on them guan et al 2020 because the impacts of sudden changes in anthropogenic activities on the lake trophic state remain unclear we took advantage of the rare field conditions arising from the covid 19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns to gain insights into human eutrophication interactions in this region of china using our novel tsi empirical model designed for use in large scale observation studies and under time pressure based on the measurements and remote sensing data our goal was three fold 1 to evaluate the trophic parameters of lakes across china using in situ measurements 2 to establish an empirical model for tsi estimations using sentinel 2 msi imagery data 3 to map the tsi of eastern lakes 100 km2 and evaluate their spatiotemporal variations during the covid 19 pandemic 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site china has the highest population in the world approximately 1 4 billion and the fourth largest area 9 6 million square kilometers by size gelfand 2019 physio graphically the chinese mainland has been divided into three zones high average altitude 4000 m middle average altitude 1000 2000 and low average altitude 500 m from west to east the editorial committee of chinese physical geography of the chinese academy of sciences 1980 these regional differences result in significantly diverse climatic geographical geological and economic development distributions as demonstrated by the gross domestic product gdp of the country fig 1 cao et al 2014 sun and chai 1998 the gapbetween theeastand the westis still a prominent feature of china although somefavorablepolicies have been enacted by the government hu huanyong first mapped the population distribution of china in 1935 it was originally known as the heihe tengchong line or hu s line this line runs from heihe city to tengchong county bounded by hu s line 94 of china s population lives on the eastern region which visually demonstrates the starkness of the unbalanced population distribution in the country it provides a basic measurement of the economic development of china that is recognized by the government and social science practitioners in the country the distinct phylogeographical breaks highlighted by hu s line has also been documented in previous studies on biogeographical divides luo et al 2021 urbanization fang and lin 2009 and population dynamics chen and ye 2007 among others in our model the region east of the heihe tengchong line was used to map tsi 3 research design a flowchart of the research process is shown in fig 2 in step 1 we collected samples from lakes to measure water quality and to conduct atmospheric corrections of the satellite images used in this study in step 2 the tsi was calculated in situ and randomly divided into a calibration dataset 70 287 lake samples and validation dataset 30 144 lake samples in matlab 14 0 in step 3 we calibrated and validated the tsi empirical models with single band or band combinations using multiple linear regression in spss 17 0 in step 4 we evaluated their performance considering the regression coefficient fitting slope and errors and used our findings to establish the tsi model in step 5 the resulting tsi model was used to map the distributions of the trophic state of lakes in the study region the tsi values were calculated from mapped pixels within a lake to represent the trophic state 3 1 data collection 3 1 1 in situ sampling process efforts were made to collect samples from lakes with different trophic state and biogeochemical backgrounds a total of 431 samples from 45 lakes were collected from 2016 to 2019 among which some were sampled once and others were sampled frequently table s2 these in situ water samples were previously published by song et al 2020 and li et al 2021 as well as in unpublished eutrophication research using machine learning algorithms samples were taken from approximately 0 5 m below the surface of the water covering as much of the surface of the lakes as possible the samples were immediately stored in a portable refrigerator 4 c and delivered to the laboratory within 2 3 days the secchi disk depth sdd was determined using a black and white disk 3 1 2 multispectral instrument imagery the sentinel 2 satellite with a multispectral instrument msi sensor was launched in 2015 with 12 bands table s3 the msi level 1c product of the sentinel satellite can be freely downloaded from the european space agency esa website first 210 scenes of cloud free images for 7 days covering the relevant lakes were required to extract the reflectance and further build a tsi model second the trophic state of 35 lakes with areas 100 km2 across eastern china were mapped and evaluated using the tsi model developed in this study a total of 148 cloud free images covering mapped lakes were acquired it should be noted that we selected the images from march april 2020 and october november 2019 covering these 35 lakes to map trophic state with the derived tsi model tsi maps of lakes were constructed using envi 5 3 and arcgis 10 3 software 3 2 data analysis 3 2 1 laboratory analysis of water quality parameters in the laboratory the concentrations of chl a were measured using a uv 2600pc spectrophotometer shimadzu kyoto japan and total phosphorus tp concentrations were determined using a continuous flow analyzer skalar san plus system the netherlands apha awwa wef 1998 further details can be found in the studies by song et al 2020 and li et al 2021 in addition we used the modified carlson s trophic state to calculate the tsi with three levels carlson 1977 table s1 eutrophic 50 tsi 100 mesotrophic 30 tsi 50 and oligotrophic tsi 30 using eq 1 4 supplementary data 3 2 2 atmospheric correction of msi imagery case 2 regional coast color c2rcc atmospheric correction processor in sentinel application platform snap version 7 0 0 developed by esa was used for atmospheric correction it can be used to transfer the bottom of atmospheric reflectance of level 1c product to normalized water leaving reflectance at 443 492 560 665 704 and 740 nm rhown in snap c2rcc uses artificial neural networks to process 550 000 entries of simulated data generated by hydrolight simulations and a bio optical model doerffer and schiller 2007 the performance of the c2rcc processor has been evaluated in previous studies warren et al 2019 li et al 2021 in the present study a 3 3 pixel 30 m 30 m centered reflectance was used and band 1 6 were used to represent rhown λ 3 2 3 statistical analyses and accuracy assessment of tsi model statistical analyses including descriptive statistics correlation correlation coefficient r regression regression coefficient r2 and one way anova analyses significance levels p 0 05 were conducted using spss software version 16 0 statistical program for social science chicago il usa the mean normalized error mae and root mean square error rmse were used to assess the performance of the tsi model as described by li et al 2021 4 results 4 1 in situ measured water qualities the average value of chl a concentrations from in situ measured lakes was 7 56 11 28 µg l 1 with a chl a concentration ranging from 0 13 to 100 0 µg l 1 table s2 the mean sdd of the lakes was 1 6 1 5 m with a range of 0 17 9 47 m overlapping with the sdd results reported by song et al 2020 in terms of nutrient tp concentration the average value was 0 16 0 42 mg l 1 with a range of 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 these tsi results indicate that the quality of lake water collected from across china showed the lakes to be mostly eutrophic fig 3 4 2 the empirical tsi model multiple linear regression was used to test all possible band ratios and determine correlated relationships between spectral band ratios in situ tsi was used to determine some sensitive combinations ratios for band 2 band 6 band 3 band 5 band 4 band 5 and bands 4 5 and 1 were significantly associated with tsi table s4 in addition empirical models based on these sensitive band combinations with two or more variables achieved regression coefficients of determination r2 0 77 for the calibration dataset of these models the combination of bands 4 5 and 1 played an important role in correlations with tsi where r2 values were higher than 0 80 for the calibration dataset the combinations of band 4 and band 5 did the same in particular our trial analysis showed that for the validation dataset the empirical regression model based on bands 4 5 and 1 performed the best r2 0 60 fig 4 with relatively small errors rmse 7 36 mae 6 25 contrasting band 4 and band 5 combinations as follows 1 tsi 34 04 band 4 b a n d 5 1 114 band 1 b a n d 4 97 376 this model could also be used with bands 4 5 and 1 to map the tsi of the eastern lakes to assess the eutrophic state of the lakes studied 4 3 trophic state assessment of eastern lakes 100 km2 the trophic state of 35 lakes with areas 100 km2 across eastern china was evaluated using our derived tsi model figs 5 6 and table s5 because the eutrophication state of these lakes was space dependent the tsi values within a lake were averaged considering the representativeness when the standard deviation was less than the average values for every lake table s5 as a result eutrophic lakes accounted for 77 14 97 14 80 00 and 94 28 of the lakes sample in spring 2019 autumn 2019 spring 2020 and autumn 2020 respectively fig 5a indicating that most of the eastern lakes had a tsi 50 fig 5b despite the imposition of a covid 19 lockdown these results indicate that there was no significant improvement in lake eutrophication in spring 2020 compared to spring 2019 fig s1 a decrease in the number of eutrophic lakes was only observed in autumn 2020 compared to 2019 notably the tsis and sd from lakes located in northeast china were steadily eutrophic and lakes distributed in the reaches of the yangtze river were significantly variable fig 6e h only one lake fuxian lake located in the yungui plateau was characterized by an oligotrophic state both in autumn 2019 and 2020 similarly significant differences were observed in the seasonal variations f 8 57 p 0 01 and spatial variations associated with their environmental backgrounds we compared the seasonal differences for the tsi values within a lake and found that the tsi was stable with low sd in autumn ranges 0 3 11 12 in 2019 and 0 47 7 35 in 2020 compared to spring 0 41 14 in 2019 and 0 5 15 5 in 2020 5 discussion 5 1 new empirical tsi model in response to the rare field conditions arising from the covid 19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns a new tsi empirical model was developed based on the msi based satellite images to conduct a long term study of lake eutrophication instead of a traditional monitoring and early warning of trophic state this unified model was tested for eastern lakes 100 km2 during lockdowns to understand the evolution prospects of lakes with reduced anthropogenic activities our study provides a new empirical tsi model 1 using sentinel 2 remote sensing data to quantify the trophic state rapidly figs 4 5 this model was calibrated and validated using in situ data across china which could have large scale applicability and robustness compared to previous studies huang et al 2014 shi et al 2019 our method can be used to avoid the need for traditional time and labor consuming measurements the traditional field lab method limits the availability of water quality for analysis in spatiotemporal applications meanwhile we found that the blue red green red red red edge and blue red combinations could be sensitive to the tsi considering the significant performance r2 0 77 fig 4 the results showed an increase in the r2 value r2 0 80 of the calibration datasets with red and red edge combinations fig 4c and d the validation results also indicated an improvement error rmse 7 36 mape 6 25 this result was in line with that reported by an earlier study kutser et al 1994 wherein a variety of band combinations including band ratio original band values and base line were used to establish the relationship between water quality and remotely sensed signals which affected the strength of applications it is important to note that for our tsi models these sensitive bands were synthesized bands they were blue red green red and red red edges it was also not surprising that the tsi was calculated as a compressive result reflecting phytoplankton biomass chl a turbidity suspended matter sdd and nutrients although there were no systematic optical responses to tsi as a function of the trophic state some sensitive bands confirmed by independent trophic parameters could support the estimation of tsi song et al 2020 applied red blue and red green combinations to build a universal sdd model with a large number of lake datasets n 2032 these studies have attempted to build relationships between water quality and inherent optical properties which have an impact on reflectance gordon et al 1988 hence most algorithms for trophic parameters employ band combinations to amplify their spectral characteristics although reflectance is comprised of the inherent optical properties of water qualities related to the trophic state it is also related to light field conditions lee et al 2002 in this study sentinel 2 msi data with multi spatial resolution resampled 10 m and time windows of 7 days were used likewise a c2rcc atmospheric correction processor based on the bio optical model and radiative transfer equation was used to extract the normalized leaving water reflectance warren et al 2019 pahlevan et al 2019 toming et al 2016 the results showed that red blue and red red edges can be used as a suitable proxy for estimating tsi we aimed to reduce the dependence of every trophic parameter to determine the trophic state index using a cost effective empirical model for large scale applications 5 2 lake eutrophication of eastern lakes many efforts have been devoted to qualifying the trophic state index of lake eutrophication carlson 1977 dodds et al 1998 khan et al 2014 huang et al 2014 shi et al 2019 sheela et al 2011 approaches to classify the trophic levels have been proposed using combinations of water column variables including phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter cunha et al 2013 the tsi serves as a widely recognized as an acceptable paradigm of trophic state via the organization and grouping of these parameters and is used as a decision making strategy by lake managers zhang et al 2018 in general based on our in situ observations from lake samples the majority of the sampled lakes were eutrophic and mesotrophic with tsi values 30 fig 3 these results were not surprising because of the intrinsic economic and population gap between the eastern and western regions of china fig 1 in terms of the tp 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 and chl a 0 13 100 0 µg l 1 concentration the average values were 0 16 0 42 mg l 1 and 7 56 11 28 µg l 1 indicating that water qualities are provided with highly spatially information the nutrient levels in our measured lakes were significantly higher than those in lake erie stow et al 2015 lake balaton hatvani et al 2014 and saginaw bay steinman et al 2012 as a result it needs to be emphasized that chinese lakes are facing serious eutrophication and regional differences fig 3 lake eutrophication is the main factor affecting the degradation of lake ecosystems khan and ansari 2005 for most developed regions in china eastern lake catchments are subject to intensive human activities cao et al 2017 and provide critical ecological functions guan et al 2020 in addition this region contains numerous lakes with highly changed suspended matter levels e g poyang lake and dongting lake and phytoplankton production e g taihu lake considering the ecosystem service function of eastern lakes we selected eastern lakes 100 km2 divided by hu s line to which we applied our tsi model and evaluated their trophic state consistent with our in situ observations the application of our tsi model to eastern lakes area 100 km2 demonstrated serious levels of eutrophication in line with previous studies fig 5 duan et al 2014 the trophic state in different lakes at times within a single lake varied greatly spatially and resulted in large standard deviations fig 6e h this demonstrated the significant seasonal variations f 8 57 p 0 01 and spatial distributions associated with the environmental backgrounds of the lakes under study overall lake eutrophication is subject to rainfall wind speed aquaculture and agricultural fertilizer leaching from lake catchments to illustrate this further for the eastern lakes 100 km2 investigated in this study the proportion of eutrophic lakes was larger in autumn 94 28 than in spring 77 14 fig 5a this indicates that seasonal variations include increased temperature and a rather large proportional contribution of nutrient loadings due to the seasonality of hydrological forces wind and river flow and phytoplankton development yin 2002 wind and river flow may play an important role in carrying nutrient loadings impacted by human activities into lakes nõges et al 2007 for instance some lakes such as dongting lake and poyang lake in the yangtze river floodplain are of oxbow or riverine types with an average residence time of 30 days whereas the isolated taihu lake has an average of 310 days wang dou 1998 likewise lake characteristics such as water depth and soil type can cause additional eutrophication kong and gao 2005 pierson et al 2003 for example for shallow lakes in the eastern region above 5 m wind could resuspend sediment and release nutrients into the overlying water shallow lakes with a small storage capacity were subject to conditions that were favorable to eutrophication e g warm water temperature and dynamic nutrients compared to deeper lakes in comparison only one lake fuxian in the yungui plateau was characterized by an oligotrophic state tsi 30 in autumn fig 7 d fuxian lake is one of the deepest lake in southwest china with an average depth of 87 m cui and wang 2009 allowing it to have a large storage capacity and self purifying abilities nutrient sources are mainly the result of anthropogenic activities including aquaculture sewerage soil nutrients and loss of fertilizers in drained agricultural lands paerl et al 2011 as a result the nutrient and trophic state indices showed higher values in these lakes based on the trophic results of spatial patterns addressing eutrophication issues requires a better understanding of the complex effects caused by interactions between anthropogenic activities climate and lake characteristics 5 3 current covid 19 perspective for lake eutrophication 100 km2 a new acute respiratory disease coronavirus disease covid 19 spread globally at the beginning of 2020 and continues to spread today world health organization 2020 as a result many countries have implemented various emergency policies to limit the spread of the virus including lockdowns and isolation askitas et al 2020 bates et al 2020 anthropogenic activities such as factories and lakeside tourist attractions have been shut down in an attempt to reduce transmission yunus et al 2020 our results indicate that the decrease in numerous pollutants in lakes including nutrients from terrestrial inputs was the main driving force for eutrophication sun et al 2021 reported that the turbidity of lakes in wuhan changed from 33 4 ntu to 25 1 ntu after the lockdown yunus et al 2020 also reported that the concentration of suspended particulate matter in vembanad lake also decreased during the lockdown period these findings suggest that a sudden lockdown reduces anthropogenic activities in lake ecosystems by minimizing nutrient inputs patel et al 2020 huang et al 2020 it is interesting to note that for the lakes studied herein 100 km2 figs 4 5 no significant improvement was observed in lake eutrophication after the halt of anthropic activities due to the lockdown in spring 2020 compared to spring 2019 fig s1 these results can be observed in liangzihu lake from mesotrophic in may 2019 to eutrophic in may 2020 and nvshan lake from eutrophic in may 2019 to mesotrophic in may 2020 recognizing that over 94 of the chinese population lives in eastern watersheds competing for water use including potable water irrigation needs for agriculture despite several months of the curfew lockdown period from january 2020 onwards eutrophication still has a significant negative impact on lake ecosystems particularly when coupled with unfavorable hydrological processes for liangzi lake fig s1 many outlets ditches input agricultural nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and wastewater from surrounding villages into the lake via runoff or rainfall fan et al 2016 xiong et al 2008 found that the nutrient and organic matter pollution levels in sediments were higher than those in eastern lakes considering the recent decades of economic development the enriched nutrients that accumulate in sediments nakayama and watanabe 2008 can be characterized as autochthonous sources of lake eutrophication berthold et al 2019 demonstrated that sediments could accelerate the progress of lake eutrophication via the enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus our results also illustrated that from a long term perspective the nutrients from sediment catchment remain a serious environmental issue for eutrophication in large scale observations duan et al 2014 michalak et al 2013 taken together these results indicate that the improvement of eutrophication by minimizing anthropogenic activities could be a long term solution 5 4 implications for remote sensing of tsi we recommended the use of msi sentinel 2 data to qualify and evaluate the trophic state of lakes with full 13 spectral bands a spatial resolution of 10 60 m in most of the visible and all of the nir bands and a temporal resolution of 3 5 days revisit time drusch et al 2012 msi sentinel 2 and operational land imager oli landsat have a similar design that offers even more spectral measurements within the near infrared band msi demonstrated that additional spectral bands and high spatial resolution are advantageous over optically complex inland waters kutser et al 2016 thus msi has the potential to provide eutrophic information for lake monitoring at regional and global scales pahlevan et al 2017 for retrieving tsi chl a follows wavelength dependent bands lyu et al 2015 sdd could be related to the scattering spectra of spm suspended particulate matter and tp has no optical response making it difficult to differentiate them using solely their optical properties based on the empirical relationships between reflectance and tsi band combinations are able to characterize the trophic state rapidly in comparison to traditional independent retrieves of trophic parameters hence our analysis and results include a large dataset that covers the large variability of water quality the tsi model can be applicable for most lakes with similar ranges of eutrophic parameters as those found in this study chl a 0 13 100 0 µg l 1 tp 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 sdd 0 17 9 47 m according to verpoorter et al 2014 there are over 11 7 million bodies of water 0 2 ha most of which are accessible with the requirements of global inventory the trophic state evaluation records are not available making it difficult to conduct large scale trend analyses olmanson et al 2008 song et al 2020 as mentioned above a new tsi model was developed with which to evaluate the trophic state of lakes which is particularly pertinent considering the marked effects of climate change in recent years this model allows for the identification of appropriate algorithms with which to qualify the trophic state of water bodies via satellite remote sensing mccullough et al 2012 5 5 limitation and future perpectives the red band e g 665 nm and red edge band e g 704 nm were demonstrated to be capable of quantifying tsi in this study as a synthetic parameter tsi was calculated using chl a sdd and tp and chl a was provided with maximum weighted matching carlson 1977 hence the band combinations responding to synthetic tsi showed a greater spectral configuration consistency of chl a considering satellite sensors than in previous studies chl a algorithms gitelson et al 2008 gower et al 2005 gurlin et al 2011 the tsi model can be applied to similar sensors to produce records of tsi variations and can be used to compare more traditional ocean color missions e g modis olci and meris likewise the machine learning algorithms based on computer technology and statistical learning theory have successfully improved the accuracy of water quality models in recent years cao et al 2020 li et al 2021 both the empirical and machine learning tsi model required a highly calibrated dataset including high nutrients 2 50 mg l 1 and chl a concentrations 100 µg l 1 considering the machine learning algorithms the extensive field lab materials with complex source variations from different lakes will be required for the formation of robust agreements especially in regions subject to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and industry nevertheless we aim to provide technical operations and national scale tsi products which should then prompt more targeted validation efforts and driving factors analysis particularly in large spatial scale lake observations the strong relationships between tsi or other eutrophic indexes to qualify trophic state and several trophic state defining parameters should be also studied in future in a broader perspective our ambition for future work is to provide an immediate solution to the uptake of sensor products in a wider range of lakes which should then prompt more analysis responding to rapid urbanization effects and warming temperature 6 conclusions recognizing that the traditional field lab approach has limited temporal and spatial heterogeneity for estimating the trophic state index of lakes we aimed to provide a new unified model based on band combination through the development and validation of in situ measurements we assessed the trophic parameters of samples collected in situ from 45 productive lakes and used normalized water leaving reflectance acquired with sentinel 2a b msi images and a c2rcc processor to calibrate and validate our model trophic parameters included the concentrations of sdd 0 17 9 47 m tp 0 003 2 17 mg l 1 and chl a 0 13 100 0 µg l 1 the unified model was combined with msi reflectance data to obtain a snapshot of tsi in lakes 100 km2 in eastern china between 2019 and 2020 at a time when local and national lockdowns were imposed due to covid 19 the mapping results demonstrated that 77 of the eastern lakes 100 km2 were eutrophic notable our results confirmed that eutrophication was not improved during lockdowns in response to the covid 19 pandemic this suggests that more attention should be paid to nutrients or pollution via soil or sediment around lakes our novel empirical tsi model eq 1 was used to characterize the trophic state index both spatially and temporally and showed promising results for use in large scale study scenarios wishing to determine the trophic state of lakes this model shows potential for use as an efficient alternative tool for the monitoring of eutrophication and a guide to be used by lake managers to assess possible solutions such as mitigating

3473,flash drought fd is an extreme event causing severe impacts on ecosystems and agriculture due to its fast velocity of evolution and high frequency here we develop a voxel based three dimensional fd v3dfd method to track the spatio temporal dynamics of fd based on the soil moisture sm decline method proposed by yuan et al 2019 the key idea of v3dfd is that fd is identified in terms of the connectivity of drought voxels i e cubes with width length and height representing latitude longitude and time respectively in 3d space instead of directly forming the drought events by merging drought clusters the v3dfd is systematically evaluated and compared with the commonly used 3d severity area duration sad method in four provinces in china guangdong gd guangxi gx guizhou gz and yunnan yn results show that v3dfd can better reflect the dynamic development and recovery of fd events compared with sad regional analyses indicate that fd occurs more frequent with a larger intensity and longer duration in gd and gx than yn and gz the onset terminal of fd in yn occurs mostly in april may april june the onset of fd in gx and gd is scattered at the intra annual scale but the terminal occurs mostly in november in addition the first fd event in a year is mostly located during april may in yn and gz while the last fd event of a year occurs mostly during october november in gx and gd keywords flash drought soil moisture deficit flash drought identification space time characteristics 1 introduction drought is one of the most serious global natural disasters causing severe impacts on the ecosystems agriculture and socio economic activities wang et al 2014 schwalm et al 2017 song et al 2020 edwards et al 2019 china meteorological data service center cmdsc reported that the drought area is about 21 6 million hectares per year from 1949 to 1999 in china and the drought events account for 60 of the total number of meteorological disasters nearly 10 billion kilograms of crop have been lost annually due to drought from 1949 to 1999 in china cmdsc 2011 drought is traditionally recognized as a slowly developing process which can last for several years chen et al 2019 she and xia 2018 su et al 2020 wilhite et al 2007 recently a new type of rapidly developing drought the flash drought fd svoboda et al 2002 has attracted much research attention li et al 2020a yuan et al 2019 zhang and yuan 2020 fd events can develop rapidly and may have greater negative impacts than traditional drought such as large agricultural yield losses high deteriorations in vegetation health strong shortage of short term water resources and high vulnerability of global food supply boyer et al 2013 christian et al 2019a christian et al 2019b otkin et al 2015a otkin et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 zhang and yuan 2020 for example a severe fd occurred in central usa in 2012 caused disastrous impacts on water resources and agricultural production and received considerable attention from the united states government agencies and academia basara et al 2019 pendergrass et al 2020 svoboda et al 2002 was the first to introduce the fd concept i e a type of rapidly intensifying drought caused by the short term dryness and strong heatwaves for explaining the crop deterioration phenomenon various metrics based on actual evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet have been proposed to identify fd occurrence for example the satellite derived evaporative stress index esi otkin et al 2013 the rapid change index rci otkin et al 2015a b the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr christian et al 2019a christian et al 2019b and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi li et al 2020a recently some advances were made to identify fd occurrence using the soil moisture sm and meteorological factors mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 identified the heatwave and precipitation pre deficit fd in us based on the anomalies of sm pre et and temperature t at the pentad 5 day scale the identification scheme of fd by mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 were based on the hard thresholding rule i e the occurrence of fd is simply determined by judging the anomalies of the given climate factors are larger or less than their individually preset constant thresholds which has the two limitations of without considering the possibility that fd event can temporally occur at two sequential pentads and the inability to characterize the rapid development of fd wang and yuan 2018 identified the fd occurrence over china based on the positive t and et anomalies and sm deficit different from mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 they focused on the fd events occurred across a set of pentads i e a series of short term heat extremes instead of the event covering only one single pentad more recently yuan et al 2019 developed a new fd identification method by considering the decreasing sm from the 40th to the 20th percentile with a pentad average decline rate 5 in percentile the method of yuan et al 2019 overcomes those two limitations of mo and lettenmaier 2015 as mentioned above since it considered the rapid rate of fd intensification overcoming limitation b and the persistence of fd event overcoming limitation a most previous drought assessment studies were conducted either on the temporal evolution of drought characteristics one dimensional 1d at a specific spatial scale e g guo et al 2020 nabaei et al 2019 wu et al 2017 or at the spatial patterns of drought two dimensional 2d during a given study period e g patel et al 2007 xu et al 2018 these studies however neglected the three dimensionally evolutional processes of drought in both the two dimensions in space and one dimension in time the three dimensional 3d based drought identification can enhance the understanding of the internal mechanisms and external forcing of drought evolutions lloyd hughes 2012 to date only few works are available on the 3d drought identification andreadis et al 2005 proposed the severity area duration sad method for tracking the spatio temporal variations of drought based on the merging of two temporally sequential drought clusters according to minimum overlapping area the sad method has been applied to characterize meteorological drought sm agricultural drought and hydrologic drought at the regional andreadis et al 2005 li et al 2020a wang et al 2011 zhu et al 2019 continental guo et al 2018 lloyd hughes 2012 and global guo et al 2018 herrera estrada et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 scales recently zhou et al 2019 identified the meteorological droughts in the poyang lake basin china by using a 3d drought migration tracking method similarly diaz et al 2019 2020a b developed a spatial drought tracking algorithm s track to identify the trajectory of drought different from the sad method these methods merge two drought clusters by the euclidean distance between the geometric centroids zhou et al 2019 or by both the euclidean distance and their individual area diaz et al 2019 diaz et al 2020a diaz et al 2020b instead of the overlapping area considered in andreadis et al 2005 despite significant advances have been made in 3d drought identification there are still some disadvantages in these existing 3d methods first the drought identification is accompanied with uncertainty because the determination process of the successive drought clusters belonging to the same drought event is concept dependent for example andreadis et al 2005 and xu et al 2015b calculated the overlapping area between continuous time slices of each drought cluster to judge whether to split or connect each of them which may cause misjudgment when multiple clusters exist in the adjacent time steps second the drought patches i e a set of spatially connected grids satisfying the given drought identification criteria smaller than 1 6 of the study area were removed in the drought identifying process xu et al 2015b which may disrupt the continuity of drought events and is difficult to capture the development and recovery of droughts third either only one diaz et al 2020b or no more than two zhou et al 2019 drought patches in each time step are counted which is appropriate only for a small area but can introduce non negligible errors in tracking drought events over a relatively large area the present study aims to develop a voxel based 3d fd v3dfd method to identify the occurrence of fd events on the basis of the sm decline method proposed by yuan et al 2019 here the terminology voxel represents a cube whose width length and height represent latitude longitude and time respectively the key idea of v3dfd is that fd is identified in terms of the connectivity of drought voxels in 3d space instead of directly forming the drought events by merging drought clusters or patches from different time steps hence this new method no longer requires any efforts in collecting clusters or patches in this study v3dfd is applied to the typical drought prone regions in southern and southwestern china encompassing 4 provinces of guangdong gd guangxi gx guizhou gz and yunnan yn the objectives here are to 1 test the proposed new v3dfd method in tracking the spatial temporal variations of fd events by comparing with the previous 1d yuan et al 2019 and sad andreadis et al 2005 methods and 2 explore the spatial and temporal evolutions of fd characteristics in the selected yn gz gx and gd drought prone regions the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces

southwest china 97 31 e 117 19 e and 20 13 n 29 15 n see fig 1 includes four provinces gd gx gz and yn the study region has large areas of rugged terrain and exhibits large variability in elevations

climate zone southern yn and southern gd tropical climate zone with the mean annual pre decreasing from 2000 mm along the southern coast in gd and gx to 700 mm in the northwest and northeast of yn liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 due to anthropogenic warming caused by rapid urbanization expansion drought hazards have become more frequently over the study region over the past two decades in these

identification the 1d fd events are identified at the grid scales based on the method of yuan et al 2019 hereafter as 1d method taking the fd identification at a grid point as an example the main steps of the 1d method are i calculation of the sm percentile smp for each pentad during a period of interest ii extraction of the smp series where the first smp is 40th the last smp is 20th and all other smp are 40th see a in the step 1 in fig 2 and iii elimination of the smp series with a duration of 3 pentads see c in step 1 in fig 2 or with the average decreasing rate of smp δ s m p 5 see b in the step 1 in fig 2 the above abbreviations of the variables are listed in table a1 in appendix a one can refer to this table for convenience 3 2 v3dfd framework the framework of v3dfd is illustrated in fig 2 there are generally three steps of workflows 1 extraction of fd voxel 2 identification of fd events and 3 evaluation of fd characteristics as detailed in the following 1 extraction of fd voxel we first identify the fd events in the 3d coordinates xi yi n with their basic components cubes termed as the fd voxels step 1 in fig 2 here x and y represent the latitude and longitude of the geometric center of voxel n is the index of the pentad used as the time coordinate ranging from 1 to n 1d n 1d is the number of pentads for the 1d fd events extracted by the method of yuan et al 2019 which is also denoted as the 1d fd duration 2 identification of 3d fd events identification of the 3d fd event is the core part of the v3dfd framework including the three components construction separation and elimination of fd objects see the bold labels in fig 2 construction of original fd event according to the connectivity of fd voxels in the 3d space we first construct the original 3d fd event as a collection of fd voxels where at least one side of each member is connected with another fig 2 the original 3d fd event may contain two or more adjacent fd events or it does not contain any events that meet the rules given in the separation of fd event and elimination of fd event in fig 2 the latter condition indicates that no any fd event can be identified based on the original 3d fd event separation of fd event based on the construction of original 3d fd event we design two rules to determinate whether the original event should be divided into two events the separation of the original 3d fd event contains two parts part i and part ii see fig 2 corresponding to two different rules a slice of an event is defined as a transection associated with a fixed pentad of the 3d fd event see fig 3 let a n here 1 n n 3d 1 and a n 1 denote the areas of slices n and n 1 respectively where n 3d is the number of pentads for the original 3d fd events according to li et al 2020a the first separation rule is that the overlapping area ao n between a n and a n 1 see the deep red and transparent blue slices as the n and n 1th slices respectively in fig 3 should be greater than half of their minimum i e min a n a n 1 if satisfied then move forward to next slice if not then separate the event into two events using the interface between the slices n and n 1 see the separation of fd event part i in fig 2 it is clearly shown in fig 3 that the overlapping area ao n between two slices is less than half of the area of transparent blue slice and hence a separation process should be carried out implementing the first separation rule with n changing from 1 to n 3d 1 yields a total of j j 1 fd events here ssmp n 1 n n 3d j 1 and ssmp n 1 denote the averages of sm percentile over the slices n and n 1 respectively where n 3d j is the total number of pentads of the j th 1 j j fd event before the second separation rule we filter out the j th event in the case that the time length i e duration n 3d j is 3 pentads yuan et al 2019 following yuan et al 2019 the second separation rule is that if ssmp n 20 and ssmp n 1 20 then separate the j th event into two events by the interface between the slices n and n 1 if not then move forward to the next slice see separation of fd event part ii in fig 2 for each event looping the second separation rule from n equal to 1 to n 3d j 1 yields a total of k k 1 fd events elimination of fd event the fd events obtained by the previous steps may be associated with the short duration and low affected area in this part we eliminate the k th 1 k k event among the k events which is separated from the j th event among the j events based on the criteria that either the fd affected area is 1 6 of the study area li et al 2020a xu et al 2015a 2015b or its time length n 3d j k i e duration is 3 pentads yuan et al 2019 in this study the fd affected area is computed as the percentage of projection area of a fd event to the whole study area for each original fd event looping over k and j yields the final fd events 3 evaluation of 3d fd characteristics in addition to duration and affected area several other fd characteristics are also used in this study the fd frequency is defined as the average number of fd events identified per decade at each grid the severity is the sum of sm deficit relative to the 40th percentile of sm for all fd voxels during a fd event the fd intensity is the ratio of severity to duration the fd centroid associated with the coordinates longitude latitude time is the geometrical center of a fd event the slice centroid is defined as the geometrical center of the slice the centroids for the beginning and ending slices of a fd event are used to quantify the displacement between the beginning and ending positions of the fd event note that all the above characteristics are identified for the 3d fd event while the fd frequency is also suitable for the 1d fd event we compare the v3dfd framework with the sad method here as it is the most popular 3d approach for drought identification andreadis et al 2005 xu et al 2015a to this end we consider the fd voxels after the extraction fig 2 as the input data to the sad method in addition to the design rules to construct the 3d drought event proposed by andreadis et al 2005 and xu et al 2015a the separation and elimination of the fd events with the duration 3 pentads are also added to the sad method 3 3 maximal information coefficient the maximal information coefficient mic is a powerful measure of the correlation between the paired variables reshef et al 2011 with a wide range of applications in biological science koren et al 2012 and medicine lyu et al 2017 here mic is used to detect the relations between the paired 3d fd characteristics according to reshef et al 2011 the formula of mic can be expressed as 1 mic max m m r c 2 r 2 c and r c b n where r and c are the positive integers b l is a function of l expressed as b l l 0 6 l is the data length m is the characteristic matrix with the elements m r c which is the highest normalized mutual information obtained by any r c grid discretizing the scatterplot of two fd characteristics the m r c is expressed as follows reshef et al 2011 2 m r c i r c log min r c where i r c represents the highest mutual information over a grid resolution of r c a larger mic corresponds to a higher degree of information overlap indicating a strong relation between the paired variables in this study the mic value between the paired fd characteristics is obtained using the minepy package provided in albanese et al 2012 3 4 mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator we use the non parametric mann kendall m k test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 to analyze the trends of meteorological variables pre maxt rhu win and et at the 5 significance level p 0 05 the m k test has the advantages of being independent of any kind of probability distribution and interference from a few outliers while the sen s slope estimator can estimate the trend magnitudes of data series available without resorting to any parameters these two methods have been widely employed to analyze the trend significances and estimate the trend magnitudes in the hydrometeorological time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 hu et al 2021 mekonen and berlie 2020 she et al 2017 wu et al 2016 2018 xu et al 2018 4 results 4 1 comparison of v3dfd versus 1d and sad methods fig 4 shows the distributions of fd frequency obtained by using the 1d fig 4a sad fig 4b and v3dfd fig 4c methods as well as the differences of fd frequency between the 1d and v3dfd fig 4d and between the sad and v3dfd methods fig 4e as seen the three methods show generally similar spatial variabilities of fd frequency that is gd has the apparently higher frequency than yn and gz however the frequency of the 1d method is higher than that of v3dfd over most study regions fig 4d mainly due to that the 1d method is implemented on a single grid and fails to consider the spatio temporal connectivity of the fd events in contrast the frequency of the sad method is smaller than that of v3dfd in some parts of gz and gx fig 4e likely associated with that the patches with the affected area 1 6 of the study area were removed by the sad method fig 5 compares the probability density functions pdfs of fd duration fig 5a severity fig 5b and intensity fig 5c obtained by using v3dfd and sad over study regions as shown the pdf of fd duration by v3dfd is generally fatter than that by sad this is because the patches with affected area 1 6 is eliminated in sad resulting in the erroneous identification of the growth or recovery of fd events and ultimately a shortened duration the distribution of severity is nearly the same for two methods fig 5b however the pdf of intensity by sad is slightly larger than that by v3dfd fig 5c table 1 summarizes the statistics standard deviation maximum median minimum upper quartile and lower quartile of fd characteristics i e fd duration severity and intensity obtained by the v3dfd and sad methods respectively the results show that v3dfd 285 identifies more fd events than sad 275 the variability i e standard deviation of duration by v3dfd is significantly larger than that by sad in contrast the variability of severity and intensity by v3dfd tends to be smaller than that by sad furthermore the number of fd events with duration 12 pentads i e the maximum fd duration defined in li et al 2020a and 18 pentads i e 3 month scale representing the seasonal drought identified by v3dfd are 70 and 31 respectively which are significantly larger than those identified by sad 48 and 9 respectively fig 6 compares the fd events in 2010 as well as the spatial distributions of severity in grids identified by v3dfd fig 6a and c and sad fig 6b and d methods respectively as shown both methods can identify three fd events in 2010 fig 6a and b but the geometrics of fd events identified by v3dfd are obviously different from that identified by sad specifically the early parts of fd events identified by sad are missing compared with that by v3dfd the difference can be attributed to that sad eliminates the patches or fd voxels during the early development of fd event when the affected area of each patch is 1 6 of the study area this is also supported by fig 6c and d showing that the v3dfd identifies large severity in the eastern gz and southern yn while the sad identifies large severity only in the eastern gz furthermore the severity by v3dfd is larger than that by sad in the eastern gz 4 2 variability of fd characteristic in space and time 4 2 1 spatial variability by using the v3dfd method the spatial variabilities of fd characteristics i e fd duration severity intensity and affected area over the study regions are explored fig 7 displays the spatial distributions of fd duration severity intensity and affected area over the study regions during the period 1953 2013 the points represent the centroid locations it can be seen that the large fd duration is located mainly in the eastern gx and western gd while the large fd severity intensity and affected area are concentrated in the northeast gx overall the fd characteristics are smaller in gz than that in other regions table 2 lists the mic and correlation coefficient r between the paired fd characteristics over the study regions during 1953 2013 the r between all paired characteristics is positive demonstrating the positive correlations among the fd characteristics analyzed particularly strong correlations r 0 74 among severity intensity and affected area and weak correlations 0 03 0 69 between duration and other fd characteristics especially between duration and intensity can be found for all four provinces furthermore the correlations between duration and other characteristics tend to be stronger in gx than other provinces similar to r the mic between duration and other fd characteristics is in generally small 0 12 0 64 while it is larger between severity intensity and affected area 0 52 1 suggesting that severity intensity and affected area are closely related to each other but collectively weakly correlated with duration 4 2 2 temporal variability fig 8 shows the 1953 2013 temporal variability of four fd characteristics fd duration severity intensity and affected area in the four study provinces it can be seen that the duration fig 8a shows a smaller variability as indicated by the standard deviation in yn 3 13 pentads and gz 4 18 pentads than that in gx 7 12 pentads and gd 6 69 pentads resulting in a shorter duration 20 pentads in yn and gz than that in gx and gd similarly the severity in gz and yn are significantly smaller than that in gx and gd fig 8b and the standard deviation of severity is much smaller in gz 0 58 104 mm and yn 1 86 104 mm than gx 8 16 104 mm and gd 3 98 104 mm in addition the smallest intensity and affected area are found in gz fig 8c and d and the variabilities of intensity and affected area are increased in the order of gz smallest yn gd and gx largest respectively table 3 lists the fd characteristics for three fd events respectively with the longest duration event 1 from june 8 to november 30 1956 the largest intensity event 2 from september 12 to november 26 1992 and the largest severity and affected area event 3 from july 1 to november 28 2009 the sum of these fd characteristics for all the fd events within the corresponding year are also given in this table as shown the duration of event 1 is much larger than that of event 2 and event 3 while the intensity severity and affected area of event 1 are much smaller than that of event 2 and event 3 this indicates that a large duration is not necessarily associated with a large intensity severity and affected area but the latter three characteristics are strongly correlated with each other further supporting the findings in table 2 of the strong correlations among severity intensity and affected area but weak correlations between duration and other fd characteristics e g severity intensity and affected area in the four study provinces additionally the event 3 is coincided with the severe drought occurred in southwest china in the autumn of 2009 huang et al 2012 wang et al 2012 4 2 3 trajectory of fd events fig 9 displays the trajectories of all fd events in 1956 1992 and 2009 as plotted in the saffron yellow purple and green lines respectively it shows that all the first and last events in the same year are generally located in the center around the borders between gx yn and gz and the eastern part of the study domain gx and gd respectively for the trajectory in 1992 the first two events are located in the northern and northeast yn respectively the third event is located close to the border between gz and gx and the last event is located in the northeast gx for the trajectory in 1956 the first event see the yellow point with the numbering 1 in fig 9 starts on april 14 and located close to one of the first two fd events in 1992 see the purple points with the numbering 1 in fig 9 the second and third fd events located in gd while the last four events are located in gz there are in total 6 fd events in 2009 the distance between the first and last events in 2009 is smaller compared with that in 1956 and 1992 additionally there are no fd events identified in gd in both 2009 and 1992 the changes in the spatial patterns of the fd event trajectories during these three years may be related to that the gradual drying climatic conditions moved from the center to the east of the study regions as will be further discussed in section 5 suggesting that the fd event trajectories show large spatial variability over the study regions fig 10 a and b display the distributions of fd onset and terminal during april november for the four provinces the onset and terminal positions of fd events are represented by the centroids for the beginning and ending slices of a fd event respectively the results show that most of fd events in yn begin in april may see green block in fig 10a and end in may june fig 10b for gz no apparent intra annual variability of the frequency of fd onset and terminal can be observed for gx and gd also no apparent intra annual variability is found for the frequency of fd onset but the fd terminal mostly occurs in november fig 10b fig 10c plots the distribution of the frequency of fd events starting from different onset directions i e the labels of the wind rose diagram and ending in different directions with respected to the domain center 107 25 24 75 as shown most of fd events start in the west 120 events and east 71 events directions in contrast relatively few fd events occur in northeast 25 events northern 18 events northwest 20 events and southeast 21 events directions particularly only 3 and 7 events start respectively in southwest and southern directions similar to the distribution of the onset directions most of fd events end in the west and east directions while only a few fd events end in the southwest and northwest directions overall the west to west and east to east pathways dominate the trajectory of fd evolution which is likely to be related with the long and narrow terrain along the west and east directions fig 10d shows the distribution of the number of years and their corresponding first see the x axis label and last see the colored legend fd events in april november identified by fd centroid as shown the number of the first fd events is the largest in april 36 followed by may 17 and june 4 in contrast the first fd event rarely occurs in august 1 september 1 october 1 and november 1 and never occurs in july in addition the first fd events occurred in april and may are mainly associated with the last fd events occurred in october and november fig 10e shows the distribution of the number of years with the annually first see the labels of the wind rose diagram and last see the colored legend events in different directions as seen more than half of years 38 years with the first fd events occur in the west direction and most of them are associated with the last fd events occurred in the east direction overall the fd events have a trajectory from april and may to october and november in time and a path from the west to the east direction in space 4 3 evolution of fd and meteorological conditions fig 11 plots the temporal evolutions of smp and the anomalies i e subtracting the mean and divided by the standard deviation of pre maxt rhu win and et during the fd event from april 1 to april 26 in 1983 it can be seen that pre anomalies are mostly negative in yn western gz and gx during the fd events except for april 21 fig 11b both win fig 11e and et fig 11f anomalies are positive the positive anomalies of et generally exceed 1 5 sd and last for 5 pentads due to the enhanced win 0 5 sd fig 11e as a result rhu anomalies fig 11d become negative in most parts of the study regions especially for april 11 1 5 sd in the midwest however the negative anomalies of maxt are found in the west of the study regions except for april 16 fig 11c therefore it can be concluded that the anomalously low pre and high et caused by strong win can lead to the decline of smp in the western regions resulting in the occurrence of the fd event during april 1 to 26 1983 fig 11a fig 12 shows the temporal evolutions of smp pre maxt rhu win and et during the fd event from july 1 to november 28 2009 it can be seen that the negative anomalies of pre 0 5 sd fig 12b are observed in the eastern part of study regions especially during august 20 september 9 the fd expanding period and last for about four pentads meanwhile maxt fig 12c is extremely high 2 sd leading to an increased et fig 12f from august 20 to september 9 and a decreased rhu 2 sd fig 12d in most parts of the study regions such changes in meteorological conditions coincide with the variability of smp fig 12a and smp generally decreases with the increased fd affected area over time it is worth noting that the pre on september 14 was abnormally high but unable to effectively alleviate drought mainly because no obvious changes can be detected in maxt rhu and et during the corresponding period in addition after september 19 despite the positive pre anomalies and negative maxt anomalies can be found from november 8 to 13 and from november 13 to 18 leading to an increased rhu and a decreased et fd was still in a state of development in the eastern part of the study regions mainly due to that the duration of the cool and moist conditions one or two pentads is too short to eliminate drought 5 discussion in this study the v3dfd method is developed for identifying the spatio temporal dynamic evolutions of fd events in southern and southwestern china and the comparisons of the performance of identifying fd events against the sad method are performed the results indicate two main differences between the v3dfd and sad methods 1 v3dfd identifies fd events according to the spatio temporal connectivity of fd voxels while sad is based on the geometrical correlations between two nearby patches 2 the patches with the affected area 1 6 of the study area are removed in sad while there is no such a constraint in v3dfd based on these two improvements the performance of v3dfd is better than sad in capturing the dynamic development and recovery of fd events see fig 6 which are important to characterize fd events for early warning and decision making in agriculture management additionally the comparisons between v3dfd and the 1d method reveal that 1d tends to overestimate fd frequency mainly because it fails to consider the relations between the occurrence of droughts at the nearby grids in addition li et al 2020a set the upper limit in estimating the duration of fd events as 12 pentads while v3dfd identifies fd events in terms of the developing velocity i e the velocity of sm drawdown following the definition of yuan et al 2019 where the length of fd duration was not considered for example the number of fd events with the duration 12 and 18 pentads identified by v3dfd is 70 and 31 respectively namely the fd may evolve into seasonal drought when duration is long enough such as 3 months wang and yuan 2018 therefore v3dfd is also suitable for identification of conventional agricultural drought without losing the generality the results of this study indicate that due to the spatio temporal variability of meteorological conditions over the study regions ford and labosier 2017 liu et al 2020 li et al 2020a the first fd event in a year mostly occurs in the western part yn and gz of the study regions during april may while the last event in a year mainly occurs in the eastern regions gx and gd during october november fig 10d and e fig 13 presents the distributions of the mean anomalies of pre maxt and et in april 1 may 31 and october 1 november 30 during 1978 2013 in april may the negative anomalies 1 sd of pre are mainly located in yn and gz while the positive anomalies 1 sd are widely distributed in gd and eastern gx fig 13a in contrast the negative anomalies of pre during october november occur mainly in northern and eastern yn eastern gd and eastern gx fig 13b the positive anomalies of maxt and et are distributed mainly in the southern regions during april may fig 13c and e and in the southeast regions gx and gd during october november fig 13d and f therefore the larger pre deficit and the higher maxt and et in the western regions yn and gz during april may and in the southeast regions gx and gd during october november are conducive to the rapid depletion of sm which ultimately intensify the occurrence of fd events our results also indicate that the largest fd frequency is detected in gx and followed by gd fig 4 a finding generally consistent with li et al 2020b who reported a significant increase of the heat wave fd events in the eastern pearl river basin prb during 1960 2015 likely due to a larger increase in t in the highly urbanized gx and gd where the warming trend is stronger than yn and gz wang et al 2015 due to rapid expansion of urbanization drought hazards have occurred more frequently in prb especially in gd over recent years deng et al 2018 li et al 2020b yang et al 2010 yuan et al 2019 another possible reason responsible for the higher probability of fd event occurrence in gx and gd is due to their higher water demand because of higher urbanization together with the more uneven spatio temporal distribution of pre these factors make gx and gd more prone and vulnerable to drought occurrence liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 6 conclusions based on the flash drought fd definition of yuan et al 2019 this study develops a voxel based three dimensional fd identification v3dfd framework to identify and characterize fd event occurrence in space and time different from the previous 3d methods based on the drought clusters or patches e g andreadis et al 2005 diaz et al 2020a xu et al 2015b zhou et al 2019 v3dfd is based on the drought voxel the v3dfd method is tested by comparisons with the one dimensional 1d method by yuan et al 2019 and the severity area duration sad method a widely used 3d method for drought identification in the southern and southwest china the main conclusions can be summarized as the following 1 as the v3dfd method considers fd in terms of the connectivity of fd voxels in space and time the fd frequency identified by v3dfd is generally lower than that identified by the 1d method compared with sad v3dfd shows better performance in capturing the development and recovery of fd events 2 the fd events occur more frequently in gd and eastern gx 6 11 times per decade with the larger duration severity intensity and affected area than yn and gz 3 5 times per decade in yn most fd events start in april may and recover in april june while in gx and gd there is little intra annual variability in fd onsets and most of fd terminals occur in november additionally most of the first and last fd events occur during the period within april may and october november respectively in the western yn and gz and the eastern study regions gx and gd 3 the pre deficit as well as high et play the leading roles in the fd event occurrence in yn western gz and gx in april 1983 while the fd events in gd gx gz and eastern yn occurred during july november in 2009 were mainly caused by large pre deficit and extremely high maxt in addition the large pre deficit together with high maxt and et can well explain the distributions of fd characteristics in the western study regions yn and gz during april may and in the eastern study regions gx and gd during october november credit authorship contribution statement jiayun li conceptualization methodology

3473,flash drought fd is an extreme event causing severe impacts on ecosystems and agriculture due to its fast velocity of evolution and high frequency here we develop a voxel based three dimensional fd v3dfd method to track the spatio temporal dynamics of fd based on the soil moisture sm decline method proposed by yuan et al 2019 the key idea of v3dfd is that fd is identified in terms of the connectivity of drought voxels i e cubes with width length and height representing latitude longitude and time respectively in 3d space instead of directly forming the drought events by merging drought clusters the v3dfd is systematically evaluated and compared with the commonly used 3d severity area duration sad method in four provinces in china guangdong gd guangxi gx guizhou gz and yunnan yn results show that v3dfd can better reflect the dynamic development and recovery of fd events compared with sad regional analyses indicate that fd occurs more frequent with a larger intensity and longer duration in gd and gx than yn and gz the onset terminal of fd in yn occurs mostly in april may april june the onset of fd in gx and gd is scattered at the intra annual scale but the terminal occurs mostly in november in addition the first fd event in a year is mostly located during april may in yn and gz while the last fd event of a year occurs mostly during october november in gx and gd keywords flash drought soil moisture deficit flash drought identification space time characteristics 1 introduction drought is one of the most serious global natural disasters causing severe impacts on the ecosystems agriculture and socio economic activities wang et al 2014 schwalm et al 2017 song et al 2020 edwards et al 2019 china meteorological data service center cmdsc reported that the drought area is about 21 6 million hectares per year from 1949 to 1999 in china and the drought events account for 60 of the total number of meteorological disasters nearly 10 billion kilograms of crop have been lost annually due to drought from 1949 to 1999 in china cmdsc 2011 drought is traditionally recognized as a slowly developing process which can last for several years chen et al 2019 she and xia 2018 su et al 2020 wilhite et al 2007 recently a new type of rapidly developing drought the flash drought fd svoboda et al 2002 has attracted much research attention li et al 2020a yuan et al 2019 zhang and yuan 2020 fd events can develop rapidly and may have greater negative impacts than traditional drought such as large agricultural yield losses high deteriorations in vegetation health strong shortage of short term water resources and high vulnerability of global food supply boyer et al 2013 christian et al 2019a christian et al 2019b otkin et al 2015a otkin et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 zhang and yuan 2020 for example a severe fd occurred in central usa in 2012 caused disastrous impacts on water resources and agricultural production and received considerable attention from the united states government agencies and academia basara et al 2019 pendergrass et al 2020 svoboda et al 2002 was the first to introduce the fd concept i e a type of rapidly intensifying drought caused by the short term dryness and strong heatwaves for explaining the crop deterioration phenomenon various metrics based on actual evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet have been proposed to identify fd occurrence for example the satellite derived evaporative stress index esi otkin et al 2013 the rapid change index rci otkin et al 2015a b the standardized evaporative stress ratio sesr christian et al 2019a christian et al 2019b and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi li et al 2020a recently some advances were made to identify fd occurrence using the soil moisture sm and meteorological factors mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 identified the heatwave and precipitation pre deficit fd in us based on the anomalies of sm pre et and temperature t at the pentad 5 day scale the identification scheme of fd by mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 were based on the hard thresholding rule i e the occurrence of fd is simply determined by judging the anomalies of the given climate factors are larger or less than their individually preset constant thresholds which has the two limitations of without considering the possibility that fd event can temporally occur at two sequential pentads and the inability to characterize the rapid development of fd wang and yuan 2018 identified the fd occurrence over china based on the positive t and et anomalies and sm deficit different from mo and lettenmaier 2015 2016 they focused on the fd events occurred across a set of pentads i e a series of short term heat extremes instead of the event covering only one single pentad more recently yuan et al 2019 developed a new fd identification method by considering the decreasing sm from the 40th to the 20th percentile with a pentad average decline rate 5 in percentile the method of yuan et al 2019 overcomes those two limitations of mo and lettenmaier 2015 as mentioned above since it considered the rapid rate of fd intensification overcoming limitation b and the persistence of fd event overcoming limitation a most previous drought assessment studies were conducted either on the temporal evolution of drought characteristics one dimensional 1d at a specific spatial scale e g guo et al 2020 nabaei et al 2019 wu et al 2017 or at the spatial patterns of drought two dimensional 2d during a given study period e g patel et al 2007 xu et al 2018 these studies however neglected the three dimensionally evolutional processes of drought in both the two dimensions in space and one dimension in time the three dimensional 3d based drought identification can enhance the understanding of the internal mechanisms and external forcing of drought evolutions lloyd hughes 2012 to date only few works are available on the 3d drought identification andreadis et al 2005 proposed the severity area duration sad method for tracking the spatio temporal variations of drought based on the merging of two temporally sequential drought clusters according to minimum overlapping area the sad method has been applied to characterize meteorological drought sm agricultural drought and hydrologic drought at the regional andreadis et al 2005 li et al 2020a wang et al 2011 zhu et al 2019 continental guo et al 2018 lloyd hughes 2012 and global guo et al 2018 herrera estrada et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 scales recently zhou et al 2019 identified the meteorological droughts in the poyang lake basin china by using a 3d drought migration tracking method similarly diaz et al 2019 2020a b developed a spatial drought tracking algorithm s track to identify the trajectory of drought different from the sad method these methods merge two drought clusters by the euclidean distance between the geometric centroids zhou et al 2019 or by both the euclidean distance and their individual area diaz et al 2019 diaz et al 2020a diaz et al 2020b instead of the overlapping area considered in andreadis et al 2005 despite significant advances have been made in 3d drought identification there are still some disadvantages in these existing 3d methods first the drought identification is accompanied with uncertainty because the determination process of the successive drought clusters belonging to the same drought event is concept dependent for example andreadis et al 2005 and xu et al 2015b calculated the overlapping area between continuous time slices of each drought cluster to judge whether to split or connect each of them which may cause misjudgment when multiple clusters exist in the adjacent time steps second the drought patches i e a set of spatially connected grids satisfying the given drought identification criteria smaller than 1 6 of the study area were removed in the drought identifying process xu et al 2015b which may disrupt the continuity of drought events and is difficult to capture the development and recovery of droughts third either only one diaz et al 2020b or no more than two zhou et al 2019 drought patches in each time step are counted which is appropriate only for a small area but can introduce non negligible errors in tracking drought events over a relatively large area the present study aims to develop a voxel based 3d fd v3dfd method to identify the occurrence of fd events on the basis of the sm decline method proposed by yuan et al 2019 here the terminology voxel represents a cube whose width length and height represent latitude longitude and time respectively the key idea of v3dfd is that fd is identified in terms of the connectivity of drought voxels in 3d space instead of directly forming the drought events by merging drought clusters or patches from different time steps hence this new method no longer requires any efforts in collecting clusters or patches in this study v3dfd is applied to the typical drought prone regions in southern and southwestern china encompassing 4 provinces of guangdong gd guangxi gx guizhou gz and yunnan yn the objectives here are to 1 test the proposed new v3dfd method in tracking the spatial temporal variations of fd events by comparing with the previous 1d yuan et al 2019 and sad andreadis et al 2005 methods and 2 explore the spatial and temporal evolutions of fd characteristics in the selected yn gz gx and gd drought prone regions the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data sources used in this study in section 3 the 1d definition of fd as well as the details of the newly developed v3dfd method are provided the results and discussion are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively and the main conclusions drawn from this study are summarized in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area 9 8 105 km2 located in the southern and southwest china 97 31 e 117 19 e and 20 13 n 29 15 n see fig 1 includes four provinces gd gx gz and yn the study region has large areas of rugged terrain and exhibits large variability in elevations ranging from the sea level coastal areas in southern gx and southern gd to the mount kawakarpo in northwest yn liu et al 2014 the typical karst landforms account for 73 37 8 28 and 14 5 of the total area of gz gx yn and gd respectively deng et al 2009 lan and mo 1995 liu et al 2014 mo 1986 most of these study regions are located in the subtropical climate zone except for northern yn plateau climate zone southern yn and southern gd tropical climate zone with the mean annual pre decreasing from 2000 mm along the southern coast in gd and gx to 700 mm in the northwest and northeast of yn liu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 due to anthropogenic warming caused by rapid urbanization expansion drought hazards have become more frequently over the study region over the past two decades in these study regions deng et al 2018 li et al 2020b yang et al 2010 yuan et al 2019 causing serious impacts on economy and society wang et al 2015 2 2 data the observed 1978 2013 daily pre maximum air

identification the 1d fd events are identified at the grid scales based on the method of yuan et al 2019 hereafter as 1d method taking the fd identification at a grid point as an example the main steps of the 1d method are i calculation of the sm percentile smp for each pentad during a period of interest ii extraction of the smp series where the first smp is 40th the last smp is 20th and all other smp are 40th see a in the step 1 in fig 2 and iii elimination of the smp series with a duration of 3 pentads see c in step 1 in fig 2 or with the average decreasing rate of smp δ s m p 5 see b in the step 1 in fig 2 the above abbreviations of the variables are listed in table a1 in appendix a one can refer to this table for convenience 3 2 v3dfd framework the framework of v3dfd is illustrated in fig 2 there are generally three steps of workflows 1 extraction of fd voxel 2 identification of fd events and 3 evaluation of fd characteristics as detailed in the following 1 extraction of fd voxel we first identify the fd events in the 3d coordinates xi yi n with their basic components cubes termed as the fd voxels step 1 in fig 2 here x and y represent the latitude and longitude of the geometric center of voxel n is the index of the pentad used as the time coordinate ranging from 1 to n 1d n 1d is the number of pentads for the 1d fd events extracted by the method of yuan et al 2019 which is also denoted as the 1d fd duration 2 identification of 3d fd events identification of the 3d fd event is the core part of the v3dfd framework including the three components construction separation and elimination of fd objects see the bold labels in fig 2 construction of original fd event according to the connectivity of fd voxels in the 3d space we first construct the original 3d fd event as a collection of fd voxels where at least one side of each member is connected with another fig 2 the original 3d fd event may contain two or more adjacent fd events or it does not contain any events that meet the rules given in the separation of fd event and elimination of fd event in fig 2 the latter condition indicates that no any fd event can be identified based on the original 3d fd event separation of fd event based on the construction of original 3d fd event we design two rules to determinate whether the original event should be divided into two events the separation of the original 3d fd event contains two parts part i and part ii see fig 2 corresponding to two different rules a slice of an event is defined as a transection associated with a fixed pentad of the 3d fd event see fig 3 let a n here 1 n n 3d 1 and a n 1 denote the areas of slices n and n 1 respectively where n 3d is the number of pentads for the original 3d fd events according to li et al 2020a the first separation rule is that the overlapping area ao n between a n and a n 1 see the deep red and transparent blue slices as the n and n 1th slices respectively in fig 3 should be greater than half of their minimum i e min a n a n 1 if satisfied then move forward to next slice if not then separate the event into two events using the interface between the slices n and n 1 see the separation of fd event part i in fig 2 it is clearly shown in fig 3 that the overlapping area ao n between two slices is less than half of the area of transparent blue slice and hence a separation process should be carried out implementing the first separation rule with n changing from 1 to n 3d 1 yields a total of j j 1 fd events here ssmp n 1 n n 3d j 1 and ssmp n 1 denote the averages of sm percentile over the slices n and n 1 respectively where n 3d j is the total number of pentads of the j th 1 j j fd event before the second separation rule we filter out the j th event in the case that the time length i e duration n 3d j is 3 pentads yuan et al 2019 following yuan et al 2019 the second separation rule is that if ssmp n 20 and ssmp n 1 20 then separate the j th event into two events by the interface between the slices n and n 1 if not then move forward to the next slice see separation of fd event part ii in fig 2 for each event looping the second separation rule from n equal to 1 to n 3d j 1 yields a total of k k 1 fd events elimination of fd event the fd events obtained by the previous steps may be associated with the short duration and low affected area in this part we eliminate the k th 1 k k event among the k events which is separated from the j th event among the j events based on the criteria that either the fd affected area is 1 6 of the study area li et al 2020a xu et al 2015a 2015b or its time length n 3d j k i e duration is 3 pentads yuan et al 2019 in this study the fd affected area is computed as the percentage of projection area of a fd event to the whole study area for each original fd event looping over k and j yields the final fd events 3 evaluation of 3d fd characteristics in addition to duration and affected area several other fd characteristics are also used in this study the fd frequency is defined as the average number of fd events identified per decade at each grid the severity is the sum of sm deficit relative to the 40th percentile of sm for all fd voxels during a fd event the fd intensity is the ratio of severity to duration the fd centroid associated with the coordinates longitude latitude time is the geometrical center of a fd event the slice centroid is defined as the geometrical center of the slice the centroids for the beginning and ending slices of a fd event are used to quantify the displacement between the beginning and ending positions of the fd event note that all the above characteristics are identified for the 3d fd event while the fd frequency is also suitable for the 1d fd event we compare the v3dfd framework with the sad method here as it is the most popular 3d approach for drought identification andreadis et al 2005 xu et al 2015a to this end we consider the fd voxels after the extraction fig 2 as the input data to the sad method in addition to the design rules to construct the 3d drought event proposed by andreadis et al 2005 and xu et al 2015a the separation and elimination of the fd events with the duration 3 pentads are also added to the sad method 3 3 maximal information coefficient the maximal information coefficient mic is a powerful measure of the correlation between the paired variables reshef et al 2011 with a wide range of applications in biological science koren et al 2012 and medicine lyu et al 2017 here mic is used to detect the relations between the paired 3d fd characteristics according to reshef et al 2011 the formula of mic can be expressed as 1 mic max m m r c 2 r 2 c and r c b n where r and c are the positive integers b l is a function of l expressed as b l l 0 6 l is the data length m is the characteristic matrix with the elements m r c which is the highest normalized mutual information obtained by any r c grid discretizing the scatterplot of two fd characteristics the m r c is expressed as follows reshef et al 2011 2 m r c i r c log min r c where i r c represents the highest mutual information over a grid resolution of r c a larger mic corresponds to a higher degree of information overlap indicating a strong relation between the paired variables in this study the mic value between the paired fd characteristics is obtained using the minepy package provided in albanese et al 2012 3 4 mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator we use the non parametric mann kendall m k test kendall 1975 mann 1945 and the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 to analyze the trends of meteorological variables pre maxt rhu win and et at the 5 significance level p 0 05 the m k test has the advantages of being independent of any kind of probability distribution and interference from a few outliers while the sen s slope estimator can estimate the trend magnitudes of data series available without resorting to any parameters these two methods have been widely employed to analyze the trend significances and estimate the trend magnitudes in the hydrometeorological time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 hu et al 2021 mekonen and berlie 2020 she et al 2017 wu et al 2016 2018 xu et al 2018 4 results 4 1 comparison of v3dfd versus 1d and sad methods fig 4 shows the distributions of fd frequency obtained by using the 1d fig 4a sad fig 4b and v3dfd fig 4c methods as well as the differences of fd frequency between the 1d and v3dfd fig 4d and between the sad and v3dfd methods fig 4e as seen the three methods show generally similar spatial variabilities of fd frequency that is gd has the apparently higher frequency than yn and gz however the frequency of the 1d method is higher than that of v3dfd over most study regions fig 4d mainly due to that the 1d method is implemented on a single grid and fails to consider the spatio temporal connectivity of the fd events in contrast the frequency of the sad method is smaller than that of v3dfd in some parts of gz and gx fig 4e likely associated with that the patches with the affected area 1 6 of the study area were removed by the sad method fig 5 compares the probability density functions pdfs of fd duration fig 5a severity fig 5b and intensity fig 5c obtained by using v3dfd and sad over study regions as shown the pdf of fd duration by v3dfd is generally fatter than that by sad this is because the patches with affected area 1 6 is eliminated in sad resulting in the erroneous identification of the growth or recovery of fd events and ultimately a shortened duration the distribution of severity is nearly the same for two methods fig 5b however the pdf of intensity by sad is slightly larger than that by v3dfd fig 5c table 1 summarizes the statistics standard deviation maximum median minimum upper quartile and lower quartile of fd characteristics i e fd duration severity and intensity obtained by the v3dfd and sad methods respectively the results show that v3dfd 285 identifies more fd events than sad 275 the variability i e standard deviation of duration by v3dfd is significantly larger than that by sad in contrast the variability of severity and intensity by v3dfd tends to be smaller than that by sad furthermore the number of fd events with duration 12 pentads i e the maximum fd duration defined in li et al 2020a and 18 pentads i e 3 month scale representing the seasonal drought identified by v3dfd are 70 and 31 respectively which are significantly larger than those identified by sad 48 and 9 respectively fig 6 compares the fd events in 2010 as well as the spatial distributions of severity in grids identified by v3dfd fig 6a and c and sad fig 6b and d methods respectively as shown both methods can identify three fd events in 2010 fig 6a and b but the geometrics of fd events identified by v3dfd are obviously different from that identified by sad specifically the early parts of fd events identified by sad are missing compared with that by v3dfd the difference can be attributed to that sad eliminates the patches or fd voxels during the early development of fd event when the affected area of each patch is 1 6 of the study area this is also supported by fig 6c and d showing that the v3dfd identifies large severity in the eastern gz and southern yn while the sad identifies large severity only in the eastern gz furthermore the severity by v3dfd is larger than that by sad in the eastern gz 4 2 variability of fd characteristic in space and time 4 2 1 spatial variability by using the v3dfd method the spatial variabilities of fd characteristics i e fd duration severity intensity and affected area over the study regions are explored fig 7 displays the spatial distributions of fd duration severity intensity and affected area over the study regions during the period 1953 2013 the points represent the centroid locations it can be seen that the large fd duration is located mainly in the eastern gx and western gd while the large fd severity intensity and affected area are concentrated in the northeast gx overall the fd characteristics are smaller in gz than that in other regions table 2 lists the mic and correlation coefficient r between the paired fd characteristics over the study regions during 1953 2013 the r between all paired characteristics is positive demonstrating the positive correlations among the fd characteristics analyzed particularly strong correlations r 0 74 among severity intensity and affected area and weak correlations 0 03 0 69 between duration and other fd characteristics especially between duration and intensity can be found for all four provinces furthermore the correlations between duration and other characteristics tend to be stronger in gx than other provinces similar to r the mic between duration and other fd characteristics is in generally small 0 12 0 64 while it is larger between severity intensity and affected area 0 52 1 suggesting that severity intensity and affected area are closely related to each other but collectively weakly correlated with duration 4 2 2 temporal variability fig 8 shows the 1953 2013 temporal variability of four fd characteristics fd duration severity intensity and affected area in the four study provinces it can be seen that the duration fig 8a shows a smaller variability as indicated by the standard deviation in yn 3 13 pentads and gz 4 18 pentads than that in gx 7 12 pentads and gd 6 69 pentads resulting in a shorter duration 20 pentads in yn and gz than that in gx and gd similarly the severity in gz and yn are significantly smaller than that in gx and gd fig 8b and the standard deviation of severity is much smaller in gz 0 58 104 mm and yn 1 86 104 mm than gx 8 16 104 mm and gd 3 98 104 mm in addition the smallest intensity and affected area are found in gz fig 8c and d and the variabilities of intensity and affected area are increased in the order of gz smallest yn gd and gx largest respectively table 3 lists the fd characteristics for three fd events respectively with the longest duration event 1 from june 8 to november 30 1956 the largest intensity event 2 from september 12 to november 26 1992 and the largest severity and affected area event 3 from july 1 to november 28 2009 the sum of these fd characteristics for all the fd events within the corresponding year are also given in this table as shown the duration of event 1 is much larger than that of event 2 and event 3 while the intensity severity and affected area of event 1 are much smaller than that of event 2 and event 3 this indicates that a large duration is not necessarily associated with a large intensity severity and affected area but the latter three characteristics are strongly correlated with each other further supporting the findings in table 2 of the strong correlations among severity intensity and affected area but weak correlations between duration and other fd characteristics e g severity intensity and affected area in the four study provinces additionally the event 3 is coincided with the severe drought occurred in southwest china in the autumn of 2009 huang et al 2012 wang et al 2012 4 2 3 trajectory of fd events fig 9 displays the trajectories of all fd events in 1956 1992 and 2009 as plotted in the saffron yellow purple and green lines respectively it shows that all the first and last events in the same year are generally located in the center around the borders between gx yn and gz and the eastern part of the study domain gx and gd respectively for the trajectory in 1992 the first two events are located in the northern and northeast yn respectively the third event is located close to the border between gz and gx and the last event is located in the northeast gx for the trajectory in 1956 the first event see the yellow point with the numbering 1 in fig 9 starts on april 14 and located close to one of the first two fd events in 1992 see the purple points with the numbering 1 in fig 9 the second and third fd events located in gd while the last four events are located in gz there are in total 6 fd events in 2009 the distance between the first and last events in 2009 is smaller compared with that in 1956 and 1992 additionally there are no fd events identified in gd in both 2009 and 1992 the changes in the spatial patterns of the fd event trajectories during these three years may be related to that the gradual drying climatic conditions moved from the center to the east of the study regions as will be further discussed in section 5 suggesting that the fd event trajectories show large spatial variability over the study regions fig 10 a and b display the distributions of fd onset and terminal during april november for the four provinces the onset and terminal positions of fd events are represented by the centroids for the beginning and ending slices of a fd event respectively the results show that most of fd events in yn begin in april may see green block in fig 10a and end in may june fig 10b for gz no apparent intra annual variability of the frequency of fd onset and terminal can be observed for gx and gd also no apparent intra annual variability is found for the frequency of fd onset but the fd terminal mostly occurs in november fig 10b fig 10c plots the distribution of the frequency of fd events starting from different onset directions i e the labels of the wind rose diagram and ending in different directions with respected to the domain center 107 25 24 75 as shown most of fd events start in the west 120 events and east 71 events directions in contrast relatively few fd events occur in northeast 25 events northern 18 events northwest 20 events and southeast 21 events directions particularly only 3 and 7 events start respectively in southwest and southern directions similar to the distribution of the onset directions most of fd events end in the west and east directions while only a few fd events end in the southwest and northwest directions overall the west to west and east to east pathways dominate the trajectory of fd evolution which is likely to be related with the long and narrow terrain along the west and east directions fig 10d shows the distribution of the number of years and their corresponding first see the x axis label and last see the colored legend fd events in april november identified by fd centroid as shown the number of the first fd events is the largest in april 36 followed by may 17 and june 4 in contrast the first fd event rarely occurs in august 1 september 1 october 1 and november 1 and never occurs in july in addition the first fd events occurred in april and may are mainly associated with the last fd events occurred in october and november fig 10e shows the distribution of the number of years with the annually first see the labels of the wind rose diagram and last see the colored legend events in different directions as seen more than half of years 38 years with the first fd events occur in the west direction and most of them are associated with the last fd events occurred in the east direction overall the fd events have a trajectory from april and may to october and november in time and a path from the west to the east direction in space 4 3 evolution of fd and meteorological conditions fig 11 plots the temporal evolutions of smp and the anomalies i e subtracting the mean and divided by the standard deviation of pre maxt rhu win and et during the fd event from april 1 to april 26 in 1983 it can be seen that pre anomalies are mostly negative in yn western gz and gx during the fd events except for april 21 fig 11b both win fig 11e and et fig 11f anomalies are positive the positive anomalies of et generally exceed 1 5 sd and last for 5 pentads due to the enhanced win 0 5 sd fig 11e as a result rhu anomalies fig 11d become negative in most parts of the study regions especially for april 11 1 5 sd in the midwest however the negative anomalies of maxt are found in the west of the study regions except for april 16 fig 11c therefore it can be concluded that the anomalously low pre and high et caused by strong win can lead to the decline of smp in the western regions resulting in the occurrence of the fd event during april 1 to 26 1983 fig 11a fig 12 shows the temporal evolutions of smp pre maxt rhu win and et during the fd event from july 1 to november 28 2009 it can be seen that the negative anomalies of pre 0 5 sd fig 12b are observed in the eastern part of study regions especially during august 20 september 9 the fd expanding period and last for about four pentads meanwhile maxt fig 12c is extremely high 2 sd leading to an increased et fig 12f from august 20 to september 9 and a decreased rhu 2 sd fig 12d in most parts of the study regions such changes in meteorological conditions coincide with the variability of smp fig 12a and smp generally decreases with the increased fd affected area over time it is worth noting that the pre on september 14 was abnormally high but unable to effectively alleviate drought mainly because no obvious changes can be detected in maxt rhu and et during the corresponding period in addition after september 19 despite the positive pre anomalies and negative maxt anomalies can be found from november 8 to 13 and from november 13 to 18 leading to an increased rhu and a decreased et fd was still in a state of development in the eastern part of the study regions mainly due to that the duration of the cool and moist conditions one or two pentads is too short to eliminate drought 5 discussion in this study the v3dfd method is developed for identifying the spatio temporal dynamic evolutions of fd events in southern and southwestern china and the comparisons of the performance of identifying fd events against the sad method are performed the results indicate two main differences between the v3dfd and sad methods 1 v3dfd identifies fd events according to the spatio temporal connectivity of fd voxels while sad is based on the geometrical correlations between two nearby patches 2 the patches with the affected area 1 6 of the study area are removed in sad while there is no such a constraint in v3dfd based on these two improvements the performance of v3dfd is better than sad in capturing the dynamic development and recovery of fd events see fig 6 which are important to characterize fd events for early warning and decision making in agriculture management additionally the comparisons between v3dfd and the 1d method reveal that 1d tends to overestimate fd frequency mainly because it fails to consider the relations between the occurrence of droughts at the nearby grids in addition li et al 2020a set the upper limit in estimating the duration of fd events as 12 pentads while v3dfd identifies fd events in terms of the developing velocity i e the velocity of sm drawdown following the definition of yuan et al 2019 where the length of fd duration was not considered for example the number of fd events with the duration 12 and 18 pentads identified by v3dfd is 70 and 31 respectively namely the fd may evolve into seasonal drought when duration is long enough such as 3 months wang and yuan 2018 therefore v3dfd is also suitable for identification of conventional agricultural drought without losing the generality the results of this study indicate that due to the spatio temporal variability of meteorological conditions over the study regions ford and labosier 2017 liu et al 2020 li et al 2020a the first fd event in a year mostly occurs in the western part yn and gz of the study regions during april may while the last event in a year mainly occurs in the eastern regions gx and gd during october november fig 10d and e fig 13 presents the distributions of the mean anomalies of pre maxt and et in april 1 may 31 and october 1 november 30 during 1978 2013 in april may the negative anomalies 1 sd of pre are mainly located in yn and gz while the positive anomalies 1 sd are widely distributed in gd and eastern gx fig 13a in contrast the negative anomalies of pre during october november occur mainly in northern and eastern yn eastern gd and eastern gx fig 13b the positive anomalies of maxt and et are distributed mainly in the southern regions during april may fig 13c and e and in the southeast regions gx and gd during october november fig 13d and f therefore the larger pre deficit and the higher maxt and et in the western regions yn and gz during april may and in the southeast regions gx and gd during october november are conducive to the rapid depletion of sm which ultimately intensify the occurrence of fd events our results also indicate that the largest fd frequency is detected in gx and followed by gd fig 4 a finding generally consistent with li et al 2020b who reported a significant increase of the heat wave fd events in the eastern pearl river basin prb during 1960 2015 likely due to a larger increase in t in the highly urbanized gx and gd where the warming trend is stronger than yn and gz wang et al 2015 due to rapid expansion of urbanization drought hazards have occurred more frequently in prb especially in gd over recent years deng et al 2018 li et al 2020b yang et al 2010 yuan et al 2019 another possible reason responsible for the higher probability of fd event occurrence in gx and gd is due to their higher water demand because of higher urbanization together with the more uneven spatio temporal distribution of pre these factors make gx and gd more prone and vulnerable to drought occurrence liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 6 conclusions based on the flash drought fd definition of yuan et al 2019 this study develops a voxel based three dimensional fd identification v3dfd framework to identify and characterize fd event occurrence in space and time different from the previous 3d methods based on the drought clusters or patches e g andreadis et al 2005 diaz et al 2020a xu et al 2015b zhou et al 2019 v3dfd is based on the drought voxel the v3dfd method is tested by comparisons with the one dimensional 1d method by yuan et al 2019 and the severity area duration sad method a widely used 3d method for drought identification in the southern and southwest china the main conclusions can be summarized as the following 1 as the v3dfd method considers fd in terms of the connectivity of fd voxels in space and time the fd frequency identified by v3dfd is generally lower than that identified by the 1d method compared with sad v3dfd shows better performance in capturing the development and recovery of fd events 2 the fd events occur more frequently in gd and eastern gx 6 11 times per decade with the larger duration severity intensity and affected area than yn and gz 3 5 times per decade in yn most fd events start in april may and recover in april june while in gx and gd there is little intra annual variability in fd onsets and most of fd terminals occur in november additionally most of the first and last fd events occur during the period within april may and october november respectively in the western yn and gz and the eastern study regions gx and gd 3 the pre deficit as well as high et play the leading roles in the fd event occurrence in yn western gz and gx in april 1983 while the fd events in gd gx gz and eastern yn occurred during july november in 2009 were mainly caused by large pre deficit and extremely high maxt in addition the large pre deficit together with high maxt and et can well explain the distributions of fd characteristics in the western study regions yn and gz during april may and in the eastern study regions gx and gd during october november credit authorship contribution statement jiayun li conceptualization methodology

3474,reliable distributed hydrological modeling especially in semi arid areas must consider the inclusion of surface soil moisture ssm spatial information during the calibration process this variable plays a key role in the evapotranspiration processes that determine the hydrological cycle the coarse resolution of the ssm estimates by satellite remote sensing has restricted the application of this approach to only large basins focusing most of the studies in the consideration of simply the temporal dynamics of this variable the growing efforts in providing higher spatial resolution through disaggregating methodologies or new sensor estimates facilitates the application of this spatial approach to small basins this paper explores the applicability of the currently available satellite surface soil moisture estimates for distributed eco hydrological modelling in mediterranean forest basins on one hand this study contributes to fill the existing research gap on the use of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns within the distributed hydrological modelling framework in small basins on the other hand it serves as an indirect validation method for the spatial performance of satellite ssm products to achieve this goal we implemented the eco hydrological model tetis in three case studies named hozgarganta southern spain ceira western portugal and carraixet eastern spain the ssm estimates selected for comparison were sentinel 1 ssm provided by the copernicus global land services cgls smap ssm disaggregated using sentinel 1 spl2smap s provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa smos ssm provided by the barcelona expert center bec and smos and smap ssm disaggregated using the dispatch algorithm provided by lobelia earth the methodology employed involved a multi objective and multi variable calibration in terms of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns and in situ streamflow using the spatial efficiency metric spaef and the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse respectively before model calibration a sensitivity analysis of the most influent variables was performed the temporal and spatial comparison of the reference ssm products revealed inconsistencies amongst products the disaggregating methodology determined the spatial agreement to a greater degree than the sensor itself i e smap smos in spite of the differences amongst products the multi objective calibration approach proposed increased the robustness of the hydrological modelling keywords surface soil moisture remote sensing spatial patterns eco hydrological modelling multi variable calibration 1 introduction the reliable determination of the hydrological variables in a catchment has been a challenging objective for a long time many hydrological models have emerged as a response to growing demand of operational tools amongst them deterministic distributed hydrological models offering spatial explicit predictions can fulfil the lack of spatial representation of the dominant hydrological processes when available in situ observations are not sufficient traditionally hydrological model calibration was based on solely streamflow information however this does not guarantee the correct representation of the spatial heterogeneity of other state variables rajib et al 2016 wambura et al 2018 the introduction in hydrological models of satellite derived information has the potential to overcome this limitation by improving models performance both temporally and spatially laiolo et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 herman et al 2018 dembelé et al 2020a additionally it should not be ignored the existing relationship between vegetation dynamics and the related hydrological processes thus vegetation requires proper representation in eco hydrological models to attend reliability requirements in catchments with representative areas of forestry or agricultural uses pasquato et al 2015 ruiz pérez et al 2017 bai et al 2018 the surface soil moisture information derived from satellite data has been commonly employed for improvement in the hydrological modelling due to its importance in the description of the hydrological cycle gcos 2019 especially in semi arid areas this has been mostly done via assimilation laiolo et al 2016 alvarez garreton et al 2016 abbaszadeh et al 2020 khaki et al 2020 or direct calibration approaches wanders et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 rajib et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 dembelé et al 2020a most of the studies have focused on the temporal dynamics of the ssm mainly due to the coarse spatial resolution of the available estimates special attention to spatial patterns was restricted only to large basins dembelé et al 2020a the growing efforts in providing higher spatial resolution through disaggregating methodologies merlin et al 2013 piles et al 2011 piles et al 2012 das et al 2019 or new sensor estimates bauer marschallinger et al 2019 allow to provide operational estimations at 1 km which is an accepted basic assumption for eco hydrological resources management sabaghy et al 2020 thus the emerging research performed in hydrological model evaluation and calibration based on spatial patterns koch et al 2015 mendiguren et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 koch et al 2018 zink et al 2018 can be transferred to ssm for medium and small basins however there is an underlying uncertainty in current ssm products fang et al 2016 al yaari et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and model performance is dependent on the selection of the reference product used for calibration dembelé et al 2020b in consequence a previous analysis of their performance before the calibration process is necessary this paper is aimed at the evaluation of the current available satellite soil moisture products at 1 km spatial resolution for distributed eco hydrological modelling in mediterranean basins firstly it contributes to fill the existing research gap on the use of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns within the distributed hydrological modelling framework in small basins secondly it serves as an indirect validation method of the spatial performance of satellite ssm products to achieve these goals we selected tetis hydrological model francés et al 2007 which is a conceptual deterministic model in its tanks structure processes are represented by parameters that are physically based and spatially distributed it has a dynamic vegetation sub model pasquato 2013 pasquato et al 2015 and has been implemented in several case studies e g ruiz pérez et al 2016 ruiz pérez et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 echeverría et al 2019 barrientos et al 2020 echevarria et al 2019 stated the possibility of calibrating the tetis model basing exclusively in satellite information three case studies named carraixet eastern spain hozgarganta southern spain and ceira western portugal have been strategically selected to perform this research in the mediterranean region four different sources of ssm estimates were considered for the study sentinel 1 ssm provided by copernicus global land services cgls smos ssm provided by the barcelona expert center bec smap ssm disaggregated using sentinel 1 provided by nasa and smos and smap ssm disaggregated using the dispatch algorithm provided by lobelia earth the methodology employed involved a multi objective multi variable calibration in terms of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns and in situ streamflow the paper contents are organised as follows section 2 introduces tetis eco hydrological model section 3 deals with the description of the study sites and the data employed in tetis implementation together with a description of the ssm products considered it includes the methodology employed for the remote sensing ssm product comparison model calibration steps sensitivity analysis calibration experiments and assessment metrics and model evaluation section 5 and 6 provide the results and their discussion respectively finally section 8 summarizes the main conclusions derived from this study 2 tetis eco hydrological model tetis is a hydrological conceptual distributed model useful for both for flood event and continuous simulation the tetis model bases the runoff production on the water balance calculation for each cell the water is assumed to be distributed in six conceptual storage tanks interconnected fig 1 a the tanks represent the capacity in the water storage by the vegetation cover t6 the static storage t1 the surface storage t2 the gravitational storage t3 and the aquifer t4 the sixth tank t5 represents the channel when it exists in the cell as shown in fig 1c the water volumes h stored in each tank are the state variables of the model tetis has a modular structure in consequence these h states depend on the conceptual schema adopted due to the spatially distributed conceptualization the morphological and hydrologic characteristics of the soil in each cell also determine h states the modules in tetis are conceptualized as an interconnected three dimensional mesh t2 t3 and t4 drain into the corresponding downstream one following the flow directions proposed by the digital elevation model dem and reaching the drainage network that consists of gullies and channels fig 1c the cases where the destination cell is a gully both the overland flow and interflow integrate into it while the base flow drains to the downstream cell in channel cells all the output flows integrate into the river channel tank t5 threshold areas are parametrized to discriminate between these three types of cells hillside gullies and river channel summarizing runoff translation along the basin considers that non abstracted water circulates on the hillslopes until to the natural drainage network of the basin is reached onwards water flows through the drainage network itself conceptual simplifications of the laws of the hydraulics in natural channels are included in tetis the kinematic wave supports the tetis modelling approach assuming uniform flow and comparable friction and channel slopes as a simplification of the saint venant shallow water equations the kinematic wave integrated in tetis neglects the terms corresponding to inertial and pressure effects in the equation of conservation of energy on the other hand the hydraulic characteristics of the riverbeds are parametrized in tetis consequently characteristic geomorphological information of the basins can be accounted for the eco hydrological configuration of tetis includes a dynamic vegetation model in which the static storage tank t1 splits into two tanks fig 1b associated to the different layers found in the first horizons of the soil the shallow static storage t1a the deep static storage t1b t1a involves the processes of evaporation from the bare soil and superficial roots transpiration from the first few centimeters of the soil t1b considers the deep roots transpiration processes from the underlying layer in t6 the balance of the water stored by the canopy is balanced in terms of rainfall and evaporation from the interception considering the lai the lai is also dynamically estimated by the dynamic vegetation

confluence of the la sauceda gorge province of málaga spain and the pasada llana canyon at 160 m a s l this river collects water from the los alcornocales natural park in the province of cádiz spain after 45 6 km in natural regime it discharges to the guadiaro river which drains to the western mediterranean sea the hozgarganta river basin extends over approximately 228 3 km2 of forestry main land uses dominated by coniferous broadleaved and mixed forests with some isolated presence of natural grasslands moors and heathland sclerophyllous vegetation transitional woodland shrub pastures and agro forestry areas the gauging station with the same name hozgarganta 280189 4034238 in etrs89 utm zone 30 n epsg 25830 allows the consideration of the complete natural drainage area of this tributary

is close to 1200 mm as is frequent in mediterranean basins rainfall between october and april is intense while summer is a dry season in consequence hozgarganta suffers relevant runoff reduction in the upper basin during summer in contrast many pools and ponds remain permanent sustaining the local fauna mesozoic and cenozoic eras represent the lithology that frame the hydrogeology in the aljibe unit where the presence of characteristic sandstones and clays determine the low permeability of the basin the ceira river basin is a tributary of the mondego river and their confluence is situated

from a catchment area of 496 89 km2 forestry main land uses dominate the basin showing three main areas the upper basin where transitional woodland shrub dominate in combination with moors and heathlands areas with presence of coniferous and mixed forests the middle basin where these forests gain relevance and the lower basin where transitional areas and complex cultivation patterns cover most of the land surface ponte cabouco gauging station 553466 4447702 in etrs89 utm zone 29 n epsg 25829 provided enough and good quality hydrological information that revealed permanent flow mean

mediterranean sea north to the city of valencia the carraixet upper river basin extends over approximately 236 5 km2 of forestry main land uses dominated by coniferous forests and transitional woodland shrub areas natural grasslands and sclerophyllous vegetation represent lower stratums in the study site urban and agricultural uses dominate the lower basin with high presence of fruit trees plantations and complex cultivation patterns the gauging station of bétera 716948 4387531 in etrs89 utm zone 30 n epsg 25830 is the perfect reference outlet to consider the study site well represented

annual rainfall ranges between 270 and 480 mm approximately while reference evapotranspiration ranges between 1000 and 1200 mm this fact indicates the study site is clearly semiarid following the typical mediterranean patterns rainfall prevail in autumn and spring while reference evapotranspiration stands out in spring and summer the driest season two main areas highlight regarding the lithology oldest formations dated as triassic in the upper basin and newest formations from the quaternary in the lower basin conglomerates sandstones limestones and multi colored clays combined with gravel soils conglomerates sands and silts determine the hydrogeology karst intensity is determinant for the percolation processes in the basin not relevant erosive processes take place in most of the basins surfaces since they are mature basins with morphological stability just in upper basin of hozgarganta some erosion risk can be deducted from huge slopes in the tributary gorges 3 2 input

the different stations available for each basin are displayed in fig 3 regarding the geomorphological relationships used in tetis they were obtained from previous studies bussi et al 2014 for carraixet the effect of transmission losses present in ephemeral rivers was taken into account by introducing a loss point per km along the main river channel transmission losses values were calculated following neitsch et al 2011 mean river width for each kilometer and a channel effective hydraulic conductivity of 3 75 mm h 1 were considered for calculation 3 3 satellite products 3 3 1 sentinel 1 sm sentinel 1 s1 soil moisture data is obtained by applying the technological university of vienna tu wien change detection method wagner 1998 to c band sentinel 1 backscatter time series which are collected in interferometric wade swath iw and vv polarization mode bauer marschallinger et al 2019 in a first step backscatter values are terrain geo corrected and radiometrically calibrated then they are normalized to a reference incidence angle considering the linear slope parameter finally relative soil moisture values expressed in from 0 to 100 are derived by scaling the normalized backscatter values between the historically driest dry reference and wettest wet reference observed values output spatial resolution is 1 km pre processing of these data consisted in two phases spatial resampling to adequate to the considered spatial projection and translation to absolute soil moisture values considering soil porosity porosity information was obtained from soilgrids bulk density following das 2013 soil moisture values were previously screened for already masked invalid pixels finally daily values were monthly aggregated to maximize the amount of data considered for the analysis a month was considered valid if it had at least 3 available days for the simplicity of notation we will refer to this product as s1 3 3 2 smap s1 smap sentinel 1 l2 radiometer radar soil moisture spl2smap s level 2 product results from the merging of soil moisture active passive smap radiometer data with sentinel 1a 1b radar data through an active passive downscaling algorithm this downscaling is obtained by two different approaches baseline and optional the baseline approach is focused on the disaggregation of the l band brightness temperature from the smap level 2 enhanced product l2 sm p e at about 33 km spatial resolution in ease2 9 km grid using the fine resolution at 1 km sentinel radar backscatter which are collected in iw swath mode and vv and vh polarization mode the soil moisture is then retrieved by applying the single channel algorithm at vertical polarization sca v to the downscaled brightness temperature in the optional approach the soil moisture available in l2 sm p e is directly disaggregated at 1 km using the sentinel backscatter cross sections das et al 2017 for the rest of the paper we will refer to smap bs for the baseline approach and smap dis for the optional approach in an analogous way to sentinel 1 ssm pre processing consisted in spatial resampling to the reference spatial projection for this case as screening for invalid pixels considering only data with good quality reduced considerably the amount of available data we decided to simply filter soil moisture values by an upper threshold given by porosity same as in sentinel 1 ssm so we could discard possible outliers finally daily values were monthly aggregated it is worth remembering at this stage that for calibration purposes we are dealing with monthly spatial patterns therefore possible uncertainties due to these considerations are minimized 3 3 3 smos bec smos soil moisture data is provided by the barcelona expert center bec we have used the level 4 product which provides estimates of smos soil moisture at 1 km across europe ssm estimates are obtained by applying a semi empirical downscaling algorithm that relates the ssm to the brightness temperature ndvi and lst piles et al 2011 piles et al 2012 inputs to the product are bec smos level 3 soil moisture that is directly generated by the l2 smos from esa expert support laboratory esl

earth surface at three incidence angles 32 5 42 5 and 52 5 daily lst or skin temperature at 12 h at around 9 km provided by the ecmwf model 16 day terra modis ndvi at 1 km during the process some considerations are addressed such as sea land contamination and gap filling of original l3 soil moisture for more information we refer to the products description file pablos et al 2020 pre processing consisted in spatial resampling and monthly aggregation ssm estimates were also filtered by an upper threshold provided by porosity ascending orbits 06 00 am were used in this study for notation simplification we will refer this product as smos bec 3 3 4 smap and smos dispatch alternatively smap and smos soil moisture estimates at 1 km were obtained considering the disaggregation based on a physical and theoretical scale change dispatch algorithm merlin et al 2013 two different low resolution surface soil moisture ssm products were used in this study the smos mission level 2 swath based ssm and the smap mission enhanced level 3 radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid ssm both products were used as input to the downscaling algorithm dispatch disaggregates low resolution ssm to higher resolution ssm by using a soil evaporative efficiency see term at higher resolution to model the spatial variability within a low resolution pixel see defined as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation is derived using land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the distribution of the high resolution ssm around the mean value of the low resolution ssm products is possible through the spatial link between the optical derived see and ssm merlin et al 2012 in this study the modis version 6 lst products onboard terra mod11a1 and aqua myd11a1 and ndvi product onboard terra mod13a were used to derive the 1 km see fields dispatch also uses elevation data extracted from the gtopo30 digital elevation to correct the lst data for topographic effects a more detailed description of the disaggregation methodology can be found in merlin et al 2013 same pre processing of the final soil moisture values as the previous cases was considered in this case only days in which the downscaling was completely successful i e proper reproduction of the 1 km spatial features were considered these products will be named from here on as smap dpat and smos dpat 4 methods 4 1 surface soil moisture products comparison comparison of the products was performed both temporally and spatially temporal agreement amongst products was assessed using series of aggregated at basin level soil moisture values and spatially distributed correlation images ssm values were normalized using temporal z scores period 2016 2020 in order to discard existing biases amongst products and make them comparable finally spatial pattern agreement was obtained by visual comparison of spatial z score ssm images these scores were calculated based on spatial mean and standard deviation of the mean ssm image period 2016 2020 4 2 model calibration 4 2 1 sensitivity analysis prior to model calibration we performed a sobol sensitivity analysis sobol et al 2001 saltelli et al 2002 2010 that ranked which parameters were more significant to model performance and allowed us to reduce the number of parameters to calibrate this method is based on an analysis of variance decomposition it can be applied to non linear models as no assumption between model input and output is required assuming that all model inputs are independent output model variance can be decomposed into component variances from individuals and their interactions the sensitivity of a single parameter or their interaction can be assessed by the percentage contribution to the total variance these percentages are the so called sobol s sensitivity indices sobol s first index correspond to the independent contribution of the input variables sobol s second index to the interaction among inputs variables and sobol s total index correspond to the gathering of these two effects this technique has been widely used for parameters sensitivity analysis in hydrological models song et al 2015 providing an in depth understanding of hydrological processes zhang et al 2013 main drawback is the high computational intensity associated requiring n x 2 m 2 model evaluations if second order effects are included herman usher 2017 where n are the samples and m the model parameters for a more detailed mathematical description we refer to original works describing the method sobol et al 2001 saltelli et al 2002 2010 and recent reviews for sensitivity analysis in hydrological modelling song et al 2015 for this study in order to minimize the associated computational cost while still preserving representativeness of the results sobol analysis was applied over a semi lumped version of the model i e natural land uses which are the ones to be calibrated were considered to share same vegetation parameters while urban and agricultural land uses corresponding parameters were previously fixed to reference values this approach substantially reduced the number of parameters in the analysis 9 hydrological parameters 11 vegetation parameters sensitivity analysis was performed separately considering for streamflow and surface soil moisture nash sutcliffe efficiency index equation 3 was used as the standard error metric in both cases for streamflow nse was evaluated against discharge observations while for ssm mean simulated values considering the natural land uses for aggregation were considered for model deviation assessment sensitivity analysis was performed over the calibration period sample size for the analysis was fixed at 500 corresponding to 21 000 model evaluations initial tests ensured the convergence of these results sensitivity parameters and associated lower and upper bounds are summarized in table 3 they were based on previous works using tetis eco hydrological model ruiz pérez et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 echeverría et al 2019 manually refined to ensure a good performance of the model during the analysis all the calculations were performed using the python salib toolbox herman usher 2017 in fig 4 sobol s sensitivity analysis indices are displayed a threshold of 1 dotted line was considered for discriminating between sensitive and insensitive parameters tang et al 2007 several conclusions can be derived from fig 4 1 regarding vegetation sub model roots and laimax can be considered as the most sensitive parameters for both ssm and q it can be deduced that lai can be more influent than some hydrological parameters in the proper representation of the discharge 2 regarding hydrological sub model different sensitive parameters were found for the different basins considered according to their hydrological characteristics for hozgarganta we observed that a more important contribution of the interflow followed by direct runoff in ceira an accurate baseflow description in the model becomes important for the reproduction of observed values for carraixet direct runoff is the major contribution to the observed streamflow followed by interflow 4 2 2 calibrations experiments and assessment metrics the initial parameters range values were established by screening the simulations performed during the sensitivity analysis nse values greater than 0 5 calibration parameters and associated ranges are summarized in table 4 for the case of roots and laimax parameters they were calibrated specifically for each of the natural land uses considered these are according to the corine classification broadleaved forests mixed forests coniferous forests natural grasslands moors and heathland sclerophyllous vegetation transitional woodland shrub and sparsely vegetated areas for the rest of the vegetation parameters they were fixed according to previous values of the literature topt was fixed at 18 c according to ruiz perez et al 2017 respiration ratio was fixed to a value of 0 066 gc gnd according to bonan et al 2003 kdecay was fixed to 0 56 according to the values provided by zhang et al 2014 from montaldo et al 2005 senescence factor was fixed in the range from 0 008 to 0 004 value of 0 006 in that study adequating to the different land uses lue values were obtained from the copernicus dry matter productivity atbd and sla values from heinsch et al 2003 imax was fixed to a value of 0 2 according to manfreda et al 2005 considering the hydrological and vegetation parameters a total of 22 16 and 16 parameters were to be calibrated for the cases of hozgarganta ceira and carraixet respectively for hozgarganta and carraixet calibration period was 2016 2017 and validation period was 2018 2019 for the case of ceira calibration period was 08 2015 to 07 2017 and validation period 03 2019 to 07 2020 approximately an additional year 7 months for the case of ceira was considered for model warm up before calibration for each of the basins considered calibration was performed based on a multi objective approach using the multiobjective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem ua algorithm vrugt et al 2003a considering discharge q and surface soil moisture ssm observations the moscem ua algorithm combines the strengths of the complex evolution used in the shuffle complex evolutionary sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 and the probabilistic search method known as covariance annealing used in shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua vrugt et al 2003b together with and improved version of the assignment method aptitude zitzler and thiele 1999 to determine an efficient estimate of the pareto frontier for this study the initial population was obtained as the product of the number of complexes for this study 10 complexes were selected and 2 nvar 1 being nvar the number of variables scale factor β and l number of new candidates in each complex were obtained following vrugt et al 2003a number of iterations were set so that at least 5000 function evaluations were performed objective functions were the nse 1 for discharge while the spatial efficiency metric spaef 1 koch et al 2018 for the evaluation of the spatial agreement between the remote sensing based soil moisture observations and tetis soil moisture simulations spaef is bias insensitive and focused only on spatial patterns demirel et al 2018 these metrics are provided in equations 3 and 4 3 nse 1 i 1 n q s i q o i i 1 n q oi q o where qs and qo are the simulated and observed flows on day i n is the total number of days and q o is the mean daily measured flow for the analysed period 4 spaef 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where α is the pearson correlation coefficient ρ a b between the observed ssm map a and simulated ssm map b for a particular month β is the fraction of coefficient of variations representing spatial variability and γ is the percentage of histogram intersection this calculation is performed after normalization of the observed and simulated maps using z scores i e mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to 1 for each particular image i e month a spaef value was obtained the mean value of these scores was considered as representative of the corresponding time series the multi objective calibration was performed for all the products considered and for the study cases as the adjustment for q and ssm is different amongst the non dominated solutions we selected for posterior analysis three solution candidates best performance in q q case best performance in ssm ssm case and a compromise solution in the performance of both q and sm q ssm case the first two points were selected by seeking for the point in the pareto frontier that maximises the corresponding objective functions i e nse for q and spaef for ssm the third point was the one with minimum euclidean distance to the reference point this reference point is obtained considering the best objective value for each of the two objectives functions previous to distance calculation these objective function values were normalized between the maximum and minimum values respectively 4 3 model evaluation evaluation of the different experiments q case ssm case and q ssm case was performed by quantitative analysis of nse and spaef metrics in addition for q ssm case spatial patterns are provided for a visual assessment of the agreement between simulated and observed ssm series aggregated at basin level and spatially distributed correlation maps allowed the comparison of the temporal dynamics of ssm 5 results 5 1 rs soil moisture inter comparison fig 5 shows the temporal dynamics of the soil moisture products considered over the respective basins values were calculated considering natural land uses i e no irrigation fig 6 displays the spatially distributed correlation coefficient images for completeness they were calculated over the whole basin area it is clearly observed fig 5 that for the three cases of study ceira is the one in which a clear temporal agreement between the different soil moisture products exists most discrepant product is s1 which also reproduces a discrepant behaviour for the other two study cases the temporal evolution showed some negative 08 2016 till 12 2019 and positive year 2020 bias in s1 for this study case in addition the temporal correlation coefficient for s1 ranges between 0 2 to 0 8 while the rest of the cases yield values in the range 0 8 1 0 fig 6 nevertheless all products represent the corresponding monthly rain events period 08 2017 to 08 2018 has no precipitation records fig 5 in the case of hozgarganta main discrepancies arise also for s1 product that still shows some clear bias and smos dpat product with a positive value in 2017 that do not relate to the observed precipitation fig 5 the temporal correlation coefficient for s1 smos dpat ranges between 0 2 to 0 8 0 6 respectively while the rest of the cases yield values in the range 0 8 1 0 fig 6 the ssm temporal evolution clearly follows the precipitation evolution fig 5 for carraixet main discrepant temporal evolutions are s1 and smos bec for s1 a clear bias is observed in addition it does not follow precipitation monthly amounts 2018 2019 and 2020 fig 6 shows s1 correlation coefficient values in the range of 0 2 to 0 6 it is worth highlighting that this poor performance is related to land uses while inconsistencies were observed for the forest and natural land uses upper part of the basin they have been found less evident for the agriculture uses lower part of the basin fig 7 displays the spatial patterns that refer to the standardized spatial anomalies of the mean values for the period 2016 2020 spatial patterns matched for products that share the same disaggregating methodology this fact is reproduced for the three cases of study for hozgarganta smap dis and smap bs share a similar spatial pattern while also for the case of smap dpat and smos dpat smos bec provides the most discrepant spatial pattern amongst products for ceira smap dis smap bs smap dpat smos dpat s1 show a comparable behaviour respectively smos bec shares a more similar pattern to this last one group for carraixet same behaviour as in ceira is reproduced in exception of smos bec 5 2 model performance for the different soil moisture products 5 2 1 calibration fig 8 displays the calibration results for the study cases values are summarized in table s1 of supplementary material q is well represented in every case analysed only exception was found in the analysis of some products in carraixet for the ssm case nse 0 4 and ceira smos bec for the ssm case nse 0 5 q case provided the best nse values in every case study although q ssm case raised comparable results nse 0 65 0 75 ssm case showed the best spaef values with slight differences comparing to other approaches however spaef values can provide maximum deviations greater than 0 45 for the different product combinations and study cases this fact indicates that the spatial agreement between the soil moisture products and the model simulations will become more determinant in the selection of the best performing combinations than the nse carraixet is clearly the one in which tetis provides a major spatial agreement followed by ceira and hozgarganta focusing on the comparison of the different product combinations for each of the study case we observe that for hozgarganta smos dpat followed closely by smap dpat provides the best spaef values for all the cases q 0 243 ssm 0 117 and q ssm 0 215 smos bec and smap dis provide a similar performance ranging from 0 250 to 0 318 in every cases while smap bs and s1 provide the worst performance spaef lower than 0 340 in every case for ceira smap bs and smap dis are the worst ranking in spaef values values lower than 0 4 s1 smos bec smos dpat and smap dpat provide a better performance in the q ssm case s1 ranks the best in nse value of 0 726 while smos bec ranks the best in spaef value of 0 112 smos dpat however ranks better than smos bec in nse while still having closer spaef values 0 137 smap dpat is the one amongst these four that provides the worst performance in spaef for carraixet smos bec provides a different behaviour it always provides worst performing spaef values for the three cases thus indicating that tetis is never able to reproduce the associated spatial patterns for the rest of the products s1 smap dpat and smos dpat rank the best in terms of spatial agreement fig 9 displays the spatial patterns for the calibration period q ssm case smap dpat and smos dpat showed the major agreement for hozgarganta ceira and carraixet in addition s1 works properly for ceira and carraixet although the number of available pixels in ceira is not significant to state the agreement smos bec must be highlighted in the case of ceira similar main spatial patterns were provided by tetis for the reference products transitional pixels between the main different areas of the standardized anomalies were highly affected by the reference product considered in the calibration process in exception of carraixet in which the main spatial patterns are best fitting the reference product fig 10 shows the correlation coefficient maps q ssm case tetis simulations provide the worst agreement with s1 for all the study cases and smos dpat for hozgarganta other cases have correlation coefficient values greater than 0 8 thus indicating the temporal agreement exceptions are smap dis for ceira and hozgarganta and smos bec for carraixet with correlation values between 0 2 and 0 8 temporal evolution of ssm were coherent to precipitations in every case study fig 11 differences between reference products were observed only in terms of absolute ssm values 5 2 2 validation fig 12 displays the validation results for the three case studies values are summarized in table s2 of supplementary material tetis tends to provide a worse performance during the validation phase than during the calibration phase only cases in which this is not accomplished are ssm case for ceira smap dpat smos bec and carraixet all products in exception of smos bec for carraixet calibrating the model in order to adjust to only one variable will result in an improper performance while nse values in the calibrating phase fig 8 are acceptable they are not able to reproduce the validation observations fig 12 on the contrary adjusting only to ssm provides an unacceptable performance in calibration nse 0 4 while a surprisingly good performance during validation these results indicated that the inclusion of ssm in a multi objective calibration increased the model capability to reproduce not only the ssm spatial patterns but also the q in different hydrologic periods considering the q ssm case for all the study cases and products combinations nse 0 5 is provided calibrations and validation nse values are also in agreement this indicates that all the combinations provide a realistic description of the discharge and therefore supporting the validity of the multi objective calibration approach moving to each study case comparison for hozgarganta the calibration candidate s combinations smap dpat and smos dpat provide nse values 0 65 being smap dpat the best option in terms of spaef with slight differences with the rest of the products however spaef values are lower than 0 2 thus preventing to state the agreement between the models estimates and products observations in consequence no particular product can be highlighted for its performance in both q and ssm in the hozgarganta study case moving to ceira again smap dpat and smos dpat provide the best performance in both nse and spaef although s1 and smos bec still provided acceptable results in terms of nse the spatial performance was worse spaef 0 2 smos dpat is preferred because of the good performance in both calibration and validation periods finally for carraixet s1 smap dpat and smos dpat provided good performance in both nse and spaef it is remarkably that s1 actually provided the best nse metric in spite of the unrealistic temporal behaviour observed followed closely by smos dpat and smap dpat fig 13 displays the spatial patterns for the validation period q ssm case results are analogous to the calibration period smap dpat and smos dpat still provided the best agreement in all the case studies with s1 performing particularly well also in carraixet fig 14 shows the correlation coefficient maps s1 again provided the worst temporal agreement with a slight improvement in ceira the rest of the combinations provided correlation values over 0 5 with smap products best fitting finally the ssm temporal evolution in this period fig 15 again is coherent to precipitations in every case study still showing main differences in terms of absolute ssm values 6 discussion coarse spatial resolution of satellite ssm smap and smos estimates products have only provided the opportunity of considering the temporal dynamic of the ssm variable when regional studies of hydrological implementation were approached since the existing downscaling methods piles et al 2011 piles et al 2012 merlin et al 2013 provide increased spatial resolutions in addition to new sensor estimates bauer marschallinger et al 2019 we postulate that the inclusion of spatial patterns in the implementation of hydrological models may improve their performance there is a lack of testing the improved spatial information of these downscaled products in small basins specifically in the mediterranean region this study evaluates the suitability of several 1 km spatial ssm estimates s1 smap bs smap dis smos bec smap dpat smos dpat for this purpose as first step a comparison of the available products is required we observed that the agreement among the spatial and temporal dynamics of the evaluated products is not as good as expected the suitability of hydrological distributed models for the reproduction of main hydrological state variables have already been demonstrated ruiz pérez et al 2016 ruiz pérez et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 echeverría et al 2019 barrientos et al 2020 thus we can consider these models as validation tools to test the performance of the available comparable products particularly the tetis conceptual model has demonstrated to be a good choice for this purpose echeverría et al 2019 this paper encompasses first the multi objective and multi variable calibration of the model considering previously described ssm products second the analysis of pareto frontiers in terms of temporal dynamics of streamflow spatial agreement of ssm and both finally the performance comparison amongst the different products despite the significant differences amongst ssm products results showed an improvement when the ssm spatial patterns were considered in the calibration process we observed that not all the products have the same agreement with tetis results in the comparison of the ssm products we observed a relative temporal agreement in exception of s1 that has different temporal dynamics this product showed a strong overestimation of the ssm during dry months in carraixet previous studies escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 pointed out that in semi arid regions the artificial increase in soil moisture can be the result of the increase in the effective soil roughness due to volume scattering this poor performance can be also associated to different factors firstly s1 retrieval algorithm does not consider vegetation dynamics on radar backscatter signal thus leading to potential biases during vegetation full development bauer marschallinger et al 2019 in addition the sensitivity of the c band backscatter is likely to be reduced in high density vegetated areas with leaf area index larger than 0 6 ohja et al 2021 the temporal agreement between products is higher in ceira than the other two basins the location of the study sites may have influence in the ssm retrieval although the three basins share some issues in the soil moisture retrieval topography dense vegetation it is true that ceira is in an easier to solve area for the retrieval carraixet is close to the coast thus some noise can affect due to sea land disturbance water areas present near hozgarganta can also disfavour the ssm retrieval nevertheless in spite of some exceptions s1 and smos dpat for hozgarganta all the products generally agree in their temporal dynamics correlation coefficient greater than 0 4 in fig 6 portal et al 2020 performed a comparison between smap and smos products over the iberian peninsula and they observed the same general temporal agreement in this study they also pointed out that the methodology employed for the downscaling depend on the scale information the ssm products employed s1 radar backscatter lst ndvi land use we observe this same conclusion for the products considered fig 7 shows that for spatial patterns the disaggregating methodology employed is more relevant than the sensor i e smos smap s1 traditional approaches consider only streamflow information in the calibration process considering another state variable as unique objective function does not prevent the problem of equifinality therefore to follow a multi objective approach is recommended dembelé et al 2020b although calibrating considering separately in q and ssm will result in good implementations we decided to compare their effect in the pareto frontier selecting the best performing non dominated solutions in terms of q and ssm gave us an idea of their relevance in a comparable context comparing the calibration and validation phases we found that the model conducted more robustly when both q and ssm information was considered through the selection of an optimum non dominated solution particularly intermittent streams such as carraixet will improve the adjustment of its hydrology i e ssm patterns through this approach during dry periods in which q is not enough representative this fact was advanced by the sensitivity analysis fig 4 where correction factor related to the static storage fc1 was the most relevant the spatial pattern of the precipitation intensely determines the ssm spatial patterns offered by the model thus the calibration considering different ssm reference products introduced variations limited to transitional areas between homologous main spatial patterns this endorses the fact that using physically based models is a good criterion to validate satellite products the dependency on the calibration and validation periods is expected to be additionally high nevertheless we cannot test this hypothesis since the ssm observed data is limited mostly to the period from 2015 to present spaef results are frequently negative or mostly nulls similar to other authors i e dembelé et al 2020a these evidence possible causes incoherencies in the ssm retrieval lack of representativity in spatial resolution temporal limitations of satellite products and or differences in input data generation the influence of land use has been reported by burgin et al 2017 and soil hydraulic properties has been previously reported by baroni et al 2010 livneh et al 2015 ayana et al 2019 smap dpat and smos dpat were the products that provided better spatial agreement to the tetis outputs additionally s1 provided remarkable agreement in carraixet in ceira case study we cannot state the agreement to s1 since few pixels are available for comparison thus to decide while s1 is useful in the mediterranean region other basins need to be evaluated on the contrary we can state that lobelia products provide the best representation of the ssm spatial patterns in the selected case studies limitations in this study open the door to future research higher spatial resolution higher reliability of spatial products and higher temporal coverage may lead to improved adjustments results can be model dependent in consequence we encourage other models to be tested under this approach recently new metrics for spatial pattern comparison have aroused such as spaef however this is still an active field of research new metrics algorithms and objective functions should be considered before performing similar analysis inclusion of spatial patterns from complementary state variables in multi objective calibration efforts is challenging but it is expected to offer promising results dembelé et al 2020a 7 conclusions we explored the usefulness of eco hydrological distributed modelling as a validation tool for remote sensing ssm products this study provides a valuable advance in the filling of the existent gap in the validation of the spatial patterns of current ssm products the study frame is the mediterranean region in which three small basins were selected as representative case studies within this context differences in temporal and spatial dynamics of the reference products were found the multi objective calibration approach proposed increased the robustness of the modelling despite the differences amongst products while smap dpat and smos dpat achieved the best agreement in terms of spatial and temporal representativeness the other products showed some strengths s1 did not provided a realistic temporal evolution in contrast the spatial patterns fitted correctly the distribution provided by tetis model unfortunately the data is not sufficient in all the basins this is the case of ceira in carraixet s1 agreement was comparable to smap dpat and smos dpat results smap bs and smap dis showed an opposite behaviour with a good temporal representation but poor spatial representativeness for some specific cases this is more evident in the case of ceira finally smos bec followed the line of smap bs and smap dis showing spatial disagreement between model simulations and observations limitations of this study have been highlighted model dependency uncertainties in ssm products temporal calibration validation periods restrictions 2015 present although results are dependent on the basin characteristics case

3474,reliable distributed hydrological modeling especially in semi arid areas must consider the inclusion of surface soil moisture ssm spatial information during the calibration process this variable plays a key role in the evapotranspiration processes that determine the hydrological cycle the coarse resolution of the ssm estimates by satellite remote sensing has restricted the application of this approach to only large basins focusing most of the studies in the consideration of simply the temporal dynamics of this variable the growing efforts in providing higher spatial resolution through disaggregating methodologies or new sensor estimates facilitates the application of this spatial approach to small basins this paper explores the applicability of the currently available satellite surface soil moisture estimates for distributed eco hydrological modelling in mediterranean forest basins on one hand this study contributes to fill the existing research gap on the use of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns within the distributed hydrological modelling framework in small basins on the other hand it serves as an indirect validation method for the spatial performance of satellite ssm products to achieve this goal we implemented the eco hydrological model tetis in three case studies named hozgarganta southern spain ceira western portugal and carraixet eastern spain the ssm estimates selected for comparison were sentinel 1 ssm provided by the copernicus global land services cgls smap ssm disaggregated using sentinel 1 spl2smap s provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa smos ssm provided by the barcelona expert center bec and smos and smap ssm disaggregated using the dispatch algorithm provided by lobelia earth the methodology employed involved a multi objective and multi variable calibration in terms of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns and in situ streamflow using the spatial efficiency metric spaef and the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse respectively before model calibration a sensitivity analysis of the most influent variables was performed the temporal and spatial comparison of the reference ssm products revealed inconsistencies amongst products the disaggregating methodology determined the spatial agreement to a greater degree than the sensor itself i e smap smos in spite of the differences amongst products the multi objective calibration approach proposed increased the robustness of the hydrological modelling keywords surface soil moisture remote sensing spatial patterns eco hydrological modelling multi variable calibration 1 introduction the reliable determination of the hydrological variables in a catchment has been a challenging objective for a long time many hydrological models have emerged as a response to growing demand of operational tools amongst them deterministic distributed hydrological models offering spatial explicit predictions can fulfil the lack of spatial representation of the dominant hydrological processes when available in situ observations are not sufficient traditionally hydrological model calibration was based on solely streamflow information however this does not guarantee the correct representation of the spatial heterogeneity of other state variables rajib et al 2016 wambura et al 2018 the introduction in hydrological models of satellite derived information has the potential to overcome this limitation by improving models performance both temporally and spatially laiolo et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 herman et al 2018 dembelé et al 2020a additionally it should not be ignored the existing relationship between vegetation dynamics and the related hydrological processes thus vegetation requires proper representation in eco hydrological models to attend reliability requirements in catchments with representative areas of forestry or agricultural uses pasquato et al 2015 ruiz pérez et al 2017 bai et al 2018 the surface soil moisture information derived from satellite data has been commonly employed for improvement in the hydrological modelling due to its importance in the description of the hydrological cycle gcos 2019 especially in semi arid areas this has been mostly done via assimilation laiolo et al 2016 alvarez garreton et al 2016 abbaszadeh et al 2020 khaki et al 2020 or direct calibration approaches wanders et al 2014 silvestro et al 2015 rajib et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 dembelé et al 2020a most of the studies have focused on the temporal dynamics of the ssm mainly due to the coarse spatial resolution of the available estimates special attention to spatial patterns was restricted only to large basins dembelé et al 2020a the growing efforts in providing higher spatial resolution through disaggregating methodologies merlin et al 2013 piles et al 2011 piles et al 2012 das et al 2019 or new sensor estimates bauer marschallinger et al 2019 allow to provide operational estimations at 1 km which is an accepted basic assumption for eco hydrological resources management sabaghy et al 2020 thus the emerging research performed in hydrological model evaluation and calibration based on spatial patterns koch et al 2015 mendiguren et al 2017 demirel et al 2018 koch et al 2018 zink et al 2018 can be transferred to ssm for medium and small basins however there is an underlying uncertainty in current ssm products fang et al 2016 al yaari et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and model performance is dependent on the selection of the reference product used for calibration dembelé et al 2020b in consequence a previous analysis of their performance before the calibration process is necessary this paper is aimed at the evaluation of the current available satellite soil moisture products at 1 km spatial resolution for distributed eco hydrological modelling in mediterranean basins firstly it contributes to fill the existing research gap on the use of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns within the distributed hydrological modelling framework in small basins secondly it serves as an indirect validation method of the spatial performance of satellite ssm products to achieve these goals we selected tetis hydrological model francés et al 2007 which is a conceptual deterministic model in its tanks structure processes are represented by parameters that are physically based and spatially distributed it has a dynamic vegetation sub model pasquato 2013 pasquato et al 2015 and has been implemented in several case studies e g ruiz pérez et al 2016 ruiz pérez et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 echeverría et al 2019 barrientos et al 2020 echevarria et al 2019 stated the possibility of calibrating the tetis model basing exclusively in satellite information three case studies named carraixet eastern spain hozgarganta southern spain and ceira western portugal have been strategically selected to perform this research in the mediterranean region four different sources of ssm estimates were considered for the study sentinel 1 ssm provided by copernicus global land services cgls smos ssm provided by the barcelona expert center bec smap ssm disaggregated using sentinel 1 provided by nasa and smos and smap ssm disaggregated using the dispatch algorithm provided by lobelia earth the methodology employed involved a multi objective multi variable calibration in terms of remote sensing ssm spatial patterns and in situ streamflow the paper contents are organised as follows section 2 introduces tetis eco hydrological model section 3 deals with the description of the study sites and the data employed in tetis implementation together with a description of the ssm products considered it includes the methodology employed for the remote sensing ssm product comparison model calibration steps sensitivity analysis calibration experiments and assessment metrics and model evaluation section 5 and 6 provide the results and their discussion respectively finally section 8 summarizes the main conclusions derived from this study 2 tetis eco hydrological model tetis is a hydrological conceptual distributed model useful for both for flood event and continuous simulation the tetis model bases the runoff production on the water balance calculation for each cell the water is assumed to be distributed in six conceptual storage tanks interconnected fig 1 a the tanks represent the capacity in the water storage by the vegetation cover t6 the static storage t1 the surface storage t2 the gravitational storage t3 and the aquifer t4 the sixth tank t5 represents the channel when it exists in the cell as shown in fig 1c the water volumes h stored in each tank are the state variables of the model tetis has a modular structure in consequence these h states depend on the conceptual schema adopted due to the spatially distributed conceptualization the morphological and hydrologic characteristics of the soil in each cell also determine h states the modules in tetis are conceptualized as an interconnected three dimensional mesh t2 t3 and t4 drain into the corresponding downstream one following the flow directions proposed by the digital elevation model dem and reaching the drainage network that consists of gullies and channels fig 1c the cases where the destination cell is a gully both the overland flow and interflow integrate into it while the base flow drains to the downstream cell in channel cells all the output flows integrate into the river channel tank t5 threshold areas are parametrized to discriminate between these three types of cells hillside gullies and river channel summarizing runoff translation along the basin considers that non abstracted water circulates on the hillslopes until to the natural drainage network of the basin is reached onwards water flows through the drainage network itself conceptual simplifications of the laws of the hydraulics in natural channels are included in tetis the kinematic wave supports the tetis modelling approach assuming uniform flow and comparable friction and channel slopes as a simplification of the saint venant shallow water equations the kinematic wave integrated in tetis neglects the terms corresponding to inertial and pressure effects in the equation of conservation of energy on the other hand the hydraulic characteristics of the riverbeds are parametrized in tetis consequently characteristic geomorphological information of the basins can be accounted for the eco hydrological configuration of tetis includes a dynamic vegetation model in which the static storage tank t1 splits into two tanks fig 1b associated to the different layers found in the first horizons of the soil the shallow static storage t1a the deep static storage t1b t1a involves the processes of

the different stations available for each basin are displayed in fig 3 regarding the geomorphological relationships used in tetis they were obtained from previous studies bussi et al 2014 for carraixet the effect of transmission losses present in ephemeral rivers was taken into account by introducing a loss point per km along the main river channel transmission losses values were calculated following neitsch et al 2011 mean river width for each kilometer and a channel effective hydraulic conductivity of 3 75 mm h 1 were considered for calculation 3 3 satellite products 3 3 1 sentinel 1 sm sentinel 1 s1 soil moisture data is obtained by applying the technological university of vienna tu wien change detection method wagner 1998 to c band sentinel 1 backscatter time series which are collected in interferometric wade swath iw and vv polarization mode bauer marschallinger et al 2019 in a first step backscatter values are terrain geo corrected and radiometrically calibrated then they are normalized to a reference incidence angle considering the linear slope parameter finally relative soil moisture values expressed in from 0 to 100 are derived by scaling the normalized backscatter values between the historically driest dry reference and wettest wet reference observed values output spatial resolution is 1 km pre processing of these data consisted in two phases spatial resampling to adequate to the considered spatial projection and translation to absolute soil moisture values considering soil porosity porosity information was obtained from soilgrids bulk density following das 2013 soil moisture values were previously screened for already masked invalid pixels finally daily values were monthly aggregated to maximize the amount of data considered for the analysis a month was considered valid if it had at least 3 available days for the simplicity of notation we will refer to this product as s1 3 3 2 smap s1 smap sentinel 1 l2 radiometer radar soil moisture spl2smap s level 2 product results from the merging of soil moisture active passive smap radiometer data with sentinel 1a 1b radar data through an active passive downscaling algorithm this downscaling is obtained by two different approaches baseline and optional the baseline approach is focused on the disaggregation of the l band brightness temperature from the smap level 2 enhanced product l2 sm p e at about 33 km spatial resolution in ease2 9 km grid using the fine resolution at 1 km sentinel radar backscatter which are collected in iw swath mode and vv and vh polarization mode the soil moisture is then retrieved by applying the single channel algorithm at vertical polarization sca v to the downscaled brightness temperature in the optional approach the soil moisture available in l2 sm p e is directly disaggregated at 1 km using the sentinel backscatter cross sections das et al 2017 for the rest of the paper we will refer to smap bs for the baseline approach and smap dis for the optional approach in an analogous way to sentinel 1 ssm pre processing consisted in spatial resampling to the reference spatial projection for this case as screening for invalid pixels considering only data with good quality reduced considerably the amount of available data we decided to simply filter soil moisture values by an upper threshold given by porosity same as in sentinel 1 ssm so we could discard possible outliers finally daily values were monthly aggregated it is worth remembering at this stage that for calibration purposes we are dealing with monthly spatial patterns therefore possible uncertainties due to these considerations are minimized 3 3 3 smos bec smos soil moisture data is provided by the barcelona expert center bec we have used the level 4 product which provides estimates of smos soil moisture at 1 km across europe ssm estimates are obtained by applying a semi empirical downscaling algorithm that relates the ssm to the brightness temperature ndvi and lst piles et al 2011 piles et al 2012 inputs to the product are bec smos level 3 soil moisture that is directly generated by the l2 smos from esa expert support laboratory esl

considerations are addressed such as sea land contamination and gap filling of original l3 soil moisture for more information we refer to the products description file pablos et al 2020 pre processing consisted in spatial resampling and monthly aggregation ssm estimates were also filtered by an upper threshold provided by porosity ascending orbits 06 00 am were used in this study for notation simplification we will refer this product as smos bec 3 3 4 smap and smos dispatch alternatively smap and smos soil moisture estimates at 1 km were obtained considering the disaggregation based on a physical and theoretical scale change dispatch algorithm merlin et al 2013 two different low resolution surface soil moisture ssm products were used in this study the smos mission level 2 swath based ssm and the smap mission enhanced level 3 radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid ssm both products were used as input to the downscaling algorithm dispatch disaggregates low resolution ssm to higher resolution ssm by using a soil evaporative efficiency see term at higher resolution to model the spatial variability within a low resolution pixel see defined as the ratio of actual to potential evaporation is derived using land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the distribution of the high resolution ssm around the mean value of the low resolution ssm products is possible through the spatial link between the optical derived see and ssm merlin et al 2012 in this study the modis version 6 lst products onboard terra mod11a1 and aqua myd11a1 and ndvi product onboard terra mod13a were used to derive the 1 km see fields dispatch also uses elevation data extracted from the gtopo30 digital elevation to correct the lst data for topographic effects a more detailed description of the disaggregation methodology can be found in merlin et al 2013 same pre processing of the final soil moisture values as the previous cases was considered in this case only days in which the downscaling was completely successful i e proper reproduction of the 1 km spatial features were considered these products will be named from here on as smap dpat and smos dpat 4 methods 4 1 surface soil moisture products comparison comparison of the products was performed both temporally and spatially temporal agreement amongst products was assessed using series of aggregated at basin level soil moisture values and spatially distributed correlation images ssm values were normalized using temporal z scores period 2016 2020 in order to discard existing biases amongst products and make them comparable finally spatial pattern agreement was obtained by visual comparison of spatial z score ssm images these scores were calculated based on spatial mean and standard deviation of the mean ssm image period 2016 2020 4 2 model calibration 4 2 1 sensitivity analysis prior to model calibration we performed a sobol sensitivity analysis sobol et al 2001 saltelli et al 2002 2010 that ranked which parameters were more significant to model performance and allowed us to reduce the number of parameters to calibrate this method is based on an analysis of variance decomposition it can be applied to non linear models as no assumption between model input and output is required assuming that all model inputs are independent output model variance can be decomposed into component variances from individuals and their interactions the sensitivity of a single parameter or their interaction can be assessed by the percentage contribution to the total variance these percentages are the so called sobol s sensitivity indices sobol s first index correspond to the independent contribution of the input variables sobol s second index to the interaction among inputs variables and sobol s total index correspond to the gathering of these two effects this technique has been widely used for parameters sensitivity analysis in hydrological models song et al 2015 providing an in depth understanding of hydrological processes zhang et al 2013 main drawback is the high computational intensity associated requiring n x 2 m 2 model evaluations if second order effects are included herman usher 2017 where n are the samples and m the model parameters for a more detailed mathematical description we refer to original works describing the method sobol et al 2001 saltelli et al 2002 2010 and recent reviews for sensitivity analysis in hydrological modelling song et al 2015 for this study in order to minimize the associated computational cost while still preserving representativeness of the results sobol analysis was applied over a semi lumped version of the model i e natural land uses which are the ones to be calibrated were considered to share same vegetation parameters while urban and agricultural land uses corresponding parameters were previously fixed to reference values this approach substantially reduced the number of parameters in the analysis 9 hydrological parameters 11 vegetation parameters sensitivity analysis was performed separately considering for streamflow and surface soil moisture nash sutcliffe efficiency index equation 3 was used as the standard error metric in both cases for streamflow nse was evaluated against discharge observations while for ssm mean simulated values considering the natural land uses for aggregation were considered for model deviation assessment sensitivity analysis was performed over the calibration period sample size for the analysis was fixed at 500 corresponding to 21 000 model evaluations initial tests ensured the convergence of these results sensitivity parameters and associated lower and upper bounds are summarized in table 3 they were based on previous works using tetis eco hydrological model ruiz pérez et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 echeverría et al 2019 manually refined to ensure a good performance of the model during the analysis all the calculations were performed using the python salib toolbox herman usher 2017 in fig 4 sobol s sensitivity analysis indices are displayed a threshold of 1 dotted line was considered for discriminating between sensitive and insensitive parameters tang et al 2007 several conclusions can be derived from fig 4 1 regarding vegetation sub model roots and laimax can be considered as the most sensitive parameters for both ssm and q it can be deduced that lai can be more influent than some hydrological parameters in the proper representation of the discharge 2 regarding hydrological sub model different sensitive parameters were found for the different basins considered according to their hydrological characteristics for hozgarganta we observed that a more important contribution of the interflow followed by direct runoff in ceira an accurate baseflow description in the model becomes important for the reproduction of observed values for carraixet direct runoff is the major contribution to the observed streamflow followed by interflow 4 2 2 calibrations experiments and assessment metrics the initial parameters range values were established by screening the simulations performed during the sensitivity analysis nse values greater than 0 5 calibration parameters and associated ranges are summarized in table 4 for the case of roots and laimax parameters they were calibrated specifically for each of the natural land uses considered these are according to the corine classification broadleaved forests mixed forests coniferous forests natural grasslands moors and heathland sclerophyllous vegetation transitional woodland shrub and sparsely vegetated areas for the rest of the vegetation parameters they were fixed according to previous values of the literature topt was fixed at 18 c according to ruiz perez et al 2017 respiration ratio was fixed to a value of 0 066 gc gnd according to bonan et al 2003 kdecay was fixed to 0 56 according to the values provided by zhang et al 2014 from montaldo et al 2005 senescence factor was fixed in the range from 0 008 to 0 004 value of 0 006 in that study adequating to the different land uses lue values were obtained from the copernicus dry matter productivity atbd and sla values from heinsch et al 2003 imax was fixed to a value of 0 2 according to manfreda et al 2005 considering the hydrological and vegetation parameters a total of 22 16 and 16 parameters were to be calibrated for the cases of hozgarganta ceira and carraixet respectively for hozgarganta and carraixet calibration period was 2016 2017 and validation period was 2018 2019 for the case of ceira calibration period was 08 2015 to 07 2017 and validation period 03 2019 to 07 2020 approximately an additional year 7 months for the case of ceira was considered for model warm up before calibration for each of the basins considered calibration was performed based on a multi objective approach using the multiobjective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem ua algorithm vrugt et al 2003a considering discharge q and surface soil moisture ssm observations the moscem ua algorithm combines the strengths of the complex evolution used in the shuffle complex evolutionary sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 and the probabilistic search method known as covariance annealing used in shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua vrugt et al 2003b together with and improved version of the assignment method aptitude zitzler and thiele 1999 to determine an efficient estimate of the pareto frontier for this study the initial population was obtained as the product of the number of complexes for this study 10 complexes were selected and 2 nvar 1 being nvar the number of variables scale factor β and l number of new candidates in each complex were obtained following vrugt et al 2003a number of iterations were set so that at least 5000 function evaluations were performed objective functions were the nse 1 for discharge while the spatial efficiency metric spaef 1 koch et al 2018 for the evaluation of the spatial agreement between the remote sensing based soil moisture observations and tetis soil moisture simulations spaef is bias insensitive and focused only on spatial patterns demirel et al 2018 these metrics are provided in equations 3 and 4 3 nse 1 i 1 n q s i q o i i 1 n q oi q o where qs and qo are the simulated and observed flows on day i n is the total number of days and q o is the mean daily measured flow for the analysed period 4 spaef 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where α is the pearson correlation coefficient ρ a b between the observed ssm map a and simulated ssm map b for a particular month β is the fraction of coefficient of variations representing spatial variability and γ is the percentage of histogram intersection this calculation is performed after normalization of the observed and simulated maps using z scores i e mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal to 1 for each particular image i e month a spaef value was obtained the mean value of these scores was considered as representative of the corresponding time series the multi objective calibration was performed for all the products considered and for the study cases as the adjustment for q and ssm is different amongst the non dominated solutions we selected for posterior analysis three solution candidates best performance in q q case best performance in ssm ssm case and a compromise solution in the performance of both q and sm q ssm case the first two points were selected by seeking for the point in the pareto frontier that maximises the corresponding objective functions i e nse for q and spaef for ssm the third point was the one with minimum euclidean distance to the reference point this reference point is obtained considering the best objective value for each of the two objectives functions previous to distance calculation these objective function values were normalized between the maximum and minimum values respectively 4 3 model evaluation evaluation of the different experiments q case ssm case and q ssm case was performed by quantitative analysis of nse and spaef metrics in addition for q ssm case spatial patterns are provided for a visual assessment of the agreement between simulated and observed ssm series aggregated at basin level and spatially distributed correlation maps allowed the comparison of the temporal dynamics of ssm 5 results 5 1 rs soil moisture inter comparison fig 5 shows the temporal dynamics of the soil moisture products considered over the respective basins values were calculated considering natural land uses i e no irrigation fig 6 displays the spatially distributed correlation coefficient images for completeness they were calculated over the whole basin area it is clearly observed fig 5 that for the three cases of study ceira is the one in which a clear temporal agreement between the different soil moisture products exists most discrepant product is s1 which also reproduces a discrepant behaviour for the other two study cases the temporal evolution showed some negative 08 2016 till 12 2019 and positive year 2020 bias in s1 for this study case in addition the temporal correlation coefficient for s1 ranges between 0 2 to 0 8 while the rest of the cases yield values in the range 0 8 1 0 fig 6 nevertheless all products represent the corresponding monthly rain events period 08 2017 to 08 2018 has no precipitation records fig 5 in the case of hozgarganta main discrepancies arise also for s1 product that still shows some clear bias and smos dpat product with a positive value in 2017 that do not relate to the observed precipitation fig 5 the temporal correlation coefficient for s1 smos dpat ranges between 0 2 to 0 8 0 6 respectively while the rest of the cases yield values in the range 0 8 1 0 fig 6 the ssm temporal evolution clearly follows the precipitation evolution fig 5 for carraixet main discrepant temporal evolutions are s1 and smos bec for s1 a clear bias is observed in addition it does not follow precipitation monthly amounts 2018 2019 and 2020 fig 6 shows s1 correlation coefficient values in the range of 0 2 to 0 6 it is worth highlighting that this poor performance is related to land uses while inconsistencies were observed for the forest and natural land uses upper part of the basin they have been found less evident for the agriculture uses lower part of the basin fig 7 displays the spatial patterns that refer to the standardized spatial anomalies of the mean values for the period 2016 2020 spatial patterns matched for products that share the same disaggregating methodology this fact is reproduced for the three cases of study for hozgarganta smap dis and smap bs share a similar spatial pattern while also for the case of smap dpat and smos dpat smos bec provides the most discrepant spatial pattern amongst products for ceira smap dis smap bs smap dpat smos dpat s1 show a comparable behaviour respectively smos bec shares a more similar pattern to this last one group for carraixet same behaviour as in ceira is reproduced in exception of smos bec 5 2 model performance for the different soil moisture products 5 2 1 calibration fig 8 displays the calibration results for the study cases values are summarized in table s1 of supplementary material q is well represented in every case analysed only exception was found in the analysis of some products in carraixet for the ssm case nse 0 4 and ceira smos bec for the ssm case nse 0 5 q case provided the best nse values in every case study although q ssm case raised comparable results nse 0 65 0 75 ssm case showed the best spaef values with slight differences comparing to other approaches however spaef values can provide maximum deviations greater than 0 45 for the different product combinations and study cases this fact indicates that the spatial agreement between the soil moisture products and the model simulations will become more determinant in the selection of the best performing combinations than the nse carraixet is clearly the one in which tetis provides a major spatial agreement followed by ceira and hozgarganta focusing on the comparison of the different product combinations for each of the study case we observe that for hozgarganta smos dpat followed closely by smap dpat provides the best spaef values for all the cases q 0 243 ssm 0 117 and q ssm 0 215 smos bec and smap dis provide a similar performance ranging from 0 250 to 0 318 in every cases while smap bs and s1 provide the worst performance spaef lower than 0 340 in every case for ceira smap bs and smap dis are the worst ranking in spaef values values lower than 0 4 s1 smos bec smos dpat and smap dpat provide a better performance in the q ssm case s1 ranks the best in nse value of 0 726 while smos bec ranks the best in spaef value of 0 112 smos dpat however ranks better than smos bec in nse while still having closer spaef values 0 137 smap dpat is the one amongst these four that provides the worst performance in spaef for carraixet smos bec provides a different behaviour it always provides worst performing spaef values for the three cases thus indicating that tetis is never able to reproduce the associated spatial patterns for the rest of the products s1 smap dpat and smos dpat rank the best in terms of spatial agreement fig 9 displays the spatial patterns for the calibration period q ssm case smap dpat and smos dpat showed the major agreement for hozgarganta ceira and carraixet in addition s1 works properly for ceira and carraixet although the number of available pixels in ceira is not significant to state the agreement smos bec must be highlighted in the case of ceira similar main spatial patterns were provided by tetis for the reference products transitional pixels between the main different areas of the standardized anomalies were highly affected by the reference product considered in the calibration process in exception of carraixet in which the main spatial patterns are best fitting the reference product fig 10 shows the correlation coefficient maps q ssm case tetis simulations provide the worst agreement with s1 for all the study cases and smos dpat for hozgarganta other cases have correlation coefficient values greater than 0 8 thus indicating the temporal agreement exceptions are smap dis for ceira and hozgarganta and smos bec for carraixet with correlation values between 0 2 and 0 8 temporal evolution of ssm were coherent to precipitations in every case study fig 11 differences between reference products were observed only in terms of absolute ssm values 5 2 2 validation fig 12 displays the validation results for the three case studies values are summarized in table s2 of supplementary material tetis tends to provide a worse performance during the validation phase than during the calibration phase only cases in which this is not accomplished are ssm case for ceira smap dpat smos bec and carraixet all products in exception of smos bec for carraixet calibrating the model in order to adjust to only one variable will result in an improper performance while nse values in the calibrating phase fig 8 are acceptable they are not able to reproduce the validation observations fig 12 on the contrary adjusting only to ssm provides an unacceptable performance in calibration nse 0 4 while a surprisingly good performance during validation these results indicated that the inclusion of ssm in a multi objective calibration increased the model capability to reproduce not only the ssm spatial patterns but also the q in different hydrologic periods considering the q ssm case for all the study cases and products combinations nse 0 5 is provided calibrations and validation nse values are also in agreement this indicates that all the combinations provide a realistic description of the discharge and therefore supporting the validity of the multi objective calibration approach moving to each study case comparison for hozgarganta the calibration candidate s combinations smap dpat and smos dpat provide nse values 0 65 being smap dpat the best option in terms of spaef with slight differences with the rest of the products however spaef values are lower than 0 2 thus preventing to state the agreement between the models estimates and products observations in consequence no particular product can be highlighted for its performance in both q and ssm in the hozgarganta study case moving to ceira again smap dpat and smos dpat provide the best performance in both nse and spaef although s1 and smos bec still provided acceptable results in terms of nse the spatial performance was worse spaef 0 2 smos dpat is preferred because of the good performance in both calibration and validation periods finally for carraixet s1 smap dpat and smos dpat provided good performance in both nse and spaef it is remarkably that s1 actually provided the best nse metric in spite of the unrealistic temporal behaviour observed followed closely by smos dpat and smap dpat fig 13 displays the spatial patterns for the validation period q ssm case results are analogous to the calibration period smap dpat and smos dpat still provided the best agreement in all the case studies with s1 performing particularly well also in carraixet fig 14 shows the correlation coefficient maps s1 again provided the worst temporal agreement with a slight improvement in ceira the rest of the combinations provided correlation values over 0 5 with smap products best fitting finally the ssm temporal evolution in this period fig 15 again is coherent to precipitations in every case study still showing main differences in terms of absolute ssm values 6 discussion coarse spatial resolution of satellite ssm smap and smos estimates products have only provided the opportunity of considering the temporal dynamic of the ssm variable when regional studies of hydrological implementation were approached since the existing downscaling methods piles et al 2011 piles et al 2012 merlin et al 2013 provide increased spatial resolutions in addition to new sensor estimates bauer marschallinger et al 2019 we postulate that the inclusion of spatial patterns in the implementation of hydrological models may improve their performance there is a lack of testing the improved spatial information of these downscaled products in small basins specifically in the mediterranean region this study evaluates the suitability of several 1 km spatial ssm estimates s1 smap bs smap dis smos bec smap dpat smos dpat for this purpose as first step a comparison of the available products is required we observed that the agreement among the spatial and temporal dynamics of the evaluated products is not as good as expected the suitability of hydrological distributed models for the reproduction of main hydrological state variables have already been demonstrated ruiz pérez et al 2016 ruiz pérez et al 2017 puertes et al 2019 echeverría et al 2019 barrientos et al 2020 thus we can consider these models as validation tools to test the performance of the available comparable products particularly the tetis conceptual model has demonstrated to be a good choice for this purpose echeverría et al 2019 this paper encompasses first the multi objective and multi variable calibration of the model considering previously described ssm products second the analysis of pareto frontiers in terms of temporal dynamics of streamflow spatial agreement of ssm and both finally the performance comparison amongst the different products despite the significant differences amongst ssm products results showed an improvement when the ssm spatial patterns were considered in the calibration process we observed that not all the products have the same agreement with tetis results in the comparison of the ssm products we observed a relative temporal agreement in exception of s1 that has different temporal dynamics this product showed a strong overestimation of the ssm during dry months in carraixet previous studies escorihuela and quintana seguí 2016 pointed out that in semi arid regions the artificial increase in soil moisture can be the result of the increase in the effective soil roughness due to volume scattering this poor performance can be also associated to different factors firstly s1 retrieval algorithm does not consider vegetation dynamics on radar backscatter signal thus leading to potential biases during vegetation full development bauer marschallinger et al 2019 in addition the sensitivity of the c band backscatter is likely to be reduced in high density vegetated areas with leaf area index larger than 0 6 ohja et al 2021 the temporal agreement between products is higher in ceira than the other two basins the location of the study sites may have influence in the ssm retrieval although the three basins share some issues in the soil moisture retrieval topography dense vegetation it is true that ceira is in an easier to solve area for the retrieval carraixet is close to the coast thus some noise can affect due to sea land disturbance water areas present near hozgarganta can also disfavour the ssm retrieval nevertheless in spite of some exceptions s1 and smos dpat for hozgarganta all the products generally agree in their temporal dynamics correlation coefficient greater than 0 4 in fig 6 portal et al 2020 performed a comparison between smap and smos products over the iberian peninsula and they observed the same general temporal agreement in this study they also pointed out that the methodology employed for the downscaling depend on the scale information the ssm products employed s1 radar backscatter lst ndvi land use we observe this same conclusion for the products considered fig 7 shows that for spatial patterns the disaggregating methodology employed is more relevant than the sensor i e smos smap s1 traditional approaches consider only streamflow information in the calibration process considering another state variable as unique objective function does not prevent the problem of equifinality therefore to follow a multi objective approach is recommended dembelé et al 2020b although calibrating considering separately in q and ssm will result in good implementations we decided to compare their effect in the pareto frontier selecting the best performing non dominated solutions in terms of q and ssm gave us an idea of their relevance in a comparable context comparing the calibration and validation phases we found that the model conducted more robustly when both q and ssm information was considered through the selection of an optimum non dominated solution particularly intermittent streams such as carraixet will improve the adjustment of its hydrology i e ssm patterns through this approach during dry periods in which q is not enough representative this fact was advanced by the sensitivity analysis fig 4 where correction factor related to the static storage fc1 was the most relevant the spatial pattern of the precipitation intensely determines the ssm spatial patterns offered by the model thus the calibration considering different ssm reference products introduced variations limited to transitional areas between homologous main spatial patterns this endorses the fact that using physically based models is a good criterion to validate satellite products the dependency on the calibration and validation periods is expected to be additionally high nevertheless we cannot test this hypothesis since the ssm observed data is limited mostly to the period from 2015 to present spaef results are frequently negative or mostly nulls similar to other authors i e dembelé et al 2020a these evidence possible causes incoherencies in the ssm retrieval lack of representativity in spatial resolution temporal limitations of satellite products and or differences in input data generation the influence of land use has been reported by burgin et al 2017 and soil hydraulic properties has been previously reported by baroni et al 2010 livneh et al 2015 ayana et al 2019 smap dpat and smos dpat were the products that provided better spatial agreement to the tetis outputs additionally s1 provided remarkable agreement in carraixet in ceira case study we cannot state the agreement to s1 since few pixels are available for comparison thus to decide while s1 is useful in the mediterranean region other basins need to be evaluated on the contrary we can state that lobelia products provide the best representation of the ssm spatial patterns in the selected case studies limitations in this study open the door to future research higher spatial resolution higher reliability of spatial products and higher temporal coverage may lead to improved adjustments results can be model dependent in consequence we encourage other models to be tested under this approach recently new metrics for spatial pattern comparison have aroused such as spaef however this is still an active field of research new metrics algorithms and objective functions should be considered before performing similar analysis inclusion of spatial patterns from complementary state variables in multi objective calibration efforts is challenging but it is expected to offer promising results dembelé et al 2020a 7 conclusions we explored the usefulness of eco hydrological distributed modelling as a validation tool for remote sensing ssm products this study provides a valuable advance in the filling of the existent gap in the validation of the spatial patterns of current ssm products the study frame is the mediterranean region in which three small basins were selected as representative case studies within this context differences in temporal and spatial dynamics of the reference products were found the multi objective calibration approach proposed increased the robustness of the modelling despite the differences amongst products while smap dpat and smos dpat achieved the best agreement in terms of spatial and temporal representativeness the other products showed some strengths s1 did not provided a realistic temporal evolution in contrast the spatial patterns fitted correctly the distribution provided by tetis model unfortunately the data is not sufficient in all the basins this is the case of ceira in carraixet s1 agreement was comparable to smap dpat and smos dpat results smap bs and smap dis showed an opposite behaviour with a good temporal representation but poor spatial representativeness for some specific cases this is more evident in the case of ceira finally smos bec followed the line of smap bs and smap dis showing spatial disagreement between model simulations and observations limitations of this study have been highlighted model dependency uncertainties in ssm products temporal calibration validation periods restrictions 2015 present although results are dependent on the basin characteristics case specific this paper provides evidence on the necessity to incorporate the spatial patterns information in the calibration of hydrological model credit authorship contribution statement josé gomis
