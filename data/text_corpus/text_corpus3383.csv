16915,halobenzoquinones hbqs are emerging disinfection by products dbps that are postulated drivers of bladder carcinogenicity prior assessments of 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone dcbq occurrence in drinking water distribution systems have revealed a gradual decline with increasing distance from points of entry while this signals a degradation pathway there is limited quantitative data on rate of that degradation a systematic evaluation of dcbq hydrolysis was performed resulting in a rate law that is first order in both hydroxide oh and dcbq the impact of temperature on that rate was characterized according to the arrhenius relationship under the conditions tested ph 7 2 t 20 c chloramine did not significantly impact dcbq concentrations however dcbq was rapidly degraded in solutions containing free available chlorine fac kinetic analysis showed non integer order with respect to fac further investigation led to a model that invoked reaction with dichlorine monoxide cl2o as well as fac graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products distribution system stability kinetics halobenzoquinones temperature 1 introduction modern drinking water treatment processes have been successful at minimizing health hazards through disinfection using oxidants such as chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide ozone and their combinations reactions between disinfectants and organic natural organic matter nom and anthropogenic organics and or inorganic bromide and iodide compounds in water produce diverse groups of undesired compounds called disinfection by products dbps even though 600 dbps have been identified in treated drinking water trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the only ones regulated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa boorman 1999 richardson 1998 since they constitute only 25 of the halogenated dbps by concentration krasner et al 2006 and do not account for the extent of bladder cancer risk observed in existing epidemiological surveys bull 1982 hrudey 2009 there is intense interest in characterizing the unregulated dbps halobenzoquinones hbqs are considered high priority dbps qin et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 due to their suspected role in bladder carcinogenicity bull 2006 of the four hbqs that have previously been confirmed as dbps 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone dcbq was most abundant in treated drinking water with concentrations generally higher in utilities using free chlorine for disinfection zhao et al 2012 2010 ever since dcbq was first identified in drinking water in 2010 researchers have published measured concentrations in public drinking water at present hbq concentrations from at least 63 treated water samples representing 21 treatment plants 8 free chlorine 13 chloramine within the us and canada have been published of these 34 were from plant effluents and 29 from distribution systems ds most of these occurrence studies were conducted by dr xing fang li s research group at the university of alberta where the analytical protocols for hbqs were first developed qin et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2014 zhao et al 2012 2010 three of the eight plants using free chlorine as a final disinfectant had dcbq concentrations from 136 to 275 ng l whereas one using ozone and chlorine had much lower values 7 5 and 4 2 ng l in the ds data for the remaining four free chlorine water treatment plants wtps showed up to 14 ng l dcbq formation cuthbertson et al 2020 the remaining 13 plants all maintained a chloramine residual with mean dcbq concentrations 14 ng l median 9 6 ng l and 5 6 ng l median 4 7 ng l in the plant effluents and ds samples respectively to the best of our knowledge there are only three studies outside of the us and canada that reported dcbq occurrence one in japan and 3 from china hu et al 2020 li et al 2021 nakai et al 2015a yu et al 2019 for instance dcbq concentrations were in the range of 8 51 ng l in 24 free chlorine ds samples from 12 wtps in japan nakai et al 2015a and 16 7 20 5 ng l in six local tap waters in china maintaining chloramine residual yu et al 2019 while 4 41 ng l dcbq was detected in 8 chlorinated tap water samples in china 6 15 9 ng l dcbq was detected in 4 chloraminated tap water samples hu et al 2020 in a more recent study tianjin china dcbq concentrations in the range 3 1 24 ng l were reported in a free chlorine ds li et al 2021 while there is a clear need to further build upon the dcbq occurrence data set to include a larger number of drinking water systems it is also quite important to evaluate the typical lifetime of dcbq in drinking water systems concentrations recorded in distribution system points of entry provide some information in this regard as well as the water age distribution ph and disinfectant residual all of these factors can play a role in the continued formation and simultaneous degradation of this metastable dbp many years of work on hbqs suggest a slow decline in dcbq concentrations with increasing distance from the point of entry poe qin et al 2010 wang et al 2014 complete conversion of dcbq into 3 hydroxy 2 6 dcbq oh dcbq a stable hydrolysis product was reported after 4 5 h at ph 9 in laboratory studies chuang et al 2015 some researchers have also reported trace levels of oh dcbq in ds samples li et al 2021 wang et al 2014 early laboratory studies indicated a half life of dcbq of about 6 7 hours in ph 7 buffered solutions 100 mm phosphate buffer 4 c qin et al 2010 subsequent research by cuthbertson et al 2020 revealed a 30 decrease in dcbq concentration in bottled water over a day with 20 dcbq still remaining after day 5 the temperature and ph conditions used in these experiments are unclear however it is to be noted that typical phs in bottled waters range between 6 9 7 5 kulthanan et al 2013 note that dcbq s iodinated analogue 2 6 diiodobenzoquinone dibq which might be expected to exhibit similar hydrolysis kinetics was relatively stable up to 9 hours in the same ph range hu et al 2020 in a recent study of dcbq hydrolysis the estimated dcbq half life at phs 6 8 was found to be about 21 28 h li et al 2021 inconsistencies between the very limited studies on dcbq stability will certainly hinder attempts at exposure assessments for this important dbp substantial uncertainties also exist around changes in hbq concentrations under the impact of temperature changes which can inform seasonal variations as well as hbq fate in say premise plumbing water heaters can cause very substantial increases or decreases in dbp concentrations and thereby impact human exposures studies in homes with both tank and tankless water heaters have shown large increases in some dbps such as thms and halonitromethanes hnms while decreases are seen for others such as halonitriles liu and reckhow 2015a 2015b 2013 some authors have argued for routine dbp monitoring to include hot water samples liu and reckhow 2015a 2013 because of the perceived greater vulnerability to dbps through dermal and inhalation exposure backer et al 2000 maxwell et al 1991 nuckols et al 2005 whitaker et al 2003 nevertheless almost nothing is known about temperature impacts on hbq concentrations fast degradation of dcbq along with other hbqs over the course of a day was recently reported in a chlorinated tap water 0 2 mg cl2 l neutral ph cuthbertson et al 2020 moreover in other studies where dcbq formation potential was the prime focus researchers noted degradation of 90 of the dcbq after just 1 hour of contact with free available chlorine fac ph 7 20 c 1 1 mg cl2 l kosaka et al 2017 nakai et al 2015b the organic products resulting from the reaction of chlorine with hbqs are not well known certainly halogenated benzoquinones may form aliphatic dbps thms haas via a ring cleavage mechanism hu et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 pan and zhang 2013 zhai and zhang 2011 on the other hand chloramination reactions with dcbq are expected to yield haloacetamide and haloacetaldehyde total yield 15 through intermediates trichlorobenzoquinone tetrachlorobenzoquinone and 2 3 5 5 6 pentachloro 6 hydroxy cyclohexa 2 ene 1 4 dione chuang et al 2015 heasley et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 a methodical kinetic investigation of iodo hbq degradation by chloramine was conducted with proposed end products being their aliphatic counterparts thms haa haloacetonitriles haloacetamides hu et al 2020 similar studies related to dcbq are not available whether or not any of these subsequent products are more toxic than the hbqs has yet to be determined the ultimate focus of this study was to systematically study dcbq degradation under select conditions that are representative of drinking water distribution systems the goal was to develop kinetic rate laws that could be used in modeling hbq concentrations and as tools for exposure assessments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals pure dcbq 98 purity was purchased from sigma

from fisher scientific fair lawn nj 2 2 chromatographic analyses it is noteworthy that most dcbq studies to date have employed liquid chromatography lc with negative electrospray ionization esi mass spectrometry ms based detection except one which used a gas chromatography electron capture detection technique yu et al 2019 here dcbq was analyzed via direct injection no extraction using ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms acquity uplc i class plus and xevo tq xs waters corp milford ma chromatographic separation was performed using a c18 column acquity beh c18 50 2 1 mm 1 7 μm waters corp milford ma on the uplc ms ms operated under esi condition and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode acidified 0 25 fa water a and methanol b were used as mobile phase and the gradient program was slightly modified from a prior published method zhao et al 2010 a brief summary of all analytical conditions is provided in section s1 hydroxylated product oh dcbq was monitored using ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc time of flight mass spectrometer q tof ms acquity uplc with a xevo g2 xs qtof ms waters corp milford ma section s1 the dcbq

deviation of 7 replicate measurements of a 6 ng ml dcbq standard was 2 4 the approximate instrumental detection limit no extraction for dcbq was 0 5 ng ml students t value n 1 1 α 0 99 x standard deviation analysis blanks were included in order to ensure no contamination occurred during analytical runs 2 3 kinetic experiments primary dcbq stock solutions 2 mg ml were prepared in methanol stored at 4 c and carefully monitored for signs of degradation prior to beginning experiments unless otherwise specified all test solutions were prepared in laboratory grade water phosphate buffer 10 mm with ph adjustments performed using solutions of sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide as needed ph was measured on all solutions at 25 c differences in ph due to changing temperature was assessed in accordance with standard thermodynamic principles and determined to be minor 0 035 log unit difference since dcbq is only moderately soluble in water methanolic stock solution was spiked in buffered solutions such that the initial dcbq concentration was in the range 2 3 0 7 μm the final methanol content in experiments was controlled to 0 03 v v control experiments were conducted under select conditions that ensured minimal impact of methanol in spiking solutions on observed kinetics fig s1 temperature controlled hydrolysis studies were conducted at 10 20 and 40 c 2 c in the uplc sample chamber in the dark with samples injected at regular intervals into the uplc ms ms over a 7 hour test period the time to first injection was set at 1 min chloramine impact on dcbq decay was studied for one concentration only 2 5 mg l cl2 preformed monochloramine was prepared by mixing naocl and ammonium chloride to give a chlorine to nitrogen ratio of 0 8 1 with the ph adjusted to 8 5 before application for better understanding of dcbq persistence in chlorinated dss time based dcbq measurements were made at ph 7 phosphate buffer 10 mm in the presence of different fac concentrations 0 25 2 5 mg l cl2 at ambient room temperature 22 c minimal photolysis was ensured by conducting experiments in the dark and in amber glass bottles at prescribed reaction times an aliquot of the sample was preserved using 0 25 fa for chromatographic analysis reasons for not conducting these tests using consecutive uplc ms ms injections similar to hydrolysis tests will be discussed in a later section dcbq degradation was also evaluated in the presence 1 mg cl2 l and absence of fac control under varying ionic strength 1 100 mm using nano3 and cl 1 100 mm using nacl concentrations at ph 7 phosphate buffer 10 mm for the cl fortification experiments ionic strength was held constant by varying the nano3 levels such that nacl nano3 100 mm for all degradation tests ph drift was less than 0 05 units over the full time span of the experiments and dcbq measurements working naocl and preformed monochloramine solutions were prepared daily before dcbq chlor am ination experiments 2 4 other measurements in dcbq chlorination experiments residual free chlorine was measured over time using a portable diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimeter hach company loveland co the dpd titrimetric method apha 1998 was used to standardize monochloramine stock solutions actual cl measurements in working fac solutions were made using an ion chromatograph similar to prior published approaches cherney et al 2006 lau et al 2016 briefly the naocl stock was standardized using a dpd method apha 1998 and a series of dilutions of this stock 0 56 16 5 mm were prepared using laboratory grade water immediate conversion of fac to cl was initiated using molar excess of sodium arsenite measurements were carried out using an anion column metrosep a supp 5 250 4 on an ic metrohm 850 professional ic using aqueous eluents 1 mm sodium bicarbonate and 3 2 mm disodium carbonate final cl concentration in fac solutions was calculated as cl total fac initial such an approach minimizes potential errors or interferences in cl measurements due to on column conversion of fac to cl 2 5 data modeling sigma plot v 13 0 systat software san jose ca was used for all regression analyses determination of pseudo first order rate constants kobs were performed using linear regression while second order rate constants for chlorination species were estimated using a non linear least squares regression by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations between the measured and predicted dcbq values 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ph on dcbq hydrolysis preliminary evaluation of dcbq degradation over a wide ph range 2 7 11 was conducted using the following buffers phosphate for ph 2 7 citrate for ph 3 5 acetate for 5 5 phosphate for ph 6 7 7 2 borate for 7 8 9 and carbonate for ph 11 dcbq solutions at acidic phs 2 7 6 7 exhibited no measurable loss over short reaction times about 3 3 hrs data not shown these observations support prior reports of little or no hydrolysis under acidic conditions cuthbertson et al 2020 li et al 2021 qin et al 2010 alkaline conditions ph 11 resulted in degradation of dcbq that was too rapid for our methods to accurately measure therefore these phs were excluded from further analysis and only dcbq degradation profiles at mid range phs 7 2 8 5 were further investigated a series of temperature controlled laboratory experiments were conducted in the absence of any disinfectant residuals with initial dcbq concentration of 1 8 0 2 µm in 10 mm phosphate buffer test solutions ph 7 2 8 5 samples were incubated at 10 20 or 40 c 2 c in a thermostatic controlled autosampler and analyzed periodically for residual dcbq exponential decrease in dcbq concentrations i e log linear indicates a rate law that is first order in dcbq fig 1 additionally a logarithmic plot of rate against averaged dcbq concentration resulted in a slope of 1 further confirming this first order relationship fig s2 as can be inferred from fig 1 rate of dcbq degradation increased with increasing ph and temperature based on a linear model of the dependency of first order rate constants on hydroxide oh concentrations hydrolysis of dcbq could be treated as first order in oh regardless of ph or temperature fig 2 a based on the data presented the following pseudo first order rate law is proposed to simulate variations in typical drinking water conditions 1 r d d c b q d t k o b s d c b q 2 k o b s k o h o h where r is the rate of loss of dcbq by hydrolysis m s 1 kobs is the observed or pseudo first order rate constant s 1 koh is the second order hydrolysis rate constant m 1 s 1 this first order dependency on oh has been described elsewhere in a similar study conducted at 22 c li et al 2021 which was in close agreement with our data collected at 20 c fig 2a 3 2 temperature dependence of dcbq hydrolysis the rate of dcbq hydrolysis increased with increasing temperature in accordance with the arrhenius relationship k o h a e x p e a r t fig 2b presents a plot of the linearized form 3 ln k o h ln a e a r t where t is the absolute temperature in kelvin r 8 314 is the universal gas constant in j mol k based on these data the rate constant for dcbq hydrolysis can be estimated as follows 4 ln k o h 5137 4 1 t 21 972 as noted in fig 2b the value for koh estimated from the kobs values reported by li and coworkers 2021 at phs 6 8 at 22 c was 91 m 1s 1 li et al 2021 which is nearly identical to the predicted koh at 22 c using the above relationship 96 m 1s 1 the resulting temperature corrected hydrolysis model was a good indicator of the ph dependent dcbq degradation average r2 0 97 p 0 0001 in contrast our data do not agree very well with the findings of qin et al 2010 fig s 2 a b show estimated kobs or koh values based on their reports of a 6 7 hr half life of dcbq at neutral ph 7 this corresponds to a rate constant that is about an order of magnitude higher than our model would predict one difference between the two studies is the ten fold higher buffer concentration used by qin 0 1 m phosphate vs 0 01m for our study with an eye toward possible general base catalysis a set of experiments was conducted with phosphate buffers ranging between the two values nevertheless we were unable to detect any significant impact of phosphate over that range on the observed hydrolysis rate fig s3 in a companion study where oh dcbq was noted to be the most predominant dcbq hydrolysis product concentrations increased with corresponding decreases in dcbq concentrations which is in agreement with other studies fig s4 li et al 2021 wang et al 2014 part of this data have been presented elsewhere hung et al 2019 the reader is referred to this paper for more details on the oh dcbq experiments impact of temperature on these products was not investigated however existing information points to decreasing concentrations upon heating of oh dcbq or halo benzenetriols which have also been detected as uv degradation products of dcbq pei et al 2018 qian et al 2013 3 3 influence of free chlorine residual on dcbq another likely fate for dcbq in distribution systems is reaction with residual chlorine in its various forms in an effort to account for this loss pathway dcbq concentrations were monitored in the presence of fac at neutral ph i e 7 0 05 while the average initial dcbq o was 2 42 0 77 μm fac initial doses were varied between 0 25 2 5 mg cl2 l i e 2 14 times the molar concentration of dcbq replicate experiments and measurements were carried out resulting in 4 sets of time based dcbq data for each chlorine dose 20 data sets in total all tests were conducted at ambient temperature 22 c and shielded from light because dcbq decay was too fast particularly at higher fac doses to be accurately captured by consecutive lc injection a sequential injection approach as used in the hydrolysis experiments was not used in this case instead sub samples were withdrawn at precise times from a large volume of buffered high purity water containing dcbq and chlorine each sample was immediately split one portion used for measurement of residual chlorine by dpd colorimetry and the other was preserved using 0 25 fa for subsequent dcbq measurements fa has been shown to protect dcbq from reacting with free chlorine cuthbertson et al 2020 mohan and reckhow unpublished work surprisingly while conducting dpd colorimetric test it was discovered that dcbq displayed an oxidizing tendency similar to fac by transforming dpd amine into its crimson colored free radical similar observations have been noted with p benzoquinone in another study criquet et al 2015 the positive interference caused by dcbq was nearly quantitative and repeatable therefore the measured free chlorine residuals across all experiments were corrected for this interference with the help of a calibration curve for dpd response at various dcbq concentrations fig s5 first order dcbq kinetics was apparent from linear natural log dcbq vs time plots fig s6 a linear relationship between reaction rate against averaged dcbq dcbq o varied between 0 7 5 3 μm at a fixed fac 1 mg l 14 μm further supported the 1st order assumption in dcbq fig s7 the resulting pseudo first order reaction could be described as 5 d c b q f a c r p r o d u c t s p h 7 k n r d d c b q d t k o b s d c b q kobs is the observed or pseudo first order rate constant determined using regressions of ln dcbq as a function of time s 1 note that particularly for the low chlorine dose experiments e g 0 25 mg l the ln dcbq vs time data were divided into discrete linear segments for determination of kobs fig s6 the presence of fac resulted in rapid loss of dcbq with the rate increasing with increases in chlorine dose appreciable depletion of chlorine occurred especially at lower chlorine doses therefore the assumption of a constant chlorine residual otherwise typical of pseudo first order conditions was not made in order to minimize errors in rate constant estimates the reaction order in fac was estimated under similar pseudo first order conditions 6 k o b s k o h o h k f a c f a c n 7 k k f a c f a c n where kfac is the apparent rate constant and n is the reaction order in fac it has units of m ns 1 k kobs koh oh is the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction with chlorine at a fixed ph s 1 koh is the hydrolysis rate constant m 1 s 1 the log transform of this equation is 8 log k log k f a c n log f a c the log of all 30 observed values for k were plotted vs log fac in accordance with the above equation and fitted to a least square regression line the slope of this line was 1 32 0 1 error corresponding to 95 confidence level fig 3 a and it corresponds to the reaction order with respect to fac a value greater than and significantly different from 1 is evidence of mixed first and second order pathways where reactive electrophilic chlorine species such as bimolecular chlorine cl2 and dichlorine monoxide cl2o might be contributing in addition to the predominant fac species hocl and ocl these have often been disregarded in chlorination studies and efforts to incorporate them in chlorination of phenols cyclic alkenes and select secondary amines have been undertaken for refinement of simple 2nd order rate laws lau et al 2019 2016 sivey et al 2010 voudrias and reinhard 1988a in fact a model assuming n 1 in fac led to overprediction of dcbq decay at low fac doses and under prediction at higher fac doses the presumed 1 1 stoichiometric relationship between fac and dcbq was tested and verified in order to eliminate the possibility that deviations from this stoichiometry were causing the apparent mixed order kinetics fig s8 acknowledging a measurable role for a higher order chlorine species the rate constant can be amended as follows 9 k o b s k o h o h k f a c f a c k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o 10 k k o b s k o h o h k f a c f a c k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o where kcl2o is the rate constant for cl2o with dcbq m 1 s 1 kcl2 is the rate constant for cl2 with dcbq m 1 s 1 while cl2 and cl2o residuals were not measured in this research they can be calculated from the fac using the following ionic strength corrected equilibrium relationships c l 2 k e q c l 2 h o c l c l h log keq cl2 2 6 25 c i 26 mm wang and margerum 1994 c l 2 o k e q c l 2 o h o c l 2 log keq cl2o 2 2 25 c i 26 mm sivey et al 2010 voudrias and reinhard 1988b the following studies were conducted to clarify the importance of the higher order chlorine terms 3 4 impact of ionic strength and cl on dcbq chlorination the impact of ionic strength induced by varying nano3 concentrations had no appreciable effect on dcbq decay by fac up to 100 mm fig s9 with a view to further assessing the significance of cl2 term independent experiments were conducted at ph 7 by varying cl concentrations 1 100 mm cl at fixed fac dose of about 1 mg l for all cl concentrations nano3 was added in order to maintain constant ionic strength 100 mm these tests were particularly important because the naocl stock used in these experiments contained cl levels at 1 45 times the molar fac concentration fig s10 also trace levels of cl 0 001 mm were detected in 10 mm phosphate buffers used across experiments at ph 7 cl addition did not significantly alter dcbq chlorination rates fig s9 since higher chloride concentrations would result in elevated cl2 levels at the same fac the lack of a chloride affect suggests that bimolecular chlorine is not an important reactant under these conditions a log log plot of rate vs the calculated cl2 resulted in a slope 0 further reinforcing the negligible contribution of cl2 to dcbq chlorination at ph 7 fig s11 as a result the cl2 term could be eliminated and cl concentrations were thereafter not considered in modeling the final simplified rate equation then becomes 11 r d dcbq dt k oh o h k fac fac k cl 2 o c l 2 o dcbq k k fac fac k cl 2 o c l 2 o and substituting for the equilibrium value for cl2o 12 k k f a c f a c k c l 2 o k e q c l 2 o h o c l 2 13 k k f a c f a c k c l 2 o k e q c l 2 o α 0 2 f a c 2 where αo is the fraction of fac in the most protonated form i e hocl estimates of maximum possible values for second order rate constants were obtained by fitting k values against cl2o or fac the phosphate buffer concentration was held constant in all experiments at 10 mm therefore impacts from phosphate buffer were not considered or pursued further for dcbq chlorination in all cases the final methanol content used as a solvent vehicle resulting from dcbq spiking was 0 003 v v and deemed not likely to induce any significant cosolvent effects on observed rates schwarzenbach et al 2002 the best fit estimates of the second order rate constants kfac and kcl2o were obtained using non linear least squared regression by application of a user defined function f a x b x2 where f k a kfac x fac b kcl2o keq cl2o from this the kcl2o estimate was almost 6 orders of magnitude greater than kfac fig 3b the model fit was a good indication that the kinetics could reasonably be described by a combination of the fac and cl2o pathways r2 0 9 p 0 0001 based on the results in fig 3b we estimate the following values for the two 2nd order rate constants k fac 1 1 0 2 10 2 m 1 s 1 k cl 2 o 5 6 1 5 10 8 m 1 s 1 there is virtually no published data on kinetics of dcbq chlorination however a few studies do support rapid degradation through chlorination reactions cuthbertson et al 2020 kosaka et al 2017 nakai et al 2015b to our knowledge this is the first time cl2o has been implicated as an important reactant in the degradation of dcbq however cl2o has been proposed as important in the degradation of simple organic compounds some of which are closely related phenols and halophenols lau et al 2019 2016 the 2nd order rate constants for cl2o with phenol and 4 chlorophenol are 9 0 104 and 9 8 104 m 1s 1 respectively the rate constants for these same two compounds with hocl are 0 36 and 0 002 m 1s 1 gallard and von gunten 2002 this results in a kcl2o khocl ratio of 2 5 105 for phenol and 4 9 107 for 4 chlorophenol by comparison the kcl2o khocl ratio for dcbq determined here 5 106 is between these two values identification of chlorination end products was beyond the scope of this study oh dcbq has been previously detected in free chlorine ds samples at concentrations equivalent to dcbq detected in wtp effluent samples wang et al 2014 cuthbertson et al 2020 report catalyzed conversion of hbqs to oh hbqs in the presence of free chlorine by using 2 6 dibromobenzoquinone as example however oh dcbq concentrations were not measured in this chlorination study 3 5 predictions fig 4 a shows the predicted half life for dcbq at phs 7 8 in the absence of free chorine at temperatures up to 30 c as well as the expected half life with a 0 1 mg cl2 l fac residual at ph 7 related calculations were all performed using the following relationship 14 t 1 2 h y d r o l y s i s ln 0 5 k o h o h where k o h e x p 5137 4 1 t 21 97 a summary of relative contribution of reactive species at typical drinking water ds conditions 0 1 3 mg l cl2 is provided in fig 4b as can be seen the role of cl2o in dcbq degradation is expected to become significant as hocl or fac exceeds 1 mg l since cl2o hocl 2 therefore ignoring the cl2o pathway can result in large errors even under typical drinking water conditions 3 6 influence of chloramine residual on dcbq concentrations use of chloramines or combined chlorine in place of free chlorine provides a more stable long term residual and usually results in substantially lower concentrations of regulated dbps at the consumer s tap likewise dcbq occurrence studies have noted lower concentrations in utilities using chloramine compared to free chlorine although it is expected that most of the dcbq in chloraminated systems must be formed during the initial free chlorine contact time preceding conversion to chloramines it is unclear whether the detected low concentrations may be attributed to shorter free chlorine reaction times or faster degradation in the presence of chloramine residual in order to clarify this dcbq stability in the presence of chloramine was investigated through use of preformed chloramine solutions dcbq reaction with monochloramine was documented stability of dcbq in the presence of a high concentration of preformed chloramine 2 5 mg cl2 l at ph 7 2 was studied through consecutive lc injections of the test sample protected from light this concentration was chosen for consistency with the highest concentration used in the fac experiments dcbq stability in the presence of chloramine appeared similar to that from hydrolysis alone therefore under the conditions used in this study loss of dcbq can be entirely attributed to hydrolysis the concentration of preformed chloramine did not significantly change over time a linear plot of natural log of dcbq against time suggested a rate law that is first order in dcbq assuming a reaction that is first order in chloramine the estimated 2nd order rate constant chloramination rate constant kca was 1 m 1s 1 which is close to the apparent rate constant 1 18 m 1s 1 4261 m 1h 1 for the reaction of chloramine with dcbq s iodinated analogue 2 6 dibq at ph 7 and 20 c hu et al 2020 4 conclusions the widespread practice of maintaining a chlorine residual in public drinking water results in the formation of dbps including dcbq and for many of them some degree of simultaneous degradation the net dcbq concentration at any point in a drinking water distribution system is the result of a balance of the two reactions formation vs degradation results from this study indicate an alkaline hydrolysis having first order dependence on both dcbq and oh degradation rates increase with increasing temperature in accordance with the arrhenius equation these results may have important ramifications for 1 dcbq storage conditions 2 predicting seasonal dcbq variations and 3 possible water heater impacts for utilities that maintain high ph in distributed water for corrosion control dcbq can rapidly hydrolyze formation of oh dcbq a known degradation product is expected under conditions where there is absence of fac residual in the presence of fac dcbq loss is accelerated as compared to chloramination or the pure hydrolysis pathway both cl2o and fac were determined to contribute significantly to dcbq decay among the chlorinating reagents the relative importance of cl2o versus fac is expected to increase with increasing fac residual such that they are approximately equal in contribution kcl2o cl2o kfac fac under conditions typical to drinking water

16915,halobenzoquinones hbqs are emerging disinfection by products dbps that are postulated drivers of bladder carcinogenicity prior assessments of 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone dcbq occurrence in drinking water distribution systems have revealed a gradual decline with increasing distance from points of entry while this signals a degradation pathway there is limited quantitative data on rate of that degradation a systematic evaluation of dcbq hydrolysis was performed resulting in a rate law that is first order in both hydroxide oh and dcbq the impact of temperature on that rate was characterized according to the arrhenius relationship under the conditions tested ph 7 2 t 20 c chloramine did not significantly impact dcbq concentrations however dcbq was rapidly degraded in solutions containing free available chlorine fac kinetic analysis showed non integer order with respect to fac further investigation led to a model that invoked reaction with dichlorine monoxide cl2o as well as fac graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products distribution system stability kinetics halobenzoquinones temperature 1 introduction modern drinking water treatment processes have been successful at minimizing health hazards through disinfection using oxidants such as chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide ozone and their combinations reactions between disinfectants and organic natural organic matter nom and anthropogenic organics and or inorganic bromide and iodide compounds in water produce diverse groups of undesired compounds called disinfection by products dbps even though 600 dbps have been identified in treated drinking water trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are the only ones regulated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa boorman 1999 richardson 1998 since they constitute only 25 of the halogenated dbps by concentration krasner et al 2006 and do not account for the extent of bladder cancer risk observed in existing epidemiological surveys bull 1982 hrudey 2009 there is intense interest in characterizing the unregulated dbps halobenzoquinones hbqs are considered high priority dbps qin et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 due to their suspected role in bladder carcinogenicity bull 2006 of the four hbqs that have previously been confirmed as dbps 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone dcbq was most abundant in treated drinking water with concentrations generally higher in utilities using free chlorine for disinfection zhao et al 2012 2010 ever since dcbq was first identified in drinking water in 2010 researchers have published measured concentrations in public drinking water at present hbq concentrations from at least 63 treated water samples representing 21 treatment plants 8 free chlorine 13 chloramine within the us and canada have been published of these 34 were from plant effluents and 29 from distribution systems ds most of these occurrence studies were conducted by dr xing fang li s research group at the university of alberta where the analytical protocols for hbqs were first developed qin et al 2010 wang et al 2016 2014 zhao et al 2012 2010 three of the eight plants using free chlorine as a final disinfectant had dcbq concentrations from 136 to 275 ng l whereas one using ozone and chlorine had much lower values 7 5 and 4 2 ng l in the ds data for the remaining four free chlorine water treatment plants wtps showed up to 14 ng l dcbq formation cuthbertson et al 2020 the remaining 13 plants all maintained a chloramine residual with mean dcbq concentrations 14 ng l median 9 6 ng l and 5 6 ng l median 4 7 ng l in the plant effluents and ds samples respectively to the best of our knowledge there are only three studies outside of the us and canada that reported dcbq occurrence one in japan and 3 from china hu et al 2020 li et al 2021 nakai et al 2015a yu et al 2019 for instance dcbq concentrations were in the range of 8 51 ng l in 24 free chlorine ds samples from 12 wtps in japan nakai et al 2015a and 16 7 20 5 ng l in six local tap waters in china maintaining chloramine residual yu et al 2019 while 4 41 ng l dcbq was detected in 8 chlorinated tap water samples in china 6 15 9 ng l dcbq was detected in 4 chloraminated tap water samples hu et al 2020 in a more recent study tianjin china dcbq concentrations in the range 3 1 24 ng l were reported in a free chlorine ds li et al 2021 while there is a clear need to further build upon the dcbq occurrence data set to include a larger number of drinking water systems it is also quite important to evaluate the typical lifetime of dcbq in drinking water systems concentrations recorded in distribution system points of entry provide some information in this regard as well as the water age distribution ph and disinfectant residual all of these factors can play a role in the continued formation and simultaneous degradation of this metastable dbp many years of work on hbqs suggest a slow decline in dcbq concentrations with increasing distance from the point of entry poe qin et al 2010 wang et al 2014 complete conversion of dcbq into 3 hydroxy 2 6 dcbq oh dcbq a stable hydrolysis product was reported after 4 5 h at ph 9 in laboratory studies chuang et al 2015 some researchers have also reported trace levels of oh dcbq in ds samples li et al 2021 wang et al 2014 early laboratory studies indicated a half life of dcbq of about 6 7 hours in ph 7 buffered solutions 100 mm phosphate buffer 4 c qin et al 2010 subsequent research by cuthbertson et al 2020 revealed a 30 decrease in dcbq concentration in bottled water over a day with 20 dcbq still remaining after day 5 the temperature and ph conditions used in these experiments are unclear however it is to be noted that typical phs in bottled waters range between 6 9 7 5 kulthanan et al 2013 note that dcbq s iodinated analogue 2 6 diiodobenzoquinone dibq which might be expected to exhibit similar hydrolysis kinetics was relatively stable up to 9 hours in the same ph range hu et al 2020 in a recent study of dcbq hydrolysis the estimated dcbq half life at phs 6 8 was found to be about 21 28 h li et al 2021 inconsistencies between the very limited studies on dcbq stability will certainly hinder attempts at exposure assessments for this important dbp substantial uncertainties also exist around changes in hbq concentrations under the impact of temperature changes which can inform seasonal variations as well as hbq fate in say premise plumbing water heaters can cause very substantial increases or decreases in dbp concentrations and thereby impact human exposures studies in homes with both tank and tankless water heaters have shown large increases in some dbps such as thms and halonitromethanes hnms while decreases are seen for others such as halonitriles liu and reckhow 2015a 2015b 2013 some authors have argued for routine dbp monitoring to include hot water samples liu and reckhow 2015a 2013 because of the perceived greater vulnerability to dbps through dermal and inhalation exposure backer et al 2000 maxwell et al 1991 nuckols et al 2005 whitaker et al 2003 nevertheless almost nothing is known about temperature impacts on hbq concentrations fast degradation of dcbq along with other hbqs over the course of a day was recently reported in a chlorinated tap water 0 2 mg cl2 l neutral ph cuthbertson et al 2020 moreover in other studies where dcbq formation potential was the prime focus researchers noted degradation of 90 of the dcbq after just 1 hour of contact with free available chlorine fac ph 7 20 c 1 1 mg cl2 l kosaka et al 2017 nakai et al 2015b the organic products resulting from the reaction of chlorine with hbqs are not well known certainly halogenated benzoquinones may form aliphatic dbps thms haas via a ring cleavage mechanism hu et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 pan and zhang 2013 zhai and zhang 2011 on the other hand chloramination reactions with dcbq are expected to yield haloacetamide and haloacetaldehyde total yield 15 through intermediates trichlorobenzoquinone tetrachlorobenzoquinone and 2 3 5 5 6 pentachloro 6 hydroxy cyclohexa 2 ene 1 4 dione chuang et al 2015 heasley et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 a methodical kinetic investigation of iodo hbq degradation by chloramine was conducted with proposed end products being their aliphatic counterparts thms haa haloacetonitriles haloacetamides hu et al 2020 similar studies related to dcbq are not available whether or not any of these subsequent products are more toxic than the hbqs has yet to be determined the ultimate focus of this study was to systematically study dcbq degradation under select conditions that are representative of drinking water distribution systems the goal was to develop kinetic rate laws that could be used in modeling hbq concentrations and as tools for exposure assessments 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals pure dcbq 98 purity was purchased from sigma

spectrometry ms based detection except one which used a gas chromatography electron capture detection technique yu et al 2019 here dcbq was analyzed via direct injection no extraction using ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms acquity uplc i class plus and xevo tq xs waters corp milford ma chromatographic separation was performed using a c18 column acquity beh c18 50 2 1 mm 1 7 μm waters corp milford ma on the uplc ms ms operated under esi condition and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode acidified 0 25 fa water a and methanol b were used as mobile phase and the gradient program was slightly modified from a prior published method zhao et al 2010 a brief summary of all analytical conditions is provided in section s1 hydroxylated product oh dcbq was monitored using ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc time of flight mass spectrometer q tof ms acquity uplc with a xevo g2 xs qtof ms waters corp milford ma section s1 the dcbq

deviation of 7 replicate measurements of a 6 ng ml dcbq standard was 2 4 the approximate instrumental detection limit no extraction for dcbq was 0 5 ng ml students t value n 1 1 α 0 99 x standard deviation analysis blanks were included in order to ensure no contamination occurred during analytical runs 2 3 kinetic experiments primary dcbq stock solutions 2 mg ml were prepared in methanol stored at 4 c and carefully monitored for signs of degradation prior to beginning experiments unless otherwise specified all test solutions were prepared in laboratory grade water phosphate buffer 10 mm with ph adjustments performed using solutions of sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide as needed ph was measured on all solutions at 25 c differences in ph due to changing temperature was assessed in accordance with standard thermodynamic principles and determined to be minor 0 035 log unit difference since dcbq is only moderately soluble in water methanolic stock solution was spiked in buffered solutions such that the initial dcbq concentration was in the range 2 3 0 7 μm the final methanol content in experiments was controlled to 0 03 v v control experiments were conducted under select conditions that ensured minimal impact of methanol in spiking solutions on observed kinetics fig s1 temperature controlled hydrolysis studies were conducted at 10 20 and 40 c 2 c in the uplc sample chamber in the dark with samples injected at regular intervals into the uplc ms ms over a 7 hour test period the time to first injection was set at 1 min chloramine impact on dcbq decay was studied for one concentration only 2 5 mg l cl2 preformed monochloramine was prepared by mixing naocl and ammonium chloride to give a chlorine to nitrogen ratio of 0 8 1 with the ph adjusted to 8 5 before application for better understanding of dcbq persistence in chlorinated dss time based dcbq measurements were made at ph 7 phosphate buffer 10 mm in the presence of different fac concentrations 0 25 2 5 mg l cl2 at ambient room temperature 22 c minimal photolysis was ensured by conducting experiments in the dark and in amber glass bottles at prescribed reaction times an aliquot of the sample was preserved using 0 25 fa for chromatographic analysis reasons for not conducting these tests using consecutive uplc ms ms injections similar to hydrolysis tests will be discussed in a later section dcbq degradation was also evaluated in the presence 1 mg cl2 l and absence of fac control under varying ionic strength 1 100 mm using nano3 and cl 1 100 mm using nacl concentrations at ph 7 phosphate buffer 10 mm for the cl fortification experiments ionic strength was held constant by varying the nano3 levels such that nacl nano3 100 mm for all degradation tests ph drift was less than 0 05 units over the full time span of the experiments and dcbq measurements working naocl and preformed monochloramine solutions were prepared daily before dcbq chlor am ination experiments 2 4 other measurements in dcbq chlorination experiments residual free chlorine was measured over time using a portable diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimeter hach company loveland co the dpd titrimetric method apha 1998 was used to standardize monochloramine stock solutions actual cl measurements in working fac solutions were made using an ion chromatograph similar to prior published approaches cherney et al 2006 lau et al 2016 briefly the naocl stock was standardized using a dpd method apha 1998 and a series of dilutions of this stock 0 56 16 5 mm were prepared using laboratory grade water immediate conversion of fac to cl was initiated using molar excess of sodium arsenite measurements were carried out using an anion column metrosep a supp 5 250 4 on an ic metrohm 850 professional ic using aqueous eluents 1 mm sodium bicarbonate and 3 2 mm disodium carbonate final cl concentration in fac solutions was calculated as cl total fac initial such an approach minimizes potential errors or interferences in cl measurements due to on column conversion of fac to cl 2 5 data modeling sigma plot v 13 0 systat software san jose ca was used for all regression analyses determination of pseudo first order rate constants kobs were performed using linear regression while second order rate constants for chlorination species were estimated using a non linear least squares regression by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations between the measured and predicted dcbq values 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ph on dcbq hydrolysis preliminary evaluation of dcbq degradation over a wide ph range 2 7 11 was conducted using the following buffers phosphate for ph 2 7 citrate for ph 3 5 acetate for 5 5 phosphate for ph 6 7 7 2 borate for 7 8 9 and carbonate for ph 11 dcbq solutions at acidic phs 2 7 6 7 exhibited no measurable loss over short reaction times about 3 3 hrs data not shown these observations support prior reports of little or no hydrolysis under acidic conditions cuthbertson et al 2020 li et al 2021 qin et al 2010 alkaline conditions ph 11 resulted in degradation of dcbq that was too rapid for our methods to accurately measure therefore these phs were excluded from further analysis and only dcbq degradation profiles at mid range phs 7 2 8 5 were further investigated a series of temperature controlled laboratory experiments were conducted in the absence of any disinfectant residuals with initial dcbq concentration of 1 8 0 2 µm in 10 mm phosphate buffer test solutions ph 7 2 8 5 samples were incubated at 10 20 or 40 c 2 c in a thermostatic controlled autosampler and analyzed periodically for residual dcbq exponential decrease in dcbq concentrations i e log linear indicates a rate law that is first order in dcbq fig 1 additionally a logarithmic plot of rate against averaged dcbq concentration resulted in a slope of 1 further confirming this first order relationship fig s2 as can be inferred from fig 1 rate of dcbq degradation increased with increasing ph and temperature based on a linear model of the dependency of first order rate constants on hydroxide oh concentrations hydrolysis of dcbq could be treated as first order in oh regardless of ph or temperature fig 2 a based on the data presented the following pseudo first order rate law is proposed to simulate variations in typical drinking water conditions 1 r d d c b q d t k o b s d c b q 2 k o b s k o h o h where r is the rate of loss of dcbq by hydrolysis m s 1 kobs is the observed or pseudo first order rate constant s 1 koh is the second order hydrolysis rate constant m 1 s 1 this first order dependency on oh has been described elsewhere in a similar study conducted at 22 c li et al 2021 which was in close agreement with our data collected at 20 c fig 2a 3 2 temperature dependence of dcbq hydrolysis the rate of dcbq hydrolysis increased with increasing temperature in accordance with the arrhenius relationship k o h a e x p e a r t fig 2b presents a plot of the linearized form 3 ln k o h ln a e a r t where t is the absolute temperature in kelvin r 8 314 is the universal gas constant in j mol k based on these data the rate constant for dcbq hydrolysis can be estimated as follows 4 ln k o h 5137 4 1 t 21 972 as noted in fig 2b the value for koh estimated from the kobs values reported by li and coworkers 2021 at phs 6 8 at 22 c was 91 m 1s 1 li et al 2021 which is nearly identical to the predicted koh at 22 c using the above relationship 96 m 1s 1 the resulting temperature corrected hydrolysis model was a good indicator of the ph dependent dcbq degradation average r2 0 97 p 0 0001 in contrast our data do not agree very well with the findings of qin et al 2010 fig s 2 a b show estimated kobs or koh values based on their reports of a 6 7 hr half life of dcbq at neutral ph 7 this corresponds to a rate constant that is about an order of magnitude higher than our model would predict one difference between the two studies is the ten fold higher buffer concentration used by qin 0 1 m phosphate vs 0 01m for our study with an eye toward possible general base catalysis a set of experiments was conducted with phosphate buffers ranging between the two values nevertheless we were unable to detect any significant impact of phosphate over that range on the observed hydrolysis rate fig s3 in a companion study where oh dcbq was noted to be the most predominant dcbq hydrolysis product concentrations increased with corresponding decreases in dcbq concentrations which is in agreement with other studies fig s4 li et al 2021 wang et al 2014 part of this data have been presented elsewhere hung et al 2019 the reader is referred to this paper for more details on the oh dcbq experiments impact of temperature on these products was not investigated however existing information points to decreasing concentrations upon heating of oh dcbq or halo benzenetriols which have also been detected as uv degradation products of dcbq pei et al 2018 qian et al 2013 3 3 influence of free chlorine residual on dcbq another likely fate for dcbq in distribution systems is reaction with residual chlorine in its various forms in an effort to account for this loss pathway dcbq concentrations were monitored in the presence of fac at neutral ph i e 7 0 05 while the average initial dcbq o was 2 42 0 77 μm fac initial doses were varied between 0 25 2 5 mg cl2 l i e 2 14 times the molar concentration of dcbq replicate experiments and measurements were carried out resulting in 4 sets of time based dcbq data for each chlorine dose 20 data sets in total all tests were conducted at ambient temperature 22 c and shielded from light because dcbq decay was too fast particularly at higher fac doses to be accurately captured by consecutive lc injection a sequential injection approach as used in the hydrolysis experiments was not used in this case instead sub samples were withdrawn at precise times from a large volume of buffered high purity water containing dcbq and chlorine each sample was immediately split one portion used for measurement of residual chlorine by dpd colorimetry and the other was preserved using 0 25 fa for subsequent dcbq measurements fa has been shown to protect dcbq from reacting with free chlorine cuthbertson et al 2020 mohan and reckhow unpublished work surprisingly while conducting dpd colorimetric test it was discovered that dcbq displayed an oxidizing tendency similar to fac by transforming dpd amine into its crimson colored free radical similar observations have been noted with p benzoquinone in another study criquet et al 2015 the positive interference caused by dcbq was nearly quantitative and repeatable therefore the measured free chlorine residuals across all experiments were corrected for this interference with the help of a calibration curve for dpd response at various dcbq concentrations fig s5 first order dcbq kinetics was apparent from linear natural log dcbq vs time plots fig s6 a linear relationship between reaction rate against averaged dcbq dcbq o varied between 0 7 5 3 μm at a fixed fac 1 mg l 14 μm further supported the 1st order assumption in dcbq fig s7 the resulting pseudo first order reaction could be described as 5 d c b q f a c r p r o d u c t s p h 7 k n r d d c b q d t k o b s d c b q kobs is the observed or pseudo first order rate constant determined using regressions of ln dcbq as a function of time s 1 note that particularly for the low chlorine dose experiments e g 0 25 mg l the ln dcbq vs time data were divided into discrete linear segments for determination of kobs fig s6 the presence of fac resulted in rapid loss of dcbq with the rate increasing with increases in chlorine dose appreciable depletion of chlorine occurred especially at lower chlorine doses therefore the assumption of a constant chlorine residual otherwise typical of pseudo first order conditions was not made in order to minimize errors in rate constant estimates the reaction order in fac was estimated under similar pseudo first order conditions 6 k o b s k o h o h k f a c f a c n 7 k k f a c f a c n where kfac is the apparent rate constant and n is the reaction order in fac it has units of m ns 1 k kobs koh oh is the pseudo first order rate constant for the reaction with chlorine at a fixed ph s 1 koh is the hydrolysis rate constant m 1 s 1 the log transform of this equation is 8 log k log k f a c n log f a c the log of all 30 observed values for k were plotted vs log fac in accordance with the above equation and fitted to a least square regression line the slope of this line was 1 32 0 1 error corresponding to 95 confidence level fig 3 a and it corresponds to the reaction order with respect to fac a value greater than and significantly different from 1 is evidence of mixed first and second order pathways where reactive electrophilic chlorine species such as bimolecular chlorine cl2 and dichlorine monoxide cl2o might be contributing in addition to the predominant fac species hocl and ocl these have often been disregarded in chlorination studies and efforts to incorporate them in chlorination of phenols cyclic alkenes and select secondary amines have been undertaken for refinement of simple 2nd order rate laws lau et al 2019 2016 sivey et al 2010 voudrias and reinhard 1988a in fact a model assuming n 1 in fac led to overprediction of dcbq decay at low fac doses and under prediction at higher fac doses the presumed 1 1 stoichiometric relationship between fac and dcbq was tested and verified in order to eliminate the possibility that deviations from this stoichiometry were causing the apparent mixed order kinetics fig s8 acknowledging a measurable role for a higher order chlorine species the rate constant can be amended as follows 9 k o b s k o h o h k f a c f a c k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o 10 k k o b s k o h o h k f a c f a c k c l 2 c l 2 k c l 2 o c l 2 o where kcl2o is the rate constant for cl2o with dcbq m 1 s 1 kcl2 is the rate constant for cl2 with dcbq m 1 s 1 while cl2 and cl2o residuals were not measured in this research they can be calculated from the fac using the following ionic strength corrected equilibrium relationships c l 2 k e q c l 2 h o c l c l h log keq cl2 2 6 25 c i 26 mm wang and margerum 1994 c l 2 o k e q c l 2 o h o c l 2 log keq cl2o 2 2 25 c i 26 mm sivey et al 2010 voudrias and reinhard 1988b the following studies were conducted to clarify the importance of the higher order chlorine terms 3 4 impact of ionic strength and cl on dcbq chlorination the impact of ionic strength induced by varying nano3 concentrations had no appreciable effect on dcbq decay by fac up to 100 mm fig s9 with a view to further assessing the significance of cl2 term independent experiments were conducted at ph 7 by varying cl concentrations 1 100 mm cl at fixed fac dose of about 1 mg l for all cl concentrations nano3 was added in order to maintain constant ionic strength 100 mm these tests were particularly important because the naocl stock used in these experiments contained cl levels at 1 45 times the molar fac concentration fig s10 also trace levels of cl 0 001 mm were detected in 10 mm phosphate buffers used across experiments at ph 7 cl addition did not significantly alter dcbq chlorination rates fig s9 since higher chloride concentrations would result in elevated cl2 levels at the same fac the lack of a chloride affect suggests that bimolecular chlorine is not an important reactant under these conditions a log log plot of rate vs the calculated cl2 resulted in a slope 0 further reinforcing the negligible contribution of cl2 to dcbq chlorination at ph 7 fig s11 as a result the cl2 term could be eliminated and cl concentrations were thereafter not considered in modeling the final simplified rate equation then becomes 11 r d dcbq dt k oh o h k fac fac k cl 2 o c l 2 o dcbq k k fac fac k cl 2 o c l 2 o and substituting for the equilibrium value for cl2o 12 k k f a c f a c k c l 2 o k e q c l 2 o h o c l 2 13 k k f a c f a c k c l 2 o k e q c l 2 o α 0 2 f a c 2 where αo is the fraction of fac in the most protonated form i e hocl estimates of maximum possible values for second order rate constants were obtained by fitting k values against cl2o or fac the phosphate buffer concentration was held constant in all experiments at 10 mm therefore impacts from phosphate buffer were not considered or pursued further for dcbq chlorination in all cases the final methanol content used as a solvent vehicle resulting from dcbq spiking was 0 003 v v and deemed not likely to induce any significant cosolvent effects on observed rates schwarzenbach et al 2002 the best fit estimates of the second order rate constants kfac and kcl2o were obtained using non linear least squared regression by application of a user defined function f a x b x2 where f k a kfac x fac b kcl2o keq cl2o from this the kcl2o estimate was almost 6 orders of magnitude greater than kfac fig 3b the model fit was a good indication that the kinetics could reasonably be described by a combination of the fac and cl2o pathways r2 0 9 p 0 0001 based on the results in fig 3b we estimate the following values for the two 2nd order rate constants k fac 1 1 0 2 10 2 m 1 s 1 k cl 2 o 5 6 1 5 10 8 m 1 s 1 there is virtually no published data on kinetics of dcbq chlorination however a few studies do support rapid degradation through chlorination reactions cuthbertson et al 2020 kosaka et al 2017 nakai et al 2015b to our knowledge this is the first time cl2o has been implicated as an important reactant in the degradation of dcbq however cl2o has been proposed as important in the degradation of simple organic compounds some of which are closely related phenols and halophenols lau et al 2019 2016 the 2nd order rate constants for cl2o with phenol and 4 chlorophenol are 9 0 104 and 9 8 104 m 1s 1 respectively the rate constants for these same two compounds with hocl are 0 36 and 0 002 m 1s 1 gallard and von gunten 2002 this results in a kcl2o khocl ratio of 2 5 105 for phenol and 4 9 107 for 4 chlorophenol by comparison the kcl2o khocl ratio for dcbq determined here 5 106 is between these two values identification of chlorination end products was beyond the scope of this study oh dcbq has been previously detected in free chlorine ds samples at concentrations equivalent to dcbq detected in wtp effluent samples wang et al 2014 cuthbertson et al 2020 report catalyzed conversion of hbqs to oh hbqs in the presence of free chlorine by using 2 6 dibromobenzoquinone as example however oh dcbq concentrations were not measured in this chlorination study 3 5 predictions fig 4 a shows the predicted half life for dcbq at phs 7 8 in the absence of free chorine at temperatures up to 30 c as well as the expected half life with a 0 1 mg cl2 l fac residual at ph 7 related calculations were all performed using the following relationship 14 t 1 2 h y d r o l y s i s ln 0 5 k o h o h where k o h e x p 5137 4 1 t 21 97 a summary of relative contribution of reactive species at typical drinking water ds conditions 0 1 3 mg l cl2 is provided in fig 4b as can be seen the role of cl2o in dcbq degradation is expected to become significant as hocl or fac exceeds 1 mg l since cl2o hocl 2 therefore ignoring the cl2o pathway can result in large errors even under typical drinking water conditions 3 6 influence of chloramine residual on dcbq concentrations use of chloramines or combined chlorine in place of free chlorine provides a more stable long term residual and usually results in substantially lower concentrations of regulated dbps at the consumer s tap likewise dcbq occurrence studies have noted lower concentrations in utilities using chloramine compared to free chlorine although it is expected that most of the dcbq in chloraminated systems must be formed during the initial free chlorine contact time preceding conversion to chloramines it is unclear whether the detected low concentrations may be attributed to shorter free chlorine reaction times or faster degradation in the presence of chloramine residual in order to clarify this dcbq stability in the presence of chloramine was investigated through use of preformed chloramine solutions dcbq reaction with monochloramine was documented stability of dcbq in the presence of a high concentration of preformed chloramine 2 5 mg cl2 l at ph 7 2 was studied through consecutive lc injections of the test sample protected from light this concentration was chosen for consistency with the highest concentration used in the fac experiments dcbq stability in the presence of chloramine appeared similar to that from hydrolysis alone therefore under the conditions used in this study loss of dcbq can be entirely attributed to hydrolysis the concentration of preformed chloramine did not significantly change over time a linear plot of natural log of dcbq against time suggested a rate law that is first order in dcbq assuming a reaction that is first order in chloramine the estimated 2nd order rate constant chloramination rate constant kca was 1 m 1s 1 which is close to the apparent rate constant 1 18 m 1s 1 4261 m 1h 1 for the reaction of chloramine with dcbq s iodinated analogue 2 6 dibq at ph 7 and 20 c hu et al 2020 4 conclusions the widespread practice of maintaining a chlorine residual in public drinking water results in the formation of dbps including dcbq and for many of them some degree of simultaneous degradation the net dcbq concentration at any point in a drinking water distribution system is the result of a balance of the two reactions formation vs degradation results from this study indicate an alkaline hydrolysis having first order dependence on both dcbq and oh degradation rates increase with increasing temperature in accordance with the arrhenius equation these results may have important ramifications for 1 dcbq storage conditions 2 predicting seasonal dcbq variations and 3 possible water heater impacts for utilities that maintain high ph in distributed water for corrosion control dcbq can rapidly hydrolyze formation of oh dcbq a known degradation product is expected under conditions where there is absence of fac residual in the presence of fac dcbq loss is accelerated as compared to chloramination or the pure hydrolysis pathway both cl2o and fac were determined to contribute significantly to dcbq decay among the chlorinating reagents the relative importance of cl2o versus fac is expected to increase with increasing fac residual such that they are approximately equal in contribution kcl2o cl2o kfac fac under conditions typical to drinking water systems ph 7 and 1 mg l fac residual under the conditions tested diatomic chlorine cl2 was not a significant reactant in the degradation of dcbq however the equilibrium relationship between of cl and

16916,per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfass are a class of persistent compounds that are resistant to degradation here we developed an effective method of degrading perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos by hydrated electrons eaq that are generated from 3 indole acetic acid iaa upon uv irradiation the method takes advantage of spatial proximity of iaa and pfos by their co sorption to an organic polymer 12 aminolauric acid ala which was pre intercalated into the interlayer space of an expandable clay mineral montmorillonite the interlayer spacing of this clay nanocomposite is greatly expanded relative to unmodified montmorillonite the maximum adsorption capacity of iaa and pfos is 168 and 1550 mmol kg respectively this process achieved 40 70 defluorination of a 10 ppm pfos solution at neutral ph in a 325 ml vessel the presence of bicarbonate and chloride ions or natural groundwater showed a minimal impact on pfos degradation based on identification of prominent degradation products a degradation pathway is proposed where the primary degradation process is breakage of the c f bonds with fluorine replaced by hydrogen with some cleavage of the cc bond this approach provides an alternative for treating concentrated pfas solutions under ambient conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ala degradation iaa montmorillonite pfos sorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a class of synthetic chemical compounds with surfactant properties these compounds are useful in various industrial applications such as textiles carpet manufacturing food packaging leather treatment and fire fighting foam houtz et al 2013 sznajder katarzyńska et al 2019 these prolific uses of pfass are largely ascribed to the strength of the carbon fluorine bond which requires 485 kj mol to break o hagan 2008 a subclass of pfass perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas are thermally stable and resistant to oxidation because of their widespread applications pfaas have made into the epa s list of emerging contaminants pfaas are persistent and bio accumulative and have been shown to be environmentally hazardous and potentially carcinogenic cooke 2017 sznajder katarzyńska et al 2019 due to its widespread occurrence and regulatory focus perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos a particular pfaa has received much attention while production in the united states has voluntarily been phased out since 2002 pfos still exists as a legacy product cooke 2017 thus exposure to pfos in the united states remains a concern several technologies have recently been explored for the destructive defluorination of pfaas including photocatalytic chen et al 2020 tian et al 2016 plasma lewis et al 2020 and electrochemical schaefer et al 2019 wang et al 2020 treatments however these methods often do not completely break down pfass and they either require expensive electrodes use hazardous materials or are energy intensive while ultrasonic degradation has achieved success in complete defluorination the required frequency and power greatly limit the application of this method fernandez et al 2016 photochemical methods used to defluorinate pfaas often rely on hydrated electrons as these are highly reactive cui et al 2020 hydroxyl radicals are ineffective for pfaas likely due to the high strength of the c f bond javed et al 2020 however highly reductive hydrated electrons can break the c f bond bentel et al 2019 chen et al 2020 gu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 while previous studies qu et al 2014 qu et al 2010 song et al 2013 have used hydrated electrons generated through photoionization of iodide or sulfite for treatment of pfoa and pfos the large scale application of this approach may be limited due to 1 the toxicity of iodide and sulfite and generation of elevated levels of undesirable byproducts e g sulfate 2 the difficulty of maintaining anoxic and high ph conditions that are required for the defluorination reaction as both o2 and protons can quickly consume hydrated electrons recent studies gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017a have used hydrated electrons to degrade both pfos and pfoa under partially oxic dissolved oxygen do 5 mg l and alkaline ph 9 2 conditions loss of hydrated electrons from reaction with o2 is partially compensated by a high production rate in a high photon flux uv sulfite system a more recent study has examined the effects of vacuum ultraviolet vuv at a ph of 12 bentel et al 2020 however sulfite and an alkaline condition ph 9 were still required in these systems other studies have adopted variations of uv systems to alleviate some of these requirements sun et al 2018 used a combination of uv and nitrilotriacetic acid nta which scavenged hydroxyl radicals and thereby minimized their reaction with hydrated electrons while pfos degradation was still sensitive to ph it was less sensitive to o2 level gu et al 2020 observed photoreductive degradation of pfos by uv irradiation in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta over a range of ph 4 10 with the removal of o2 but the degradation and defluorination efficiency of pfos at acidic ph were much lower than at alkaline ph in this process edta served as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals however edta is toxic oviedo and rodríguez 2003 in addition in treatment systems with complicated water chemistry containing organic matter co contaminants and anions such as bicarbonate carbonate sulfate and nitrate hydrated electrons can rapidly react with these species and further lower their efficiency towards pfas degradation buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017b tian et al 2016 developed a novel approach through the use of an organic polymer hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtma that was intercalated into the interlayer region of a clay mineral montmorillonite this hdtma montmorillonite nanocomposite was highly hydrophobic and even organophilic pfoa pfos and 3 indole acetic acid iaa a common component of natural organic matter in soils and sediments chen and kenny 2007 miura et al 2011 and a source of hydrated electrons were co sorbed to hdtma upon uv irradiation hydrated electrons were generated from iaa to degrade adjacent pfoa pfos the negatively charged planar surface of hdtma modified montmorillonite stabilized indole radical cations consequently inhibiting their recombination with hydrated electrons nearly complete reductive defluorination of both pfoa and pfos was achieved over a ph range of 3 11 and in air tian et al 2016 the authors postulated that the interlayer region of montmorillonite prevented entry of protons and dissolved oxygen to consume hydrated electrons a more recent study chen et al 2020 reported a near complete defluorination of pfoa by hydrated electrons even without montmorillonite scaffold this approach used positively charged hdtma to co sorb negatively charged pfoa and iaa to form self assembled micelles which increased the degradation efficiency of pfoa due to the spatial proximity between hydrated electrons and pfoa chen et al 2020 despite these encouraging results this approach has a few limitations it is well known that hdtma is toxic and antibacterial even when it is intercalated into the interlayer region of montmorillonite boyd et al 1988 additionally the maximum sorption capacity of hdtma montmorillonite is lower than other alternatives such as resins deng et al 2010 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 for these reasons a more environmentally friendly and highly adsorbing material is desirable in addition while this clay nanocomposite based approach has been shown for pfoa degradation tian et al 2016 the pathway for pfos degradation and intermediate product formation has not been identified some intermediate degradation products may be more toxic than the parent compound brendel et al 2018 kabadi et al 2020 rice et al 2020 finally the effects of natural organic matter co contaminants and competing anions such as nitrate and bicarbonate on pfos degradation are currently unknown a potential replacement which overcomes many of the limitations of hdtma is 12 aminolauric acid ala nh2 ch2 11cooh ala is a saturated omega fatty acid with a 12 carbon atom chain possessing both amino and carboxylic groups it has many properties of medium chain fatty acids it is nontoxic and readily found in many edible plants liu et al 2013 ala is a bacterial metabolite wilding et al 2015 and can be readily intercalated into the expandable clay interlayer when protonated zeng et al 2016 the objective of this study was to develop a technique to effectively degrade pfass under specific conditions pfos was selected as a model compound due to its prevalence and high recalcitrance to achieve a high rate and extent of pfos degradation iaa was selected because it has a high efficiency of emitting hydrated electrons upon uv irradiation a 254 nm monochromatic source tian et al 2016 ala was pre intercalated into the interlayer region of montmorillonite sorption isotherms of iaa and pfos onto ala modified montmorillonite were determined the rate and extent of pfos degradation and defluorination were subsequently determined along with identification of transformation products of pfos degradation the effects of competing anions and natural groundwater were evaluated so that this technology could be evaluated for in or ex situ application to contaminated water this study develops a pfos degradation technology which potentially can be used to remediate contaminated water without hazardous chemical additions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were of laboratory grade or higher and procured from fisher scientific unless specified elsewhere hdtma bromide and pfos cas number 1763 23 1 were purchased from sigma aldrich water methanol and ammonium acetate used for cleaning and mobile phases were purchased from fisher as lc ms grade 2 2 synthesis of organoclay nano composites montmorillonite swy 3 was procured from the source clays repository of the clay minerals society west lafayette in bulk swy 3 was ground and 0 02 0 5 μm size fraction was separated by repeated suspension and centrifugation ala intercalated montmorillonite nanocomposite was synthesized according to a previous method zeng et al 2016 the hdtma montmorillonite nanocomposite was prepared as described previously boyd et al 1988 the detailed method for clay separation and synthesis of ala and hdtma intercalated montmorillonite nanocomposites is described in section 1 of the supporting information si to confirm intercalation of ala into the montmorillonite interlayer powder x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed for swy 3 hdtma modified swy 3 and ala modified swy 3 si section 2 additional characterization was not carried out because our previous study already characterized ala intercalated clay nanocomposite zeng et al 2016 including xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and total organic carbon toc analysis 2 3 batch sorption experiments of iaa f and pfos batch equilibrium experiments were carried out to determine sorption of iaa f and pfos onto swy 3 clay and organoclay nanocomposites the fluoride sorption experiment was performed to account for any possible loss of aqueous f that may be released from pfos defluorination swy 3 clay and organoclay nanocomposites were kept at a concentration of 2 2 g l for time course kinetic experiments initial concentrations of 1 mm 1 mm and 1 ppm were used for iaa pfos and f sorption respectively for sorption isotherm experiments the initial concentrations of iaa and pfos ranged from 0 05 mm to 2 25 mm and from 0 to 20 mm respectively for both types of experiments the adsorbed amounts of iaa and pfos were calculated by the difference in aqueous concentration between the initial and the final time points all sorption experiments were carried out in duplicate the detailed methods for these sorption experiments are described in si section s3 2 4 iaa f and pfos analyses from sorption experiments iaa concentration was analyzed spectrophotometrically using a method modified after tang and bonner 1948 using a thermofisher genesys 10vis spectrophotometer waltham ma for high throughput analysis f concentration was analyzed using the spadns colorimetric method which is based on the reaction between fluoride and a zirconium dye lake marier and rose 1966 fluoride concentration was also periodically checked using ion chromatography ic these two methods compared favorably with no significant difference for high concentration sorption experiments 3 mm pfos concentration was determined using an hplc system for low concentration sorption experiments 3 mm samples were analyzed commercially at eurofins laboratory sacramento ca shoemaker 2018 these methods are described in si section s4 2 5 experimental setup of pfos degradation the pfos degradation experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor model xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical inc nanjing china equipped with an internal quartz photoreactor height 400 mm internal diameter 40 mm volume 325 ml the uv source was a low pressure mercury lamp philips 254 nm 36 w which was fully immersed into the reaction solution the light intensity at the surface of the sheath was 4 5 mw cm 2 tian et al 2016 at the beginning of the experiment swy 3 and ala swy 3 were pre loaded into the reactor to which iaa and pfos were subsequently added the initial concentrations of pfos iaa and clays were 10 mg l 1 mm and 2 2 g l respectively in 18 2 mohm cm water a high pfos concentration of 10 mg l was selected to facilitate f detection and was relevant to pfas concentrated wastewater the ph was adjusted to 7 using 1 n hcl or naoh the pfos iaa and clay suspensions were homogenized with a stir plate the degradation experiment was initiated when the uv lamp was turned on the reaction vessel was kept at ambient temperature using a circulating water bath various controls were run along with samples including no uv source no iaa and no clay duplicate experiments were conducted sampling times were pre determined according to a previous study tian et al 2016 at which points subsamples of 5 ml in volume were collected from the reactor using a transfer pipette the ph remained nearly neutral throughout the experiment in a separate experiment to maximize pfos degradation a high clay concentration 5 g l was used the initial mixture of pfos clay and iaa were allowed to mix overnight to achieve maximum sorption at the beginning and over the course of the experiment additional iaa was spiked three times 0 3 and 6 h 1 mm each time to ensure adequate supply of hydrated electrons while without disturbing the experimental setup to determine the potential effects of competing anions on pfos degradation cheng et al 2010 schaefer et al 2019 degradation experiments were repeated in the presence of 0 1 mm sodium bicarbonate or sodium nitrate degradation experiments were also performed in natural groundwater procured from cdm smith see table s1 for water chemistry in the groundwater experiment 10 ppm pfos was spiked into the groundwater in the presence of 1 mm iaa and 2 2 g l of clay the ph of the groundwater remained at 6 5 throughout the experiment 2 6 analysis of pfos and degradation products analysis of pfos and its transformation products in aqueous solution required a high mass resolution low detection limit method thus these analyses were performed on a lc ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc system data were acquired on a sciex x500r quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof ms system swath in data independent acquisition mode the data were processed via sciex os software ver 1 6 1 for quantification of target compounds with standards concerning the suspect compound analysis a compiled list of candidate intermediates was screened using sciex os non target analysis was conducted using masterview ver 1 3 1 for the extraction of peaks from the swath full scanned data and for statistical data analyses including principal components analysis and log fold change versus p value plot shown as a volcano plot figure s1 confidence of compounds in the list for suspect analysis and the created list by masterview were identified from mass accuracy mass error 5 mg l isotopic pattern from molecular formula difference isotope ratio 20 and ms ms library confirmation 3 results 3 1 characterization of organo clay nanocomposites ala and hdtla intercalation increased the interlayer spacing of swy 3 from 12 4 to 17 0 å and from 12 4 to 13 2 respectively fig 2 table s2 although the amount of ala intercalated into the interlayer of swy 3 was only 4 times cation exchange capacity cec the interlayer spacing was expanded to a similar level as that achieved by much higher amounts of ala at least an order of magnitude higher than the amount used in this study pagtalunan et al 2018 between ala and hdtma ala expanded the layer spacing to a higher extent our previous study based on xrd ftir and toc analyses confirmed that intercalated ala formed chemical bonds with clay mineral zeng et al 2016 3 2 sorption experiments kinetic sorption experiments figure s3 demonstrated that iaa sorption to ala swy 3 occurred quickly with equilibrium attained within approximately 2 h there was a negligible loss of iaa to glassware i e no clay and little sorption to unmodified swy 3 the level of iaa sorption was similar between ala modified figure s3 and hdtma modified swy 3 tian et al 2016 rapid sorption of pfos to ala swy 3 was also observed figure s4 reaching equilibrium in approximately 5 h in comparison the rate and extent of pfos sorption to swy 3 were much lower there was no measurable loss of aqueous pfos in the absence of clay fluoride showed no measurable adsorption figure s5 iaa sorption to swy 3 was negligible figure s6 however iaa sorption to ala and hdtma swy 3 was significant all the sorption isotherms were described using the langmuir isotherm equation the maximum sorption capacity cmax of iaa followed the order of swy 3 hdtma swy 3 ala swy 3 i e 6 140 and 168 mmol kg respectively table s3 the langmuir constant kl a measure of sorption affinity followed the same trend there was little pfos sorption to swy 3 but there was a significant amount of pfos sorption to ala swy 3 figure s7 interestingly there appeared to be two separate sorption stages the first stage occurred at a low ce concentration and it could be described using the langmuir isotherm equation the second stage could not be fitted with this model and may be related to the formation of semi micelle the maximum sorption of pfos to ala swy 3 in the second stage was much higher reaching as high as 1600 mmol kg compared to only 10 mmol kg to swy 3 suggesting that the intercalated ala served as an effective adsorbent 3 3 pfos defluorination pfos defluorination calculated as the percent of measured fluoride ion relative to the total amount of fluoride available in initial pfos was monitored fig 1 a without applied uv radiation fluoride was not generated in various combinations of iaa swy 3 and ala swy 3 0 5 data not shown with uv radiation fluoride generation was less than 5 in water iaa swy 3 or their combinations in contrast significant defluorination was observed in the presence of ala swy 3 reaching 41 at a higher clay concentration 5 g l the extent of defluorination reached as high as 71 fig 1a however spiking of iaa at 0 3 and 6 h did not increase fluoride yield suggesting that hydrated electrons generated from excess iaa were not used to degrade pfos a likely reason may be that excess iaa could not enter the interlayer of montmorillonite because of a limited sorption capacity of the intercalated ala and thus hydrated electrons were likely generated outside the clay interlayer and would not have a chance to degrade the interlayer pfos the presence of bicarbonate and nitrate anions decreased both the initial rate and final extent of pfos defluorination fig 1b c with nitrate exhibiting a greater inhibitory effect the extent of inhibition was proportional to the concentration of these competing anions the presence of pfas impacted natural groundwater did not affect the rate and extent of defluorination fig 1d even in the presence of 3 1 mm chloride anion table s1 some fluoride was generated without pfos and ala swy 3 likely due to direct photolysis of native pfass in groundwater by uv light 3 4 pfos degradation the extent of defluorination does not necessarily represent the extent of degradation because intermediate transformation products may accumulate over time thus liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometric lchrms analysis was performed to quantify pfos and its transformation products interestingly nearly all branched pfos was removed in both water and bicarbonate solutions within two hours but it took much longer to remove linear pfos fig 2 a consistent with a previous study jin and zhang 2015 by 9 h total pfos concentration decreased by 90 by 10 h over 90 of the linear and nearly 100 of the branched pfos were removed from solution consistent with the defluorination result fig 1b the presence of bicarbonate inhibited the removal rate of both linear and branched pfos fig 2a in the experiment with 5 g l ala swy 3 concentration fig 2b the concentration of total pfos dropped quickly within the first half hour followed by a slower removal period rapid removal of pfos fig 2b but little fluoride accumulation fig 1a in the first half hour suggests that degradation intermediates were formed but over extended time these products were degraded to generate fluoride fig 1a by approximately 5 h pfos was removed by 90 lchrms analysis revealed that pfos removal from aqueous solution was a result of sorption and degradation the pfos stock solution contained a small amount of c8f15hso4 10 20 and other minor impurities both pfos and these impurities degraded over time in 16 h there was over 95 removal of pfos and c8f15hso4 correspondingly three degradation products c8f16h2so3 c8f15h3so3 and c8f14h4so3 accumulated figs 3 s8 and table s4 there was a time lag between pfos degradation and its first product formation c8f16h2so3 suggesting that removal of pfos was initially due to sorption to ala swy 3 but subsequently due to degradation minor amounts of c4f8h2so3 and c8fh17so3 were also detected in the presence of bicarbonate there was no significant difference in the relative amounts of these degradation products interestingly the impurity compound c8f15hso4 was not degraded suggesting that its degradation may be more difficult when bicarbonate was present other minor impurities including pfetchxs and pfns were completely removed in 10 h and the concentration of pfhps was reduced by 50 figure s9 3 5 fluorine mass balance the fluorine mass balance was calculated based on measured pfos impurities and transformation products gu et al 2020 the calculated values ranged from 50 to 95 figure s10 with a poor balance near the beginning and a much better one towards the end 8 h the lowest fluorine mass balance at 1 hour corresponded to the sorption maximum but before any significant degradation fig 3a because the fluorine mass balance was calculated from aqueous concentrations of pfos and all transformation products pfos sorption would result in an underestimate at later time points a nearly complete fluorine mass balance suggests that degradation was dominant and any transformation products and fluoride did not sorb to ala swy 3 4 discussion 4 1 sorption of iaa and pfos to swy 3 and ala swy 3 a considerably higher amount of iaa sorption to ala swy 3 and hdtma swy 3 than to swy 3 figure s6 is likely due to the expanded interlayer spacing and the intercalated ala hdtma thus increasing the number of sorption sites solin 1997 likewise the pfos sorption capacity of ala swy 3 reached up to 1600 mmol kg figure s7 which is orders of magnitude higher than pfas sorption to soils milinovic et al 2015 and mineral surfaces johnson et al 2007 wang et al 2012 wang and shih 2011 zhao et al 2014 this level of pfos sorption is in the range of those by custom resins 1000 to 5000 mmol kg of substrate depending on the resin type and ph deng et al 2010 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 however many of these systems require non circumneutral ph and some even require ph values higher than 10 suggesting that adjustment of ph would be required before the wastewater could be discharged zhang et al 2019 the high sorption capacities of both iaa and pfos at neutral ph as shown in this study would facilitate degradation of pfos at environmentally friendly ph 4 2 effects of co present groundwater constituents the greater amount of inhibition by nitrate than by bicarbonate fig 1 was consistent with the result of a previous study gu et al 2017a a likely reason is that the reaction of hydrated electrons with nitrate is much faster than with pfos but the reaction of hydrated electrons with bicarbonate is slower buxton et al 1988 huang et al 2007 nonetheless the inhibitory effect of bicarbonate was still present fig 1b in this case competitive sorption is a likely reason because the montmorillonite scaffold may not be fully efficient to block entry of anions such as nitrate and bicarbonate the pfos degradation experiment showed that a high level of chloride 3 1 mm in a groundwater matrix along with some levels of nitrate 0 15 mm sulfate 0 11 mm and dissolved organic carbon doc 0 574 mg l only decreased the rate of defluorination not the final extent in fact the extent of impact was similar to that by 0 1 mm nitrate alone fig 3 however in natural groundwater doc concentration can range from 2 to 14 mg l pabich et al 2001 striegl et al 2005 and the effect of doc may be more important because it may serve as electron shuttle during solvated electron generation guo et al 2019 and or block pfos sorption sites of ala by competitive sorption 4 3 mechanisms of pfos degradation by hydrated electrons combining the ala intercalation iaa and pfos sorption and subsequent degradation of pfos a schematic model can be proposed fig 4 1 ala enters the interlayer region of montmorillonite expanding the interlayer spacing and increasing surface area 2 iaa and pfos enter the expanded interlayer region and co sorb to ala 3 upon irradiation iaa emits hydrated electrons and indole radical cations 4 pfos is degraded by hydrated electrons generation of hydrated electrons was confirmed previously based on a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement quenching test dmpo and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tian et al 2016 because the same source of hydrated electrons iaa uv lamp and the experimental system were used in this study it was certain that hydrated electrons were responsible for pfos degradation this proposed model explains the enhanced sorption of iaa figure s6 and pfos figure s7 and the enhanced rate and extent of pfos degradation figs 1 2 by ala swy 3 relative to swy 3 alone instead of sorbing to swy 3 iaa and pfos sorb to ala in the swy 3 interlayer which has a much higher sorption capacity furthermore the co localization of iaa and pfos to the same polymer ala decreases the path length that hydrated electrons must travel to the target pfos molecule thus enhancing its degradation and defluorination capacities our observed time course fluorine mass balance curve was different from those in photoreductive degradation of pfos gu et al 2020 sun et al 2018 in those photoreductive reaction systems the fluorine mass balance decreased over reaction time which was ascribed to the formation of partially fluorinated intermediates in our clay composite system because iaa and pfos were added nearly at the same time as uv irradiation sorption and degradation should have been occurring simultaneously at the beginning pfos sorption should be dominating over degradation and thus the fluorine mass balance was low figure s10 because this balance calculation was based on total fluoride recovery in aqueous phase however with extended time degradation became important which explains the improved mass balance of fluorine towards the end of the degradation all sorbed pfos should have been degraded the 100 mass recovery of fluorine at the end of degradation experiment suggests that fluoride figure s5 and intermediate transformation products were fully recovered from aqueous phase and they were not sorbed to mineral surface consistent with a previous study tian and gu 2018 4 4 pfos degradation pathways pfas degradation and defluorination are controlled by both the head group and the length of the fluoroalkyl chain cui et al 2020 so it is specific to each class of pfass for sulfonated pfass such as pfos there are three possible pathways of degradation desulfonation cc breakage resulting in shorter chain compounds and h f exchange cui et al 2020 the presence of sulfonated intermediate products fig 3 suggests that even though the c s bond has a lower energy 272 kj mol than either the cc bond 346 kj mol or the c f bond 485 kj mol this c s bond is not broken because the cleavage of c s bond in pfos by hydrated electrons has been observed in previous studies bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2020 gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017a lack of such cleavage in this study may be related to stabilization of the sulfonic head by the intercalated ala which is the likely site of adsorption zhang et al 2011 the detection of intermediate sulfonated transformation products c8f16h2so3 c8f15h3so3 and c8f14h4so3 suggests that hydrated electrons primarily break the c f bonds to undergo h f exchange although density functional theory calculation has shown that the two center c f bonds have the lowest dissociation bond energy bentel et al 2019 our products analyses do not support the c f cleavage at the center position suggesting that the degradation kinetics of ala sorbed pfos is different from homogeneous degradation reaction in aqueous solution furthermore previous studies have shown stepwise defluorination bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2020 gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017a qu et al 2010 song et al 2013 but our time course accumulation of intermediate transformation products suggest that there may be single and multiple h f exchange reactions occurring at the same time for example the formation of c8f15h3so3 was not at the expense of c8f16h2so3 likewise the formation of c8f14h4so3 was not at the expense of c8f15h3so3 fig 3 these data suggest that the second and third transformation products and possibly other downstream products may be formed from the parent pfos directly without sequentially going through the predecessor compounds it has been suggested that it is less energetically taxing to further break down pfass after they have undergone chain shortening and that it may be more efficient to target the cc bond initially as a means of energy conservation yang et al 2013 a measurable amount of c4f8h2so3 indicates that there has been some chain shortening as the cc bond has been broken in some of the pfos molecules gu et al 2016 through molecular orbital calculation of pfos gu et al 2016 suggests that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of pfos is mainly located on the moiety of c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 atoms and external electron tends to localize in the region over these c atoms thus weakening the cc sigma bond and facilitating the cc bond cleavage 4 5 energy requirements in the 2 2 g l nanocomposite experiment it took approximately 9 h for one log unit i e 90 removal of pfos fig 2a using a 36 w uv bulb in a 0 325 l reaction vessel requiring almost 1000 w h l of energy alternatively the higher clay concentration reactors reached a log unit removal of pfos within 5 h fig 2b this reduced the power requirement almost by half at 550 w h l while this power requirement is not as efficient as electrochemical methods schaefer et al 2019 trautmann et al 2015 it is about as efficient as other methods of hydrated electron generation most notably the uv sulfite system gu et al 2017a gu et al 2017b to further optimize this system the amount of organic polymer intercalated into the montmorillonite interlayer can be increased pagtalunan et al 2018 which could increase sorption capacities of iaa and pfos to further enhance pfos degradation additionally it is possible to increase the concentration of ala swy 3 up to 10 or 15 g l before there is a rheological change of swy 3 this would further increase the rate and extent of pfos degradation to optimize power generation 4 6 implications for treatment this clay nanocomposite approach provides a remediation technology for pfass using an easily made robust organo modified clay which does not require the application or use of hazardous chemicals because the ala and montmorillonite bear minimal costs approximately 90 and 2 5 per kg respectively the predominant energy requirement is the operation of a uv lamp the observation that several impurities in the pfos stock were also destroyed by this method suggest that this method would be viable against other recalcitrant pfass more importantly the fact that this method worked in the presence of bicarbonate and nitrate and even in natural groundwater matrix suggests this method may be broadly applicable to wastewater treatment while the highest concentration of nitrate used in this study 1 mm is far above the action limit set by the usepa ward et al 2018 and also above typical groundwater and surface freshwater levels 1 3 mg l which is 0 02 0 05 mm spalding and exner 1993 bicarbonate concentrations in natural groundwater can be as high as 500 mg l 8 2 mm in carbonate aquifers trainer and heath 1976 likewise in pfas impacted groundwater other pfass may be at higher levels than those in the groundwater tested in this study guelfo and adamson 2018 houtz et al 2013 under these complex conditions the degradation efficiency of pfass may decrease however decreased efficiency may be compensated by increased loadings of ala and ala swy 3 nanocomposite additional research is required to fully demonstrate the utility of this method for scaling up we envision that this method may be effective for treating concentrated pfass in investigator derived wastewater in those cases liters of concentrated pfas wastewater may be treated using a larger uv lamp and larger benchtop reactors 5 25 liters which increase both the volume of treatable liquid and the flux of the incident radiation one potential drawback of this approach is buildup of degradation intermediates over the experimental time frame however with optimization such as increased ala loading and prolonged reaction times these intermediates may be further degraded alternatively these intermediate products may be removed via either advanced oxidation processes or biological degradation 5 conclusions these experimental results demonstrate that the degradation of pfos via an iaa catalyzed reaction can be enhanced by organic modification of montmorillonite the clay provides a protective scaffold for the organic polymer ala which can then function as a sorbent for pfass upon exposure to hydrated electrons generated by the co sorbed iaa under uv irradiation pfos undergoes degradation forming intermediate products and fluoride the presence of nitrate and bicarbonate inhibited pfos degradation with nitrate having a greater inhibition than bicarbonate the technology provides the framework for an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology which does not require any use of any hazardous materials due to these reasons this technology provides the potential for an in situ or ex situ remediation technique for pfas concentrated small volume wastewater such as investigator derived wastewater however additional research is needed to optimize the performance for scaling up applications author contributions hd and ces conceived the research

16916,per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfass are a class of persistent compounds that are resistant to degradation here we developed an effective method of degrading perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos by hydrated electrons eaq that are generated from 3 indole acetic acid iaa upon uv irradiation the method takes advantage of spatial proximity of iaa and pfos by their co sorption to an organic polymer 12 aminolauric acid ala which was pre intercalated into the interlayer space of an expandable clay mineral montmorillonite the interlayer spacing of this clay nanocomposite is greatly expanded relative to unmodified montmorillonite the maximum adsorption capacity of iaa and pfos is 168 and 1550 mmol kg respectively this process achieved 40 70 defluorination of a 10 ppm pfos solution at neutral ph in a 325 ml vessel the presence of bicarbonate and chloride ions or natural groundwater showed a minimal impact on pfos degradation based on identification of prominent degradation products a degradation pathway is proposed where the primary degradation process is breakage of the c f bonds with fluorine replaced by hydrogen with some cleavage of the cc bond this approach provides an alternative for treating concentrated pfas solutions under ambient conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ala degradation iaa montmorillonite pfos sorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a class of synthetic chemical compounds with surfactant properties these compounds are useful in various industrial applications such as textiles carpet manufacturing food packaging leather treatment and fire fighting foam houtz et al 2013 sznajder katarzyńska et al 2019 these prolific uses of pfass are largely ascribed to the strength of the carbon fluorine bond which requires 485 kj mol to break o hagan 2008 a subclass of pfass perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas are thermally stable and resistant to oxidation because of their widespread applications pfaas have made into the epa s list of emerging contaminants pfaas are persistent and bio accumulative and have been shown to be environmentally hazardous and potentially carcinogenic cooke 2017 sznajder katarzyńska et al 2019 due to its widespread occurrence and regulatory focus perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos a particular pfaa has received much attention while production in the united states has voluntarily been phased out since 2002 pfos still exists as a legacy product cooke 2017 thus exposure to pfos in the united states remains a concern several technologies have recently been explored for the destructive defluorination of pfaas including photocatalytic chen et al 2020 tian et al 2016 plasma lewis et al 2020 and electrochemical schaefer et al 2019 wang et al 2020 treatments however these methods often do not completely break down pfass and they either require expensive electrodes use hazardous materials or are energy intensive while ultrasonic degradation has achieved success in complete defluorination the required frequency and power greatly limit the application of this method fernandez et al 2016 photochemical methods used to defluorinate pfaas often rely on hydrated electrons as these are highly reactive cui et al 2020 hydroxyl radicals are ineffective for pfaas likely due to the high strength of the c f bond javed et al 2020 however highly reductive hydrated electrons can break the c f bond bentel et al 2019 chen et al 2020 gu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 while previous studies qu et al 2014 qu et al 2010 song et al 2013 have used hydrated electrons generated through photoionization of iodide or sulfite for treatment of pfoa and pfos the large scale application of this approach may be limited due to 1 the toxicity of iodide and sulfite and generation of elevated levels of undesirable byproducts e g sulfate 2 the difficulty of maintaining anoxic and high ph conditions that are required for the defluorination reaction as both o2 and protons can quickly consume hydrated electrons recent studies gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017a have used hydrated electrons to degrade both pfos and pfoa under partially oxic dissolved oxygen do 5 mg l and alkaline ph 9 2 conditions loss of hydrated electrons from reaction with o2 is partially compensated by a high production rate in a high photon flux uv sulfite system a more recent study has examined the effects of vacuum ultraviolet vuv at a ph of 12 bentel et al 2020 however sulfite and an alkaline condition ph 9 were still required in these systems other studies have adopted variations of uv systems to alleviate some of these requirements sun et al 2018 used a combination of uv and nitrilotriacetic acid nta which scavenged hydroxyl radicals and thereby minimized their reaction with hydrated electrons while pfos degradation was still sensitive to ph it was less sensitive to o2 level gu et al 2020 observed photoreductive degradation of pfos by uv irradiation in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta over a range of ph 4 10 with the removal of o2 but the degradation and defluorination efficiency of pfos at acidic ph were much lower than at alkaline ph in this process edta served as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals however edta is toxic oviedo and rodríguez 2003 in addition in treatment systems with complicated water chemistry containing organic matter co contaminants and anions such as bicarbonate carbonate sulfate and nitrate hydrated electrons can rapidly react with these species and further lower their efficiency towards pfas degradation buxton et al 1988 gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017b tian et al 2016 developed a novel approach through the use of an organic polymer hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtma that was intercalated into the interlayer region of a clay mineral montmorillonite this hdtma montmorillonite nanocomposite was highly hydrophobic and even organophilic pfoa pfos and 3 indole acetic acid iaa a common component of natural organic matter in soils and sediments chen and kenny 2007 miura et al 2011 and a source of hydrated electrons were co sorbed to hdtma upon uv irradiation hydrated electrons were generated from iaa to degrade adjacent pfoa pfos the negatively charged planar surface of hdtma modified montmorillonite stabilized indole radical cations consequently inhibiting their recombination with hydrated electrons nearly complete reductive defluorination of both pfoa and pfos was achieved over a ph range of 3 11 and in air tian et al 2016 the authors postulated that the interlayer region of montmorillonite prevented entry of protons and dissolved oxygen to consume hydrated electrons a more recent study chen et al 2020 reported a near complete defluorination of pfoa by hydrated electrons even without montmorillonite scaffold this approach used positively charged hdtma to co sorb negatively charged pfoa and iaa to form self assembled micelles which increased the degradation efficiency of pfoa due to the spatial proximity between hydrated electrons and pfoa chen et al 2020 despite these encouraging results this approach has a few limitations it is well known that hdtma is toxic and antibacterial even when it is intercalated into the interlayer region of montmorillonite boyd et al 1988 additionally the maximum sorption capacity of hdtma montmorillonite is lower than other alternatives such as resins deng et al 2010 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 for these reasons a more environmentally friendly and highly adsorbing material is desirable in addition while this clay nanocomposite based approach has been shown for pfoa degradation tian et al 2016 the pathway for pfos degradation and intermediate product formation has not been identified some intermediate degradation products may be more toxic than the parent compound brendel et al 2018 kabadi et al 2020 rice et al 2020 finally the effects of natural organic matter co contaminants and competing anions such as nitrate and bicarbonate on pfos degradation are currently unknown a potential replacement which overcomes many of the limitations of hdtma is 12 aminolauric acid ala nh2 ch2 11cooh ala is a saturated omega fatty acid with a 12 carbon atom chain possessing both amino and carboxylic groups it has many properties of medium chain fatty acids it is nontoxic and readily found in many edible plants liu et al 2013 ala is a bacterial metabolite wilding et al 2015 and can be readily intercalated into the expandable clay interlayer when protonated zeng et al 2016 the objective of this study was to develop a technique to effectively degrade pfass under specific conditions pfos was selected as a model compound due to its prevalence and high recalcitrance to achieve a high rate and extent of pfos degradation iaa was selected because it has a high efficiency of emitting hydrated electrons upon uv irradiation a 254 nm monochromatic source tian et al 2016 ala was pre intercalated into the interlayer region of montmorillonite sorption isotherms of iaa and pfos onto ala modified montmorillonite were determined the rate and extent of pfos degradation and defluorination were subsequently determined along with identification of transformation products of pfos degradation the effects of competing anions and natural groundwater were evaluated so that this technology could be evaluated for in or ex situ application to contaminated water this study develops a pfos degradation technology which potentially can be used to remediate contaminated water without hazardous chemical additions 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used were of laboratory grade or higher and procured from fisher scientific unless specified elsewhere hdtma bromide and pfos cas number 1763 23 1 were purchased from sigma aldrich water methanol and ammonium acetate used for cleaning and mobile phases were purchased from fisher as lc ms grade 2 2 synthesis of organoclay nano composites montmorillonite swy 3 was procured from the source clays repository of the clay minerals society west lafayette in bulk swy 3 was ground and 0 02 0 5 μm size fraction was separated by repeated suspension and centrifugation ala intercalated montmorillonite nanocomposite was synthesized according to a previous method zeng et al 2016 the hdtma montmorillonite nanocomposite was prepared as described previously boyd et al 1988 the detailed method for clay separation and synthesis of ala and hdtma intercalated montmorillonite nanocomposites is described in section 1 of the supporting information si to confirm intercalation of ala into the montmorillonite interlayer powder x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed for swy 3 hdtma modified swy 3 and ala modified swy 3 si section 2 additional characterization was not carried out because our previous study already characterized ala intercalated clay nanocomposite zeng et al 2016 including xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and total organic carbon toc analysis 2 3 batch sorption experiments of iaa f and pfos batch equilibrium experiments were carried out to determine sorption of iaa f and pfos onto swy 3 clay and organoclay nanocomposites the fluoride sorption experiment was performed to account for any possible loss of aqueous f that may be released from pfos defluorination swy 3 clay and organoclay nanocomposites were kept at a concentration of 2 2 g l for time course kinetic experiments initial concentrations of 1 mm 1 mm and 1 ppm were used for iaa pfos and f sorption respectively for sorption isotherm experiments the initial concentrations of iaa and pfos ranged from 0 05 mm to 2 25 mm and from 0 to 20 mm respectively for both types of experiments the adsorbed amounts of iaa and pfos were calculated by the difference in aqueous concentration between the initial and the final time points all sorption experiments were carried out in duplicate the detailed methods for these sorption experiments are described in si section s3 2 4 iaa f and pfos analyses from sorption experiments iaa concentration was analyzed spectrophotometrically using a method modified after tang and bonner 1948 using a thermofisher genesys 10vis spectrophotometer waltham ma for high throughput analysis f concentration was analyzed using the spadns colorimetric method which is based on the reaction between fluoride and a zirconium dye lake marier and rose 1966 fluoride concentration was also periodically checked using ion chromatography ic these two methods compared favorably with no significant difference for high concentration sorption experiments 3 mm pfos concentration was determined using an hplc system for low concentration sorption experiments 3 mm samples were analyzed commercially at eurofins laboratory sacramento ca shoemaker 2018 these methods are described in si section s4 2 5 experimental setup of pfos degradation the pfos degradation experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor model xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical inc nanjing china equipped with an internal quartz photoreactor height 400 mm internal diameter 40 mm volume 325 ml the uv source was a low pressure mercury lamp philips 254 nm 36 w which was fully immersed into the reaction solution the light intensity at the surface of the sheath was 4 5 mw cm 2 tian et al 2016 at the beginning of the experiment swy 3 and ala swy 3 were pre loaded into the reactor to which iaa and pfos were subsequently added the initial concentrations of pfos iaa and clays were 10 mg l 1 mm and 2 2 g l respectively in 18 2 mohm cm water a high pfos concentration of 10 mg l was selected to facilitate f detection and was relevant to pfas concentrated wastewater the ph was adjusted to 7 using 1 n hcl or naoh the pfos iaa and clay suspensions were homogenized with a stir plate the degradation experiment was initiated when the uv lamp was turned on the reaction vessel was kept at ambient temperature using a circulating water bath various controls were run along with samples including no uv source no iaa and no clay duplicate experiments were conducted sampling times were pre determined according to a previous study tian et al 2016 at which points subsamples of 5 ml in volume were collected from the reactor using a transfer pipette the ph remained nearly neutral throughout the experiment in a separate experiment to maximize pfos degradation a high clay concentration 5 g l was used the initial mixture of pfos clay and iaa were allowed to mix overnight to achieve maximum sorption at the beginning and over the course of the experiment additional iaa was spiked three times 0 3 and 6 h 1 mm each time to ensure adequate supply of hydrated electrons while without disturbing the experimental setup to determine the potential effects of competing anions on pfos degradation cheng et al 2010 schaefer et al 2019 degradation experiments were repeated in the presence of 0 1 mm sodium bicarbonate or sodium nitrate degradation experiments were also performed in natural groundwater procured from cdm smith see table s1 for water chemistry in the groundwater experiment 10 ppm pfos was spiked into the groundwater in the presence of 1 mm iaa and 2 2 g l of clay the ph of the groundwater remained at 6 5 throughout the experiment 2 6 analysis of pfos and degradation products analysis of pfos and its transformation products in aqueous solution required a high mass resolution low detection limit method thus these analyses were performed on a lc ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc system data were acquired on a sciex x500r quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtof ms system swath in data independent acquisition mode the data were processed via sciex os software ver 1 6 1 for quantification of target compounds with standards concerning the suspect compound analysis a compiled list of candidate intermediates was screened using sciex os non target analysis was conducted using masterview ver 1 3 1 for the extraction of peaks from the swath full scanned data and for statistical data analyses including principal components analysis and log fold change versus p value plot shown as a volcano plot figure s1 confidence of compounds in the list for suspect analysis and the created list by masterview were identified from mass accuracy mass error 5 mg l isotopic pattern from molecular formula difference isotope ratio 20 and ms ms library confirmation 3 results 3 1 characterization of organo clay nanocomposites ala and hdtla intercalation increased the interlayer spacing of swy 3 from 12 4 to 17 0 å and from 12 4 to 13 2 respectively fig 2 table s2 although the amount of ala intercalated into the interlayer of swy 3 was only 4 times cation exchange capacity cec the interlayer spacing was expanded to a similar level as that achieved by much higher amounts of ala at least an order of magnitude higher than the amount used in this study pagtalunan et al 2018 between ala and hdtma ala expanded the layer spacing to a higher extent our previous study based on xrd ftir and toc analyses confirmed that intercalated ala formed chemical bonds with clay mineral zeng et al 2016 3 2 sorption experiments kinetic sorption experiments figure s3 demonstrated that iaa sorption to ala swy 3 occurred quickly with equilibrium attained within approximately 2 h there was a negligible loss of iaa to glassware i e no clay and little sorption to unmodified swy 3 the level of iaa sorption was similar between ala modified figure s3 and hdtma modified swy 3 tian et al 2016 rapid sorption of pfos to ala swy 3 was also observed figure s4 reaching equilibrium in approximately 5 h in comparison the rate and extent of pfos sorption to swy 3 were much lower there was no measurable loss of aqueous pfos in the absence of clay fluoride showed no measurable adsorption figure s5 iaa sorption to swy 3 was negligible figure s6 however iaa sorption to ala and hdtma swy 3 was significant all the sorption isotherms were described using the langmuir isotherm equation the maximum sorption capacity cmax of iaa followed the order of swy 3 hdtma swy 3 ala swy 3 i e 6 140 and 168 mmol kg respectively table s3 the langmuir constant kl a measure of sorption affinity followed the same trend there was little pfos sorption to swy 3 but there was a significant amount of pfos sorption to ala swy 3 figure s7 interestingly there appeared to be two separate sorption stages the first stage occurred at a low ce concentration and it could be described using the langmuir isotherm equation the second stage could not be fitted with this model and may be related to the formation of semi micelle the maximum sorption of pfos to ala swy 3 in the second stage was much higher reaching as high as 1600 mmol kg compared to only 10 mmol kg to swy 3 suggesting that the intercalated ala served as an effective adsorbent 3 3 pfos defluorination pfos defluorination calculated as the percent of measured fluoride ion relative to the total amount of fluoride available in initial pfos was monitored fig 1 a without applied uv radiation fluoride was not generated in various combinations of iaa swy 3 and ala swy 3 0 5 data not shown with uv radiation fluoride generation was less than 5 in water iaa swy 3 or their combinations in contrast significant defluorination was observed in the presence of ala swy 3 reaching 41 at a higher clay concentration 5 g l the extent of defluorination reached as high as 71 fig 1a however spiking of iaa at 0 3 and 6 h did not increase fluoride yield suggesting that hydrated electrons generated from excess iaa were not used to degrade pfos a likely reason may be that excess iaa could not enter the interlayer of montmorillonite because of a limited sorption capacity of the intercalated ala and thus hydrated electrons were likely generated outside the clay interlayer and would not have a chance to degrade the interlayer pfos the presence of bicarbonate and nitrate anions decreased both the initial rate and final extent of pfos defluorination fig 1b c with nitrate exhibiting a greater inhibitory effect the extent of inhibition was proportional to the concentration of these competing anions the presence of pfas impacted natural groundwater did not affect the rate and extent of defluorination fig 1d even in the presence of 3 1 mm chloride anion table s1 some fluoride was generated without pfos and ala swy 3 likely due to direct photolysis of native pfass in groundwater by uv light 3 4 pfos degradation the extent of defluorination does not necessarily represent the extent of degradation because intermediate transformation products may accumulate over time thus liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometric lchrms analysis was performed to quantify pfos and its transformation products interestingly nearly all branched pfos was removed in both water and bicarbonate solutions within two hours but it took much longer to remove linear pfos fig 2 a consistent with a previous study jin and zhang 2015 by 9 h total pfos concentration decreased by 90 by 10 h over 90 of the linear and nearly 100 of the branched pfos were removed from solution consistent with the defluorination result fig 1b the presence of bicarbonate inhibited the removal rate of both linear and branched pfos fig 2a in the experiment with 5 g l ala swy 3 concentration fig 2b the concentration of total pfos dropped quickly within the first half hour followed by a slower removal period rapid removal of pfos fig 2b but little fluoride accumulation fig 1a in the first half hour suggests that degradation intermediates were formed but over extended time these products were degraded to generate fluoride fig 1a by approximately 5 h pfos was removed by 90 lchrms analysis revealed that pfos removal from aqueous solution was a result of sorption and degradation the pfos stock solution contained a small amount of c8f15hso4 10 20 and other minor impurities both pfos and these impurities degraded over time in 16 h there was over 95 removal of pfos and c8f15hso4 correspondingly three degradation products c8f16h2so3 c8f15h3so3 and c8f14h4so3 accumulated figs 3 s8 and table s4 there was a time lag between pfos degradation and its first product formation c8f16h2so3 suggesting that removal of pfos was initially due to sorption to ala swy 3 but subsequently due to degradation minor amounts of c4f8h2so3 and c8fh17so3 were also detected in the presence of bicarbonate there was no significant difference in the relative amounts of these degradation products interestingly the impurity compound c8f15hso4 was not degraded suggesting that its degradation may be more difficult when bicarbonate was present other minor impurities including pfetchxs and pfns were completely removed in 10 h and the concentration of pfhps was reduced by 50 figure s9 3 5 fluorine mass balance the fluorine mass balance was calculated based on measured pfos impurities and transformation products gu et al 2020 the calculated values ranged from 50 to 95 figure s10 with a poor balance near the beginning and a much better one towards the end 8 h the lowest fluorine mass balance at 1 hour corresponded to the sorption maximum but before any significant degradation fig 3a because the fluorine mass balance was calculated from aqueous concentrations of pfos and all transformation products pfos sorption would result in an underestimate at later time points a nearly complete fluorine mass balance suggests that degradation was dominant and any transformation products and fluoride did not sorb to ala swy 3 4 discussion 4 1 sorption of iaa and pfos to swy 3 and ala swy 3 a considerably higher amount of iaa sorption to ala swy 3 and hdtma swy 3 than to swy 3 figure s6 is likely due to the expanded interlayer spacing and the intercalated ala hdtma thus increasing the number of sorption sites solin 1997 likewise the pfos sorption capacity of ala swy 3 reached up to 1600 mmol kg figure s7 which is orders of magnitude higher than pfas sorption to soils milinovic et al 2015 and mineral surfaces johnson et al 2007 wang et al 2012 wang and shih 2011 zhao et al 2014 this level of pfos sorption is in the range of those by custom resins 1000 to 5000 mmol kg of substrate depending on the resin type and ph deng et al 2010 yu et al 2009 zaggia et al 2016 however many of these systems require non circumneutral ph and some even require ph values higher than 10 suggesting that adjustment of ph would be required before the wastewater could be discharged zhang et al 2019 the high sorption capacities of both iaa and pfos at neutral ph as shown in this study would facilitate degradation of pfos at environmentally friendly ph 4 2 effects of co present groundwater constituents the greater amount of inhibition by nitrate than by bicarbonate fig 1 was consistent with the result of a previous study gu et al 2017a a likely reason is that the reaction of hydrated electrons with nitrate is much faster than with pfos but the reaction of hydrated electrons with bicarbonate is slower buxton et al 1988 huang et al 2007 nonetheless the inhibitory effect of bicarbonate was still present fig 1b in this case competitive sorption is a likely reason because the montmorillonite scaffold may not be fully efficient to block entry of anions such as nitrate and bicarbonate the pfos degradation experiment showed that a high level of chloride 3 1 mm in a groundwater matrix along with some levels of nitrate 0 15 mm sulfate 0 11 mm and dissolved organic carbon doc 0 574 mg l only decreased the rate of defluorination not the final extent in fact the extent of impact was similar to that by 0 1 mm nitrate alone fig 3 however in natural groundwater doc concentration can range from 2 to 14 mg l pabich et al 2001 striegl et al 2005 and the effect of doc may be more important because it may serve as electron shuttle during solvated electron generation guo et al 2019 and or block pfos sorption sites of ala by competitive sorption 4 3 mechanisms of pfos degradation by hydrated electrons combining the ala intercalation iaa and pfos sorption and subsequent degradation of pfos a schematic model can be proposed fig 4 1 ala enters the interlayer region of montmorillonite expanding the interlayer spacing and increasing surface area 2 iaa and pfos enter the expanded interlayer region and co sorb to ala 3 upon irradiation iaa emits hydrated electrons and indole radical cations 4 pfos is degraded by hydrated electrons generation of hydrated electrons was confirmed previously based on a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement quenching test dmpo and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy tian et al 2016 because the same source of hydrated electrons iaa uv lamp and the experimental system were used in this study it was certain that hydrated electrons were responsible for pfos degradation this proposed model explains the enhanced sorption of iaa figure s6 and pfos figure s7 and the enhanced rate and extent of pfos degradation figs 1 2 by ala swy 3 relative to swy 3 alone instead of sorbing to swy 3 iaa and pfos sorb to ala in the swy 3 interlayer which has a much higher sorption capacity furthermore the co localization of iaa and pfos to the same polymer ala decreases the path length that hydrated electrons must travel to the target pfos molecule thus enhancing its degradation and defluorination capacities our observed time course fluorine mass balance curve was different from those in photoreductive degradation of pfos gu et al 2020 sun et al 2018 in those photoreductive reaction systems the fluorine mass balance decreased over reaction time which was ascribed to the formation of partially fluorinated intermediates in our clay composite system because iaa and pfos were added nearly at the same time as uv irradiation sorption and degradation should have been occurring simultaneously at the beginning pfos sorption should be dominating over degradation and thus the fluorine mass balance was low figure s10 because this balance calculation was based on total fluoride recovery in aqueous phase however with extended time degradation became important which explains the improved mass balance of fluorine towards the end of the degradation all sorbed pfos should have been degraded the 100 mass recovery of fluorine at the end of degradation experiment suggests that fluoride figure s5 and intermediate transformation products were fully recovered from aqueous phase and they were not sorbed to mineral surface consistent with a previous study tian and gu 2018 4 4 pfos degradation pathways pfas degradation and defluorination are controlled by both the head group and the length of the fluoroalkyl chain cui et al 2020 so it is specific to each class of pfass for sulfonated pfass such as pfos there are three possible pathways of degradation desulfonation cc breakage resulting in shorter chain compounds and h f exchange cui et al 2020 the presence of sulfonated intermediate products fig 3 suggests that even though the c s bond has a lower energy 272 kj mol than either the cc bond 346 kj mol or the c f bond 485 kj mol this c s bond is not broken because the cleavage of c s bond in pfos by hydrated electrons has been observed in previous studies bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2020 gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017a lack of such cleavage in this study may be related to stabilization of the sulfonic head by the intercalated ala which is the likely site of adsorption zhang et al 2011 the detection of intermediate sulfonated transformation products c8f16h2so3 c8f15h3so3 and c8f14h4so3 suggests that hydrated electrons primarily break the c f bonds to undergo h f exchange although density functional theory calculation has shown that the two center c f bonds have the lowest dissociation bond energy bentel et al 2019 our products analyses do not support the c f cleavage at the center position suggesting that the degradation kinetics of ala sorbed pfos is different from homogeneous degradation reaction in aqueous solution furthermore previous studies have shown stepwise defluorination bentel et al 2019 gu et al 2020 gu et al 2016 gu et al 2017a qu et al 2010 song et al 2013 but our time course accumulation of intermediate transformation products suggest that there may be single and multiple h f exchange reactions occurring at the same time for example the formation of c8f15h3so3 was not at the expense of c8f16h2so3 likewise the formation of c8f14h4so3 was not at the expense of c8f15h3so3 fig 3 these data suggest that the second and third transformation products and possibly other downstream products may be formed from the parent pfos directly without sequentially going through the predecessor compounds it has been suggested that it is less energetically taxing to further break down pfass after they have undergone chain shortening and that it may be more efficient to target the cc bond initially as a means of energy conservation yang et al 2013 a measurable amount of c4f8h2so3 indicates that there has been some chain shortening as the cc bond has been broken in some of the pfos molecules gu et al 2016 through molecular orbital calculation of pfos gu et al 2016 suggests that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of pfos is mainly located on the moiety of c4 c5 c6 c7 and c8 atoms and external electron tends to localize in the region over these c atoms thus weakening the cc sigma bond and facilitating the cc bond cleavage 4 5 energy requirements in the 2 2 g l nanocomposite experiment it took approximately 9 h for one log unit i e 90 removal of pfos fig 2a using a 36 w uv bulb in a 0 325 l reaction vessel requiring almost 1000 w h l of energy alternatively the higher clay concentration reactors reached a log unit removal of pfos within 5 h fig 2b this reduced the power requirement almost by half at 550 w h l while this power requirement is not as efficient as electrochemical methods schaefer et al 2019 trautmann et al 2015 it is about as efficient as other methods of hydrated electron generation most notably the uv sulfite system gu et al 2017a gu et al 2017b to further optimize this system the amount of organic polymer intercalated into the montmorillonite interlayer can be increased pagtalunan et al 2018 which could increase sorption capacities of iaa and pfos to further enhance pfos degradation additionally it is possible to increase the concentration of ala swy 3 up to 10 or 15 g l before there is a rheological change of swy 3 this would further increase the rate and extent of pfos degradation to optimize power generation 4 6 implications for treatment this clay nanocomposite approach provides a remediation technology for pfass using an easily made robust organo modified clay which does not require the application or use of hazardous chemicals because the ala and montmorillonite bear minimal costs approximately 90 and 2 5 per kg respectively the predominant energy requirement is the operation of a uv lamp the observation that several impurities in the pfos stock were also destroyed by this method suggest that this method would be viable against other recalcitrant pfass more importantly the fact that this method worked in the presence of bicarbonate and nitrate and even in natural groundwater matrix suggests this method may be broadly applicable to wastewater treatment while the highest concentration of nitrate used in this study 1 mm is far above the action limit set by the usepa ward et al 2018 and also above typical groundwater and surface freshwater levels 1 3 mg l which is 0 02 0 05 mm spalding and exner 1993 bicarbonate concentrations in natural groundwater can be as high as 500 mg l 8 2 mm in carbonate aquifers trainer and heath 1976 likewise in pfas impacted groundwater other pfass may be at higher levels than those in the groundwater tested in this study guelfo and adamson 2018 houtz et al 2013 under these complex conditions the degradation efficiency of pfass may decrease however decreased efficiency may be compensated by increased loadings of ala and ala swy 3 nanocomposite additional research is required to fully demonstrate the utility of this method for scaling up we envision that this method may be effective for treating concentrated pfass in investigator derived wastewater in those cases liters of concentrated pfas wastewater may be treated using a larger uv lamp and larger benchtop reactors 5 25 liters which increase both the volume of treatable liquid and the flux of the incident radiation one potential drawback of this approach is buildup of degradation intermediates over the experimental time frame however with optimization such as increased ala loading and prolonged reaction times these intermediates may be further degraded alternatively these intermediate products may be removed via either advanced oxidation processes or biological degradation 5 conclusions these experimental results demonstrate that the degradation of pfos via an iaa catalyzed reaction can be enhanced by organic modification of montmorillonite the clay provides a protective scaffold for the organic polymer ala which can then function as a sorbent for pfass upon exposure to hydrated electrons generated by the co sorbed iaa under uv irradiation pfos undergoes degradation forming intermediate products and fluoride the presence of nitrate and bicarbonate inhibited pfos degradation with nitrate having a greater inhibition than bicarbonate the technology provides the framework for an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology which does not require any use of any hazardous materials due to these reasons this technology provides the potential for an in situ or ex situ remediation technique for pfas concentrated small volume wastewater such as investigator derived wastewater however additional research is needed to optimize the performance for scaling up applications author contributions hd and ces conceived the research

16917,the community composition and biomass of phytoplankton in shallow lakes are impacted by many environmental factors including water quality physicochemical parameters land use in the watershed and lake morphology however few studies have simultaneously evaluated the relative importance of these factors on the effect of community composition and biomass of phytoplankton the relative importance of the water quality physicochemical parameters water temperature wt total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec turbidity and secchi depth sd land use built up land farmland waters forest grassland and unused land in the watershed and lake morphology area and depth on the composition and biomass of phytoplankton communities were assessed in 29 subtropical shallow lakes in wuhan china during different seasons from december 2017 to november 2018 the results showed that phytoplankton in all 29 lakes was mainly composed of cyanophyta chlorophyta and bacillariophyta phytoplankton abundance was highest in summer and lowest in winter we analyzed the relative importance of the three groups of variables to the community composition of the phytoplankton by variance decomposition the results showed that the three groups of environmental variables had the highest explanation rate 80 for the composition of the phytoplankton community in summer and autumn and the explanation rates in spring and winter were 42 1 and 39 8 respectively the water quality physicochemical parameters were the most important variables affecting the composition of phytoplankton communities followed by land use in the watershed through generalized additive model and structural equation model analysis we found that the land use and lake morphology had minimal direct impact on the chl a and cell density of phytoplankton mainly by altering the tn tp turbidity sd do and ec which indirectly affected phytoplankton wt and nutrients were still the main predictors of phytoplankton abundance built up land was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes correlation analysis found that forest and grassland had positive impacts on reducing lake nitrogen and phosphorus contents this showed that increasing grassland and forest in the watershed could reduce the pollutants entering the lake our findings will contribute to water quality management and pollution control for subtropical shallow lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords land use lake morphology phytoplankton structural equation model subtropical shallow lakes 1 introduction with increasing combined effects of urbanization development and human activity many freshwater bodies suffer from aquatic ecological degradation and eutrophication znachor et al 2020 phytoplankton is an important primary producer in lake ecosystems and changes in its composition and biomass will directly affect the structure function and stability of aquatic ecosystems padisák 2006 over propagation of phytoplankton can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems and decreased biodiversity znachor et al 2020 therefore understanding the impact of environmental drivers on phytoplankton communities is critical to assessing the impact of human activities on lake ecosystems paerl and paul 2012 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 the biomass and community structure of phytoplankton are affected by many environmental factors many scholars have studied the effects of water quality physicochemical parameters such as nutrients ph wt and transparency on phytoplankton on a local scale navas parejo et al 2020 muhid et al 2013 shan et al 2019 in addition land use changes in a watershed caused by human activities and resulting decreases in water quality are considered to be an important driving force affecting phytoplankton growth the extent of this effect depends largely on the regional climate in the mediterranean region greece the phytoplankton species compositions in freshwater lakes are highly correlated with land use katsiapi et al 2012 in argentina which experiences a temperate climate land use has a greater impact on phytoplankton than the physicochemical parameters of lakes sánchez et al 2021 agricultural land in the yunnan guizhou plateau of china has a significant impact on cyanobacteria in lakes cao et al 2017 however in a temperate maritime climate region denmark land use did not greatly contribute to changes in lake phytoplankton abundance özkan et al 2013 additionally it was found that the explanation rate of land use for phytoplankton changes was low in 25 shallow reservoirs in brazil rocha et al 2020 few previous studies have investigated the effect of watershed land use on phytoplankton biomass and species composition in subtropical regions in addition the lake area and depth are important parameters of lake morphology and influence species diversity by impacting habitat cardoso et al 2017 the lake depth affects light availability and result in vertical heterogeneity in lakes which affects phytoplankton biomass and community structure cardoso et al 2017 the diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton fish and other species in lakes are positively related to the lake area kalff 2002 in the mediterranean region lake morphology had a strong influence on bacillariophyta cyanophyta and euglenophyta richness özkan et al 2013 although the effects of basin land use lake morphology and water quality physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton have been extensively studied their coupling effects and relative importance to phytoplankton biomass and community composition has received limited attention especially in lakes in subtropical regions since the predictors of phytoplankton community biomass in shallow lakes may be interrelated it is difficult to determine the key factors for example the concentration of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes may be affected by land use in the watershed liberoff et al 2019 pratt and chang 2012 cao et al 2017 studies have shown that farmland and built up land are the main sources of nutrient and pollutants in lakes and reservoirs and that water quality is decreased when these nutrient pollutants exceed a certain threshold liberoff et al 2019 pratt and chang 2012 forest and grasslands provide higher absorption of pollutants and play an important role in improving water quality mello et al 2018 on the other hand lake morphology is considered to reflect the buffering capacity of nutrient input deng 2020 at present the key issue is usually that only one single type of factor is considered regarding the influence on the biomass and community composition of phytoplankton which cannot effectively describe the complex relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors therefore when evaluating the comprehensive effects of multiple factors on phytoplankton community composition and biomass the coupling effect between variables should be considered to explore the driving effects of land use lake morphology and water quality physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton biomass total cell density and chl a and community composition change characteristic in subtropical shallow lakes samples were collected from 29 subtropical shallow lakes in wuhan city china and analyzed we assumed that phytoplankton biomass and community composition were primarily affected by water quality physicochemical parameters land use and lake morphology affected phytoplankton growth by coupling with the water quality physicochemical parameters this study aimed to 1 study the characteristics of phytoplankton community and biomass in 29 lakes in different seasons 2 explore the relative importance of water quality parameters land use and lake morphology as driving factors for phytoplankton community abundance and biomass and 3 assess the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on phytoplankton biomass this study is important for understanding the impact of environmental changes on phytoplankton and providing a scientific basis for water quality assessment and pollution control in subtropical shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the investigated lakes are located in wuhan hubei province china the region has a subtropical monsoon humid climate with abundant

studies have shown that with the development of urbanization the water area of lakes in wuhan has decreased significantly in recent decades the land use type around lakes has changed from natural vegetation to construction and agricultural land and the area of urban impervious surfaces has increased a total of 29 representative shallow lakes were used for this study fig 1 nan lake nl lianhua

discussion 4 1 driving factors of phytoplankton community composition and biomass phytoplankton is a primary producer in aquatic ecosystem and its community structure is affected by many environmental factors in the lakes in the present study the dominant phylum was generally stable in each season the phytoplankton community was mainly composed of cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cryptophyta these phylum were also common in subtropical and eutrophic lakes alex and linda 2008 lv et al 2011 we quantified the importance of the driving factors that affect the composition of phytoplankton communities in shallow subtropical lakes our results showed that the water quality physicochemical parameters of the lake had the highest explanation rate for the phytoplankton community composition which verified our hypothesis that phytoplankton was mainly affected by water physicochemical factors this was consistent with the results of özkan et al 2013 and liao et al 2016 in 29 lakes cyanophyta were all dominant except in winter and tn was an important factor influencing the abundance of phytoplankton communities in winter the advantages of cyanobacteria were significantly reduced chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were the primary contributors to the total biomass nitrogen and phosphorus were no longer important factors affecting phytoplankton biomass temperature had an important influence on the phytoplankton biomass and community composition in different seasons below a certain nutrient level the increase in temperature promotes the metabolic rate and cell division of phytoplankton and increases productivity cha et al 2017 kim et al 2019 the residual plots of the gam smoothing function showed that chl a and cell density increased as the wt increased up to approximately 20 c and stabilized thereafter this indicated that there was an optimal for phytoplankton growth kim et al 2019 different types of phytoplankton have different responses to temperature for example compared with other species temperature increase is more conducive to cyanobacteria growth and increases their competitive advantage nalewajko and murphy 2001 xu et al 2010 this may be the reason for cyanobacteria dominance in spring and summer in the present study in addition do was significantly positively correlated with chl a and cell density which may have been due to phytoplankton absorbing co2 and release o2 leading to an increase in do cui et al 2021 in this study the explanation rate of land use to the composition of phytoplankton communities was higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring this may be related to the climatic and rainfall characteristics of the study region summer is the rainy season in wuhan during which heavy rainfall occurs and large amounts of nutrients enter the surface runoff thereby promoting phytoplankton growth due to the hysteresis effect and the continuous increase in temperature fraterrigo and downing 2008 the impact of surface runoff on phytoplankton may reach its maximum in autumn in summer the rda results found that there was a positive correlation between construction land and cyanobacteria with the highest biomass doubek et al 2015 found that built land increased the advantage of cyanobacteria by increasing the nutrient concentration in lakes in addition when surface runoff enters a lake from impervious ground built land may also increase the wt of the runoff which also provides an increased advantages of cyanobacteria fraterrigo and downing 2008 the explanation rate of lake morphology for the phytoplankton community composition was low this was contrary to a study by cardoso et al 2017 which investigated lakes in floodplain areas in brazil and found that lake area and water depth were important factors affecting phytoplankton abundance unlike lakes in floodplains which areas of lakes vary greatly due to rainfall most of the lakes in our study were located in the city center or city suburbs which lack riparian zones therefore there was only minimal variation in the area of lakes between different seasons in addition the lakes in our study were all shallow lakes with mean water depths of 3 5 m and little changed in the water depth occurs between seasons therefore the lake morphology has little impact on phytoplankton in our study in different seasons lake morphology explained 11 5 of the phytoplankton community composition in autumn and lower phytoplankton biomasses were found in larger lakes e g lzl zjdl and wl this may be related to the heterogeneous habitat and higher environmental capacity which increase diversity and biomass of zooplankton and fish cardoso et al 2017 thereby controlling the phytoplankton biomass via predation rocha et al 2020 our unpublished data also showed that the zooplankton biomass was highest in autumn chl a and cell density were comprehensive reflection indices of dynamic changes in physical and chemical properties of water quality the chl a and cell density of phytoplankton in lakes were the lowest in winter this was due to the higher water temperature and more rainfall and more pollutants entered the lake along with surface runoff in spring summer and autumn than in winter fig 6 fig 7 which was conducive to phytoplankton growth gam results showed that the water quality physicochemical parameters among the three groups of variables had the greatest impact on phytoplankton chl a and cell density interestingly tn had a stronger effect on chl a and cell density than tp which may be because the tp content was high in the four seasons in the studied lakes and n p ratio was low in addition the delayed response of phytoplankton to the change in tp may also have led to the weak correlation filstrup and downing 2017 our results showed that due to the high phosphorus content in the studied lakes resulting in a low n p ratio phytoplankton growth was in a state of nitrogen limitation maberly et al 2020 nitrogen limitation would promote the growth of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria make cyanobacteria being more competitive than other phytoplankton osburn 2021 carey et al 2012 therefore reducing the phosphorus content in this region is important for controlling the biomass of cyanobacteria biomass 4 2 coupling effects of environmental variables on phytoplankton land use is also considered to be the most important driving factor for phytoplankton community composition katsiapi et al 2012 liao et al 2016 land use types may affect the lake morphology water quality physicochemical parameters for example farmland and built up land types were shown to be the main sources of nutrient inputs to freshwater lakes katsiapi et al 2012 in the present study land use types made a great contribution to the composition of phytoplankton community this effect was more obvious in summer and autumn and was beneficial to phytoplankton growth in our case study low phytoplankton biomass and high biodiversity were observed in zjdl and lzl these lakes were characterized by the land use in the buffer zone being mainly farmland it has a large area and is considered to be a typical suburban lake with low human disturbance gam results showed when land use and lake morphology were used as independent explanatory variables their explanatory rate for phytoplankton chl a and cell density were significantly reduced this may be because land use indirectly affects the phytoplankton biomass through the coupling of water quality physicochemical parameters this was confirmed by sem results fig 6 which showed that the direct impact of land use on phytoplankton was not significant and that it mainly affected phytoplankton growth indirectly by increasing nutrients and reducing transparency of the water body land use in lake basins had a significant positive impact on nutrients and there was a positive correlation between built up land and nutrients this is because impervious ground lacking natural vegetation could not absorb pollutants in the rainstorm period and a large number of pollutants would run into the lakes which causes non point source pollution wei et al 2020 agricultural runoff is usually an important source of high nutrient content kim et al 2019 however in this study there was a negative correlation between farmland area and nutrient parameters the reason may be that the farmland around the lakes in wuhan was dominated by paddy fields on the one hand paddy fields as vegetation or wetland systems have certain adsorption absorption and retention effects on pollutants yang et al 2017 on the other hand paddy fields contribute less to the generation and discharge of pollutants than built up land and dry land and the negative impact on water quality is relatively weak song et al 2020 evidently land use can change the phytoplankton communities by increasing or reducing nutrients and this relationship ultimately depends on the land use type our study showed that forest and grassland had positive effects on water quality moreoever forest and grassland serve as nutrient accumulation areas which can control and reduce the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus carried in surface runoff shi et al 2017 deng 2020 among the commonly considered lake morphology factors lake depth and area are sensitive predictors of eutrophication and can reflect the ability of a lake to dilute the nutrient load liu et al 2010 2012 the results of the gam model showed that the lake morphology had a minimal direct impact on the phytoplankton biomass in our study and that its significance was reduced when the lake morphology was used as an independent variable to explain the change in cell density the lake morphology may indirectly affect phytoplankton biomass through coupling with water quality physicochemical parameters as the land use which was also confirmed by the sem model the lake morphology mainly affected phytoplankton growth by reducing nitrogen and phosphorus in the water body and increasing water transparency liu et al 2010 compared with the lake depth lake area had a greater impact on phytoplankton in the present study the coupled effects of land use lake area and water quality physicochemical parameters on biomass of phytoplankton is summarized in the schematic diagram in fig 8 wt tn and tp were the main factors influencing the phytoplankton biomass the built up land indirectly increased the phytoplankton biomass by increasing tp and tn in the water bodies reducing water transparency forests and grasslands could reduce nitrogen and phosphorus entering the water bodies and improve water transparency thereby contributing to reducing the phytoplankton biomass the lake area could significantly reduce tn and tp improve water transparency and indirectly reduce the phytoplankton biomass 4 3 implications and limitations our results showed that tn and tp were the main factors that directly influenced the phytoplankton biomass built up land was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in lakes and the forest and grassland were negatively correlated with the nutrient factor of the lakes table 2 forest and grass land have lower runoff coefficient than construction land or agricultural land shi et al 2017 additionally forest and grass land can absorb and fix pollutants in runoff thus reducing non point source pollution in the basin these land use types have positive impacts on lake water quality wei et al 2020 watershed land use is one of the important human made driving forces that affect water quality physicochemical parameters changes in watersheds our study also focused on the impact of land use on water quality in three buffer scales i e 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m in the watershed and the results showed that land use in the 1000 m buffer zone had the greatest impact on water quality physicochemical parameters tab s4 therefore we suggest that in the process of urban development in wuhan city land use in the 1000 m of lake riparian zone should be rationally planned to reduce the proportion of built up land and increase the grassland and forest the hardened slope protection of the lake buffer zone can be modified to provide a natural ecological buffer zone to reduce pollutants entering the lake our research results indicated that the lake area could significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in lakes improve water transparency table 2 fig 7 and reduce the phytoplankton chl a content fig s5 which plays an important role in controlling lake eutrophication deng 2020 however the sem model showed that the lake areas decreased as the proportion of built up land increased this indicated that the rapid expansion of built up land area was the main factor influencing the reduction of lake area this is consistent with the study by xie et al 2017 which found that built up land accounted for 67 9 of the lake area reduction in china in the past 25 y therefore during the urban development process it is necessary to avoid reducing the area of lakes to protect the lake water quality and reduce the phytoplankton biomass this study selected representative lakes from wuhan as research object and systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial effects of water quality physicochemical parameters land use and lake morphology on phytoplankton however there were some limitations which should be considered in future studies our research focused on seasonal changes in the phytoplankton biomass during one year therefore future research should focus on larger time scales additionally landscape configuration such as patch density edge density and patch area index has an impact on water quality wu and lu 2021 gu et al 2019 it is necessary to further clarify the coupling effect of landscape composition land use type and landscape configuration on the phytoplankton community and biomass in addition climatic factors i e rainfall and wind speed also affect phytoplankton biomass and precipitation in different seasons and surface runoff generated by different land uses will affect the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in lakes which should be considered in future research 5 conclusion our study demonstrated that chl a and cell density of phytoplankton varied seasonally and were higher in spring and summer than in winter and autumn the three groups of variables water quality physicochemical parameters land use and lake morphology could explain most of the changes in phytoplankton community compositions in different seasons water quality physicochemical parameters had the greatest influence on the phytoplankton community compositions followed by land use gam result showed that the chl a and cell density of phytoplankton explained by the water quality physicochemical parameters were the highest followed by land use land use and lake morphology indirectly affected the phytoplankton biomass mainly through the coupling of water quality physicochemical parameters among land use patterns built up land was the main factor that caused increases in tn and tp in lakes whereas forest and grassland were effective in reducing pollutants entering the lakes to reduce the phytoplankton biomass lake managers should increase the areas of forest and grassland in lake riparian buffer zones to reduce the pollution entering the lakes in runoff in addition the lake area had a positive impact on water quality and the proportion of built up land was negatively correlated with lake area therefore in the process of urban development it is necessary to avoid construction encroaching on the lake area for controlling lake tn and tp and reducing phytoplankton biomass declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16917,the community composition and biomass of phytoplankton in shallow lakes are impacted by many environmental factors including water quality physicochemical parameters land use in the watershed and lake morphology however few studies have simultaneously evaluated the relative importance of these factors on the effect of community composition and biomass of phytoplankton the relative importance of the water quality physicochemical parameters water temperature wt total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec turbidity and secchi depth sd land use built up land farmland waters forest grassland and unused land in the watershed and lake morphology area and depth on the composition and biomass of phytoplankton communities were assessed in 29 subtropical shallow lakes in wuhan china during different seasons from december 2017 to november 2018 the results showed that phytoplankton in all 29 lakes was mainly composed of cyanophyta chlorophyta and bacillariophyta phytoplankton abundance was highest in summer and lowest in winter we analyzed the relative importance of the three groups of variables to the community composition of the phytoplankton by variance decomposition the results showed that the three groups of environmental variables had the highest explanation rate 80 for the composition of the phytoplankton community in summer and autumn and the explanation rates in spring and winter were 42 1 and 39 8 respectively the water quality physicochemical parameters were the most important variables affecting the composition of phytoplankton communities followed by land use in the watershed through generalized additive model and structural equation model analysis we found that the land use and lake morphology had minimal direct impact on the chl a and cell density of phytoplankton mainly by altering the tn tp turbidity sd do and ec which indirectly affected phytoplankton wt and nutrients were still the main predictors of phytoplankton abundance built up land was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes correlation analysis found that forest and grassland had positive impacts on reducing lake nitrogen and phosphorus contents this showed that increasing grassland and forest in the watershed could reduce the pollutants entering the lake our findings will contribute to water quality management and pollution control for subtropical shallow lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords land use lake morphology phytoplankton structural equation model subtropical shallow lakes 1 introduction with increasing combined effects of urbanization development and human activity many freshwater bodies suffer from aquatic ecological degradation and eutrophication znachor et al 2020 phytoplankton is an important primary producer in lake ecosystems and changes in its composition and biomass will directly affect the structure function and stability of aquatic ecosystems padisák 2006 over propagation of phytoplankton can lead to degradation of aquatic ecosystems and decreased biodiversity znachor et al 2020 therefore understanding the impact of environmental drivers on phytoplankton communities is critical to assessing the impact of human activities on lake ecosystems paerl and paul 2012 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 the biomass and community structure of phytoplankton are affected by many environmental factors many scholars have studied the effects of water quality physicochemical parameters such as nutrients ph wt and transparency on phytoplankton on a local scale navas parejo et al 2020 muhid et al 2013 shan et al 2019 in addition land use changes in a watershed caused by human activities and resulting decreases in water quality are considered to be an important driving force affecting phytoplankton growth the extent of this effect depends largely on the regional climate in the mediterranean region greece the phytoplankton species compositions in freshwater lakes are highly correlated with land use katsiapi et al 2012 in argentina which experiences a temperate climate land use has a greater impact on phytoplankton than the physicochemical parameters of lakes sánchez et al 2021 agricultural land in the yunnan guizhou plateau of china has a significant impact on cyanobacteria in lakes cao et al 2017 however in a temperate maritime climate region denmark land use did not greatly contribute to changes in lake phytoplankton abundance özkan et al 2013 additionally it was found that the explanation rate of land use for phytoplankton changes was low in 25 shallow reservoirs in brazil rocha et al 2020 few previous studies have investigated the effect of watershed land use on phytoplankton biomass and species composition in subtropical regions in addition the lake area and depth are important parameters of lake morphology and influence species diversity by impacting habitat cardoso et al 2017 the lake depth affects light availability and result in vertical heterogeneity in lakes which affects phytoplankton biomass and community structure cardoso et al 2017 the diversity of phytoplankton zooplankton fish and other species in lakes are positively related to the lake area kalff 2002 in the mediterranean region lake morphology had a strong influence on bacillariophyta cyanophyta and euglenophyta richness özkan et al 2013 although the effects of basin land use lake morphology and water quality physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton have been extensively studied their coupling effects and relative importance to phytoplankton biomass and community composition has received limited attention especially in lakes in subtropical regions since the predictors of phytoplankton community biomass in shallow lakes may be interrelated it is difficult to determine the key factors for example the concentration of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes may be affected by land use in the watershed liberoff et al 2019 pratt and chang 2012 cao et al 2017 studies have shown that farmland and built up land are the main sources of nutrient and pollutants in lakes and reservoirs and that water quality is decreased when these nutrient pollutants exceed a certain threshold liberoff et al 2019 pratt and chang 2012 forest and grasslands provide higher absorption of pollutants and play an important role in improving water quality mello et al 2018 on the other hand lake morphology is considered to reflect the buffering capacity of nutrient input deng 2020 at present the key issue is usually that only one single type of factor is considered regarding the influence on the biomass and community composition of phytoplankton which cannot effectively describe the complex relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors therefore when evaluating the comprehensive effects of multiple factors on phytoplankton community composition and biomass the coupling effect between variables should be considered to explore the driving effects of land use lake morphology and water quality physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton biomass total cell density and chl a and community composition change characteristic in subtropical shallow lakes samples were collected from 29 subtropical shallow lakes in wuhan city china and analyzed we assumed that phytoplankton biomass and community composition were primarily affected by water quality physicochemical parameters land use and lake morphology affected phytoplankton growth by coupling with the water quality physicochemical parameters this study aimed to 1 study the characteristics of phytoplankton community and biomass in 29 lakes in different seasons 2 explore the relative importance of water quality parameters land use and lake morphology as driving factors for phytoplankton community abundance and biomass and 3 assess the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on phytoplankton biomass this study is important for understanding the impact of environmental changes on phytoplankton and providing a scientific basis for water quality assessment and pollution control in subtropical shallow lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the investigated lakes are located in wuhan hubei province china the region has a subtropical monsoon humid climate with abundant

studies have shown that with the development of urbanization the water area of lakes in wuhan has decreased significantly in recent decades the land use type around lakes has changed from natural vegetation to construction and agricultural land and the area of urban impervious surfaces has increased a total of 29 representative shallow lakes were used for this study fig 1 nan lake nl lianhua

of the variation in the cell density interestingly when land use was used as a separate explanatory variable the effects of land use factors on cell density were reduced among the land use variables built up land had the most significant effect on cell density p 0 01 lake morphology variables explained 23 of the variation in cell density direct and indirect effects of land use lake morphology and water quality physicochemical parameters on chl a and cell density of phytoplankton were determined by sem fig 7 χ2 46 389 df 29 p 0 021 gfi 0 991 rmsea 0 028 the model showed that the direct effect

discussion 4 1 driving factors of phytoplankton community composition and biomass phytoplankton is a primary producer in aquatic ecosystem and its community structure is affected by many environmental factors in the lakes in the present study the dominant phylum was generally stable in each season the phytoplankton community was mainly composed of cyanophyta chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cryptophyta these phylum were also common in subtropical and eutrophic lakes alex and linda 2008 lv et al 2011 we quantified the importance of the driving factors that affect the composition of phytoplankton communities in shallow subtropical lakes our results showed that the water quality physicochemical parameters of the lake had the highest explanation rate for the phytoplankton community composition which verified our hypothesis that phytoplankton was mainly affected by water physicochemical factors this was consistent with the results of özkan et al 2013 and liao et al 2016 in 29 lakes cyanophyta were all dominant except in winter and tn was an important factor influencing the abundance of phytoplankton communities in winter the advantages of cyanobacteria were significantly reduced chlorophyta and bacillariophyta were the primary contributors to the total biomass nitrogen and phosphorus were no longer important factors affecting phytoplankton biomass temperature had an important influence on the phytoplankton biomass and community composition in different seasons below a certain nutrient level the increase in temperature promotes the metabolic rate and cell division of phytoplankton and increases productivity cha et al 2017 kim et al 2019 the residual plots of the gam smoothing function showed that chl a and cell density increased as the wt increased up to approximately 20 c and stabilized thereafter this indicated that there was an optimal for phytoplankton growth kim et al 2019 different types of phytoplankton have different responses to temperature for example compared with other species temperature increase is more conducive to cyanobacteria growth and increases their competitive advantage nalewajko and murphy 2001 xu et al 2010 this may be the reason for cyanobacteria dominance in spring and summer in the present study in addition do was significantly positively correlated with chl a and cell density which may have been due to phytoplankton absorbing co2 and release o2 leading to an increase in do cui et al 2021 in this study the explanation rate of land use to the composition of phytoplankton communities was higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring this may be related to the climatic and rainfall characteristics of the study region summer is the rainy season in wuhan during which heavy rainfall occurs and large amounts of nutrients enter the surface runoff thereby promoting phytoplankton growth due to the hysteresis effect and the continuous increase in temperature fraterrigo and downing 2008 the impact of surface runoff on phytoplankton may reach its maximum in autumn in summer the rda results found that there was a positive correlation between construction land and cyanobacteria with the highest biomass doubek et al 2015 found that built land increased the advantage of cyanobacteria by increasing the nutrient concentration in lakes in addition when surface runoff enters a lake from impervious ground built land may also increase the wt of the runoff which also provides an increased advantages of cyanobacteria fraterrigo and downing 2008 the explanation rate of lake morphology for the phytoplankton community composition was low this was contrary to a study by cardoso et al 2017 which investigated lakes in floodplain areas in brazil and found that lake area and water depth were important factors affecting phytoplankton abundance unlike lakes in floodplains which areas of lakes vary greatly due to rainfall most of the lakes in our study were located in the city center or city suburbs which lack riparian zones therefore there was only minimal variation in the area of lakes between different seasons in addition the lakes in our study were all shallow lakes with mean water depths of 3 5 m and little changed in the water depth occurs between seasons therefore the lake morphology has little impact on phytoplankton in our study in different seasons lake morphology explained 11 5 of the phytoplankton community composition in autumn and lower phytoplankton biomasses were found in larger lakes e g lzl zjdl and wl this may be related to the heterogeneous habitat and higher environmental capacity which increase diversity and biomass of zooplankton and fish cardoso et al 2017 thereby controlling the phytoplankton biomass via predation rocha et al 2020 our unpublished data also showed that the zooplankton biomass was highest in autumn chl a and cell density were comprehensive reflection indices of dynamic changes in physical and chemical properties of water quality the chl a and cell density of phytoplankton in lakes were the lowest in winter this was due to the higher water temperature and more rainfall and more pollutants entered the lake along with surface runoff in spring summer and autumn than in winter fig 6 fig 7 which was conducive to phytoplankton growth gam results showed that the water quality physicochemical parameters among the three groups of variables had the greatest impact on phytoplankton chl a and cell density interestingly tn had a stronger effect on chl a and cell density than tp which may be because the tp content was high in the four seasons in the studied lakes and n p ratio was low in addition the delayed response of phytoplankton to the change in tp may also have led to the weak correlation filstrup and downing 2017 our results showed that due to the high phosphorus content in the studied lakes resulting in a low n p ratio phytoplankton growth was in a state of nitrogen limitation maberly et al 2020 nitrogen limitation would promote the growth of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria make cyanobacteria being more competitive than other phytoplankton osburn 2021 carey et al 2012 therefore reducing the phosphorus content in this region is important for controlling the biomass of cyanobacteria biomass 4 2 coupling effects of environmental variables on phytoplankton land use is also considered to be the most important driving factor for phytoplankton community composition katsiapi et al 2012 liao et al 2016 land use types may affect the lake morphology water quality physicochemical parameters for example farmland and built up land types were shown to be the main sources of nutrient inputs to freshwater lakes katsiapi et al 2012 in the present study land use types made a great contribution to the composition of phytoplankton community this effect was more obvious in summer and autumn and was beneficial to phytoplankton growth in our case study low phytoplankton biomass and high biodiversity were observed in zjdl and lzl these lakes were characterized by the land use in the buffer zone being mainly farmland it has a large area and is considered to be a typical suburban lake with low human disturbance gam results showed when land use and lake morphology were used as independent explanatory variables their explanatory rate for phytoplankton chl a and cell density were significantly reduced this may be because land use indirectly affects the phytoplankton biomass through the coupling of water quality physicochemical parameters this was confirmed by sem results fig 6 which showed that the direct impact of land use on phytoplankton was not significant and that it mainly affected phytoplankton growth indirectly by increasing nutrients and reducing transparency of the water body land use in lake basins had a significant positive impact on nutrients and there was a positive correlation between built up land and nutrients this is because impervious ground lacking natural vegetation could not absorb pollutants in the rainstorm period and a large number of pollutants would run into the lakes which causes non point source pollution wei et al 2020 agricultural runoff is usually an important source of high nutrient content kim et al 2019 however in this study there was a negative correlation between farmland area and nutrient parameters the reason may be that the farmland around the lakes in wuhan was dominated by paddy fields on the one hand paddy fields as vegetation or wetland systems have certain adsorption absorption and retention effects on pollutants yang et al 2017 on the other hand paddy fields contribute less to the generation and discharge of pollutants than built up land and dry land and the negative impact on water quality is relatively weak song et al 2020 evidently land use can change the phytoplankton communities by increasing or reducing nutrients and this relationship ultimately depends on the land use type our study showed that forest and grassland had positive effects on water quality moreoever forest and grassland serve as nutrient accumulation areas which can control and reduce the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus carried in surface runoff shi et al 2017 deng 2020 among the commonly considered lake morphology factors lake depth and area are sensitive predictors of eutrophication and can reflect the ability of a lake to dilute the nutrient load liu et al 2010 2012 the results of the gam model showed that the lake morphology had a minimal direct impact on the phytoplankton biomass in our study and that its significance was reduced when the lake morphology was used as an independent variable to explain the change in cell density the lake morphology may indirectly affect phytoplankton biomass through coupling with water quality physicochemical parameters as the land use which was also confirmed by the sem model the lake morphology mainly affected phytoplankton growth by reducing nitrogen and phosphorus in the water body and increasing water transparency liu et al 2010 compared with the lake depth lake area had a greater impact on phytoplankton in the present study the coupled effects of land use lake area and water quality physicochemical parameters on biomass of phytoplankton is summarized in the schematic diagram in fig 8 wt tn and tp were the main factors influencing the phytoplankton biomass the built up land indirectly increased the phytoplankton biomass by increasing tp and tn in the water bodies reducing water transparency forests and grasslands could reduce nitrogen and phosphorus entering the water bodies and improve water transparency thereby contributing to reducing the phytoplankton biomass the lake area could significantly reduce tn and tp improve water transparency and indirectly reduce the phytoplankton biomass 4 3 implications and limitations our results showed that tn and tp were the main factors that directly influenced the phytoplankton biomass built up land was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in lakes and the forest and grassland were negatively correlated with the nutrient factor of the lakes table 2 forest and grass land have lower runoff coefficient than construction land or agricultural land shi et al 2017 additionally forest and grass land can absorb and fix pollutants in runoff thus reducing non point source pollution in the basin these land use types have positive impacts on lake water quality wei et al 2020 watershed land use is one of the important human made driving forces that affect water quality physicochemical parameters changes in watersheds our study also focused on the impact of land use on water quality in three buffer scales i e 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m in the watershed and the results showed that land use in the 1000 m buffer zone had the greatest impact on water quality physicochemical parameters tab s4 therefore we suggest that in the process of urban development in wuhan city land use in the 1000 m of lake riparian zone should be rationally planned to reduce the proportion of built up land and increase the grassland and forest the hardened slope protection of the lake buffer zone can be modified to provide a natural ecological buffer zone to reduce pollutants entering the lake our research results indicated that the lake area could significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants in lakes improve water transparency table 2 fig 7 and reduce the phytoplankton chl a content fig s5 which plays an important role in controlling lake eutrophication deng 2020 however the sem model showed that the lake areas decreased as the proportion of built up land increased this indicated that the rapid expansion of built up land area was the main factor influencing the reduction of lake area this is consistent with the study by xie et al 2017 which found that built up land accounted for 67 9 of the lake area reduction in china in the past 25 y therefore during the urban development process it is necessary to avoid reducing the area of lakes to protect the lake water quality and reduce the phytoplankton biomass this study selected representative lakes from wuhan as research object and systematically analyzed the temporal and spatial effects of water quality physicochemical parameters land use and lake morphology on phytoplankton however there were some limitations which should be considered in future studies our research focused on seasonal changes in the phytoplankton biomass during one year therefore future research should focus on larger time scales additionally landscape configuration such as patch density edge density and patch area index has an impact on water quality wu and lu 2021 gu et al 2019 it is necessary to further clarify the coupling effect of landscape composition land use type and landscape configuration on the phytoplankton community and biomass in addition climatic factors i e rainfall and wind speed also affect phytoplankton biomass and precipitation in different seasons and surface runoff generated by different land uses will affect the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in lakes which should be considered in future research 5 conclusion our study demonstrated that chl a and cell density of phytoplankton varied seasonally and were higher in spring and summer than in winter and autumn the three groups of variables water quality physicochemical parameters land use and lake morphology could explain most of the changes in phytoplankton community compositions in different seasons water quality physicochemical parameters had the greatest influence on the phytoplankton community compositions followed by land use gam result showed that the chl a and cell density of phytoplankton explained by the water quality physicochemical parameters were the highest followed by land use land use and lake morphology indirectly affected the phytoplankton biomass mainly through the coupling of water quality physicochemical parameters among land use patterns built up land was the main factor that caused increases in tn and tp in lakes whereas forest and grassland were effective in reducing pollutants entering the lakes to reduce the phytoplankton biomass lake managers should increase the areas of forest and grassland in lake riparian buffer zones to reduce the pollution entering the lakes in runoff in addition the lake area had a positive impact on water quality and the proportion of built up land was negatively correlated with lake area therefore in the process of urban development it is necessary to avoid construction encroaching on the lake area for controlling lake tn and tp and reducing phytoplankton biomass declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16918,stable suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is still a major challenge for the implementation of partial nitritation and anammox pn a in mainstream treatment despite numerous suppression strategies demonstrated it is increasingly recognized that nob could develop resistance to these strategies threatening the long term stability of the mainstream pn a process this study aims to understand adaption mechanisms and develop counter strategies to overcome the adaptation to this end three previously demonstrated suppression strategies including nob inactivation via side stream sludge treatment with free ammonia fa the use of low dissolved oxygen do and the use of anammox to scavenge nitrite were stepwise applied over a period of 800 days to a laboratory scale reactor treating effluent from a high rate activated sludge hras plant fa sludge treatment alone sustained nitrite accumulation for about two months after which nob adaptation occurred causing pn to fail the fa adaptation was induced by a shift in the nob community from nitrospira to ca nitrotoga the latter was found to have higher resistance to fa and also a higher maximum specific growth rate low do at 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 was then applied in conjunction with fa treatment which successfully eliminated ca nitrotoga and re established pn however new and unidentified nob with a higher apparent oxygen affinity emerged in three months again leading to pn failure lastly as the third strategy for nob suppression anammox was introduced as an in situ nitrite scavenger the combo strategy delivered reliable nob suppression with no further adaptation in the remaining experimental period eight months the resulted one stage pn a reactor achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 2 5 37 a control reactor operated in parallel under the same conditions but without fa treatment only achieved 10 4 4 6 nitrogen removal with anammox completely outcompeted by nob in the last phase key words partial nitritation anammox nob adaptation free ammonia treatment low do mainstream anammox nitrite sink 1 introduction partial nitritation nh4 no2 and anammox nh4 no2 n2 no3 abbreviated as pn a is a carbon and energy efficient nitrogen removal process jetten et al 1997 the implementation of pn a in municipal wastewater i e mainstream treatment is gaining increasing interests in the recent decade driven by the needs of diverting organic carbon in mainstream for bio energy recovery kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however scarcely has mainstream pn a been achieved to date agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 one of the biggest challenges is the difficulty associated with suppressing nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob while maintaining ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob at the same time laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 as illustrated in equation 1 nob suppression requires the net growth rate of nob i e μnob bnob 1 srt to be 0 or lower this goal can be achieved through 1 decreasing the growth rate μnob 2 increasing the decay rate bnob or 3 reducing srt sludge retention time μnob can be reduced by restricting oxygen availability through the use of e g low dissolved oxygen do or intermittent aeration blackburne et al 2008 ge et al 2014 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 yang et al 2007 or by limiting nitrite availability through introducing nitrite scavengers e g heterotrophic denitrifiers or anammox laureni et al 2019 regmi et al 2014 bnob could be enhanced via applying biocidal agents such as free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 or energy intensive treatment zheng et al 2019 which have been shown to inactivate nob while maintaining aob activity lastly a higher sludge wastage rate could be applied to deliver a shorter srt van dongen et al 2001 yuan and oleszkiewicz 2011 however this strategy reduces the amounts of aob and other organisms in the system thus lowering the overall system efficiency 1 d x nob x nob d t μ n o b b n o b 1 s r t despite the proven effectiveness in many studies these nob suppression strategies have also been frequently demonstrated to lose their efficacy when applied over an extended period of time because of nob adaptation for example nob adaptation to low do was frequently reported in both bench and full scale studies cao et al 2018 liu et al 2013 which was found to be caused by community shift from nitrobacter to nitrospira the latter are widely known to have a higher affinity to oxygen in comparison to nitrobacter nob adaptation has also been observed with the b enhancing strategies such as the fa and fna based sludge treatment duan et al 2019a ma et al 2017 revealed nob adaptation to fna treatment at 0 75 mg hno2 n l 1 over 85 days in a laboratory scale nitrifying reactor via a shift from nitrospira to ca nitrotoga similarly the fa tolerance of an nob community strengthened over long term exposure to fa of up to 50 mg nh3 n l 1 li et al 2020 while it was apparent that the newly emerging nob populations were able to cope with the suppression factors applied the changes in the kinetic properties of the sludge before and after the adaptation were rarely studied which hindered the development of more effective counter strategies this study aims to systematically investigate nob adaptation in the mainstream treatment to unravel the mechanisms underpinning the adaptation to different suppression factors and to develop counterstrategies accordingly to this end three promising nob suppression strategies namely the decay enhancing fa based sludge treatment strategy the oxygen limiting low do strategy and the nitrite scavenging via anammox strategy were stepwise applied with a new strategy introduced on top of the proceeding one s when adaptation was observed the composition and kinetic properties μ n o b b n o b oxygen affinity of nob populations were experimentally investigated before and after each adaptation the experiments were undertaken on two lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs receiving real mainstream wastewater effluent from a pilot scale high rate activated sludge hras plant each operated for 800 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater composition the effluent of a pilot scale hras plant brisbane australia was collected once per week and stored at 4 c prior to use in the laboratory reactor studies see 2 2 the pilot scale hras plant was operated at a full scale wastewater treatment plant to channel the organic carbon in mainstream wastewater for bioenergy recovery the hras plant was stably operated for three years displaying 62 5 10 9 of total chemical oxygen demand tcod removal and negligible ammonium removal the hras effluent contained tcod at 335 64 mg l 1 soluble cod scod at 165 36 mg l 1 and ammonium at 44 7 4 5 mg nh4 n l 1 the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor ad liquor used for fa based sludge treatment see 2 2 was collected from a full scale anaerobic sludge digester preceded with a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment unit brisbane australia the ad supernatant contained ammonium at 2440 6 123 1 mg nh4 n l 1 with ph at 7 6 0 1 see table s1 for more details of its composition it was also collected weekly and stored at 4 c prior to use 2 2 reactor set up operation and monitoring two lab scale sbrs each with a working volume of 4 l were established in a temperature controlled room at 22 1 c one served as the experimental reactor and the other as a control the sbrs were initially seeded with the full scale activated sludge from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp brisbane australia the sbrs were operated with 6 hour cycles each cycle comprised the anoxic feeding 5 min anoxic reaction 85 min aerobic reaction 215 min sludge settling 50 min and decanting 5 min periods throughout the feeding anoxic reaction and aerobic reaction periods the sbrs were mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm during the 5 min feeding period 1 l hras effluent was fed into the sbr do in the aerobic reaction period was monitored with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland and controlled at 1 5 2 0 mg o2 l 1 unless otherwise specified with a programmable logic controller plc via on off control of the air flow the flow rate was 1 l min 1 when it was turned on in the last 5 minutes of the aerobic reaction period called the sludge wastage period 66 ml mixed liquor was discharged giving rise to an average srt of 15 days lastly 1 l supernatant was decanted after the settling phase giving rise to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 day ph during the entire cycle was monitored with a ph probe tps australia and a transmitter tps australia but not controlled the reactors were operated for 800 days consisting of six phases 1 phase ⅰ day 0 200 the two sbrs were operated as described above until stable and comparable performance was observed indicated by the stable mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations and the constant effluent quality phase ⅰ served as the baseline period 2 phase ii day 201 300 the two sbrs were operated as in phase i with the following two amendments to the experimental sbr a fa based sludge treatment was implemented in the experimental reactor in order to achieve nob suppression in the sludge wastage period in each cycle 250 ml mixed liquor was removed from the reactor in addition to the normal sludge wastage of 66 ml per cycle the 1000 ml sludge removed in one day i e over four cycles was thickened to 25 ml transferred to a sludge treatment unit where the thickened sludge was mixed with 25 ml ad liquor with a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 24 hours the nitrogen load introduced via the ad liquor was approximately 25 of the mainstream nitrogen load resembling the additional nitrogen loading to a full scale plant with the return of ad liquor fux et al 2006 during the 24 hour sludge treatment period ph was controlled at 8 9 0 1 via dosing 0 1m naoh using a ph controller connected to the plc the total ammonium concentration in the treatment tank was measured as 1250 0 120 0 mg n l 1 based on which the fa concentration was calculated to be 354 58 mg nh3 n l 1 anthonisen et al 1976 the treated sludge was returned to the sbr in feeding periods over the next four cycles b to obtain an ammonium to nitrite molar ratio of roughly 1 1 suitable for feeding an anammox reactor ph based aeration control was implemented superseding the normal do based aeration control which switched off aeration when ph became lower than a pre selected set point the ph set point was selected such that approximately 50 of the influent ammonium was oxidized when the ph set point was reached 3 phase iii day 301 402 the two sbrs were operated as in phase ii the mechanisms of nob adaptation to fa treatment observed at the end of phase ii were investigated through incubation tests of the sludges from both sbrs as detailed in section 2 3 the incubation tests revealed the active aob and nob biomass concentrations in the reactors and also their maximum specific growth rates the apparent oxygen affinities of aob and nob ko aob ko nob in the experimental reactor were also measured through batch tests as illustrated in 2 4 4 phase iv day 403 501 the two sbrs were operated as in phase iii with however the lower upper limits of the do controller for the experimental reactor reduced from 1 5 2 0 to 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 the new do range was selected based on the ko aob ko nob values determined in phase iii in order to suppress nob using low do 5 phase v day 502 525 the two sbrs were operated as in phase iv the kinetic mechanism of nob adaptation to low do observed at the end of phase iv was investigated by measuring the apparent do affinities of aob and nob in the experimental sbr 6 phase vi day 526 800 each sbr was supplemented with 800 anammox containing k5 carriers anoxkaldnes ab sweden specific area of 800 m2 m 3 resulting in a filling ratio of 30 the anammox carriers originated from a pilot scale moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr treating ad liquor via pn a in a local wwtp brisbane australia the mbbr received ad liquor containing total ammonia at 855 0 75 1 mg n l 1 and delivered an effluent containing ammonium nitrite and nitrate at 101 2 27 5 8 3 6 7 and 63 8 36 9 mg n l 1 respectively the nitrogen removal rate was 0 7 kg n m 3 d 1 the anammox carriers were introduced to both sbrs to serve as nitrite scavengers and to achieve nitrogen removal both sbrs were thus turned into integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactors the fa based treatment in the experimental system was applied to the floccular sludge only i e not to the carriers to accommodate the anammox reaction the feeding anoxic and aerobic periods were integrated into one 300 min reaction period with intermittent aeration each aeration cycle was 15 min consisting of 5 min non aerated and 10 min aerated periods the influent along with the fa treated sludge for experimental system were fed to the reactor over all the non aerated periods during the aerated periods do was controlled at 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 as applied in phase v the two sbrs were otherwise operated as in phase v in all phases the influent and effluent nitrogen ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured three times per week the total inorganic nitrogen tin in the influent and effluent was calculated as the sum of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the nitrite accumulation ratio nar was calculated as the ratio between nitrite and the sum of nitrite and nitrate concentrations the mlss and mlvss concentrations the aob and nob activities both in situ and ex situ were assayed once a week as detailed in 2 5 in phase vi the ex situ anammox activities were also determined on a weekly basis biomass samples were collected from the mixed liquor and the carrier biofilm in phase vi during the steady state of each phase and stored in a freezer 80 c for microbial community profiling 2 6 2 3 incubation batch tests to estimate the maximum specific growth rate and active aob nob concentrations incubation batch tests were performed on sludges from both the experimental and control sbrs in phase iii to investigate the kinetic mechanisms of nob adaptation to fa based sludge treatment these tests were done on sludge samples both before and immediately after a 24 hour fa treatment the experimental data were then used to estimate the maximum specific growth rate d 1 and biomass concentration mg cod l 1 of aob and nob in the assayed sludge samples the incubation batch tests were performed in triplicates in 250 ml erlenmeyer cell culture flasks at 22 0 5 c in each test 1 ml of sludge was inoculated into 100 ml 0 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs solution incubation tests of aob and nob were performed separately for incubation of aob an nh4cl stock solution 50 g n l 1 1 ml was added at the beginning of the test to give a calculated ammonium concentration of 50 mg nh4 n l 1 similarly for the incubation of nob a nano2 stock solution 70 g n l 1 1 ml was added to result in a calculated nitrite concentration of 70 mg no2 n l 1 the flasks were constantly shaken at 150 rpm to ensure adequate mixing which also resulted in a non limiting do level above 5 mg o2 l 1 measured with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland through surface aeration ph was maintained in the range of 7 2 7 6 through supplementing excess calcium carbonate powder of 0 5 g per flask at the very beginning the incubation tests lasted until ammonium or nitrite were completely consumed typically over 5 7 days mixed liquor samples were taken every 12 hours for the measurement of the ammonium nitrite nitrate concentrations the maximum specific growth rates and biomass concentrations of aob and nob were estimated using a model based approach through minimizing the sum of squared errors between the measured and modelled nitrogen concentration profiles as detailed in wang et al 2020 aquasim 2 1d reichert 1998 was used for parameter estimation 2 4 determination of apparent oxygen affinity the apparent oxygen affinities of aob and nob ko aob and ko nob mg o2 l 1 in the experimental reactor sludge were determined in phase iii and v in each phase five batch tests were performed at five controlled do levels of 0 5 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 8 0 mg o2 l 1 respectively at the beginning of each test pre calculated amounts of nh4cl and nano2 stock solutions were added to achieve theoretical initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations of 50 mg nh4 n l 1 and 25 mg no2 n l 1 respectively ph in all tests was manually controlled at 7 5 through dosing 0 1m naoh and 0 1m hcl mixed liquor samples were taken at 15 min intervals for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the rates of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation were estimated through linear regression of the ammonium and nitrate profiles respectively the ammonium and nitrite oxidation rates measured at different do conditions were then used to estimate ko aob and ko nob respectively via non linear least squares regression of monod equation in graphpad prism v 8 00 san diego california 2 5 determination of aob nob and anammox activities 2 5 1 ex situ activity determination ex situ activity tests were conducted weekly to determine the maximum activities i e activity under unlimited substrate conditions of aob and nob in phase i v for both the experimental and control reactors in each test 200 ml mixed liquor was transferred to a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the initial ammonium and nitrite were elevated to 50 and 25 mg n l 1 respectively by dosing pre calculated amounts of nh4cl and nano2 stock solutions constant aeration was supplied to maintain the do above 5 mg o2 l 1 measured with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland ph was manually controlled at 7 5 0 1 by adding 0 1m naoh and 0 1m hcl each test lasted for 60 min during which mixed liquor samples were taken at 15 min intervals for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the aob and nob activities were determined as the volumetric ammonium oxidation and nitrate production rates via linear regression of ammonium and nitrate profiles respectively in phase vi the aob and nob activities of the suspended sludge were determined as described above the aob and nob activities of carrier biofilms were measured in a similar way with 40 carriers 5 of total carriers suspended in 200 ml effluent 5 working volume in each test the anammox activity of the suspended sludge and carrier biofilms was measured using a similar procedure but under anoxic conditions the anoxic condition was created by continuously flushing the head space of erlenmeyer flask with nitrogen gas the anammox activity was determined as the volumetric tin removal rate 2 5 2 in situ activity determination in situ activity tests were conducted weekly to measure the aob nob activities in both sbrs at in situ substrate conditions in phase i v the mixed liquor samples were taken at 30 min intervals in the aerobic reaction period for analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the in situ aob and nob activities were determined as the volumetric ammonium oxidation and nitrate production rates respectively which were obtained through linearly regressing the linear part of the corresponding profiles in phase vi an sbr cycle contains 20 aerated periods from which 10 aerated periods were randomly chosen in each chosen period mixed liquor samples were taken at 5 min intervals for analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the volumetric ammonium oxidation and nitrate production rates were obtained through linear regression of the corresponding profiles the in situ aob and nob rates were determined by averaging these rates in the ten periods 2 6 microbial analysis 16 s rrna gene sequencing was performed on biomass samples taken at the steady state of each phase the biomass on carriers was scratched into a 1 5 ml sterilized eppendorf tube before dna extraction dna extraction from both sludge and biofilm samples was performed using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals santa ana ca following the protocols quality of the extracted dna was checked with gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington

taken by syringes and immediately filtered through 0 45 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck u s for analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi the mlss mlvss cod concentrations were determined following the standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 nob suppression by and adaptation to fa based sludge treatment 3 1 1 effective nob suppression in phase i day 0 200 both the experimental and control reactors performed full nitrification with ammonium in influent converted to nitrate fig 1 a figure s1a the nar for both reactors was below 1 fig 1b figure s1b the in situ volumetric rates of nob overlapped with that of aob fig 1c and figure s1c suggesting in both reactors nitrite formed by aob was instantaneously converted to nitrate by nob for the experimental reactor sludge treatment with fa was commenced on day 200 initiating phase ii in the steady state of phase ii day 240 300 stable nitrite accumulation was established at 20 4 3 6 mg n l 1 while nitrate in effluent was consistently below 0 5 mg n l 1 fig 1a giving rise to an nar of 92 1 3 2 fig 1b the in situ nob activity was 0 20 0 05 mg n l 1 h 1 fig 1c only 3 of that in phase i both the effluent and in situ activity data suggest that nob were successfully suppressed for the control sbr nar remained below 1 in phase ii figure s1b and the in situ nob activity remained similar to that of aob the in situ aob activity in the experimental reactor in phase ii showed no significant difference from that in the baseline phase or that in the control reactor in phase ii p 0 05 indicating fa based sludge treatment did not jeopardize aob activity in addition the ammonium nitrite ratio in the effluent was maintained at approximately 1 1 according to the design through the use of ph based aeration control 3 1 2 nob adaptation to fa based sludge treatment the stable pn sustained for about two months in phase ii from day 301 nitrite accumulation started to collapse whereas the effluent nitrate gradually built up fig 1a leading to the nar plunging to 15 3 2 6 fig 1b the in situ nob activity in the reactor rebounded to 5 50 1 12 mg n l 1 h 1 fig 1c clearly nob adapted to the fa treatment in this period therefore day 301 402 was registered as phase iii during which the adaptation mechanisms were further investigated the maximum volumetric nitrite oxidation rate as a proxy for nob abundance was closely monitored throughout phase i iii fig 2 a the maximum capacity of nitrite oxidation decreased from 9 80 2 30 to 0 3 0 1 mg n l 1 h 1 from phase i to ii and re established at 5 60 1 20 mg n l 1 h 1 in phase iii correspondingly the 16s rrna gene sequencing performed on the day 180 phase i day 280 phase ii and day 390 phase iii revealed an obvious shift in the nob community fig 2b the nob community was initially dominated by nitrospira in the baseline phase day 180 with a relative abundance of 3 66 0 05 the relative abundance of nitrospira decreased to 0 10 0 02 in phase ii day 280 when stable nitrite accumulation was established by fa based sludge treatment indicating nitrospira was successfully suppressed by this strategy however in phase iii day 380 another nob genus ca nitrotoga emerged with a relative abundance at 2 13 0 06 these newly emerged ca nitrotoga are likely responsible for the collapse of nitrite accumulation in phase iii the emergence of ca nitrotoga also suggested they could cope with the pressure of daily fa based sludge treatment in the control sludge the maximum nitrite oxidation rate remained stable at 10 20 2 60 mg n l 1 h 1 throughout phase i iii with nitrospira consistently dominating the nob community figure s2 besides the maximum ammonium oxidation rates and aob communities are relatively constant with minor variations throughout phase i iii in both the experimental and control reactors table s2 in order to further understand how ca nitrotoga coped with fa based sludge treatment the growth kinetics of the nob populations maximum growth rate of nob μ m nob in both the experimental ca nitrotoga containing and control nitrospira containing sludges in phase iii were investigated using incubation tests besides the efficacy of fa treatment in inactivating fa adapted and unadapted nob was also examined by comparing the active nob concentrations x nob before and after fa treatment the μ m nob in the experimental sludge 0 71 0 04 d 1 was significantly higher than that in the control sludge 0 55 0 03 d 1 p 0 01 fig 3 a obviously the nob community dominated by ca nitrotoga grew faster than that dominated by nitrospira following a 24 hour fa treatment the x nob in the control sludge unadapted with nitrospira as the dominant nob decreased by 3 log while only 2 log inactivation was achieved for the experimental sludge adapted to fa treatment with ca nitrotoga as the dominating nob fig 3b the distinct survival ratios suggested that the ca nitrotoga are more resistant to fa treatment than nitrospira this finding accorded with literature report which showed ca nitrotoga bore higher tolerance to fa compared to nitrospira li et al 2020 the higher tolerance to fa of ca nitrotoga resulted in a lower b n o b of the ca nitrotoga containing sludge i e the experimental sludge than the nitrospira containing sludge i e the control sludge as a joint result of a higher μm nob and lower bnob the net growth rate μ n o b b n o b 1 s r t rose above 0 for the adapted experimental sludge which ultimately explained the proliferation of ca nitrotoga in the experimental reactor subject to daily fa treatment additionally the comparison of the aob growth and inactivation kinetics showed similar trends the fa adapted sludge had a higher μm aob 0 75 0 04 versus 0 47 0 02 d 1 and lower inactivation efficiency on aob 1 log versus 1 5 log compared to the unadapted sludge figure s3 indicating aob also adapted to fa treatment however the inactivation efficiency of aob was generally 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for nob figure s3 3 2 nob suppression by and adaptation to low do 3 2 1 fa adaptation overcome by low do the nob adaptation to fa treatment could be overcome by restricting μ n o b to a level which brings the net growth rate μ n o b b n o b 1 s r t to below 0 in phase iii the apparent oxygen affinity of aob in the experimental sludge was estimated to be higher than that of nob k o aob 0 63 0 08 mg o2 l 1 versus k o nob 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 fig 4 therefore low do could potentially eliminate the fa adapted nob in phase iii while retaining aob on day 403 do in the experimental reactor was reduced from 1 5 2 0 to 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 launching phase iv shortly after the do reduction nar re built up to 95 4 3 8 and negligible in situ nob activity was detected fig 1b and 1c suggesting the successful suppression on fa adapted nob by low do the use of the lower do also reduced the in situ aob activity from 6 20 1 50 mg n l 1 h 1 to 2 47 0 68 mg n l 1 h 1 causing elevated ammonium concentration in the effluent the effluent ammonium nitrite ratio therefore rose to 2 2 0 5 in phase iv higher than the stochiometric ratio required for the anammox process fig 1a meanwhile the control reactor was still operated as in phase i iii showing resembled performance in earlier phases figure s1 3 2 2 nob adaptation to low do low do only temporarily suppressed nob in the experimental reactor around 3 months after its introduction nob adapted to the low do in phase v day 502 525 as indicated by the climbing effluent nitrate the plummeting nar and the rebounding in situ nob activity fig 1 the decreased effluent ammonium and the rising in situ aob activity indicated aob also adapted to low do the apparent oxygen affinity of nob in the experimental sludge decreased from 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 in phase iii before applying low do to 0 38 0 05 mg o2 l 1 in phase v adapted to low do fig 4b the decreased ko nob would drastically elevate the in situ volumetric activity of nob at the beginning of phase iv when the nob populations had a ko nob value of 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 same as phase iii the in situ nob volumetric activity would immediately reach only 43 of the phase iii rate when average do was reduced from 1 7 to 0 3 mg o2 l 1 this eventually led to nob wash out in phase iv with the decrease of ko nob value from 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 to 0 38 0 05 mg o2 l 1 the in situ nob volumetric activity in phase v is estimated to return to 77 of the phase iii level assuming other kinetic parameters did not change thereby enabling the comeback of nob in phase v besides aob also obtained higher oxygen affinity with ko aob decreasing from 0 63 0 08 to 0 24 0 02 mg o2 l 1 fig 4a the enhanced oxygen affinity of aob was likely responsible for the improved ammonium oxidation performance in phase v the 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that ca nitrotoga which was the dominating nob population in phase iii were no longer detectable at the end of phase iv or in phase v nitrospira which were often found to dominate in low do systems cao et al 2018 liu et al 2013 were not detected either suggesting fa based sludge treatment continued to suppress nitrospira indeed no known nob species were detected in phase v albeit the performance and in situ activity data showed notable nitrite oxidizing activity fig 1 the responsible nitrite oxidizers in phase v could be some novel species which not only have high oxygen affinity but also strong fa resistance 3 3 stable nob suppression via the addition of anammox as an in situ nitrite scavenger in response to the nob adaptation to both fa treatment and low do anammox on carrier biofilms were added into both reactors as nitrite scavengers accompanied by changes in the feeding and aeration patterns as detailed in 2 2 after initial fluctuations during the transition period day 550 620 the effluent nitrogen gradually stabilized for both experimental and control reactors fig 5 a figure s6a in the experimental reactor the nitrate in effluent was at 4 1 1 3 mg n l 1 fig 5a and the in situ nitrite oxidation rate was detected at only 0 2 0 1 mg n l 1 h 1 fig 5b for six months day 621 800 these results suggested that nob activity in the experimental reactor were stably suppressed by the combination of fa based sludge treatment low do and nitrite scavenging by anammox in comparison nob continued to thrive in the control reactor which did not receive fa based sludge treatment but was otherwise operated under identical conditions with an in situ nitrite oxidation rate of 3 9 0 2 mg n l 1 h 1 figure s6b consequently its effluent contained nitrate as the main nitrogen species at 41 9 18 3 mg n l 1 with negligible levels of ammonium and nitrite figure s6a 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed the relative abundances of nob in the flocs and biofilm in the steady state of phase vi day 780 table 1 for the experimental reactor nob was barely detected in the flocs but retained in biofilm nitrospira 0 4 0 1 it is important to note that the carriers were not subject to periodic fa treatment which was applied to floccular sludge only for the control reactor nob nitrospira genus resided in both flocs and biofilm with a relative abundance of 2 6 0 5 and 1 1 0 4 respectively the maximum flocs and biofilm associated nob activities were also evaluated as an auxiliary perspective table 1 in accord to the microbial results the experimental reactor had a much lower nob activity in flocs than the control reactor p 0 001 demonstrating the effectiveness of fa treatment in suppressing flocs associated nob in contrast the biofilm associated nob displayed a significant nitrite oxidation capacity 4 97 0 32 mg n l 1 h 1 even slightly higher p 0 05 than that of the biofilm in the control reactor 3 60 0 93 mg n l 1 h 1 this is in good agreement with the significant presence of nob in the experimental reactor biofilm interestingly nob in the experimental reactor displayed a low in situ nitrite oxidation rate of 0 2 0 1 mg n l 1 h 1 only fig 5b the large gap between the in situ and maximum nitrite oxidation rates were likely related to the low in situ do 0 2 0 4 mg l 1 and nitrite 0 7 0 6 mg n l 1 levels previous studies found nob tend to embed themselves into the inner layer of biofilm while aob grow on the outer layer gustavsson et al 2020 the biofilm stratification would further limit the access of nob to oxygen and nitrite as nob in biofilm has a long theoretically infinite retention time even a low in situ growth rate could support their retention in the system in biofilm the relative abundances and maximum activities of aob and anammox were also measured in the same period the relative abundances of flocs and biofilm aob were comparable between the experimental and control reactors table 1 in good congruency the experimental and control sludges also delivered similar maximum flocs and biofilm associated aob activities however the two reactors exhibited distinct anammox profiles for the experimental reactor the microbial and maximum activity data jointly showed that anammox exclusively existed in biofilm the absence of anammox in flocs could be due to the short srt of the floccular sludge 15 days and the regular exposure of flocs to 354 58 mg nh3 n l 1 fa treatment as reported in literature fa at 2 mg nh3 n l 1 could significantly inhibit anammox activity jaroszynski et al 2012 for the control reactor anammox bacteria and activity were detected in neither flocs nor biofilm signalling the out selection of anammox by nob the stable nob suppression over a long period six months was achieved via a synergy of the three strategies the fa based sludge treatment and low do although unable to completely suppress nob in long term due to adaptation created conditions weakening nob activities in comparison to aob which were less affected fig 5b this distinction led to nitrite accumulation at the end of aerated periods in phase vi figure s8a the accumulated nitrite was scavenged by anammox in the following non aerated phase therefore unavailable for nob in the next aerated cycle figure s8a in this way this loss of energy source for nob led to less nob growth in the cycle giving rise to even more nitrite accumulation in the subsequent aerated periods this upward spiral continued eventually resulting in the out selection of nob as a comparison in the control reactor as no fa treatment was implemented nitrite was completely depleted by nob in each aerated period figure s8b leaving no nitrite for anammox in the following non aerated period gradually anammox rather than nob were washed out from the system 3 4 establishment of stable one stage pn a via the combo strategy during the steady state of phase vi the experimental reactor achieved an effluent tin of 6 6 3 1 mg n l 1 giving rise to an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 2 5 4 table 2 in comparison throughout phase i v without anammox carriers the tin efficiencies were only at 9 6 2 1 12 8 3 2 10 0 2 4 11 6 3 3 and 11 9 2 8 respectively the limited nitrogen removal in phase i v suggested that the cod present in the hras effluent was not effective in supporting denitrification this was further supported by the nitrogen removal performance of the control reactor with an average tin removal efficiency of 11 2 2 8 across the six phases these results could be because readily biodegradable cod in the raw wastewater was mostly captured in the preceding hras plant the comparison of the nitrogen removal performance between the experimental reactor and the control reactor in phase vi 84 2 5 4 versus 10 4 4 6 table 2 suggests that the anammox reaction alone led to a tin removal efficiency of approximately 70 the results clearly indicated that the combo strategy successfully established a stable one stage pn a process in the experimental reactor the implementation of pn a in mainstream treatment has been a hot spot field for the past decade due to its huge potential in achieving energy neutrality in wwtps a lot of promising results have been achieved so far mainstream pn a was initially demonstrated in sole biofilm either on carriers or in granules configuration gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 pérez et al 2014 the long retention time of biofilm can effectively retain the slow growing anammox bacteria moreover the inherent diffusion resistance in biofilm could facilitate nob suppression via oxygen limitation usually the do in a sole biofilm pn a system needs to be controlled below 0 2 mg l 1 the rigorous requirement for do control not only brings operational difficulties in full scale implementation joss et al 2011 but also jeopardizes aob activities thus limiting the overall rate laureni et al 2015 pérez et al 2014 to overcome the limitation on aob rates floccular sludge was introduced into biofilm systems constituting a hybrid configuration gustavsson et al 2020 hubaux et al 2015 laureni et al 2019 leix et al 2016 malovanyy et al 2015 park et al 2015 trojanowicz et al 2019 wells et al 2017 the looser structure of flocs leads to less diffusion resistance than biofilm therefore enabling higher rates however the loosened diffusion resistance would lead to nob growth in flocs which seriously deteriorates the stability and effluent quality of pn a process laureni et al 2016 yang et al 2007 the flocs associated nob could be controlled by combing an aggressive floccular srt 7 days and low do 0 2 mg l 1 laureni et al 2019 seuntjens et al 2020 these harsh conditions would severely impact flocs associated aob activities as well i e contradicting the original aim for introducing flocs this study provided an alternative dimension to control the flocs associated nob in an ifas system compared to existing ifas systems a sludge ad liquor contact tank is included fig 6 where the thickened floccular sludge is mixed with the fa rich supernatant of ad effluent through introducing fa based treatment on the floccular sludge as an additional suppression factor mainstream pn a in an ifas system can be stably maintained at a relatively higher do level of 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 and longer srt 15 days than those reported in literatures the control of do at a level below 0 2 mg o2 l 1 may be difficult to achieve at pilot and full scale because of accuracy of do probe in the range or the unsuitable size of the installed aerators and blowers joss et al 2011 this could partly explain the rare pilot or full scale demonstrations of mainstream pn a despite extensive successful lab scale studies the fa based treatment on the floccular sludge adds more operational flexibility to hybrid mainstream pn a systems making mainstream pn a one step closer to its practical application this study also confirmed the indispensability of nitrite scavenging in a mainstream pn a process through stepwise application of three promising nob suppression strategies namely the decay enhancing fa based sludge treatment strategy the oxygen limiting low do strategy and the nitrite scavenging via anammox strategy this study found that the previous two strategies can be adapted while the nitrite scavenging cannot be easily adapted the conclusion is consistent with the fact that majority of successful mainstream pn a examples were reported for one stage systems where anammox could indeed have served as a nitrite scavenger gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2019 2016 lotti et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 the reason that the combo strategy was deployed in the sequence of fa treatment oxygen limitation and nitrite scavenging is because two stage pn a was initially planned to be demonstrated however as shown in the long term results two stage configuration where in situ nitrite scavengers are absent is not a readily viable option for mainstream pn a besides with hindsight if nitrite scavenging was deployed at first by adding anammox without fa sludge treatment of the floccular sludge the anammox would be outcompeted by flocs associated nob over long term operation as shown in the control reactor figure s6 previously alternate fa and fna treatment has been proposed to overcome nob adaptation the alternate treatment strategy stably suppressed nitrobacter and nitrospira for 650 days in a lab scale reactor fed with synthetic wastewater duan et al 2019a however real sewage may contain a much more diverse nob community duan et al 2019b such as ca nitrotoga which cannot be simply suppressed via either fa or fna sludge treatment zheng et al 2020 indeed ca nitrotoga was observed in this study in phase iii which led to the failure of fa sludge treatment therefore other dimensions of controlling strategy such as oxygen limitation and nitrite scavenging are also necessary to achieve stable nob suppression in treating real sewage considering the significant difficulty of nob control recently partial denitrification pd no3 no2 has also been developed as an alternative to provide nitrite for anammox du et al 2020 cao et al 2019 cao et al 2020 pd combined with anammox pd a process can save 50 aeration and 80 organics demand compared to nitrification denitrification although the savings are lower than pn a 60 aeration and 100 organics demand the long term stability is seemingly easier to maintain which has been demonstrated in lab scale and even full scale plant therefore pd can be an alternative to pn or combined with pn to provide stable nitrite for mainstream anammox which needs to be further investigated in future studies 4 conclusions this study aimed to unravel the mechanisms of nob adaptation to various suppression strategies and to develop counterstrategies accordingly to this end two reactors receiving real carbon deficient wastewater were continuously operated for 800 days during which fa based sludge treatment low do at 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 and nitrite scavenging by anammox were progressively implemented on the experimental reactor the following conclusions are drawn nob are able to adapt to both fa based sludge treatment and low do through population shifts with the emerging populations displaying higher resistance to fa treatment higher growth rate and higher affinity of oxygen compared with the nob initially present the combined use of fa based sludge treatment low do and nitrite scavenging via anammox is an effective way to stably suppress nob this study confirmed the indispensable role of nitrite scavenging in stable nob suppression this result further suggests that it would be extremely challenging to achieve stable

16918,stable suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob is still a major challenge for the implementation of partial nitritation and anammox pn a in mainstream treatment despite numerous suppression strategies demonstrated it is increasingly recognized that nob could develop resistance to these strategies threatening the long term stability of the mainstream pn a process this study aims to understand adaption mechanisms and develop counter strategies to overcome the adaptation to this end three previously demonstrated suppression strategies including nob inactivation via side stream sludge treatment with free ammonia fa the use of low dissolved oxygen do and the use of anammox to scavenge nitrite were stepwise applied over a period of 800 days to a laboratory scale reactor treating effluent from a high rate activated sludge hras plant fa sludge treatment alone sustained nitrite accumulation for about two months after which nob adaptation occurred causing pn to fail the fa adaptation was induced by a shift in the nob community from nitrospira to ca nitrotoga the latter was found to have higher resistance to fa and also a higher maximum specific growth rate low do at 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 was then applied in conjunction with fa treatment which successfully eliminated ca nitrotoga and re established pn however new and unidentified nob with a higher apparent oxygen affinity emerged in three months again leading to pn failure lastly as the third strategy for nob suppression anammox was introduced as an in situ nitrite scavenger the combo strategy delivered reliable nob suppression with no further adaptation in the remaining experimental period eight months the resulted one stage pn a reactor achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 2 5 37 a control reactor operated in parallel under the same conditions but without fa treatment only achieved 10 4 4 6 nitrogen removal with anammox completely outcompeted by nob in the last phase key words partial nitritation anammox nob adaptation free ammonia treatment low do mainstream anammox nitrite sink 1 introduction partial nitritation nh4 no2 and anammox nh4 no2 n2 no3 abbreviated as pn a is a carbon and energy efficient nitrogen removal process jetten et al 1997 the implementation of pn a in municipal wastewater i e mainstream treatment is gaining increasing interests in the recent decade driven by the needs of diverting organic carbon in mainstream for bio energy recovery kartal et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however scarcely has mainstream pn a been achieved to date agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 one of the biggest challenges is the difficulty associated with suppressing nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob while maintaining ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob at the same time laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2015 as illustrated in equation 1 nob suppression requires the net growth rate of nob i e μnob bnob 1 srt to be 0 or lower this goal can be achieved through 1 decreasing the growth rate μnob 2 increasing the decay rate bnob or 3 reducing srt sludge retention time μnob can be reduced by restricting oxygen availability through the use of e g low dissolved oxygen do or intermittent aeration blackburne et al 2008 ge et al 2014 regmi et al 2014 sliekers et al 2005 yang et al 2007 or by limiting nitrite availability through introducing nitrite scavengers e g heterotrophic denitrifiers or anammox laureni et al 2019 regmi et al 2014 bnob could be enhanced via applying biocidal agents such as free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 free nitrous acid fna wang et al 2014 sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 or energy intensive treatment zheng et al 2019 which have been shown to inactivate nob while maintaining aob activity lastly a higher sludge wastage rate could be applied to deliver a shorter srt van dongen et al 2001 yuan and oleszkiewicz 2011 however this strategy reduces the amounts of aob and other organisms in the system thus lowering the overall system efficiency 1 d x nob x nob d t μ n o b b n o b 1 s r t despite the proven effectiveness in many studies these nob suppression strategies have also been frequently demonstrated to lose their efficacy when applied over an extended period of time because of nob adaptation for example nob adaptation to low do was frequently reported in both bench and full scale studies cao et al 2018 liu et al 2013 which was found to be caused by community shift from nitrobacter to nitrospira the latter are widely known to have a higher affinity to oxygen in comparison to nitrobacter nob adaptation has also been observed with the b enhancing strategies such as the fa and fna based sludge treatment duan et al 2019a ma et al 2017 revealed nob adaptation to fna treatment at 0 75 mg hno2 n l 1 over 85 days in a laboratory scale nitrifying reactor via a shift from nitrospira to ca nitrotoga similarly the fa tolerance of an nob community strengthened over long term exposure to fa of up to 50 mg nh3 n l 1 li et al 2020 while it was apparent that the newly emerging nob populations were able to cope with the suppression factors applied the changes in the kinetic properties of the sludge before and after the adaptation were rarely studied which hindered the development of more effective counter strategies this study aims to systematically investigate nob adaptation in the mainstream treatment to unravel the mechanisms underpinning the adaptation to different suppression factors and to develop counterstrategies accordingly to this end three promising nob suppression strategies namely the decay enhancing fa based sludge treatment strategy the oxygen limiting low do strategy and the nitrite scavenging via anammox strategy were stepwise applied with a new strategy introduced on top of the proceeding one s when adaptation was observed the composition and kinetic properties μ n o b b n o b oxygen affinity of nob populations were experimentally investigated before and after each adaptation the experiments were undertaken on two lab scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs receiving real mainstream wastewater effluent from a pilot scale high rate activated sludge hras plant each operated for 800 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater composition the effluent of a pilot scale hras plant brisbane australia was collected once per week and stored at 4 c prior to use in the laboratory reactor studies see 2 2 the pilot scale hras plant was operated at a full scale wastewater treatment plant to channel the organic carbon in mainstream wastewater for bioenergy recovery the hras plant was stably operated for three years displaying 62 5 10 9 of total chemical oxygen demand tcod removal and negligible ammonium removal the hras effluent contained tcod at 335 64 mg l 1 soluble cod scod at 165 36 mg l 1 and ammonium at 44 7 4 5 mg nh4 n l 1 the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor ad liquor used for fa based sludge treatment see 2 2 was collected from a full scale

more details of its composition it was also collected weekly and stored at 4 c prior to use 2 2 reactor set up operation and monitoring two lab scale sbrs each with a working volume of 4 l were established in a temperature controlled room at 22 1 c one served as the experimental reactor and the other as a control the sbrs were initially seeded with the full scale activated sludge from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp brisbane australia the sbrs were operated with 6 hour cycles each cycle comprised the anoxic feeding 5 min anoxic reaction 85 min aerobic reaction 215 min sludge settling 50 min and decanting 5 min periods throughout the feeding anoxic reaction and aerobic reaction periods the sbrs were mixed with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm during the 5 min

otherwise specified with a programmable logic controller plc via on off control of the air flow the flow rate was 1 l min 1 when it was turned on in the last 5 minutes of the aerobic reaction period called the sludge wastage period 66 ml mixed liquor was discharged giving rise to an average srt of 15 days lastly 1 l supernatant was decanted after the settling phase giving rise to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 day ph during the entire cycle was monitored with a ph probe tps australia and a transmitter tps australia but not controlled the reactors were operated for 800 days consisting of six phases 1 phase ⅰ day 0 200 the two sbrs were operated as described above until stable and comparable performance was observed indicated by the stable mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations and the constant effluent quality phase ⅰ served as the baseline period 2 phase ii day 201 300 the two sbrs were operated as in phase i with the following two amendments to the experimental sbr a fa based sludge treatment was implemented in the experimental reactor in order to achieve nob suppression in the sludge wastage period in each cycle 250 ml mixed liquor was removed from the reactor in addition to the normal sludge wastage of 66 ml per cycle the 1000 ml sludge removed in one day i e over four cycles was thickened to 25 ml transferred to a sludge treatment unit where the thickened sludge was mixed with 25 ml ad liquor with a magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm for 24 hours the nitrogen load introduced via the ad liquor was approximately 25 of the mainstream nitrogen load resembling the additional nitrogen loading to a full scale plant with the return of ad liquor fux et al 2006 during the 24 hour sludge treatment period ph was controlled at 8 9 0 1 via dosing 0 1m naoh using a ph controller connected to the plc the total ammonium concentration in the treatment tank was measured as 1250 0 120 0 mg n l 1 based on which the fa concentration was calculated to be 354 58 mg nh3 n l 1 anthonisen et al 1976 the treated sludge was returned to the sbr in feeding periods over the next four cycles b to obtain an ammonium to nitrite molar ratio of roughly 1 1 suitable for feeding an anammox reactor ph based aeration control was implemented superseding the normal do based aeration control which switched off aeration when ph became lower than a pre selected set point the ph set point was selected such that approximately 50 of the influent ammonium was oxidized when the ph set point was reached 3 phase iii day 301 402 the two sbrs were operated as in phase ii the mechanisms of nob adaptation to fa treatment observed at the end of phase ii were investigated through incubation tests of the sludges from both sbrs as detailed in section 2 3 the incubation tests revealed the active aob and nob biomass concentrations in the reactors and also their maximum specific growth rates the apparent oxygen affinities of aob and nob ko aob ko nob in the experimental reactor were also measured through batch tests as illustrated in 2 4 4 phase iv day 403 501 the two sbrs were operated as in phase iii with however the lower upper limits of the do controller for the experimental reactor reduced from 1 5 2 0 to 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 the new do range was selected based on the ko aob ko nob values determined in phase iii in order to suppress nob using low do 5 phase v day 502 525 the two sbrs were operated as in phase iv the kinetic mechanism of nob adaptation to low do observed at the end of phase iv was investigated by measuring the apparent do affinities of aob and nob in the experimental sbr 6 phase vi day 526 800 each sbr was supplemented with 800 anammox containing k5 carriers anoxkaldnes ab sweden specific area of 800 m2 m 3 resulting in a filling ratio of 30 the anammox carriers originated from a pilot scale moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr treating ad liquor via pn a in a local wwtp brisbane australia the mbbr received ad liquor containing total ammonia at 855 0 75 1 mg n l 1 and delivered an effluent containing ammonium nitrite and nitrate at 101 2 27 5 8 3 6 7 and 63 8 36 9 mg n l 1 respectively the nitrogen removal rate was 0 7 kg n m 3 d 1 the anammox carriers were introduced to both sbrs to serve as nitrite scavengers and to achieve nitrogen removal both sbrs were thus turned into integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas reactors the fa based treatment in the experimental system was applied to the floccular sludge only i e not to the carriers to accommodate the anammox reaction the feeding anoxic and aerobic periods were integrated into one 300 min reaction period with intermittent aeration each aeration cycle was 15 min consisting of 5 min non aerated and 10 min aerated periods the influent along with the fa treated sludge for experimental system were fed to the reactor over all the non aerated periods during the aerated periods do was controlled at 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 as applied in phase v the two sbrs were otherwise operated as in phase v in all phases the influent and effluent nitrogen ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured three times per week the total inorganic nitrogen tin in the influent and effluent was calculated as the sum of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the nitrite accumulation ratio nar was calculated as the ratio between nitrite and the sum of nitrite and nitrate concentrations the mlss and mlvss concentrations the aob and nob activities both in situ and ex situ were assayed once a week as detailed in 2 5 in phase vi the ex situ anammox activities were also determined on a weekly basis biomass samples were collected from the mixed liquor and the carrier biofilm in phase vi during the steady state of each phase and stored in a freezer 80 c for microbial community profiling 2 6 2 3 incubation batch tests to estimate the maximum specific growth rate and active aob nob concentrations incubation batch tests were performed on sludges from both the experimental and control sbrs in phase iii to investigate the kinetic mechanisms of nob adaptation to fa based sludge treatment these tests were done on sludge samples both before and immediately after a 24 hour fa treatment the experimental data were then used to estimate the maximum specific growth rate d 1 and biomass concentration mg cod l 1 of aob and nob in the assayed sludge samples the incubation batch tests were performed in triplicates in 250 ml erlenmeyer cell culture flasks at 22 0 5 c in each test 1 ml of sludge was inoculated into 100 ml 0 1 phosphate buffered saline pbs solution incubation tests of aob and nob were performed separately for incubation of aob an nh4cl stock solution 50 g n l 1 1 ml was added at the beginning of the test to give a calculated ammonium concentration of 50 mg nh4 n l 1 similarly for the incubation of nob a nano2 stock solution 70 g n l 1 1 ml was added to result in a calculated nitrite concentration of 70 mg no2 n l 1 the flasks were constantly shaken at 150 rpm to ensure adequate mixing which also resulted in a non limiting do level above 5 mg o2 l 1 measured with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland through surface aeration ph was maintained in the range of 7 2 7 6 through supplementing excess calcium carbonate powder of 0 5 g per flask at the very beginning the incubation tests lasted until ammonium or nitrite were completely consumed typically over 5 7 days mixed liquor samples were taken every 12 hours for the measurement of the ammonium nitrite nitrate concentrations the maximum specific growth rates and biomass concentrations of aob and nob were estimated using a model based approach through minimizing the sum of squared errors between the measured and modelled nitrogen concentration profiles as detailed in wang et al 2020 aquasim 2 1d reichert 1998 was used for parameter estimation 2 4 determination of apparent oxygen affinity the apparent oxygen affinities of aob and nob ko aob and ko nob mg o2 l 1 in the experimental reactor sludge were determined in phase iii and v in each phase five batch tests were performed at five controlled do levels of 0 5 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 8 0 mg o2 l 1 respectively at the beginning of each test pre calculated amounts of nh4cl and nano2 stock solutions were added to achieve theoretical initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations of 50 mg nh4 n l 1 and 25 mg no2 n l 1 respectively ph in all tests was manually controlled at 7 5 through dosing 0 1m naoh and 0 1m hcl mixed liquor samples were taken at 15 min intervals for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the rates of ammonium oxidation and nitrite oxidation were estimated through linear regression of the ammonium and nitrate profiles respectively the ammonium and nitrite oxidation rates measured at different do conditions were then used to estimate ko aob and ko nob respectively via non linear least squares regression of monod equation in graphpad prism v 8 00 san diego california 2 5 determination of aob nob and anammox activities 2 5 1 ex situ activity determination ex situ activity tests were conducted weekly to determine the maximum activities i e activity under unlimited substrate conditions of aob and nob in phase i v for both the experimental and control reactors in each test 200 ml mixed liquor was transferred to a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the initial ammonium and nitrite were elevated to 50 and 25 mg n l 1 respectively by dosing pre calculated amounts of nh4cl and nano2 stock solutions constant aeration was supplied to maintain the do above 5 mg o2 l 1 measured with an optical do probe mettler toledo switzerland ph was manually controlled at 7 5 0 1 by adding 0 1m naoh and 0 1m hcl each test lasted for 60 min during which mixed liquor samples were taken at 15 min intervals for the analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the aob and nob activities were determined as the volumetric ammonium oxidation and nitrate production rates via linear regression of ammonium and nitrate profiles respectively in phase vi the aob and nob activities of the suspended sludge were determined as described above the aob and nob activities of carrier biofilms were measured in a similar way with 40 carriers 5 of total carriers suspended in 200 ml effluent 5 working volume in each test the anammox activity of the suspended sludge and carrier biofilms was measured using a similar procedure but under anoxic conditions the anoxic condition was created by continuously flushing the head space of erlenmeyer flask with nitrogen gas the anammox activity was determined as the volumetric tin removal rate 2 5 2 in situ activity determination in situ activity tests were conducted weekly to measure the aob nob activities in both sbrs at in situ substrate conditions in phase i v the mixed liquor samples were taken at 30 min intervals in the aerobic reaction period for analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the in situ aob and nob activities were determined as the volumetric ammonium oxidation and nitrate production rates respectively which were obtained through linearly regressing the linear part of the corresponding profiles in phase vi an sbr cycle contains 20 aerated periods from which 10 aerated periods were randomly chosen in each chosen period mixed liquor samples were taken at 5 min intervals for analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate the volumetric ammonium oxidation and nitrate production rates were obtained through linear regression of the corresponding profiles the in situ aob and nob rates were determined by averaging these rates in the ten periods 2 6 microbial analysis 16 s rrna gene sequencing was performed on biomass samples taken at the steady state of each phase the biomass on carriers was scratched into a 1 5 ml sterilized eppendorf tube before dna extraction dna extraction from both sludge and biofilm samples was performed using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals santa ana ca following the protocols quality of the extracted dna was checked with gel electrophoresis and a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies wilmington de usa before amplicon sequencing details of the amplicon sequencing and analysis of the sequenced data can be found in the supplementary materials 2 7 chemical analysis the mixed liquor samples were taken by syringes and immediately filtered through 0 45 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck u s for analysis of ammonium nitrite and nitrate with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi the mlss mlvss cod concentrations were determined following the standard methods apha 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 nob suppression by and adaptation to fa based sludge treatment 3 1 1 effective nob suppression in phase i day 0 200 both the experimental and control reactors performed full nitrification with ammonium in influent converted to nitrate fig 1 a figure s1a the nar for both reactors was below 1 fig 1b figure s1b the in situ volumetric rates of nob overlapped with that of aob fig 1c and figure s1c suggesting in both reactors nitrite formed by aob was instantaneously converted to nitrate by nob for the experimental reactor sludge treatment with fa was commenced on day 200 initiating phase ii in the steady state of phase ii day 240 300 stable nitrite accumulation was established at 20 4 3 6 mg n l 1 while nitrate in effluent was consistently below 0 5 mg n l 1 fig 1a giving rise to an nar of 92 1 3 2 fig 1b the in situ nob activity was 0 20 0 05 mg n l 1 h 1 fig 1c only 3 of that in phase i both the effluent and in situ activity data suggest that nob were successfully suppressed for the control sbr nar remained below 1 in phase ii figure s1b and the in situ nob activity remained similar to that of aob the in situ aob activity in the experimental reactor in phase ii showed no significant difference from that in the baseline phase or that in the control reactor in phase ii p 0 05 indicating fa based sludge treatment did not jeopardize aob activity in addition the ammonium nitrite ratio in the effluent was maintained at approximately 1 1 according to the design through the use of ph based aeration control 3 1 2 nob adaptation to fa based sludge treatment the stable pn sustained for about two months in phase ii from day 301 nitrite accumulation started to collapse whereas the effluent nitrate gradually built up fig 1a leading to the nar plunging to 15 3 2 6 fig 1b the in situ nob activity in the reactor rebounded to 5 50 1 12 mg n l 1 h 1 fig 1c clearly nob adapted to the fa treatment in this period therefore day 301 402 was registered as phase iii during which the adaptation mechanisms were further investigated the maximum volumetric nitrite oxidation rate as a proxy for nob abundance was closely monitored throughout phase i iii fig 2 a the maximum capacity of nitrite oxidation decreased from 9 80 2 30 to 0 3 0 1 mg n l 1 h 1 from phase i to ii and re established at 5 60 1 20 mg n l 1 h 1 in phase iii correspondingly the 16s rrna gene sequencing performed on the day 180 phase i day 280 phase ii and day 390 phase iii revealed an obvious shift in the nob community fig 2b the nob community was initially dominated by nitrospira in the baseline phase day 180 with a relative abundance of 3 66 0 05 the relative abundance of nitrospira decreased to 0 10 0 02 in phase ii day 280 when stable nitrite accumulation was established by fa based sludge treatment indicating nitrospira was successfully suppressed by this strategy however in phase iii day 380 another nob genus ca nitrotoga emerged with a relative abundance at 2 13 0 06 these newly emerged ca nitrotoga are likely responsible for the collapse of nitrite accumulation in phase iii the emergence of ca nitrotoga also suggested they could cope with the pressure of daily fa based sludge treatment in the control sludge the maximum nitrite oxidation rate remained stable at 10 20 2 60 mg n l 1 h 1 throughout phase i iii with nitrospira consistently dominating the nob community figure s2 besides the maximum ammonium oxidation rates and aob communities are relatively constant with minor variations throughout phase i iii in both the experimental and control reactors table s2 in order to further understand how ca nitrotoga coped with fa based sludge treatment the growth kinetics of the nob populations maximum growth rate of nob μ m nob in both the experimental ca nitrotoga containing and control nitrospira containing sludges in phase iii were investigated using incubation tests besides the efficacy of fa treatment in inactivating fa adapted and unadapted nob was also examined by comparing the active nob concentrations x nob before and after fa treatment the μ m nob in the experimental sludge 0 71 0 04 d 1 was significantly higher than that in the control sludge 0 55 0 03 d 1 p 0 01 fig 3 a obviously the nob community dominated by ca nitrotoga grew faster than that dominated by nitrospira following a 24 hour fa treatment the x nob in the control sludge unadapted with nitrospira as the dominant nob decreased by 3 log while only 2 log inactivation was achieved for the experimental sludge adapted to fa treatment with ca nitrotoga as the dominating nob fig 3b the distinct survival ratios suggested that the ca nitrotoga are more resistant to fa treatment than nitrospira this finding accorded with literature report which showed ca nitrotoga bore higher tolerance to fa compared to nitrospira li et al 2020 the higher tolerance to fa of ca nitrotoga resulted in a lower b n o b of the ca nitrotoga containing sludge i e the experimental sludge than the nitrospira containing sludge i e the control sludge as a joint result of a higher μm nob and lower bnob the net growth rate μ n o b b n o b 1 s r t rose above 0 for the adapted experimental sludge which ultimately explained the proliferation of ca nitrotoga in the experimental reactor subject to daily fa treatment additionally the comparison of the aob growth and inactivation kinetics showed similar trends the fa adapted sludge had a higher μm aob 0 75 0 04 versus 0 47 0 02 d 1 and lower inactivation efficiency on aob 1 log versus 1 5 log compared to the unadapted sludge figure s3 indicating aob also adapted to fa treatment however the inactivation efficiency of aob was generally 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for nob figure s3 3 2 nob suppression by and adaptation to low do 3 2 1 fa adaptation overcome by low do the nob adaptation to fa treatment could be overcome by restricting μ n o b to a level which brings the net growth rate μ n o b b n o b 1 s r t to below 0 in phase iii the apparent oxygen affinity of aob in the experimental sludge was estimated to be higher than that of nob k o aob 0 63 0 08 mg o2 l 1 versus k o nob 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 fig 4 therefore low do could potentially eliminate the fa adapted nob in phase iii while retaining aob on day 403 do in the experimental reactor was reduced from 1 5 2 0 to 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 launching phase iv shortly after the do reduction nar re built up to 95 4 3 8 and negligible in situ nob activity was detected fig 1b and 1c suggesting the successful suppression on fa adapted nob by low do the use of the lower do also reduced the in situ aob activity from 6 20 1 50 mg n l 1 h 1 to 2 47 0 68 mg n l 1 h 1 causing elevated ammonium concentration in the effluent the effluent ammonium nitrite ratio therefore rose to 2 2 0 5 in phase iv higher than the stochiometric ratio required for the anammox process fig 1a meanwhile the control reactor was still operated as in phase i iii showing resembled performance in earlier phases figure s1 3 2 2 nob adaptation to low do low do only temporarily suppressed nob in the experimental reactor around 3 months after its introduction nob adapted to the low do in phase v day 502 525 as indicated by the climbing effluent nitrate the plummeting nar and the rebounding in situ nob activity fig 1 the decreased effluent ammonium and the rising in situ aob activity indicated aob also adapted to low do the apparent oxygen affinity of nob in the experimental sludge decreased from 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 in phase iii before applying low do to 0 38 0 05 mg o2 l 1 in phase v adapted to low do fig 4b the decreased ko nob would drastically elevate the in situ volumetric activity of nob at the beginning of phase iv when the nob populations had a ko nob value of 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 same as phase iii the in situ nob volumetric activity would immediately reach only 43 of the phase iii rate when average do was reduced from 1 7 to 0 3 mg o2 l 1 this eventually led to nob wash out in phase iv with the decrease of ko nob value from 1 01 0 17 mg o2 l 1 to 0 38 0 05 mg o2 l 1 the in situ nob volumetric activity in phase v is estimated to return to 77 of the phase iii level assuming other kinetic parameters did not change thereby enabling the comeback of nob in phase v besides aob also obtained higher oxygen affinity with ko aob decreasing from 0 63 0 08 to 0 24 0 02 mg o2 l 1 fig 4a the enhanced oxygen affinity of aob was likely responsible for the improved ammonium oxidation performance in phase v the 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that ca nitrotoga which was the dominating nob population in phase iii were no longer detectable at the end of phase iv or in phase v nitrospira which were often found to dominate in low do systems cao et al 2018 liu et al 2013 were not detected either suggesting fa based sludge treatment continued to suppress nitrospira indeed no known nob species were detected in phase v albeit the performance and in situ activity data showed notable nitrite oxidizing activity fig 1 the responsible nitrite oxidizers in phase v could be some novel species which not only have high oxygen affinity but also strong fa resistance 3 3 stable nob suppression via the addition of anammox as an in situ nitrite scavenger in response to the nob adaptation to both fa treatment and low do anammox on carrier biofilms were added into both reactors as nitrite scavengers accompanied by changes in the feeding and aeration patterns as detailed in 2 2 after initial fluctuations during the transition period day 550 620 the effluent nitrogen gradually stabilized for both experimental and control reactors fig 5 a figure s6a in the experimental reactor the nitrate in effluent was at 4 1 1 3 mg n l 1 fig 5a and the in situ nitrite oxidation rate was detected at only 0 2 0 1 mg n l 1 h 1 fig 5b for six months day 621 800 these results suggested that nob activity in the experimental reactor were stably suppressed by the combination of fa based sludge treatment low do and nitrite scavenging by anammox in comparison nob continued to thrive in the control reactor which did not receive fa based sludge treatment but was otherwise operated under identical conditions with an in situ nitrite oxidation rate of 3 9 0 2 mg n l 1 h 1 figure s6b consequently its effluent contained nitrate as the main nitrogen species at 41 9 18 3 mg n l 1 with negligible levels of ammonium and nitrite figure s6a 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed the relative abundances of nob in the flocs and biofilm in the steady state of phase vi day 780 table 1 for the experimental reactor nob was barely detected in the flocs but retained in biofilm nitrospira 0 4 0 1 it is important to note that the carriers were not subject to periodic fa treatment which was applied to floccular sludge only for the control reactor nob nitrospira genus resided in both flocs and biofilm with a relative abundance of 2 6 0 5 and 1 1 0 4 respectively the maximum flocs and biofilm associated nob activities were also evaluated as an auxiliary perspective table 1 in accord to the microbial results the experimental reactor had a much lower nob activity in flocs than the control reactor p 0 001 demonstrating the effectiveness of fa treatment in suppressing flocs associated nob in contrast the biofilm associated nob displayed a significant nitrite oxidation capacity 4 97 0 32 mg n l 1 h 1 even slightly higher p 0 05 than that of the biofilm in the control reactor 3 60 0 93 mg n l 1 h 1 this is in good agreement with the significant presence of nob in the experimental reactor biofilm interestingly nob in the experimental reactor displayed a low in situ nitrite oxidation rate of 0 2 0 1 mg n l 1 h 1 only fig 5b the large gap between the in situ and maximum nitrite oxidation rates were likely related to the low in situ do 0 2 0 4 mg l 1 and nitrite 0 7 0 6 mg n l 1 levels previous studies found nob tend to embed themselves into the inner layer of biofilm while aob grow on the outer layer gustavsson et al 2020 the biofilm stratification would further limit the access of nob to oxygen and nitrite as nob in biofilm has a long theoretically infinite retention time even a low in situ growth rate could support their retention in the system in biofilm the relative abundances and maximum activities of aob and anammox were also measured in the same period the relative abundances of flocs and biofilm aob were comparable between the experimental and control reactors table 1 in good congruency the experimental and control sludges also delivered similar maximum flocs and biofilm associated aob activities however the two reactors exhibited distinct anammox profiles for the experimental reactor the microbial and maximum activity data jointly showed that anammox exclusively existed in biofilm the absence of anammox in flocs could be due to the short srt of the floccular sludge 15 days and the regular exposure of flocs to 354 58 mg nh3 n l 1 fa treatment as reported in literature fa at 2 mg nh3 n l 1 could significantly inhibit anammox activity jaroszynski et al 2012 for the control reactor anammox bacteria and activity were detected in neither flocs nor biofilm signalling the out selection of anammox by nob the stable nob suppression over a long period six months was achieved via a synergy of the three strategies the fa based sludge treatment and low do although unable to completely suppress nob in long term due to adaptation created conditions weakening nob activities in comparison to aob which were less affected fig 5b this distinction led to nitrite accumulation at the end of aerated periods in phase vi figure s8a the accumulated nitrite was scavenged by anammox in the following non aerated phase therefore unavailable for nob in the next aerated cycle figure s8a in this way this loss of energy source for nob led to less nob growth in the cycle giving rise to even more nitrite accumulation in the subsequent aerated periods this upward spiral continued eventually resulting in the out selection of nob as a comparison in the control reactor as no fa treatment was implemented nitrite was completely depleted by nob in each aerated period figure s8b leaving no nitrite for anammox in the following non aerated period gradually anammox rather than nob were washed out from the system 3 4 establishment of stable one stage pn a via the combo strategy during the steady state of phase vi the experimental reactor achieved an effluent tin of 6 6 3 1 mg n l 1 giving rise to an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 84 2 5 4 table 2 in comparison throughout phase i v without anammox carriers the tin efficiencies were only at 9 6 2 1 12 8 3 2 10 0 2 4 11 6 3 3 and 11 9 2 8 respectively the limited nitrogen removal in phase i v suggested that the cod present in the hras effluent was not effective in supporting denitrification this was further supported by the nitrogen removal performance of the control reactor with an average tin removal efficiency of 11 2 2 8 across the six phases these results could be because readily biodegradable cod in the raw wastewater was mostly captured in the preceding hras plant the comparison of the nitrogen removal performance between the experimental reactor and the control reactor in phase vi 84 2 5 4 versus 10 4 4 6 table 2 suggests that the anammox reaction alone led to a tin removal efficiency of approximately 70 the results clearly indicated that the combo strategy successfully established a stable one stage pn a process in the experimental reactor the implementation of pn a in mainstream treatment has been a hot spot field for the past decade due to its huge potential in achieving energy neutrality in wwtps a lot of promising results have been achieved so far mainstream pn a was initially demonstrated in sole biofilm either on carriers or in granules configuration gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014 pérez et al 2014 the long retention time of biofilm can effectively retain the slow growing anammox bacteria moreover the inherent diffusion resistance in biofilm could facilitate nob suppression via oxygen limitation usually the do in a sole biofilm pn a system needs to be controlled below 0 2 mg l 1 the rigorous requirement for do control not only brings operational difficulties in full scale implementation joss et al 2011 but also jeopardizes aob activities thus limiting the overall rate laureni et al 2015 pérez et al 2014 to overcome the limitation on aob rates floccular sludge was introduced into biofilm systems constituting a hybrid configuration gustavsson et al 2020 hubaux et al 2015 laureni et al 2019 leix et al 2016 malovanyy et al 2015 park et al 2015 trojanowicz et al 2019 wells et al 2017 the looser structure of flocs leads to less diffusion resistance than biofilm therefore enabling higher rates however the loosened diffusion resistance would lead to nob growth in flocs which seriously deteriorates the stability and effluent quality of pn a process laureni et al 2016 yang et al 2007 the flocs associated nob could be controlled by combing an aggressive floccular srt 7 days and low do 0 2 mg l 1 laureni et al 2019 seuntjens et al 2020 these harsh conditions would severely impact flocs associated aob activities as well i e contradicting the original aim for introducing flocs this study provided an alternative dimension to control the flocs associated nob in an ifas system compared to existing ifas systems a sludge ad liquor contact tank is included fig 6 where the thickened floccular sludge is mixed with the fa rich supernatant of ad effluent through introducing fa based treatment on the floccular sludge as an additional suppression factor mainstream pn a in an ifas system can be stably maintained at a relatively higher do level of 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 and longer srt 15 days than those reported in literatures the control of do at a level below 0 2 mg o2 l 1 may be difficult to achieve at pilot and full scale because of accuracy of do probe in the range or the unsuitable size of the installed aerators and blowers joss et al 2011 this could partly explain the rare pilot or full scale demonstrations of mainstream pn a despite extensive successful lab scale studies the fa based treatment on the floccular sludge adds more operational flexibility to hybrid mainstream pn a systems making mainstream pn a one step closer to its practical application this study also confirmed the indispensability of nitrite scavenging in a mainstream pn a process through stepwise application of three promising nob suppression strategies namely the decay enhancing fa based sludge treatment strategy the oxygen limiting low do strategy and the nitrite scavenging via anammox strategy this study found that the previous two strategies can be adapted while the nitrite scavenging cannot be easily adapted the conclusion is consistent with the fact that majority of successful mainstream pn a examples were reported for one stage systems where anammox could indeed have served as a nitrite scavenger gilbert et al 2015 isanta et al 2015 laureni et al 2019 2016 lotti et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 the reason that the combo strategy was deployed in the sequence of fa treatment oxygen limitation and nitrite scavenging is because two stage pn a was initially planned to be demonstrated however as shown in the long term results two stage configuration where in situ nitrite scavengers are absent is not a readily viable option for mainstream pn a besides with hindsight if nitrite scavenging was deployed at first by adding anammox without fa sludge treatment of the floccular sludge the anammox would be outcompeted by flocs associated nob over long term operation as shown in the control reactor figure s6 previously alternate fa and fna treatment has been proposed to overcome nob adaptation the alternate treatment strategy stably suppressed nitrobacter and nitrospira for 650 days in a lab scale reactor fed with synthetic wastewater duan et al 2019a however real sewage may contain a much more diverse nob community duan et al 2019b such as ca nitrotoga which cannot be simply suppressed via either fa or fna sludge treatment zheng et al 2020 indeed ca nitrotoga was observed in this study in phase iii which led to the failure of fa sludge treatment therefore other dimensions of controlling strategy such as oxygen limitation and nitrite scavenging are also necessary to achieve stable nob suppression in treating real sewage considering the significant difficulty of nob control recently partial denitrification pd no3 no2 has also been developed as an alternative to provide nitrite for anammox du et al 2020 cao et al 2019 cao et al 2020 pd combined with anammox pd a process can save 50 aeration and 80 organics demand compared to nitrification denitrification although the savings are lower than pn a 60 aeration and 100 organics demand the long term stability is seemingly easier to maintain which has been demonstrated in lab scale and even full scale plant therefore pd can be an alternative to pn or combined with pn to provide stable nitrite for mainstream anammox which needs to be further investigated in future studies 4 conclusions this study aimed to unravel the mechanisms of nob adaptation to various suppression strategies and to develop counterstrategies accordingly to this end two reactors receiving real carbon deficient wastewater were continuously operated for 800 days during which fa based sludge treatment low do at 0 2 0 4 mg o2 l 1 and nitrite scavenging by anammox were progressively implemented on the experimental reactor the following conclusions are drawn nob are able to adapt to both fa based sludge treatment and low do through population shifts with the emerging populations displaying higher resistance to fa treatment higher growth rate and higher affinity of oxygen compared with the nob initially present the combined use of fa based sludge treatment low do and nitrite scavenging via anammox is an effective way to stably suppress nob this study confirmed the indispensable role of nitrite scavenging in stable nob suppression this result further suggests that it would be extremely challenging to achieve stable mainstream pn a in a two stage system as nitrite scavengers are absent in the partial nitration stage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

enhanced raman scattering sers human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction the outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid 19 pneumonia since 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 li et al 2020b and it has rapidly spread throughout 202 countries around the world till 19th march 2021 there have been over 125 million confirmed cases and nearly 3 million deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly as there is clear evidence of human to human transmission of sars cov 2 chan et al 2020 chang et al 2020 li et al 2020b poon and peiris 2020 e g direct contact respiratory droplets carlos et al 2020 lai et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and stools zhang et al 2020b how to interrogate sars cov 2 in human and environmental samples draws more attentions for effectively confirming covid 19 cases and identifying transmission routes zhang et al 2021 it brings urgent requirement of developing detection tools that can rapidly and specifically recognize sars cov 2 to track patients many approaches can detect sars cov 2 with high specificity e g real time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr and colloidal gold immunochromatography rt qpcr targeted viral specific rna fragment with specific primers for the open reading frame 1ab cddcorf nucleocapsid protein cddcn envelope protein membrane protein or rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp jung et al 2020 nalla et al 2020 ong et al 2020 wang et al 2020 rna extraction from swab samples is necessary for rt qpcr and requires time consuming pretreatment normally taking more than 4 h nolan et al 2006 schmittgen and livak 2008 and bringing a barrier for rapid diagnosis of sars cov 2 alternatively colloidal gold immunochromatography is a commonly used immunoassay to detect antibodies igg or igm stimulated by antigen entry auta et al 2017 targeting the immunological markers igm and igg antibodies which are reported to increase in the blood of most patients more than a week after infection woo et al 2005 however this method is still time consuming and not feasible for detecting sars cov 2 in environmental media which do not have immunological markers amanat et al 2020 stadlbauer et al 2020 weiss et al 2020 it is of great urgency to develop a rapid reproducible cheap and sensitive assay detecting sars cov 2 especially applicable for different environmental samples raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy of ability to detect chemical bonds via photon scattering morais et al 2019 but the generated signals are extremely weak comparing to the incident beam thus surface enhanced raman scattering sers is introduced to overcome such inherent limitation and interrogate trace materials by exploiting the enormous electromagnetic field enhancement resulted from the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances at nanostructured metallic surfaces mostly gold or silver moskovits 1985 stiles et al 2008 it has been widely applied for biological analysis e g living cell classification nam et al 2019 cancer detection vendrell et al 2013 biological imaging zavaleta et al 2009 and virus detection zhang et al 2011 for sars cov 2 the spike glycoprotein consists of s1 and s2 subunits and s1 subunit contains a receptor binding domain rbd directly recognizing the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cell entry lan et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 such recognition and binding might alter the structure of ace2 and lead to changes in raman spectra additionally the binding specificity allows ace2 as an anchor to capture sars cov 2 from human or environmental samples for interrogation in this study we proposed a capture quenching strategy to rapidly detect sars cov 2 and developed a sers assay introducing ace2 functionalized on silver nanorod sers substrates to capture and interrogate sars cov 2 spike protein fig 1 we firstly functionalized ace2 on an aligned silver nanorod sers sn sers array in oblique angle deposition to capture and interrogate sars cov 2 spike protein the induced sers signal quenching was documented by either red shift or whole spectral alterations in multivariate analysis as indicators for the presence of sars cov 2 in real environmental water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of silver nanorod sers array the aligned silver nanorod sers sn sers array was fabricated in oblique angle deposition oad using a custom designed electron beam sputtering evaporation system suzhou derivative biotechnology co ltd and formed randomly on a 4 inch silicon wafer with increasing deposition time shanmukh et al 2006 briefly si wafer was immersed in absolute alcohol and blow dried up

performed at a base pressure lower than 3 10 4 pa the thickness of film growth was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance firstly a thin layer of about 20 nm was deposited to assist the adhesion of silver on si wafer followed by the deposition of a base layer of 200 nm silver the glad stage was then tilt to 84 with respect to the incident vapor a layer of 80 nm was then deposited with substrate rotation at 0 1 rev s to improve the seeding for nanorod growth the deposition rate was 2 å s in each stage and lasted about 3 h 2 2 fabrication of ace2 sn sers substrate ace2 was purchased from novoprotein china and stored in borate buffer solution 0 1 m ph 7 2 at 80 c before use and the ace2 sn sers substrate was fabricated by suzhou yiqing environmental science and technology ltd china briefly sn sers substrate was firstly cleaned by thorough rinse with deionized water and dried using n2 gas flow subsequently 1 μl of ace2 stock solution 30 pg was loaded to sn sers substrate and placed in an incubator under constant temperature and humidity conditions 25 c 75 w w for 4 h ace2 was then bound onto the surface of sn sers substrate designated as ace2 sn sers substrate which could be stored in 4 c for 2 weeks before use 2 3 water samples and biological analysis twenty three water samples were collected from rivers hospitals and pipe networks in wuhan china from 24th march to 10th april 2020 table 1 around 2 0 l of water was directly collected in a plexiglass sampler placed in 4 c ice boxes and immediately transferred into laboratory for rna extraction following our reported protocol zhang et al 2020a briefly after centrifugation at 3000 rpm to remove suspended solids the supernatant was subsequently supplemented with nacl 0 3 mol l and peg 6000 10 settled overnight at 4 c and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min viral rna in pellets was extracted using the ez1 virus mini kit qiagen germany according to the manufacturer s instructions sars cov 2

template rna reverse transcription was conducted at 45 c for 10 min 1 cycle followed by initial denaturation at 90 c for 10 min 1 cycle and 40 thermal cycles of 60 c for 45 second and 90 c for 15 s quantitative fluorescent signal for each sample was normalized by rox passive reference dye provided in 2 rt pcr buffer for each rt qpcr run both positive and negative controls were included the copy numbers of sars cov 2 was obtained from a standard calibration curve by a 10 fold serial dilution of genes encoding nucleocapsid protein with an amplification efficiency of 102 6 calculated as copies 10 cq 39 086 3 262 r2 0 991 for quality control a reagent blank and extraction blank were included for rna extraction procedure and no contamination was observed 2 4 validation treatment and tests to validate the performance and specificity of ace2 sn sers substrate negative controls were prepared and included cells of escherichia coli dh5α proteins of e coli dh5α and bacteriophage phi6 cells of e coli dh5α were grown in lb medium at 37 c for 16 hr harvested by centrifugation washed three times with deionized water and finally stored at 4 c prior to test proteins of e coli dh5α cells were extracted after 16 hr cultivation using allprep bacterial protein kit qiagen usa following manufacturer s instruction and stored at 20 c prior to test bacteriophage phi 6 is an enveloped rna virus widely used for study on viral survival and persistence in environmental media whitworth et al 2020 wood et al 2020 it was purchased from dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures gmbh as vacuum dried suspensions on filter paper in double vial glass ampoules bacteriophage phil6 was carefully revitalized by a previous protocol whitworth et al 2020 harvested and purified in the suspension of sterile water and stored at 4 c prior to test sars cov 2 spike proteins were extracted and provided by school of life sciences tsinghua university following a reported protocol lan et al 2020 five microliters of stock solutions e coli dh5α cells and bacteriophage phi6 around 103 copies e coli dh5α proteins and sars cov 2 spike proteins around 10 pg and water samples were directly loaded onto the fabricated ace2 sn sers substrate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min after dryness the substrate was ready for raman spectral acquisition and can be stored at 4 c for at least 1 week a series dilution of sars cov 2 spike proteins were used to obtain the qualitative curves between raman shifts and sars cov 2 spike proteins ranging from 0 1 pg to 10 pg 2 5 raman spectral acquisition for laboratory test raman spectra were acquired using a near infrared confocal raman microscope hr evolution horiba usa equipped with a 785 nm near ir laser source a 300 l mm grating and a semiconductor cooling detector ccd all raman spectra were collected with a 50 objective lens na 0 7 at an exposure time of 10 s 3 accumulations and laser power of 10 mw prior to lens raman spectroscopic system was calibrated with a silicon wafer at raman shift of 520 cm 1 at least five random regions were measured for each sample and a minimum of 9 individual spectra were acquired per sample a 785 nm portable raman spectrometer finder edge zolix china was used for on site detection and the ace2 sn sers substrate was placed on the probe of the portable raman spectrometer with the following parameters 0 5 s acquisition time and 300 mw laser power this portable raman spectrometer has a satisfactory spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 to distinguish possible spectral shift of biological samples at least five time measurement was conducted for each sample for both laboratory and on site test all raman spectra were recorded in the range of 100 3500 cm 1 in biological triplicates on site spectra acquisition took only 2 min followed by multivariate analysis for about 3 min to allow overall test within 5 min 2 6 multivariate analysis of raman spectra raw spectral data were pre processed by using the open source irootlab toolbox performed on matlab r2012 trevisan et al 2013 briefly each acquired raman spectrum was cut to a biochemical cell fingerprint region 900 1800 cm 1 baseline corrected wavelet de noised and vector normalized unlike rt qpcr and immunochromatography assay our ace2 sn sers assay generates raman spectral data which are multivariate and difficult to generate an individual variable for sars cov 2 thus we used two approaches to distinguish the difference between positive and negative samples firstly the ratio of raman intensity at 1182 cm 1 to that at 1189 cm 1 was calculated designated as 1182 1189 ratio as an indicator for positivity prediction alternatively multivariate analysis was applied to the pre processed spectral data to reduce data dimensions and extract key information principal component analysis pca is an unsupervised data analytical method reducing the dimensionality of data determining principal components pcs and extracting key features jin et al 2017 li et al 2020a the first 10 pcs which account for more than 90 of the variance of the selected spectral regions were then inputted into linear discriminate analysis lda which determines the discriminant function line that maximizes the inter class distance and minimizes the intra class distance to derive an optimal linear boundary separating the different classes generally pca lda score plots and cluster vectors are generated and the scores of the linear discriminant 1 ld1 provides the best classification li et al 2020a 2 7 statistical analysis one way anova was used to compare the difference between samples and p value less than 0 05 refers to statistically significant difference 3 results and discussions 3 1 features of sn sers and ace2 sn sers substrates sem images fig 2 a illustrated a successful fabrication of silver nanorods on sers substrate the overall diameter and length of silver nanorods was 211 45 and 737 52 nm respectively and the uniform structure demonstrated a density of 8 nanorods μm2 after functionalization with ace2 protein clear protein structures were observed on ace2 sn sers substrate exhibiting as small islands with a diameter of 2 μm fig 2b the background raman signals of sn sers substrate without ace2 exhibited no significant peaks from 900 to 1800 cm 1 figure s1 showing a satisfactory performance for interrogating bio related sers ace2 sn sers substrate generated remarkable sers signals around 400 times stronger than sn sers substrate figure s1 the featured raman peaks are probably assigned with phenylalanine 1032 cm 1 rygula et al 2013 cn stretching in protein 1089 cm 1 chan et al 2006 amide iii for cn stretching and nh bending 1189 cm 1 malini et al 2006 ch2 bending mode of proteins 1447 cm 1 ó faoláin et al 2005 and conjugated c c in protein 1587 cm 1 rau et al 2016 3 2 sers detection of sars cov 2 spike protein sars cov 2 spike protein was firstly tested on sn sers and ace2 sn sers substrates as a proof of concept demonstration different from ace2 protein raman peak intensities derived from sars cov 2 spike protein were relatively weak on sn sers substrate and the distinct peaks were mostly located at 1032 1051 1182 1447 and 1597 cm 1 fig 2c they are probably assigned to phenylalanine 1032 cm 1 rygula et al 2013 cn stretching in protein 1051 cm 1 chan et al 2006 ch2 bending mode of proteins 1447 cm 1 ó faoláin et al 2005 after loading spike proteins onto ace2 sn sers substrate the whole spectra exhibited a quenching of sers signal intensity especially at raman shifts of 1089 1189 and 1447 cm 1 fig 2c sars cov 2 spike protein rbd targets the short β5 and β6 strands α4 and α5 helices and loops on ace2 lan et al 2020 which are rich in phenylalanine and amide iii for cn stretching and nh bending and the networks of hydrophilic interactions at rbd ace2 interfaces quench their sers signals at 1032 cm 1 and 1189 cm 1 particularly a red shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 representing nh bending was observed possibly attributing to the direct enhancement of 1182 cm 1 from sars cov 2 spike protein raman intensities of peak 1189 cm 1 of ace2 sn sers substrate 2552 163 arbitrary unit were about 2 times as those of peak 1182 cm 1 1354 76 arbitrary unit whereas the peak intensities of 1182 cm 1 430 10 arbitrary unit were higher than those of 1189 cm 1 290 11 arbitrary unit postexposure to sars cov 2 spike proteins it is possibly induced by the change in nh vibration mode or the bond length of nh rozenberg et al 2000 tomobe et al 2017 in response to the interfered h bond of ace2 after recognizing sars cov 2 spike protein in addition the intensities of both peaks 1189 cm 1 and 1182 cm 1 were positively correlated with the dosage of sars cov 2 proteins figure s2a and the 1182 1189 ratios of sers signals exhibited a positive correlation with the dosage of sars cov 2 spike proteins figure s2b in contrast there was no raman shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 in all the treatments with bacteriophage phi6 whole cells of e coli and extracted proteins of e coli cells fig 2d besides 1189 cm 1 all these treatments produced identical peaks of 1094 1161 1249 1311 and 1412 cm 1 representing typical biospectral alterations of amino acids phosphorylated proteins cellular nucleic acids fatty acids and lipids jin et al 2020 li et al 2017 these results indicated that the fabricated ace2 sn sers substrate can specifically recognize sars cov 2 spike protein and there is neglectable interference from other enveloped viruses or bacterial cells our results indicated that sars cov 2 spike protein can be recognized and bound by ace2 sn sers substrate consequently changing ace2 structure to induce the sers signal quenching such significant raman signal change demonstrated that our designed ace2 sn sers assay has a satisfactory performance in sars cov 2 interrogation either 1189 cm 1 intensity 1182 cm 1 intensity or 1182 1189 ratio could quantitatively interrogate the presence of sars cov 2 spike proteins 3 3 interrogation of sars cov 2 in real water samples from wuhan via ace2 sn sers in on site test raman spectra of ace2 acquired via the portable raman spectrometer exhibited coherent spectral peaks presented at 1032 1089 1189 1447 and 1587 cm 1 comparing to those from the research level raman spectrometer in laboratory although relatively high signal noises were observed it indicated the robustness of our developed ace2 sn sers array and feasibility for on site detection raman spectra of water samples on ace2 sn sers array exhibited different sers signals fig 3 a detailed spectral region from 1170 to 1200 cm 1 illustrated that some samples had significant signal quenching at 1189 cm 1 figure s3 e g jytcc jytcc2 jytcc3 hsscc hssbc and hn06 whereas others possessing similar spectral patterns as ace2 sn sers array included hsscd hssbd etc rt qpcr results had separated all water samples into positive and negative groups for sars cov 2 to distinguish these two groups from sers spectra we first used 1182 1189 ratio as an indicator as the red shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 was the most remarkable spectral alteration fig 3c shows a significant difference in 1182 1189 ratio between positive and negative groups p 0 001 averagely 1 311 0 446 and 0 766 0 218 respectively when 1182 1189 ratio ranges from 0 800 to 1 100 the false positive percentage slightly decreases from 20 0 to 0 0 whereas the false negative percentage increases from 0 0 to 40 0 accordingly the highest accuracy of 1182 1189 ratio is 93 33 when the threshold is 1 000 and the false positive and false negative percentage is 10 0 and 0 0 respectively figure s4a thus 1182 1189 ratio is a satisfactory indictor to detect the presence of sars cov 2 in water samples nevertheless the intrinsic sers analysis provided convoluted raman signals derived from ace2 proteins or complexes of ace2 and spike protein of sars cov 2 located in plasmonic hot spot regions and it is crucial to employ multivariate method to extract information in these complex multivariable spectroscopic data for a better interrogation herein the whole spectra from 900 to 1800 cm 1 were analyzed by pca lda and the score plot clearly segregates the positive and negative groups fig 3b ld1 derived from pca lda model provided the best classification mainly representing the shift of 1189 to 1182 cm 1 and the declining peaks at 1089 and 1447 cm 1 in addition ld2 also explained a small proportion of variance between positive and negative samples consisting of peaks at 1032 and 1587 cm 1 accordingly ld1 scores are assigned as criteria and exhibit significant difference between the positive and negative groups fig 3d p 0 001 when ld1 scores range from 0 070 to 0 120 the false positive percentage slightly increases from 0 0 to 20 0 whereas the false negative percentage decreases from 40 0 to 0 0 accordingly the highest accuracy of ld1 scores is 93 33 when the threshold is 0 080 figure s4b further analysis on the spectral region from 1170 to 1200 cm 1 figure s3 explained the potential reason for false positive and false negative measurement that some sample exhibited both shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 and considerable intensities at 1189 cm 1 it might be explained by the limited number of sars cov 2 protein in environmental samples that could not completely quench sers signals of ace2 false negative or binding of similar proteins with ace2 to raise the intensities at 1182 cm 1 false positive from the results of duplicated measurements for each sample the consistency and repeatability of this sers assay is 0 853 kendall coordination coefficient p 0 01 and 4 5 relative standard deviation rsd based on 1182 1189 ratio and 0 892 kendall coordination coefficient p 0 01 and 4 2 rsd based on ld1 scores respectively although the concept of using raman spectroscopy to detect sars cov 2 viruses has been raised by many researchers lukose et al 2021 these studies mainly focus on the detection sensitivity or substrate fabrication with artificial samples and there is no report on the detection of real environmental samples or accuracy jadhav et al 2021 peng et al 2021 our findings proved the feasibility of ace2 sn sers assay to on site interrogate sars cov 2 in real water samples and both indicators have satisfactory performance 3 4 tracking and explaining the presence of sars cov 2 in environmental water samples via on site interrogation sars cov 2 in crude water from wards of huoshenshan hospital hsscc and jinyintan hospital jytcc was 633 copies l and 255 copies l respectively showing the presence of sars cov 2 viral rna the results became negative in the biological treatment sector hssbc and aerobic biodegradation sector jytbc in the wastewater treatment plants of huoshenshan and jinyintan hospitals table 1 however both 1182 1189 ratios and ld1 scores by ace2 sn sers assay had contradictory results that sars cov 2 was present in all wastewater samples throughout in the treatment process despite of slight decay fig 4 a and 4e it might be explained by higher stability of sars cov 2 spike protein than rna after disinfection and the residual spike proteins were still detectable but the infectivity was of low risk our findings indicated a decay of sars cov 2 viral rna along wastewater treatment process consistent with previous reported facts that both rna norovirus ggi ggii sapovirus and aichi virus and dna viruses enteric adenoviruses jc polyomaviruses bk polyomaviruses were effectively removed in conventional and biological wastewater treatment plants hata et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 nordgren et al 2009 the presence of sars cov 2 in the adjusting tanks might pose threats to workers for medical wastewater treatment and their personal care protections are suggested to prevent potential infection the rapidness and easy operation of this developed ace2 sn sers assay offers a solution to monitor sars cov 2 in medical wastewater treatment plants allowing on site assessment of potential spreading risks on workers and surrounding environment disinfection completely removed sars cov 2 viral rna exhibiting negative rt qpcr and ace2 sn sers results for disinfected water hsscd hssbd and jytcd fig 4b and 4f ld1 scores by ace2 sn sers assays also suggested the existence of sars cov 2 after 1 to 3 days storage fig 4c and 4g consistent with the results of rt qpcr 750 and 3 01 103 copies l these results proved the robustness of ace2 sn sers assay in detecting sars cov 2 in real water samples offering strong evidence to document the effective disinfection performance kampf et al 2020 and long term survival for at least 3 days van doremalen et al 2020 diagnosing confirmed patients and tracking asymptomatic candidates is one of major challenges for covid 19 prevention and control in this work we collected water samples from pipeline receiving discharge from huanan seafood market a suspected first place of covid 19 outbreak in china the upstream waters had negative rt qpcr results and exhibited no sars cov 2 spike protein from clear raman shifts at 1189 cm 1 in ace2 sn sers assay fig 3a after receiving wastewater from huanan seafood market the positive rt qpcr results 2 88 104 copies l table 1 1182 1189 ratios fig 4d and ld1 scores fig 4h illustrated the entry of sars cov 2 into pipelines different from rt qpcr assay requiring rna extraction and laboratory amplification the developed ace2 sn sers assay allows onsite detection of sars cov 2 with portable raman spectrometers showing huge potentials for field practices to track the presence and source of sars cov 2 in sewage pipe network all water samples collected from yangtze and hanjiang river did not exhibited significant raman shift from1189 cm 1 to 1182 cm 1 fig 3a consistent with qpcr results table 1 these results indicated that no sars cov 2 was detectable in surface waters and its spreading risk through natural rivers are neglectable although both yangtze river and hanjiang river received treated discharge from wastewater treatment plants in wuhan which had influents containing sars cov 2 fig 4a disinfection can effectively remove viral rna fig 4b and leave limited risks of sars cov 2 spillover into natural environment the occurrence of sars cov 2 in wastewater and rivers has been reported in paris rimoldi et al 2020 and its potential transmission and spread in the urban and rural water cycle might pose threats to public health bhowmick et al 2020 for rivers or lakes receiving untreated sewage this ace2 sn sers assay might be a solution for rapidlya and online detecting sars cov 2 viral rna for drinking water safety 3 5 prospective the developed ace2 sn sers assay provides good accuracy and satisfactory performance for the rapid and onsite detection of sars cov 2 in environmental specimens meeting well with rt qpcr results compared with rt qpcr and immunochromatography assays this ace2 sn sers assay has three advantages firstly ace2 sn sers assay does not rely on rna extraction or immune biomarker simplifying the sample preparation procedure and shortening the measurement time secondly spike protein is more stable than rna as the biomarker for sars cov 2 hinting a more stable and sensitive assay particularly for environmental specimens last but not the least we have proved that portable raman spectrometers can provide satisfactory signals with ace2 sn sers assay and allows rapid interrogation of sars cov 2 on site there are some limitations in this work firstly our ace2 sn sers assay cannot evaluate viral viability or infectivity as free spike proteins or viral envelop are also recognizable by ace2 sn sers substrates to quench sers signals possibly overestimating the presence of sars cov 2 in human or environmental specimens secondly only limited real samples were tested and the interference of other viruses targeting ace2 for cell entry is still questionable owing to the restriction in sample collection and clinical tests during the outbreak of covid 19 in wuhan on the contrary the mentioned advantages prove ace2 sn sers assay as a reliable and mobile detection platform or screening system for onsite clinal and environmental detection under a variety of conditions thirdly we did not get resources to measure the effects of other viruses e g sars cov 1 or antigens of influenza virus a b and sars cov 2 targeting ace2 proteins from the interrogation mechanisms they might activate sers response and produce false positive signals for sars cov 2 detection which reduces the specificity of this sers assay instead our state of the art work also raises a concept to screen other viruses with rbd recognizing receptors of human cells for entry and evaluate the recognition strength of sars like viruses across mammalian species when different rbd containing viruses are tested or human cell receptors are functionalized for substrate fabrication as a possible in vitro assay ace2 sn sers substrate might also contribute to the assessment of vaccine efficiency further studies need to address those possibilities and establish robust databases and algorithms for a faster interrogation even down to 1 min for clinical and environmental purposes 4 conclusion a novel ace2 sn sers assay was developed in this study by functionalizing human cellular receptor ace2 proteins on silver nanorods and generating strong sers signals the successful and significant quenching of sers signal intensities in the presence of sars cov 2 spike proteins proved its capability in capturing and recognizing sars cov 2 onsite tests on 23 water samples using a portable raman spectrometer achieved satisfactory performance in interrogating the presence of sars cov 2 in environmental specimens although some inconsistent with rt qpcr results at the current stage the developed ace2 sn sers assay had acceptable accuracy false positive and false negative percentages which can be further improved by fabrication implementation database set up and algorithm optimization it has a bright future and huge potential as a rapid and on site detection tool for sars cov 2 and other viruses to confirm patients determine community cases and track environmental viral sources in pandemics declaration of competing interest the authors

since 2019 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 li et al 2020b and it has rapidly spread throughout 202 countries around the world till 19th march 2021 there have been over 125 million confirmed cases and nearly 3 million deaths globally and the number is still increasing rapidly as there is clear evidence of human to human transmission of sars cov 2 chan

sars cov 2 in human and environmental samples draws more attentions for effectively confirming covid 19 cases and identifying transmission routes zhang et al 2021 it brings urgent requirement of developing detection tools that can rapidly and specifically recognize sars cov 2 to track patients many approaches can detect sars cov 2 with high specificity e g real time reverse transcription

nucleocapsid protein cddcn envelope protein membrane protein or rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp jung et al 2020 nalla et al 2020 ong et al 2020 wang et al 2020 rna extraction from swab samples is necessary for rt qpcr and requires time consuming pretreatment normally taking more than 4 h nolan et al 2006 schmittgen and livak 2008 and bringing a barrier for rapid diagnosis of sars cov 2 alternatively colloidal gold immunochromatography is a commonly used immunoassay to detect antibodies igg or igm stimulated by antigen entry auta et al 2017 targeting the immunological markers igm and igg antibodies which are reported to increase in the blood of most patients more than a week after infection woo et al 2005 however this method is still time consuming and not feasible for detecting sars cov 2 in environmental media which do not have immunological markers amanat et al 2020 stadlbauer et al 2020 weiss et al 2020 it is of great urgency to develop a rapid reproducible cheap and sensitive assay detecting sars cov 2 especially applicable for different environmental samples raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy of ability to detect chemical bonds via photon scattering morais et al 2019 but the generated signals are extremely weak comparing to the incident beam thus surface enhanced raman scattering sers is introduced to overcome such inherent limitation and interrogate trace materials by exploiting the enormous electromagnetic field enhancement resulted from the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances at nanostructured metallic surfaces

imaging zavaleta et al 2009 and virus detection zhang et al 2011 for sars cov 2 the spike glycoprotein consists of s1 and s2 subunits and s1 subunit contains a receptor binding domain rbd directly recognizing the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 for cell entry lan et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 such recognition and binding might alter the structure of ace2 and lead to changes in raman spectra additionally the binding specificity allows ace2 as an anchor to capture sars cov 2 from human or environmental samples for interrogation in this study we proposed a capture quenching strategy to rapidly detect sars cov 2 and developed a sers assay introducing ace2 functionalized on silver nanorod sers substrates to capture and interrogate sars cov 2 spike protein fig 1 we firstly functionalized ace2 on an aligned silver nanorod sers sn sers array in oblique angle deposition to capture and interrogate sars cov 2 spike protein the induced sers signal quenching was documented by either red shift or whole spectral alterations in multivariate analysis as indicators for the presence of sars cov 2 in real environmental water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of silver nanorod sers array the aligned silver nanorod sers sn sers array was fabricated in oblique angle deposition oad using a custom designed electron beam sputtering evaporation system suzhou

performed at a base pressure lower than 3 10 4 pa the thickness of film growth was monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance firstly a thin layer of about 20 nm was deposited to assist the adhesion of silver on si wafer followed by the deposition of a base layer of 200 nm silver the glad stage was then tilt to 84 with respect to the incident vapor a layer of 80 nm was then deposited with substrate rotation at 0 1 rev s to improve the seeding for nanorod growth the deposition rate was 2 å s in each stage and lasted about 3 h 2 2 fabrication of ace2 sn sers substrate ace2 was purchased from novoprotein china and stored in borate buffer solution 0 1 m ph 7 2 at 80 c before use and the ace2 sn sers substrate was fabricated by suzhou yiqing environmental science and

quantitative fluorescent signal for each sample was normalized by rox passive reference dye provided in 2 rt pcr buffer for each rt qpcr run both positive and negative controls were included the copy numbers of sars cov 2 was obtained from a standard calibration curve by a 10 fold serial dilution of genes encoding nucleocapsid protein with an amplification efficiency of 102 6 calculated as copies 10 cq 39 086 3 262 r2 0 991 for quality control a reagent blank and extraction blank were included for rna extraction procedure and no contamination was observed 2 4 validation treatment and tests to validate the performance and specificity of ace2 sn sers substrate negative controls were prepared and included cells of escherichia coli dh5α proteins of e coli dh5α and bacteriophage phi6 cells of e coli dh5α were grown in lb medium at 37 c for 16 hr harvested by centrifugation washed three times with deionized water and finally stored at 4 c prior to test proteins of e coli dh5α cells were extracted after 16 hr cultivation using allprep bacterial protein kit qiagen usa following manufacturer s instruction and stored at 20 c prior to test bacteriophage phi 6 is an enveloped rna virus widely used for study on viral survival and persistence in environmental media whitworth et al 2020 wood et al 2020 it was purchased from dsmz german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures gmbh as vacuum dried suspensions on filter paper in double vial glass ampoules bacteriophage phil6 was carefully revitalized by a previous protocol whitworth et al 2020 harvested and purified in the suspension of sterile water and stored at 4 c prior to test sars cov 2 spike proteins were extracted and provided by school of life sciences tsinghua university following a reported protocol lan et al 2020 five microliters of stock solutions e coli dh5α cells and bacteriophage phi6 around 103 copies e coli dh5α proteins and sars cov 2 spike proteins around 10 pg and water samples were directly loaded onto the fabricated ace2 sn sers substrate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min after dryness the substrate was ready for raman spectral acquisition and can be stored at 4 c for at least 1 week a series dilution of sars cov 2 spike proteins were used to obtain the qualitative curves between raman shifts and sars cov 2 spike proteins ranging from 0 1 pg to 10 pg 2 5 raman spectral acquisition for laboratory test raman spectra were acquired using a near infrared confocal raman microscope hr evolution horiba usa equipped with a 785 nm near ir laser source a 300 l mm grating and a semiconductor cooling detector ccd all raman spectra were collected with a 50 objective lens na 0 7 at an exposure time of 10 s 3 accumulations and laser power of 10 mw prior to lens raman spectroscopic system was calibrated with a silicon wafer at raman shift of 520 cm 1 at least five random regions were measured for each sample and a minimum of 9 individual spectra were acquired per sample a 785 nm portable raman spectrometer finder edge zolix china was used for on site detection and the ace2 sn sers substrate was placed on the probe of the portable raman spectrometer with the following parameters 0 5 s acquisition time and 300 mw laser power this portable raman spectrometer has a satisfactory spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 to distinguish possible spectral shift of biological samples at least five time measurement was conducted for each sample for both laboratory and on site test all raman spectra were recorded in the range of 100 3500 cm 1 in biological triplicates on site spectra acquisition took only 2 min followed by multivariate analysis for about 3 min to allow overall test within 5 min 2 6 multivariate analysis of raman spectra raw spectral data were pre processed by using the open source irootlab toolbox performed on matlab r2012 trevisan et al 2013 briefly each acquired raman spectrum was cut to a biochemical cell fingerprint region 900 1800 cm 1 baseline corrected wavelet de noised and vector normalized unlike rt qpcr and immunochromatography assay our ace2 sn sers assay generates raman spectral data which are multivariate and difficult to generate an individual variable for sars cov 2 thus we used two approaches to distinguish the difference between positive and negative samples firstly the ratio of raman intensity at 1182 cm 1 to that at 1189 cm 1 was calculated designated as 1182 1189 ratio as an indicator for positivity prediction alternatively multivariate analysis was applied to the pre processed spectral data to reduce data dimensions and extract key information principal component analysis pca is an unsupervised data analytical method reducing the dimensionality of data determining principal components pcs and extracting key features jin et al 2017 li et al 2020a the first 10 pcs which account for more than 90 of the variance of the selected spectral regions were then inputted into linear discriminate analysis lda which determines the discriminant function line that maximizes the inter class distance and minimizes the intra class distance to derive an optimal linear boundary separating the different classes generally pca lda score plots and cluster vectors are generated and the scores of the linear discriminant 1 ld1 provides the best classification li et al 2020a 2 7 statistical analysis one way anova was used to compare the difference between samples and p value less than 0 05 refers to statistically significant difference 3 results and discussions 3 1 features of sn sers and ace2 sn sers substrates sem images fig 2 a illustrated a successful fabrication of silver nanorods on sers substrate the overall diameter and length of silver nanorods was 211 45 and 737 52 nm respectively and the uniform structure demonstrated a density of 8 nanorods μm2 after functionalization with ace2 protein clear protein structures were observed on ace2 sn sers substrate exhibiting as small islands with a diameter of 2 μm fig 2b the background raman signals of sn sers substrate without ace2 exhibited no significant peaks from 900 to 1800 cm 1 figure s1 showing a satisfactory performance for interrogating bio related sers ace2 sn sers substrate generated remarkable sers signals around 400 times stronger than sn sers substrate figure s1 the featured raman peaks are probably assigned with phenylalanine 1032 cm 1 rygula et al 2013 cn stretching in protein 1089 cm 1 chan et al 2006 amide iii for cn stretching and nh bending 1189 cm 1 malini et al 2006 ch2 bending mode of proteins 1447 cm 1 ó faoláin et al 2005 and conjugated c c in protein 1587 cm 1 rau et al 2016 3 2 sers detection of sars cov 2 spike protein sars cov 2 spike protein was firstly tested on sn sers and ace2 sn sers substrates as a proof of concept demonstration different from ace2 protein raman peak intensities derived from sars cov 2 spike protein were relatively weak on sn sers substrate and the distinct peaks were mostly located at 1032 1051 1182 1447 and 1597 cm 1 fig 2c they are probably assigned to phenylalanine 1032 cm 1 rygula et al 2013 cn stretching in protein 1051 cm 1 chan et al 2006 ch2 bending mode of proteins 1447 cm 1 ó faoláin et al 2005 after loading spike proteins onto ace2 sn sers substrate the whole spectra exhibited a quenching of sers signal intensity especially at raman shifts of 1089 1189 and 1447 cm 1 fig 2c sars cov 2 spike protein rbd targets the short β5 and β6 strands α4 and α5 helices and loops on ace2 lan et al 2020 which are rich in phenylalanine and amide iii for cn stretching and nh bending and the networks of hydrophilic interactions at rbd ace2 interfaces quench their sers signals at 1032 cm 1 and 1189 cm 1 particularly a red shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 representing nh bending was observed possibly attributing to the direct enhancement of 1182 cm 1 from sars cov 2 spike protein raman intensities of peak 1189 cm 1 of ace2 sn sers substrate 2552 163 arbitrary unit were about 2 times as those of peak 1182 cm 1 1354 76 arbitrary unit whereas the peak intensities of 1182 cm 1 430 10 arbitrary unit were higher than those of 1189 cm 1 290 11 arbitrary unit postexposure to sars cov 2 spike proteins it is possibly induced by the change in nh vibration mode or the bond length of nh rozenberg et al 2000 tomobe et al 2017 in response to the interfered h bond of ace2 after recognizing sars cov 2 spike protein in addition the intensities of both peaks 1189 cm 1 and 1182 cm 1 were positively correlated with the dosage of sars cov 2 proteins figure s2a and the 1182 1189 ratios of sers signals exhibited a positive correlation with the dosage of sars cov 2 spike proteins figure s2b in contrast there was no raman shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 in all the treatments with bacteriophage phi6 whole cells of e coli and extracted proteins of e coli cells fig 2d besides 1189 cm 1 all these treatments produced identical peaks of 1094 1161 1249 1311 and 1412 cm 1 representing typical biospectral alterations of amino acids phosphorylated proteins cellular nucleic acids fatty acids and lipids jin et al 2020 li et al 2017 these results indicated that the fabricated ace2 sn sers substrate can specifically recognize sars cov 2 spike protein and there is neglectable interference from other enveloped viruses or bacterial cells our results indicated that sars cov 2 spike protein can be recognized and bound by ace2 sn sers substrate consequently changing ace2 structure to induce the sers signal quenching such significant raman signal change demonstrated that our designed ace2 sn sers assay has a satisfactory performance in sars cov 2 interrogation either 1189 cm 1 intensity 1182 cm 1 intensity or 1182 1189 ratio could quantitatively interrogate the presence of sars cov 2 spike proteins 3 3 interrogation of sars cov 2 in real water samples from wuhan via ace2 sn sers in on site test raman spectra of ace2 acquired via the portable raman spectrometer exhibited coherent spectral peaks presented at 1032 1089 1189 1447 and 1587 cm 1 comparing to those from the research level raman spectrometer in laboratory although relatively high signal noises were observed it indicated the robustness of our developed ace2 sn sers array and feasibility for on site detection raman spectra of water samples on ace2 sn sers array exhibited different sers signals fig 3 a detailed spectral region from 1170 to 1200 cm 1 illustrated that some samples had significant signal quenching at 1189 cm 1 figure s3 e g jytcc jytcc2 jytcc3 hsscc hssbc and hn06 whereas others possessing similar spectral patterns as ace2 sn sers array included hsscd hssbd etc rt qpcr results had separated all water samples into positive and negative groups for sars cov 2 to distinguish these two groups from sers spectra we first used 1182 1189 ratio as an indicator as the red shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 was the most remarkable spectral alteration fig 3c shows a significant difference in 1182 1189 ratio between positive and negative groups p 0 001 averagely 1 311 0 446 and 0 766 0 218 respectively when 1182 1189 ratio ranges from 0 800 to 1 100 the false positive percentage slightly decreases from 20 0 to 0 0 whereas the false negative percentage increases from 0 0 to 40 0 accordingly the highest accuracy of 1182 1189 ratio is 93 33 when the threshold is 1 000 and the false positive and false negative percentage is 10 0 and 0 0 respectively figure s4a thus 1182 1189 ratio is a satisfactory indictor to detect the presence of sars cov 2 in water samples nevertheless the intrinsic sers analysis provided convoluted raman signals derived from ace2 proteins or complexes of ace2 and spike protein of sars cov 2 located in plasmonic hot spot regions and it is crucial to employ multivariate method to extract information in these complex multivariable spectroscopic data for a better interrogation herein the whole spectra from 900 to 1800 cm 1 were analyzed by pca lda and the score plot clearly segregates the positive and negative groups fig 3b ld1 derived from pca lda model provided the best classification mainly representing the shift of 1189 to 1182 cm 1 and the declining peaks at 1089 and 1447 cm 1 in addition ld2 also explained a small proportion of variance between positive and negative samples consisting of peaks at 1032 and 1587 cm 1 accordingly ld1 scores are assigned as criteria and exhibit significant difference between the positive and negative groups fig 3d p 0 001 when ld1 scores range from 0 070 to 0 120 the false positive percentage slightly increases from 0 0 to 20 0 whereas the false negative percentage decreases from 40 0 to 0 0 accordingly the highest accuracy of ld1 scores is 93 33 when the threshold is 0 080 figure s4b further analysis on the spectral region from 1170 to 1200 cm 1 figure s3 explained the potential reason for false positive and false negative measurement that some sample exhibited both shift from 1189 to 1182 cm 1 and considerable intensities at 1189 cm 1 it might be explained by the limited number of sars cov 2 protein in environmental samples that could not completely quench sers signals of ace2 false negative or binding of similar proteins with ace2 to raise the intensities at 1182 cm 1 false positive from the results of duplicated measurements for each sample the consistency and repeatability of this sers assay is 0 853 kendall coordination coefficient p 0 01 and 4 5 relative standard deviation rsd based on 1182 1189 ratio and 0 892 kendall coordination coefficient p 0 01 and 4 2 rsd based on ld1 scores respectively although the concept of using raman spectroscopy to detect sars cov 2 viruses has been raised by many researchers lukose et al 2021 these studies mainly focus on the detection sensitivity or substrate fabrication with artificial samples and there is no report on the detection of real environmental samples or accuracy jadhav et al 2021 peng et al 2021 our findings proved the feasibility of ace2 sn sers assay to on site interrogate sars cov 2 in real water samples and both indicators have satisfactory performance 3 4 tracking and explaining the presence of sars cov 2 in environmental water samples via on site interrogation sars cov 2 in crude water from wards of huoshenshan hospital hsscc and jinyintan hospital jytcc was 633 copies l and 255 copies l respectively showing the presence of sars cov 2 viral rna the results became negative in the biological treatment sector hssbc and aerobic biodegradation sector jytbc in the wastewater treatment plants of huoshenshan and jinyintan hospitals table 1 however both 1182 1189 ratios and ld1 scores by ace2 sn sers assay had contradictory results that sars cov 2 was present in all wastewater samples throughout in the treatment process despite of slight decay fig 4 a and 4e it might be explained by higher stability of sars cov 2 spike protein than rna after disinfection and the residual spike proteins were still detectable but the infectivity was of low risk our findings indicated a decay of sars cov 2 viral rna along wastewater treatment process consistent with previous reported facts that both rna norovirus ggi ggii sapovirus and aichi virus and dna viruses enteric adenoviruses jc polyomaviruses bk polyomaviruses were effectively removed in conventional and biological wastewater treatment plants hata et al 2013 kitajima et al 2014 nordgren et al 2009 the presence of sars cov 2 in the adjusting tanks might pose threats to workers for medical wastewater treatment and their personal care protections are suggested to prevent potential infection the rapidness and easy operation of this developed ace2 sn sers assay offers a solution to monitor sars cov 2 in medical wastewater treatment plants allowing on site assessment of potential spreading risks on workers and surrounding environment disinfection completely removed sars cov 2 viral rna exhibiting negative rt qpcr and ace2 sn sers results for disinfected water hsscd hssbd and jytcd fig 4b and 4f ld1 scores by ace2 sn sers assays also suggested the existence of sars cov 2 after 1 to 3 days storage fig 4c and 4g consistent with the results of rt qpcr 750 and 3 01 103 copies l these results proved the robustness of ace2 sn sers assay in detecting sars cov 2 in real water samples offering strong evidence to document the effective disinfection performance kampf et al 2020 and long term survival for at least 3 days van doremalen et al 2020 diagnosing confirmed patients and tracking asymptomatic candidates is one of major challenges for covid 19 prevention and control in this work we collected water samples from pipeline receiving discharge from huanan seafood market a suspected first place of covid 19 outbreak in china the upstream waters had negative rt qpcr results and exhibited no sars cov 2 spike protein from clear raman shifts at 1189 cm 1 in ace2 sn sers assay fig 3a after receiving wastewater from huanan seafood market the positive rt qpcr results 2 88 104 copies l table 1 1182 1189 ratios fig 4d and ld1 scores fig 4h illustrated the entry of sars cov 2 into pipelines different from rt qpcr assay requiring rna extraction and laboratory amplification the developed ace2 sn sers assay allows onsite detection of sars cov 2 with portable raman spectrometers showing huge potentials for field practices to track the presence and source of sars cov 2 in sewage pipe network all water samples collected from yangtze and hanjiang river did not exhibited significant raman shift from1189 cm 1 to 1182 cm 1 fig 3a consistent with qpcr results table 1 these results indicated that no sars cov 2 was detectable in surface waters and its spreading risk through natural rivers are neglectable although both yangtze river and hanjiang river received treated discharge from wastewater treatment plants in wuhan which had influents containing sars cov 2 fig 4a disinfection can effectively remove viral rna fig 4b and leave limited risks of sars cov 2 spillover into natural environment the occurrence of sars cov 2 in wastewater and rivers has been reported in paris rimoldi et al 2020 and its potential transmission and spread in the urban and rural water cycle might pose threats to public health bhowmick et al 2020 for rivers or lakes receiving untreated sewage this ace2 sn sers assay might be a solution for rapidlya and online detecting sars cov 2 viral rna for drinking water safety 3 5 prospective the developed ace2 sn sers assay provides good accuracy and satisfactory performance for the rapid and onsite detection of sars cov 2 in environmental specimens meeting well with rt qpcr results compared with rt qpcr and immunochromatography assays this ace2 sn sers assay has three advantages firstly ace2 sn sers assay does not rely on rna extraction or immune biomarker simplifying the sample preparation procedure and shortening the measurement time secondly spike protein is more stable than rna as the biomarker for sars cov 2 hinting a more stable and sensitive assay particularly for environmental specimens last but not the least we have proved that portable raman spectrometers can provide satisfactory signals with ace2 sn sers assay and allows rapid interrogation of sars cov 2 on site there are some limitations in this work firstly our ace2 sn sers assay cannot evaluate viral viability or infectivity as free spike proteins or viral envelop are also recognizable by ace2 sn sers substrates to quench sers signals possibly overestimating the presence of sars cov 2 in human or environmental specimens secondly only limited real samples were tested and the interference of other viruses targeting ace2 for cell entry is still questionable owing to the restriction in sample collection and clinical tests during the outbreak of covid 19 in wuhan on the contrary the mentioned advantages prove ace2 sn sers assay as a reliable and mobile detection platform or screening system for onsite clinal and environmental detection under a variety of conditions thirdly we did not get resources to measure the effects of other viruses e g sars cov 1 or antigens of influenza virus a b and sars cov 2 targeting ace2 proteins from the interrogation mechanisms they might activate sers response and produce false positive signals for sars cov 2 detection which reduces the specificity of this sers assay instead our state of the art work also raises a concept to screen other viruses with rbd recognizing receptors of human cells for entry and evaluate the recognition strength of sars like viruses across mammalian species when different rbd containing viruses are tested or human cell receptors are functionalized for substrate fabrication as a possible in vitro assay ace2 sn sers substrate might also contribute to the assessment of vaccine efficiency further studies need to address those possibilities and establish robust databases and algorithms for a faster interrogation even down to 1 min for clinical and environmental purposes 4 conclusion a novel ace2 sn sers assay was developed in this study by functionalizing human cellular receptor ace2 proteins on silver nanorods and generating strong sers signals the successful and significant quenching of sers signal intensities in the presence of sars cov 2 spike proteins proved its capability in capturing and recognizing sars cov 2 onsite tests on 23 water samples using a portable raman spectrometer achieved satisfactory performance in interrogating the presence of sars cov 2 in environmental specimens although some inconsistent with rt qpcr results at the current stage the developed ace2 sn sers assay had acceptable accuracy false positive and false negative percentages which can be further improved by fabrication implementation database set up and algorithm optimization it has a bright future and huge potential as a rapid and on site detection tool for sars cov 2 and other viruses to confirm patients determine community cases and track environmental viral sources in pandemics declaration of competing interest the authors
