sulfate reduction is more likely to occur when both sulfate and sulfur are available sludge was taken out from the sulfidogenic bioreactor for batch tests after the long term tests before the batch

results 3 1 sulfidogenic bioreactor performance the sulfidogenic bioreactor was continuously operated for 169 days which was divided into two phases in phase i days 0 64 aimed at cultivating sulfur reducers 565 103 mg s l sulfide were produced within the cycle time of 6 h while 94 10 of the influent organic matter was removed fig 1 a and b based on the actual hrt 12 h in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the sulfide production rate in the absence of sulfate and mn2 was calculated to be 47 9 mg s l h indicating that high rate sulfide production was achieved in addition no sulfate and thiosulfate were generated in the phase i in phase ii days 65 169 in addition to elemental sulfur and organic matter synthetic pretreated amd containing 1300 mg s l sulfate and 25 mg l mn2 was also provided the sulfide production rate was 53 10 mg s l h 635 119 mg s l fig 1b organic matter was also efficiently removed 94 8 these results show that the sulfide production rates were similar between phase i and phase ii surprisingly only 0 8 of the influent sulfate average 10 mg s l were reduced in phase ii contributing to 1 5 to the sulfide production contrary to our expectation that sulfate would be more favorable for sulfide formation than sulfur owing to its higher solubility and bioavailability the c s mg oxidized organic carbon mg produced sulfide ratio was measured to be 0 26 0 05 mg c mg s in phase i similar to that in phase ii 0 25 0 07 mg c mg s fig 1c during a typical cycle on day 169 the concentration of dissolved zero valent sulfur was 11 0 1 5 mg s l in the presence of organic matter when organic matter was completely depleted the concentration of dissolved zero valent sulfur rose sharply to 54 3 mg s l fig s3 which is far higher than the solubility of elemental sulfur additionally on average 70 of the influent mn2 was immobilized in the sludge of the sulfidogenic bioreactor fig s4 3 2 microbial community structure and taxonomic identification the sludge samples in the bioreactor at different time points days 64 97 113 and 169 were analyzed to investigate the influences of sulfate and mn2 on the microbial community the diversity of the microbial community was sufficiently represented by the sequencing depth of the sludge samples with rarefaction analysis based on otus at 3 dissimilarity fig s5 pcoa based on unweighted unifrac shows the β diversity of the microbial community on different dates fig 2 revealing a clear separation in the microbial community structures between day 64 days 97 and 113 and day 169 the present result suggests that the microbial community structures were shaped after receiving sulfate and mn2 from the pretreated amd the sludge taken on day 64 was the representative of cultivated sulfur reducers before sulfate and mn2 were added day 65 the bacterial community was predominated by seven phyla constituting 98 5 of the community fig s6 bacteroidetes 22 9 proteobacteria 24 2 tm7 25 2 firmicutes 14 0 chloroflexi 8 1 spirochaetes 2 5 and synergistetes 1 5 at the end of the experiment proteobacteria and spirochaetes increased significantly to 64 4 and 7 3 by day 169 respectively fig s6 however bacteroidetes firmicutes and chloroflexi gradually decreased to 17 5 and 4 2 respectively fig s6 the abundance of synergistetes rose to 8 5 by day 97 before falling to 0 7 by day 169 the bacterial genera also exhibited different evolution patterns as shown in fig 3 paludibacter t78 and trichococcus were the main fermentation genera during the experiment seven sulfidogenic genera namely clostridium desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio geobacter sulfurospirillum and pseudomonas were identified in the sulfidogenic bioreactor fig 3 after 105 days of cultivation with the addition of sulfate and mn2 geobacter and desulfomicrobium became the dominant sulfidogenic bacteria and their abundances gradually increased from 1 9 to 3 0 and 3 0 to 10 6 respectively furthermore the obligate sulfur reducer sulfurospirillum sharply decreased from 16 1 on day 64 to 0 1 on day 169 as for the genera clostridium desulfobulbus desulfovibrioand pseudomonas their relative abundances were always below 1 in phase ii and fell further to 0 1 by day 169 3 3 sulfur reducers preferred electron acceptors as sulfate was barely reduced and the facultative sulfate reducing bacterium desulfomicrobium predominated in the bioreactor a question arises as to what the sulfidogenic bacteria prefer to use as the electron acceptors sulfate or sulfur when sulfate and sulfur are both available the results of batch tests show that the net sulfide production was 342 mg s l on average when 40 mg s l sulfide were added at the start of the batch test and sulfate was barely reduced in the batch test fig 4 however the amount of sulfide produced in the control test with the addition of fe2 was significantly lower than that in the batch test with the addition of sulfide average 64 mg s l sulfide avs were produced while 54 mg s l sulfate were reduced in the absence of thiosulfate in this control test it can be calculated that sulfate reduction contributed to 85 of the sulfide production in the control test these results indicate that the sulfidogenic bacteria preferred sulfur to sulfate when dissolved sulfide was present in the sulfidogenic bioreactor 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of realizing a sulfur reducing bsp process in a laboratory scale sulfidogenic bioreactor under sulfate rich conditions high rate sulfide production was observed in the bioreactor and the concentration of sulfate in the influent was nearly the same as that in the effluent when both sulfate and sulfur were available in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the negligible reduction of sulfate indicates that the sulfidogenic bacteria preferred to utilize elemental sulfur contrary to our expectation the similar c s ratios in phase i and phase ii were close to the theoretical c s level 0 19 of the sulfur reduction process we can calculate that 73 and 76 of oxidized organics were through sulfur reduction in the phase i and ii respectively indicating that sulfur reducers always prevailed in the bioreactor and the high levels of sulfate and mn2 in the influent did not affect the performance of the sulfidogenic bioreactor the high rate sulfur reduction could be explained by the role of polysulfide in sulfur reduction polysulfide is abiotically formed from reaction between sulfide and sulfur roman et al 2014 and can be reduced to sulfide by sulfur reducers and some srb boyd and druschel 2013 florentino et al 2016 the presence of hs and elemental sulfur in the sulfidogenic bioreactor created suitable conditions for polysulfide formation under nearly neutral ph fig s7 polysulfide was always present in the bioreactor and its concentration increased sharply after the depletion of organic matter fig s3 this suggests that polysulfide could be formed and be consumed simultaneously and polysulfide accumulated only after polysulfide consumption aborted batch tests further validated that the high rate sulfur reduction was achieved via polysulfide formation and reduction in the presence of sulfide sulfate was barely reduced and sulfide production was mainly attributed to sulfur reduction fig 4 however when polysulfide generation was prevented by fe2 addition the majority of sulfide came from sulfate reduction regarding microbial community analysis in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the fermentation genera paludibacter and trichococcus can decompose complex organic compounds into simple organics for the growth of sulfidogenic bacteria which are frequently found in sulfide laden wastewater hao et al 2013 montoya et al 2013 sánchez andrea et al 2013 fan et al 2015 reported that t78 was an uncultured genus affiliated with anaerolineaceae which was described to be a saccharolytic bacterium the genus t78 has also been reported in other sulfidogenic bioreactors qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 seven sulfur reducing genera including obligate sulfur reducers and facultative srb were identified in the sulfidogenic bioreactor based on the ecophysiology of sulfur reducers approximately 69 sulfur reducing genera within nine phyla in the bacteria domain have been identified to date florentino et al 2016 among the seven sulfur reducing genera desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio geobacter sulfurospirillum and pseudomonas carry the genes encoding polysulfide reductase sorokin et al 2016 florentino et al 2016 this finding supports our speculation that sulfur reducers that can reduce polysulfide can be selectively enriched this evidence also partially supports the high rate sulfur reduction via polysulfide achieved in the sulfidogenic bioreactor desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium and desulfovibrio are also srb hao et al 2014 the facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium replaced sulfurospirillum to become the predominant sulfidogenic bacterium at the end of the experiment indicating that the obligate sulfur reducer sulfurospirillum may not be able to adapt to high strength sulfate conditions the negligible sulfate reduction in the sulfidogenic bioreactor implies that with sufficient polysulfide desulfomicrobium may prefer to use polysulfide rather than sulfate as the electron acceptors however in the absence of polysulfide the sulfur reduction rate dramatically decreased and desulfomicrobium used sulfate as the electron acceptors instead as shown in fig 4 sorokin et al 2010 found that sulfur reduction via polysulfide formation is more favorable than sulfate reduction under haloalkaline conditions in soda lakes containing sulfide however to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to demonstrate the preference of sulfur reduction due to polysulfide formation over sulfate reduction in a sulfidogenic bioreactor for amd treatment under neutral conditions it may be because sulfate can only be reduced after the activation of sulfate by atp consumption in contrast polysulfide reduction can occur without atp loss poser et al 2013 we thus propose a conceptual model of sulfate and sulfur reduction in the presence or absence of sulfide fig 5 in the absence of sulfide sulfide production mainly occurs via sulfate reduction once sulfide is available in the system polysulfide naturally forms through the reaction between elemental sulfur and hs as the concentration of hs increases more polysulfide is generated which stimulates indirect sulfur reduction once the concentration of hs exceeds a certain level indirect sulfur reduction via polysulfide becomes the main process for high rate sulfide production and sulfate reduction halts almost completely this conceptual model is also supported by the literature blumentals et al 1990 liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the above findings suggest that a sulfur reducing bsp process can be used for economical and high rate sulfide production to treat metal laden wastewater even when the influent contains a high level of sulfate however the high metal concentrations and low ph in raw metal laden wastewater would prevent polysulfide formation and suppress sulfur reduction this means that direct contact of raw metal laden wastewater and sulfur reducers may be problematic a two phase system consisting of metal precipitators and a posterior sulfidogenic bioreactor see fig s1 would be an appropriate solution for high rate sulfide generation and efficient metal laden wastewater treatment in addition compared to a typical sulfate reducing bsp process see fig s1 in which alkalinity is produced sulfur reduction process needs more alkali solution addition as this process produces protons derived from eqs 1 and 2 sulfur reduction theoretically needs 2 75 mol naoh more than sulfate reduction for neutralizing the ph of amd when one mol sulfide is generated thus the cost effective of sulfur reducing bsp process merits further investigation 5 conclusions the long term performance of the sulfur reducing bsp process has been demonstrated in a laboratory scale sulfidogenic bioreactor receiving organic matter elemental sulfur and high strength sulfate wastewater taking pretreated amd as an example the main findings are stable and high rate sulfur reduction was observed in the sulfidogenic bioreactor even with 1300 mg s l sulfate in the influent the sulfide production rate was 53 10 mg s l h in the bioreactor phase ii and 98 5 of the sulfide was produced from sulfur reduction sulfate was barely consumed in the bioreactor desulfomicrobium replaced sulfurospirillum and became the predominant sulfidogenic bacterium after high levels of sulfate were introduced into the sulfidogenic bioreactor polysulfide was present in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the sulfidogenic bacteria in the bioreactor utilized polysulfide instead of sulfate as the electron acceptors therefore the sulfur reducing bsp process could serve as a promising and attractive alternative for treating mining and metallurgic wastewater and merits further study acknowledgments the authors acknowledge support from the national

makes it difficult to determine the aggregate concentration of polysulfide in contrast zero valent sulfur atoms in polysulfide ions also called dissolved zero valent sulfur s0 in sn 2 can be analyzed using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv 6000pc metash shanghai china operating at a wavelength of 285 nm after filtration millipore 0 22 μm kleinjan et al 2005 thus dissolved zero valent

results 3 1 sulfidogenic bioreactor performance the sulfidogenic bioreactor was continuously operated for 169 days which was divided into two phases in phase i days 0 64 aimed at cultivating sulfur reducers 565 103 mg s l sulfide were produced within the cycle time of 6 h while 94 10 of the influent organic matter was removed fig 1 a and b based on the actual hrt 12 h in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the sulfide production rate in the absence of sulfate and mn2 was calculated to be 47 9 mg s l h indicating that high rate sulfide production was achieved in addition no sulfate and thiosulfate were generated in the phase i in phase ii days 65 169 in addition to elemental sulfur and organic matter synthetic pretreated amd containing 1300 mg s l sulfate and 25 mg l mn2 was also provided the sulfide production rate was 53 10 mg s l h 635 119 mg s l fig 1b organic matter was also efficiently removed 94 8 these results show that the sulfide production rates were similar between phase i and phase ii surprisingly only 0 8 of the influent sulfate average 10 mg s l were reduced in phase ii contributing to 1 5 to the sulfide production contrary to our expectation that sulfate would be more favorable for sulfide formation than sulfur owing to its higher solubility and bioavailability the c s mg oxidized organic carbon mg produced sulfide ratio was measured to be 0 26 0 05 mg c mg s in phase i similar to that in phase ii 0 25 0 07 mg c mg s fig 1c during a typical cycle on day 169 the concentration of dissolved zero valent sulfur was 11 0 1 5 mg s l in the presence of organic matter when organic matter was completely depleted the concentration of dissolved zero valent sulfur rose sharply to 54 3 mg s l fig s3 which is far higher than the solubility of elemental sulfur additionally on average 70 of the influent mn2 was immobilized in the sludge of the sulfidogenic bioreactor fig s4 3 2 microbial community structure and taxonomic identification the sludge samples in the bioreactor at different time points days 64 97 113 and 169 were analyzed to investigate the influences of sulfate and mn2 on the microbial community the diversity of the microbial community was sufficiently represented by the sequencing depth of the sludge samples with rarefaction analysis based on otus at 3 dissimilarity fig s5 pcoa based on unweighted unifrac shows the β diversity of the microbial community on different dates fig 2 revealing a clear separation in the microbial community structures between day 64 days 97 and 113 and day 169 the present result suggests that the microbial community structures were shaped after receiving sulfate and mn2 from the pretreated amd the sludge taken on day 64 was the representative of cultivated sulfur reducers before sulfate and mn2 were added day 65 the bacterial community was predominated by seven phyla constituting 98 5 of the community fig s6 bacteroidetes 22 9 proteobacteria 24 2 tm7 25 2 firmicutes 14 0 chloroflexi 8 1 spirochaetes 2 5 and synergistetes 1 5 at the end of the experiment proteobacteria and spirochaetes increased significantly to 64 4 and 7 3 by day 169 respectively fig s6 however bacteroidetes firmicutes and chloroflexi gradually decreased to 17 5 and 4 2 respectively fig s6 the abundance of synergistetes rose to 8 5 by day 97 before falling to 0 7 by day 169 the bacterial genera also exhibited different evolution patterns as shown in fig 3 paludibacter t78 and trichococcus were the main fermentation genera during the experiment seven sulfidogenic genera namely clostridium desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio geobacter sulfurospirillum and pseudomonas were identified in the sulfidogenic bioreactor fig 3 after 105 days of cultivation with the addition of sulfate and mn2 geobacter and desulfomicrobium became the dominant sulfidogenic bacteria and their abundances gradually increased from 1 9 to 3 0 and 3 0 to 10 6 respectively furthermore the obligate sulfur reducer sulfurospirillum sharply decreased from 16 1 on day 64 to 0 1 on day 169 as for the genera clostridium desulfobulbus desulfovibrioand pseudomonas their relative abundances were always below 1 in phase ii and fell further to 0 1 by day 169 3 3 sulfur reducers preferred electron acceptors as sulfate was barely reduced and the facultative sulfate reducing bacterium desulfomicrobium predominated in the bioreactor a question arises as to what the sulfidogenic bacteria prefer to use as the electron acceptors sulfate or sulfur when sulfate and sulfur are both available the results of batch tests show that the net sulfide production was 342 mg s l on average when 40 mg s l sulfide were added at the start of the batch test and sulfate was barely reduced in the batch test fig 4 however the amount of sulfide produced in the control test with the addition of fe2 was significantly lower than that in the batch test with the addition of sulfide average 64 mg s l sulfide avs were produced while 54 mg s l sulfate were reduced in the absence of thiosulfate in this control test it can be calculated that sulfate reduction contributed to 85 of the sulfide production in the control test these results indicate that the sulfidogenic bacteria preferred sulfur to sulfate when dissolved sulfide was present in the sulfidogenic bioreactor 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated the feasibility of realizing a sulfur reducing bsp process in a laboratory scale sulfidogenic bioreactor under sulfate rich conditions high rate sulfide production was observed in the bioreactor and the concentration of sulfate in the influent was nearly the same as that in the effluent when both sulfate and sulfur were available in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the negligible reduction of sulfate indicates that the sulfidogenic bacteria preferred to utilize elemental sulfur contrary to our expectation the similar c s ratios in phase i and phase ii were close to the theoretical c s level 0 19 of the sulfur reduction process we can calculate that 73 and 76 of oxidized organics were through sulfur reduction in the phase i and ii respectively indicating that sulfur reducers always prevailed in the bioreactor and the high levels of sulfate and mn2 in the influent did not affect the performance of the sulfidogenic bioreactor the high rate sulfur reduction could be explained by the role of polysulfide in sulfur reduction polysulfide is abiotically formed from reaction between sulfide and sulfur roman et al 2014 and can be reduced to sulfide by sulfur reducers and some srb boyd and druschel 2013 florentino et al 2016 the presence of hs and elemental sulfur in the sulfidogenic bioreactor created suitable conditions for polysulfide formation under nearly neutral ph fig s7 polysulfide was always present in the bioreactor and its concentration increased sharply after the depletion of organic matter fig s3 this suggests that polysulfide could be formed and be consumed simultaneously and polysulfide accumulated only after polysulfide consumption aborted batch tests further validated that the high rate sulfur reduction was achieved via polysulfide formation and reduction in the presence of sulfide sulfate was barely reduced and sulfide production was mainly attributed to sulfur reduction fig 4 however when polysulfide generation was prevented by fe2 addition the majority of sulfide came from sulfate reduction regarding microbial community analysis in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the fermentation genera paludibacter and trichococcus can decompose complex organic compounds into simple organics for the growth of sulfidogenic bacteria which are frequently found in sulfide laden wastewater hao et al 2013 montoya et al 2013 sánchez andrea et al 2013 fan et al 2015 reported that t78 was an uncultured genus affiliated with anaerolineaceae which was described to be a saccharolytic bacterium the genus t78 has also been reported in other sulfidogenic bioreactors qiu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 seven sulfur reducing genera including obligate sulfur reducers and facultative srb were identified in the sulfidogenic bioreactor based on the ecophysiology of sulfur reducers approximately 69 sulfur reducing genera within nine phyla in the bacteria domain have been identified to date florentino et al 2016 among the seven sulfur reducing genera desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio geobacter sulfurospirillum and pseudomonas carry the genes encoding polysulfide reductase sorokin et al 2016 florentino et al 2016 this finding supports our speculation that sulfur reducers that can reduce polysulfide can be selectively enriched this evidence also partially supports the high rate sulfur reduction via polysulfide achieved in the sulfidogenic bioreactor desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium and desulfovibrio are also srb hao et al 2014 the facultative sulfur reducer desulfomicrobium replaced sulfurospirillum to become the predominant sulfidogenic bacterium at the end of the experiment indicating that the obligate sulfur reducer sulfurospirillum may not be able to adapt to high strength sulfate conditions the negligible sulfate reduction in the sulfidogenic bioreactor implies that with sufficient polysulfide desulfomicrobium may prefer to use polysulfide rather than sulfate as the electron acceptors however in the absence of polysulfide the sulfur reduction rate dramatically decreased and desulfomicrobium used sulfate as the electron acceptors instead as shown in fig 4 sorokin et al 2010 found that sulfur reduction via polysulfide formation is more favorable than sulfate reduction under haloalkaline conditions in soda lakes containing sulfide however to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to demonstrate the preference of sulfur reduction due to polysulfide formation over sulfate reduction in a sulfidogenic bioreactor for amd treatment under neutral conditions it may be because sulfate can only be reduced after the activation of sulfate by atp consumption in contrast polysulfide reduction can occur without atp loss poser et al 2013 we thus propose a conceptual model of sulfate and sulfur reduction in the presence or absence of sulfide fig 5 in the absence of sulfide sulfide production mainly occurs via sulfate reduction once sulfide is available in the system polysulfide naturally forms through the reaction between elemental sulfur and hs as the concentration of hs increases more polysulfide is generated which stimulates indirect sulfur reduction once the concentration of hs exceeds a certain level indirect sulfur reduction via polysulfide becomes the main process for high rate sulfide production and sulfate reduction halts almost completely this conceptual model is also supported by the literature blumentals et al 1990 liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the above findings suggest that a sulfur reducing bsp process can be used for economical and high rate sulfide production to treat metal laden wastewater even when the influent contains a high level of sulfate however the high metal concentrations and low ph in raw metal laden wastewater would prevent polysulfide formation and suppress sulfur reduction this means that direct contact of raw metal laden wastewater and sulfur reducers may be problematic a two phase system consisting of metal precipitators and a posterior sulfidogenic bioreactor see fig s1 would be an appropriate solution for high rate sulfide generation and efficient metal laden wastewater treatment in addition compared to a typical sulfate reducing bsp process see fig s1 in which alkalinity is produced sulfur reduction process needs more alkali solution addition as this process produces protons derived from eqs 1 and 2 sulfur reduction theoretically needs 2 75 mol naoh more than sulfate reduction for neutralizing the ph of amd when one mol sulfide is generated thus the cost effective of sulfur reducing bsp process merits further investigation 5 conclusions the long term performance of the sulfur reducing bsp process has been demonstrated in a laboratory scale sulfidogenic bioreactor receiving organic matter elemental sulfur and high strength sulfate wastewater taking pretreated amd as an example the main findings are stable and high rate sulfur reduction was observed in the sulfidogenic bioreactor even with 1300 mg s l sulfate in the influent the sulfide production rate was 53 10 mg s l h in the bioreactor phase ii and 98 5 of the sulfide was produced from sulfur reduction sulfate was barely consumed in the bioreactor desulfomicrobium replaced sulfurospirillum and became the predominant sulfidogenic bacterium after high levels of sulfate were introduced into the sulfidogenic bioreactor polysulfide was present in the sulfidogenic bioreactor the sulfidogenic bacteria in the bioreactor utilized polysulfide instead of sulfate as the electron acceptors therefore the sulfur reducing bsp process could serve as a promising and attractive alternative for treating mining and metallurgic wastewater and merits further study acknowledgments the authors acknowledge support from the national

concern to the public due to the indiscriminate disposal of wastewater containing heavy metals for example heavy metals especially cadmium cd2 and lead pb2 in the rivers and lakes in southwestern china probably result in potential health risk due to its high toxicity to living organisms insusceptibility and non biodegradable liu et al 2015 adsorption is deemed as the most effective techniques to remove heavy metals in wastewater ali 2012 zhou et al 2016a huang et al 2013 uddin 2017 peter et al 2017 efficient cleanup of heavy metals by adsorbents such as ion exchange polymers carbon nanotubes activated carbon and nanoparticles have been extensively investigated fu and wang 2011 santhosh et al 2016 chitpong and husson 2017 peter et al 2017 ihsanullah et al 2016 the adsorption process can be described as a successive process of metal ion diffusion through boundary layer intraparticle diffusion and metal ions adsorption onto the adsorbent surface lai et al 2016 compact granular adsorbents are strongly limited by the low diffusion of metal ions into small pore causing a slow adsorption rate for example the equilibrium time required at least 5 h for activated carbon maneerung et al 2016 in addition granular adsorbents are prone to loss its adsorption ability due to blocking and burial of surface sorption sites dou et al 2013 in contrast nano adsorbents possess fast adsorption but the small size leads to the difficulties in separation ali 2012 furthermore the inefficient separation of nano adsorbents could result in the increase of operation cost and potential threats to natural environment which greatly limits their practical applications shen et al 2015 the low cost and high performance high adsorption capacity fast kinetics and good reusability

to extensive application recently double network dn hydrogels have been developed for tough machine field yang et al 2016 sun et al 2012 wallace et al 2013 in addition the dn hydrogels still remain high water permeability hence these unique properties of dn hydrogels motivate us to exploit this kind of materials as adsorbents through introducing functional groups in this study a double network

100 mesh was prepared from jute plant including leaf and limb provided by institute of bast fiber crops chinese academy of agricultural sciences acrylic acid aa ammonium persulfate aps and n n methylenebisacrylamide mba were purchased from commercial sources and used as received the industrial melting effluent was taken from shuikoushan smelting plant located in hengyang hunan province china all aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 jute paa gel synthesis jute paa gel was synthesized by a one pot method first jute powder was dissolved in 0 5 m naoh aqueous solution and then the solution was adjusted to neutral with 0 5 m hcl to obtain a 20 wt jute aqueous solution 4 ml of 20 wt jute aqueous solution 0 8 ml 11 7 mmol aa 0 25 mol aps initiator and 1 5 mol

gel scheme 1 then the obtained jute paa gel was washed with deionized water to remove unreacted reagents according to the price of raw materials the cost of the dry jute paa gel is approximately us 1

point of zero charge phpzc of jute paa gel was measured by δph drift method in a series of 0 01 m nacl at different ph avetta et al 2015 swelling experiment was performed in deionized water and the swollen weight of the gel was recorded until swelling equilibrium was reached the swelling ratio sr was calculated as sr w s w d w d where w s and w d represent the weights of swollen gel and corresponding dried gel respectively 2 4 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments on jute paa gel or jute 1 g of dry gel l they were soaked in water for 4 h before use were carried out in synthetic heavy metal wastewater with preselected concentrations nitrates mg2 ca2 k na cu2 zn2 and mn2 were added as background components in synthetic heavy metal wastewater the batch adsorption experiments on jute paa gel 1 4 g of dry gel l were also carried out in practical melting effluent the practical melting effluent contains 3 825 6 075 9 325 188 6 17 05 0 25 9 75 40 03 31 34 and 389 2 mg l of pb cd cu zn mn cr fe k mg and ca respectively because it is difficult to make sure the valence of these elements only the contents were determined the ph values of the solution

absorption spectrometer aas hitachi z 2000 japan for the regeneration study the metal adsorbed hydrogel was eluted with 0 1 m hcl solution 12 m hcl was diluted 120 times with deionized water then regenerated with 0 1 m naoh solution and washed with deionized water to neutral the detailed experimental conditions were listed in the captions of figures for different experiments 2 5 data analysis

than 5 2 6 fixed bed column adsorption experimental the actual melting effluent was treated by jute paa sorbent using two columns in series the ph of the effluent was adjusted to 5 0 the column parameters are summarized in table s1 in every cycle when the adsorption capacity of the first column reached to 1 breakthrough the column was transferred and regenerated with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solution and the second column was shifted forward as the first column and a pare column was used as the second column in next cycle in this way the two columns in every cycle assured the highest available adsorption capacity in the continuous processing loop 3 results and discussion 3 1 jute paa gel characterization the jute paa gel was freeze dried to yield porous aerogel fig 1 a the blocky structure is available for separation and reusability inset fig 1a the functional groups in the porous sorbent can be fully exposed to metal ions in the ir spectra jute paa contained the characteristic functional groups of carbonyl at 1720 cm 1 and amino or hydroxyl at 3200 3600 cm 1 from paa and jute fig 1b the high resolution xps results of the samples confirm the existence of oxygen and amino containing functional groups figs s1a d presenting higher content of functional groups in jute paa than those in jute table s2 the jute paa gel exhibited extraordinary mechanical properties fig 1c the hydrogel was pliable and tough withstanding high level deformations of compression without any observable damage the outstanding ductility of the jute paa gel roots from the high elasticity of the cross linking between paa chains and cellulose molecules by covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds in addition the jute paa gel displayed excellent stability in water because the supramolecular structure the swelling ratio value of this gel was about 3 85 in water until reaching equilibrium at around 12 h fig 1d which contained about 80 wt of water at equilibrium state thus the high porosity and high water permeability could provide a fast channel for metal ion diffusion from solution into hydrogel the tga and dtg results display that thermal degradation of jute paa gel occurred at above 200 c indicating a good thermostability fig s1e 3 2 selective adsorption the selective adsorption experiment is necessary to evaluate the adsorption ability to remove targeted heavy metals because the main heavy metal ions in the practical melting effluent tested in this study are pb2 cd2 cu2 zn2 and mn2 the selective adsorption among them was conducted fig 2 shows the selective sorption of these bivalent heavy metal ions with the initial concentration of 100 mg l onto jute paa gel the pb2 and cd2 ions were preferentially adsorbed with about 97 and 89 sorption efficiency respectively the sorption efficiency is in the order of pb2 cd2 cu2 zn2 mn2 the adsorption selectivity may be caused by the difference of electronegativity 2 2 for pb2 1 69 for cd2 1 90 for cu2 1 65 for zn2 and 1 55 for mn2 and mass to charge 103 for pb2 56 for cd2 32 for cu2 33 for zn2 and 27 for mn2 of metal ions resulting in the difference of chelation ability with functional groups hadi et al 2013 the selective adsorption towards pb2 and cd2 is exactly needed to treat the targeted melting effluent with potential health risk from toxic pb2 and cd2 liu et al 2015 therefore the pb2 and cd2 adsorption behavior on jute paa gel adsorbent was systematically investigated 3 3 effect of environmental conditions because the jute paa gel showed a selective adsorption towards cd2 and pb2 the effect of environmental conditions on the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 was investigated the common species in aquatic systems such as alkali metals na and k alkaline earth metals mg2 and ca2 and humic acid ha would compete with adsorbates at sorption sites of adsorbents tan et al 2015 all the species were used in different concentrations 0 0 01 and 0 1 m and the initial concentration of cd2 and pb2 were set at 400 mg l 0 0035 m for cd and 0 002 m for pb as shown in fig 3 a and b the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 reached up to 90 and 96 respectively in the presence of 0 01 m na k and ha when the concentrations of na k and ha increased to 0 1 m 28 5 and 50 times higher than cd and pb respectively the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 decreased by 8 15 in contrast ca2 and mg2 ions 0 1 m was 28 6 and 50 times higher than cd2 and pb2 respectively showed significant influence on the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 especially cd2 the influence of ionic species followed the sequence mg2 ca2 k na probably due to the difference in electronegativity hadi et al 2013 the decreased adsorption efficiency could result from the competition and electrostatic repulsion among metal ions and from the lowered activity coefficient of cd2 and pb2 at a high ionic strength yang and jiang 2014 the ph can influence the chemical speciation of heavy metal ions and the surface chemistry of adsorbents zhou et al 2016a and b as shown in fig 3c and d the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 onto jute and jute paa gel at ph 1 5 were negligible the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 on jute increased slowly with increasing ph and finally retained about 82 and 91 at ph above 6 respectively in contrast the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel sharply increased to nearly 100 at ph 3 indicating that the adsorption desorption of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa could be facilely achieved by adjusting solution ph the ph of bulk solution precipitation phbsp for cd2 and pb2 with initial concentration of 40 mg l was 8 57 and 6 04 respectively and no precipitation occurred at ph below phbsp therefore the adsorption on jute paa could be well conducted in a wide ph range of 3 8 for cd2 or 3 to 6 for pb2 at a high concentration of 40 mg l the point of zero charge phpzc of jute paa gel was 7 4 fig s1f at ph phpzc the surface of adsorbents is positively charged which is unfavorable for adsorption process due to the electrostatic repulsion towards positively charged metal ions however the adsorption capacity of jute paa gel was very high at a low ph 3 below phpzc 7 4 indicating that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel was dominated by chemical rather than electrostatic interactions 3 4 adsorption kinetics rapid adsorption of adsorbates is highly demanded for adsorbents in practical application especially in running wastewater treatment the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel and jute as a function of contact time was studied c0 40 mg l adsorbent dosage 1 g l fig 4 the sorption equilibrium time of cd2 and pb2 on jute required at least 120 min with removal efficiencies of 75 for cd2 and 89 for pb2 in contrast only 10 min was required to reach equilibrium on jute paa gel with almost 100 removal efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 the fast adsorption should be attributed to the porous double network structure and high permeability of jute paa gel which accelerate the intraparticle diffusion of metal ions the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were used to analyze the sorption rate based on equilibrium time data the relative parameters calculated from the two models were listed in table s3 for the dada of jute paa gel the correlation coefficients r2 0 9873 for pb2 and 0 9968 for cd2 of the pseudo first order model were larger than 0 9083 for pb2 and 0 9446 for cd2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating that there are enough adsorption sites on jute paa for adsorbing cd2 and pb2 repo et al 2013 in contrast for the data of jute correlation coefficients r2 0 9137 for pb2 and 0 9569 for cd2 of the pseudo first order model were smaller than 0 9851 for pb2 and 0 9943 for cd2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model indicative of limited adsorption sites on jute the pseudo first and second order kinetics can describe the data as a generalized rate controlling step but they cannot provide a comprehensive view of adsorption as a series of distinct steps when metal ions enter adsorbents from solution pore and intraparticle diffusion are often rate limiting martínez cabanas et al 2016 the intraparticle diffusion had three different linear zones over the whole time range fig s2 the plots of equilibrium adsorption capacity q e vs t 0 5 of jute crossed the origin fig s2a indicating that the intraparticle diffusion was limited liu et al 2013 in contrast the plots of jute paa gel did not pass through the origin fig s2b indicative of a fast intraparticle diffusion zarghami et al 2016 3 5 isotherm studies and modeling the adsorption isotherms of jute paa gel at different temperatures are presented in fig 5 the adsorption capacity increased with increasing temperature and initial concentrations both langmuir and freundlich isotherms were used to describe the adsorption behavior of cd2 and pb2 and their corresponding parameters are listed in table 1 for jute paa gel the correlation coefficient r2 0 9742 for the langmuir model was higher than that for the freundlich model r2 0 9470 indicating the monolayer adsorption of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel jiang et al 2014 it is believed that intraparticle diffusion on granular adsorbents does not meet langmuir model maneerung et al 2016 in fact jute paa gel showed a fast intraparticle diffusion fig s2b this indicates that the internal adsorption sites of jute paa gel were in similar environment with those on the surface of jute paa gel due to the high water content 80 wt which presented a fast channel for metal ions accessible to internal adsorption sites so the adsorption behavior of cd2 and pb2 over jute paa gel well met the langmuir model the maximal theoretical adsorption capacities qmax of jute paa gel reached as high as 401 7 mg g for cd2 and 542 9 mg g for pb2 respectively which much higher than those on jute 62 5 mg g for cd2 and 77 1 mg g for pb2 fig s3 they are ones of the highest adsorption capacities for cd2 and pb2 on adsorbents reported so far wang et al 2016 ling et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 thermodynamic parameters standard gibbs free energy δg standard enthalpy δh and standard entropy δs of adsorption process were calculated according to van t hoff equation table s4 the negative values of δg and positive values of δh mean spontaneous and endothermic adsorption processes during cd2 and pb2 adsorption on jute paa gel the positive value of δs implies an increase in the disorderness of the solid solution system xie et al 2014 according to the dubinin radushkevish d r isotherm analysis fig s4 the calculated free energy e were 10 51 and 11 44 kj mol for cd2 and pb2 adsorption respectively which are in the energy range of a chemical sorption process 8 16 kj mol phetphaisit et al 2016 3 6 adsorption mechanism due to the relatively higher concentration of cd2 than other heavy metals in the melting wastewater the adsorption mechanism of cd2 on jute paa gel was examined from what was discussed above a preliminary conclusion could be inferred that the adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption as shown in the ftir spectra fig 6 a the peak of o h stretching vibration at about 3500 cm 1 significantly increased after cd2 adsorption due to the electron drawing effect of positive charged cd2 resulting in a stronger stretching vibration chen and chen 2015 the results suggest that chemical interactions occurred between cd2 and oxygen containing groups on jute paa gel the results were consistent with the effect of temperature on adsorption increasing temperature could activate reactants for adsorption process xps analysis was applied for an in depth investigation of the adsorption mechanism fig 6b shows the total survey scans of xps spectra before and after adsorbing cd2 the characteristic peaks of cd 3d5 2 405 58 ev and cd 3d3 2 412 35 ev are obviously observed in the jute paa gel cd meaning the adsorption of cd2 onto the sorbent in the high resolution xps spectra of n1s fig 6c there is no change observed after cd2 adsorption in contrast the integral area ratio of the two peaks of o1s at 532 8 ev c o and 531 3 ev c o for jute paa gel and jute paa gel cd increased from 0 782 to 2 40 fig 6d indicating that the binding of cd2 dominantly occurred at o atoms of c o wang and li 2015 sun et al 2015 3 7 recyclability test recyclability is one of the crucial aspects to evaluate sorbent applicability of treating practical wastewater since the adsorption desorption of cd2 and pb2 onto jute paa gel was highly sensitive in the solution ph range from 2 to 3 fig 3c and d the desorption of two metal ions could be achieved by adjusting the solution ph in this study the metal ion adsorbing jute paa gel was eluted with 0 1 m hcl solution and regenerated with 0 1 m naoh solution and deionized water for reuse at a high initial concentration of 400 mg l the removal efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 were 83 and 96 in the first cycle and remained 81 and 94 in the fifth cycle respectively fig 7 the excellent recyclability of jute paa gel should be attributed to the good mechanical stability for its three dimensional double network structure 3 8 treatment of actual industrial effluent the high adsorption capacity of jute paa gel indicates a great potential in treating practical wastewater containing cd2 and pb2 consequently the metal sorption efficiency of jute paa gel with different adsorbent dosage was investigated in actual industrial effluent from smelting plant after filtration to remove suspended solid the initial ph value of melting effluent was adjusted from 2 8 to 5 0 0 1 before adsorption tests the initial concentrations of pb cd cu zn mn cr and fe in industrial effluent are 3 825 6 075 9 325 188 6 17 05 0 25 and 9 75 mg l respectively in addition the concentrations of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals of k mg and ca were 40 03 31 34 and 389 2 mg l respectively the adsorption data of heavy metal ions by different jute paa gel dosage after treatment for 2 h were summarized in table 2 after treatment by 1 g l jute paa gel the removal efficiencies are 81 0 for pb 79 3 for cd 83 4 for cu 29 8 for zn 22 3 for mn 96 2 for cr and 99 8 for fe in this adsorption process fe and cr are preferentially removed to low concentration level probably due to high average valence electron energy and the 3d64s2 subshell which offer empty orbital and strongly coordinate with active site srivastava et al 2015 when increasing adsorbent dosage to 2 g l pb was preferentially removed in divalent metal ions with the residual concentration below 0 001 mg l probably due to the higher electronegativity of pb when further increasing jute paa gel dosage to 4 g l the cd ions could be completely adsorbed and the removal efficiencies of cu zn and mn ions reached up to 99 8 90 5 and 61 6 respectively the results indicate that the jute paa gel has a great potential in the treatment of industrial effluent containing heavy metals 3 9 fixed bed column adsorption test fig 8 represents an effluent history of actual melting wastewater through two consecutive fixed bed columns packed with jute paa gel the column parameters are summarized in table s1 accurate prediction of target metal ions breakthrough curves from the fixed bed system is important in facility design and operation 1 breakthrough of pb2 and cd2 effluent through the first column occurred after 350 bed volumes bv 3 96 l and 380 bv 4 3 l respectively and the concentrations of pb2 and cd2 in the effluent from the second column were below 0 004 mg l this result suggests that the heavy metals especially pb2 and cd2 in the melting effluent could be efficiently removed in this cycle after each cycle the second column played as the first column and another regenerated column the column was eluted with 0 1 m hcl solution and regenerated with 0 1 m naoh solution followed by deionized water for reuse the process needed about 15 min was used as the second column in next cycle after six cycles the treatment volumes of the effluent reached 2900 bv and the effluent pb2 and cd2 concentrations were below 0 004 mg l the concentrations of other metal ions except zn and mn were below 0 01 mg l they are not reflected in the effluent history curve as for such a small scale column system the treatment capacity of practical melting effluent is quite encouraging fig s5 illustrates the desorption history of pb2 and cd2 preloaded onto jute paa sorbent the adsorbed pb2 and cd2 could be effectively eluted with a limited volume 10 bv 113 1 ml of 0 1 m hcl solution for each column in other words 2900 bv 32 8 l wastewater could be treated with producing only 50 bv 565 ml eluent note that the adsorption desorption process of jute paa gel produced negligible amount of sludge due to its highly structural stability so the fixed bed column system could be featured by efficiency flexibility and re utilization 4 conclusions this work develops a highly practical adsorption process based on low cost hydrogel adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in actual wastewater the new jute paa gel showed a 3d interpenetrating network structure which is conducive to improving the mechanical properties diffusion of metal ions and exposure of adsorption sites the jute paa gel could be efficiently conducted in ph range of 3 6 and the adsorption kinetic equilibrium is very fast the adsorbent showed the highest adsorption capacities of 401 7 mg g for cd2 and 542 9 mg g for pb2 among adsorbents reported so far significantly the jute paa gel was effective in removing heavy metals from actual melting effluent with a high treatment volume of 32 8 l only producing 565 ml eluent meanwhile jute

internal adsorption sites fully expose to metal ions the jute paa gel adsorbent could efficiently adsorb heavy metals in melting wastewater especially cd2 and pb2 the adsorbent showed very high adsorption capacities of 401 7 mg g for cd2 and 542 9 mg g for pb2 moreover the adsorption equilibrium reached within only 10 min for 40 mg l of cd2 and pb2 using 1 g l adsorbent meanwhile the removal

treatment volume of melting wastewater reached 2900 bv 32 8 l only producing 50 bv 565 ml eluent this work develops a highly practical adsorption process based on hydrogel adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in actual wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords gel adsorbent melting wastewater heavy metals fixed bed process 1 introduction heavy metals pollution has been an environmental concern to the public due to the indiscriminate disposal of wastewater containing heavy metals for example heavy metals especially cadmium cd2 and lead pb2 in the rivers and lakes in southwestern china probably result in potential health risk due to its high toxicity to living organisms insusceptibility and non biodegradable liu et al 2015 adsorption is deemed as the most effective techniques to remove heavy metals in wastewater ali 2012 zhou et al 2016a huang et al 2013 uddin 2017 peter et al 2017 efficient cleanup of heavy metals by adsorbents such as ion exchange polymers carbon nanotubes activated carbon and nanoparticles have been extensively investigated fu and wang 2011 santhosh et al 2016 chitpong and husson 2017 peter et al 2017 ihsanullah et al 2016 the adsorption process can be described as a successive process of metal ion diffusion through boundary layer intraparticle diffusion and metal ions adsorption onto the adsorbent surface lai et al 2016 compact granular adsorbents are strongly limited by the low diffusion of metal ions into small pore causing a slow adsorption rate for example the equilibrium time required at least 5 h for activated carbon maneerung et al 2016 in addition granular adsorbents are prone to loss its adsorption ability due to blocking and burial of surface sorption sites dou et al 2013 in contrast nano adsorbents possess fast adsorption but the small size leads to the difficulties in separation ali 2012 furthermore the inefficient separation of nano adsorbents could result in the increase of operation cost and potential threats to natural environment which greatly limits their practical applications shen et al 2015 the low cost and high performance high adsorption capacity fast kinetics and good reusability adsorbents are exceedingly short for practical adsorption process polymeric hydrogels are typical soft solid materials with three dimensional network structures which possess high water permeability hydrogel materials have been widely used in medicine and soft machine fields calvert 2009 hu et al 2015 rose et al 2013 li et al 2015 conventional hydrogels however are generally too weak and brittle to extensive application recently double network dn hydrogels have been developed for tough machine field yang et al 2016 sun et al 2012 wallace et al 2013 in addition the dn hydrogels still remain high water permeability hence these unique properties of dn hydrogels motivate us to exploit this kind of materials as adsorbents through introducing functional groups in this study a double network jute polyacrylic acid jute paa gel is prepared using simple free radical polymerization of acrylic acid in jute aqueous solution jute a bast fibre crop occupies the second place in terms of world production level of cellulosic fibers lin et al 2014 the low cost jute has plenty of oh nh2 and cooh functional groups in addition paa chains contain abundant cooh groups as well the high permeability of jute paa hydrogel with about 80 wt water made internal adsorption sites fully expose to metal ions the double network jute paa gel exhibited good mechanical strength for reusability the jute paa gel adsorbent could efficiently remove the metals i e pb cd cu zn mn cr and fe in melting wastewater which has been identified by fix bed column test 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals jute powder 100 mesh was prepared from jute plant including leaf and limb provided by institute of bast fiber crops chinese academy of agricultural sciences acrylic acid aa ammonium persulfate aps and n n methylenebisacrylamide mba were purchased from commercial sources and used as received the industrial melting effluent was taken from shuikoushan smelting plant located in hengyang hunan province china all aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 jute paa gel synthesis jute paa gel was synthesized by a one pot method first jute powder was dissolved in 0 5 m naoh aqueous solution and then the solution was adjusted to neutral with 0 5 m hcl to obtain a 20 wt jute aqueous solution 4 ml of 20 wt jute aqueous solution 0 8 ml 11 7 mmol aa 0 25 mol aps initiator and 1 5 mol mba cross linking agent the mole ratios were referred to aa were added into a glass reactor the sealed reactor was placed in a water bath at 60 c for 5 h to complete gelation process to get jute paa gel scheme 1 then the obtained jute paa gel was washed with deionized water to remove unreacted reagents according to the price of raw materials the cost of the dry jute paa gel is approximately us 1 4 103 t much lower than commonly used adsorbents see supporting information 2 3 analysis methods and characterization the interpenetrating structure of freeze dried jute paa gel was examined by scanning electron microscope sem fei quanta 200 the functional groups of the samples were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectra ftir nicolet 5700 the surface chemistry of jute paa gel before and after adsorbing cd ii was determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps k alpha 1063 thermo fisher scientific england the thermal stability of jute paa gel was measured by thermogravimetric analysis tga tg dta7300 under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 c min quantification of functional groups was carried out using boehm titration bhadra et al 2016 the point of zero charge phpzc of jute paa gel was measured by δph drift method in a series of 0 01 m nacl at different ph avetta et al 2015 swelling experiment was performed in deionized water and the swollen weight of the gel was recorded until swelling equilibrium was reached the swelling ratio sr was calculated as sr w s w d w d where w s and w d represent the weights of swollen gel and corresponding dried gel respectively 2 4 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments on jute paa gel or jute 1 g of dry gel l they were soaked in water for 4 h before use were carried out in synthetic heavy metal wastewater with preselected concentrations nitrates mg2 ca2 k na cu2 zn2 and mn2 were added as background components in synthetic heavy metal wastewater the batch adsorption experiments on jute paa gel 1 4 g of dry gel l were also carried out in practical melting effluent the practical melting effluent contains 3 825 6 075 9 325 188 6 17 05 0 25 9 75 40 03 31 34 and 389 2 mg l of pb cd cu zn mn cr fe k mg and ca respectively because it is difficult to make sure the valence of these elements only the contents were determined the ph values of the solution were adjusted by 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions after being shaken for a definite time the liquid phases could be conveniently separated by decantation and the supernatant was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometer aas hitachi z 2000 japan for the regeneration study the metal adsorbed hydrogel was eluted with 0 1 m hcl solution 12 m hcl was diluted 120 times with deionized water then regenerated with 0 1 m naoh solution and washed with deionized water to neutral the detailed experimental conditions were listed in the captions of figures for different experiments 2 5 data analysis

concentration c e yu et al 2017 pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were used to analyze the adsorption kinetics the langmuir and freundlich models were utilized to fit the adsorption isotherms and more details are presented in the supporting information all the experimental data were the averages of duplicate determinations and the relative errors were less than 5 2 6 fixed bed column adsorption experimental the actual melting effluent was treated by jute paa sorbent using two columns in series the ph of the effluent was adjusted to 5 0 the column parameters are summarized in table s1 in every cycle when the adsorption capacity of the first column reached to 1 breakthrough the column was transferred and regenerated with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solution and the second column was shifted forward as the first column and a pare column was used as the second column in next cycle in this way the two columns in every cycle assured the highest available adsorption capacity in the continuous processing loop 3 results and discussion 3 1 jute paa gel characterization the jute paa gel was freeze dried to yield porous aerogel fig 1 a the blocky structure is available for separation and reusability inset fig 1a the functional groups in the porous sorbent can be fully exposed to metal ions in the ir spectra jute paa contained the characteristic functional groups of carbonyl at 1720 cm 1 and amino or hydroxyl at 3200 3600 cm 1 from paa and jute fig 1b the high resolution xps results of the samples confirm the existence of oxygen and amino containing functional groups figs s1a d presenting higher content of functional groups in jute paa than those in jute table s2 the jute paa gel exhibited extraordinary mechanical properties fig 1c the hydrogel was pliable and tough withstanding high level deformations of compression without any observable damage the outstanding ductility of the jute paa gel roots from the high elasticity of the cross linking between paa chains and cellulose molecules by covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds in addition the jute paa gel displayed excellent stability in water because the supramolecular structure the swelling ratio value of this gel was about 3 85 in water until reaching equilibrium at around 12 h fig 1d which contained about 80 wt of water at equilibrium state thus the high porosity and high water permeability could provide a fast channel for metal ion diffusion from solution into hydrogel the tga and dtg results display that thermal degradation of jute paa gel occurred at above 200 c indicating a good thermostability fig s1e 3 2 selective adsorption the selective adsorption experiment is necessary to evaluate the adsorption ability to remove targeted heavy metals because the main heavy metal ions in the practical melting effluent tested in this study are pb2 cd2 cu2 zn2 and mn2 the selective adsorption among them was conducted fig 2 shows the selective sorption of these bivalent heavy metal ions with the initial concentration of 100 mg l onto jute paa gel the pb2 and cd2 ions were preferentially adsorbed with about 97 and 89 sorption efficiency respectively the sorption efficiency is in the order of pb2 cd2 cu2 zn2 mn2 the adsorption selectivity may be caused by the difference of electronegativity 2 2 for pb2 1 69 for cd2 1 90 for cu2 1 65 for zn2 and 1 55 for mn2 and mass to charge 103 for pb2 56 for cd2 32 for cu2 33 for zn2 and 27 for mn2 of metal ions resulting in the difference of chelation ability with functional groups hadi et al 2013 the selective adsorption towards pb2 and cd2 is exactly needed to treat the targeted melting effluent with potential health risk from toxic pb2 and cd2 liu et al 2015 therefore the pb2 and cd2 adsorption behavior on jute paa gel adsorbent was systematically investigated 3 3 effect of environmental conditions because the jute paa gel showed a selective adsorption towards cd2 and pb2 the effect of environmental conditions on the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 was investigated the common species in aquatic systems such as alkali metals na and k alkaline earth metals mg2 and ca2 and humic acid ha would compete with adsorbates at sorption sites of adsorbents tan et al 2015 all the species were used in different concentrations 0 0 01 and 0 1 m and the initial concentration of cd2 and pb2 were set at 400 mg l 0 0035 m for cd and 0 002 m for pb as shown in fig 3 a and b the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 reached up to 90 and 96 respectively in the presence of 0 01 m na k and ha when the concentrations of na k and ha increased to 0 1 m 28 5 and 50 times higher than cd and pb respectively the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 decreased by 8 15 in contrast ca2 and mg2 ions 0 1 m was 28 6 and 50 times higher than cd2 and pb2 respectively showed significant influence on the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 especially cd2 the influence of ionic species followed the sequence mg2 ca2 k na probably due to the difference in electronegativity hadi et al 2013 the decreased adsorption efficiency could result from the competition and electrostatic repulsion among metal ions and from the lowered activity coefficient of cd2 and pb2 at a high ionic strength yang and jiang 2014 the ph can influence the chemical speciation of heavy metal ions and the surface chemistry of adsorbents zhou et al 2016a and b as shown in fig 3c and d the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 onto jute and jute paa gel at ph 1 5 were negligible the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 on jute increased slowly with increasing ph and finally retained about 82 and 91 at ph above 6 respectively in contrast the adsorption efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel sharply increased to nearly 100 at ph 3 indicating that the adsorption desorption of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa could be facilely achieved by adjusting solution ph the ph of bulk solution precipitation phbsp for cd2 and pb2 with initial concentration of 40 mg l was 8 57 and 6 04 respectively and no precipitation occurred at ph below phbsp therefore the adsorption on jute paa could be well conducted in a wide ph range of 3 8 for cd2 or 3 to 6 for pb2 at a high concentration of 40 mg l the point of zero charge phpzc of jute paa gel was 7 4 fig s1f at ph phpzc the surface of adsorbents is positively charged which is unfavorable for adsorption process due to the electrostatic repulsion towards positively charged metal ions however the adsorption capacity of jute paa gel was very high at a low ph 3 below phpzc 7 4 indicating that the adsorption process of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel was dominated by chemical rather than electrostatic interactions 3 4 adsorption kinetics rapid adsorption of adsorbates is highly demanded for adsorbents in practical application especially in running wastewater treatment the adsorption of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel and jute as a function of contact time was studied c0 40 mg l adsorbent dosage 1 g l fig 4 the sorption equilibrium time of cd2 and pb2 on jute required at least 120 min with removal efficiencies of 75 for cd2 and 89 for pb2 in contrast only 10 min was required to reach equilibrium on jute paa gel with almost 100 removal efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 the fast adsorption should be attributed to the porous double network structure and high permeability of jute paa gel which accelerate the intraparticle diffusion of metal ions the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were used to analyze the sorption rate based on equilibrium time data the relative parameters calculated from the two models were listed in table s3 for the dada of jute paa gel the correlation coefficients r2 0 9873 for pb2 and 0 9968 for cd2 of the pseudo first order model were larger than 0 9083 for pb2 and 0 9446 for cd2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating that there are enough adsorption sites on jute paa for adsorbing cd2 and pb2 repo et al 2013 in contrast for the data of jute correlation coefficients r2 0 9137 for pb2 and 0 9569 for cd2 of the pseudo first order model were smaller than 0 9851 for pb2 and 0 9943 for cd2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model indicative of limited adsorption sites on jute the pseudo first and second order kinetics can describe the data as a generalized rate controlling step but they cannot provide a comprehensive view of adsorption as a series of distinct steps when metal ions enter adsorbents from solution pore and intraparticle diffusion are often rate limiting martínez cabanas et al 2016 the intraparticle diffusion had three different linear zones over the whole time range fig s2 the plots of equilibrium adsorption capacity q e vs t 0 5 of jute crossed the origin fig s2a indicating that the intraparticle diffusion was limited liu et al 2013 in contrast the plots of jute paa gel did not pass through the origin fig s2b indicative of a fast intraparticle diffusion zarghami et al 2016 3 5 isotherm studies and modeling the adsorption isotherms of jute paa gel at different temperatures are presented in fig 5 the adsorption capacity increased with increasing temperature and initial concentrations both langmuir and freundlich isotherms were used to describe the adsorption behavior of cd2 and pb2 and their corresponding parameters are listed in table 1 for jute paa gel the correlation coefficient r2 0 9742 for the langmuir model was higher than that for the freundlich model r2 0 9470 indicating the monolayer adsorption of cd2 and pb2 on jute paa gel jiang et al 2014 it is believed that intraparticle diffusion on granular adsorbents does not meet langmuir model maneerung et al 2016 in fact jute paa gel showed a fast intraparticle diffusion fig s2b this indicates that the internal adsorption sites of jute paa gel were in similar environment with those on the surface of jute paa gel due to the high water content 80 wt which presented a fast channel for metal ions accessible to internal adsorption sites so the adsorption behavior of cd2 and pb2 over jute paa gel well met the langmuir model the maximal theoretical adsorption capacities qmax of jute paa gel reached as high as 401 7 mg g for cd2 and 542 9 mg g for pb2 respectively which much higher than those on jute 62 5 mg g for cd2 and 77 1 mg g for pb2 fig s3 they are ones of the highest adsorption capacities for cd2 and pb2 on adsorbents reported so far wang et al 2016 ling et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 thermodynamic parameters standard gibbs free energy δg standard enthalpy δh and standard entropy δs of adsorption process were calculated according to van t hoff equation table s4 the negative values of δg and positive values of δh mean spontaneous and endothermic adsorption processes during cd2 and pb2 adsorption on jute paa gel the positive value of δs implies an increase in the disorderness of the solid solution system xie et al 2014 according to the dubinin radushkevish d r isotherm analysis fig s4 the calculated free energy e were 10 51 and 11 44 kj mol for cd2 and pb2 adsorption respectively which are in the energy range of a chemical sorption process 8 16 kj mol phetphaisit et al 2016 3 6 adsorption mechanism due to the relatively higher concentration of cd2 than other heavy metals in the melting wastewater the adsorption mechanism of cd2 on jute paa gel was examined from what was discussed above a preliminary conclusion could be inferred that the adsorption process was dominated by chemisorption as shown in the ftir spectra fig 6 a the peak of o h stretching vibration at about 3500 cm 1 significantly increased after cd2 adsorption due to the electron drawing effect of positive charged cd2 resulting in a stronger stretching vibration chen and chen 2015 the results suggest that chemical interactions occurred between cd2 and oxygen containing groups on jute paa gel the results were consistent with the effect of temperature on adsorption increasing temperature could activate reactants for adsorption process xps analysis was applied for an in depth investigation of the adsorption mechanism fig 6b shows the total survey scans of xps spectra before and after adsorbing cd2 the characteristic peaks of cd 3d5 2 405 58 ev and cd 3d3 2 412 35 ev are obviously observed in the jute paa gel cd meaning the adsorption of cd2 onto the sorbent in the high resolution xps spectra of n1s fig 6c there is no change observed after cd2 adsorption in contrast the integral area ratio of the two peaks of o1s at 532 8 ev c o and 531 3 ev c o for jute paa gel and jute paa gel cd increased from 0 782 to 2 40 fig 6d indicating that the binding of cd2 dominantly occurred at o atoms of c o wang and li 2015 sun et al 2015 3 7 recyclability test recyclability is one of the crucial aspects to evaluate sorbent applicability of treating practical wastewater since the adsorption desorption of cd2 and pb2 onto jute paa gel was highly sensitive in the solution ph range from 2 to 3 fig 3c and d the desorption of two metal ions could be achieved by adjusting the solution ph in this study the metal ion adsorbing jute paa gel was eluted with 0 1 m hcl solution and regenerated with 0 1 m naoh solution and deionized water for reuse at a high initial concentration of 400 mg l the removal efficiencies of cd2 and pb2 were 83 and 96 in the first cycle and remained 81 and 94 in the fifth cycle respectively fig 7 the excellent recyclability of jute paa gel should be attributed to the good mechanical stability for its three dimensional double network structure 3 8 treatment of actual industrial effluent the high adsorption capacity of jute paa gel indicates a great potential in treating practical wastewater containing cd2 and pb2 consequently the metal sorption efficiency of jute paa gel with different adsorbent dosage was investigated in actual industrial effluent from smelting plant after filtration to remove suspended solid the initial ph value of melting effluent was adjusted from 2 8 to 5 0 0 1 before adsorption tests the initial concentrations of pb cd cu zn mn cr and fe in industrial effluent are 3 825 6 075 9 325 188 6 17 05 0 25 and 9 75 mg l respectively in addition the concentrations of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals of k mg and ca were 40 03 31 34 and 389 2 mg l respectively the adsorption data of heavy metal ions by different jute paa gel dosage after treatment for 2 h were summarized in table 2 after treatment by 1 g l jute paa gel the removal efficiencies are 81 0 for pb 79 3 for cd 83 4 for cu 29 8 for zn 22 3 for mn 96 2 for cr and 99 8 for fe in this adsorption process fe and cr are preferentially removed to low concentration level probably due to high average valence electron energy and the 3d64s2 subshell which offer empty orbital and strongly coordinate with active site srivastava et al 2015 when increasing adsorbent dosage to 2 g l pb was preferentially removed in divalent metal ions with the residual concentration below 0 001 mg l probably due to the higher electronegativity of pb when further increasing jute paa gel dosage to 4 g l the cd ions could be completely adsorbed and the removal efficiencies of cu zn and mn ions reached up to 99 8 90 5 and 61 6 respectively the results indicate that the jute paa gel has a great potential in the treatment of industrial effluent containing heavy metals 3 9 fixed bed column adsorption test fig 8 represents an effluent history of actual melting wastewater through two consecutive fixed bed columns packed with jute paa gel the column parameters are summarized in table s1 accurate prediction of target metal ions breakthrough curves from the fixed bed system is important in facility design and operation 1 breakthrough of pb2 and cd2 effluent through the first column occurred after 350 bed volumes bv 3 96 l and 380 bv 4 3 l respectively and the concentrations of pb2 and cd2 in the effluent from the second column were below 0 004 mg l this result suggests that the heavy metals especially pb2 and cd2 in the melting effluent could be efficiently removed in this cycle after each cycle the second column played as the first column and another regenerated column the column was eluted with 0 1 m hcl solution and regenerated with 0 1 m naoh solution followed by deionized water for reuse the process needed about 15 min was used as the second column in next cycle after six cycles the treatment volumes of the effluent reached 2900 bv and the effluent pb2 and cd2 concentrations were below 0 004 mg l the concentrations of other metal ions except zn and mn were below 0 01 mg l they are not reflected in the effluent history curve as for such a small scale column system the treatment capacity of practical melting effluent is quite encouraging fig s5 illustrates the desorption history of pb2 and cd2 preloaded onto jute paa sorbent the adsorbed pb2 and cd2 could be effectively eluted with a limited volume 10 bv 113 1 ml of 0 1 m hcl solution for each column in other words 2900 bv 32 8 l wastewater could be treated with producing only 50 bv 565 ml eluent note that the adsorption desorption process of jute paa gel produced negligible amount of sludge due to its highly structural stability so the fixed bed column system could be featured by efficiency flexibility and re utilization 4 conclusions this work develops a highly practical adsorption process based on low cost hydrogel adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals in actual wastewater the new jute paa gel showed a 3d interpenetrating network structure which is conducive to improving the mechanical properties diffusion of metal ions and exposure of adsorption sites the jute paa gel could be efficiently conducted in ph range of 3 6 and the adsorption kinetic equilibrium is very fast the adsorbent showed the highest adsorption capacities of 401 7 mg g for cd2 and 542 9 mg g for pb2 among adsorbents reported so far significantly the jute paa gel was effective in removing heavy metals from actual melting effluent with a high treatment volume of 32 8 l only producing 565 ml eluent meanwhile jute paa gel could be easily regenerated and highly reused acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51778218and 51478171 and national science foundation

19787,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is an important optically active substance in aquatic environments and plays a key role in light attenuation and in the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles although the optical properties abundance sources cycles compositions and remote sensing estimations of cdom have been widely reported in different aquatic environments little is known about the optical properties and composition changes in cdom along trophic gradients therefore we collected 821 samples from 22 lakes along a trophic gradient oligotrophic to eutrophic in china from 2004 to 2015 and determined the cdom spectral absorption and nutrient concentrations the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a chla concentrations and the secchi disk depth sdd ranged from 0 02 to 24 75 mg l 0 002 3 471 mg l 0 03 882 66 μg l and 0 05 17 30 m respectively the trophic state index tsi ranged from 1 55 to 98 91 and covered different trophic states from oligotrophic to hyper eutrophic the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm a 254 ranged from 1 68 to 92 65 m 1 additionally the cdom sources and composition parameters including the spectral slope and relative molecular size value exhibited a substantial variability from the oligotrophic level to other trophic levels the natural logarithm value of the cdom absorption lna 254 is highly linearly correlated with the tsi r 2 0 92 p 001 n 821 oligotrophic lakes are distinguished by a 254 4 m 1 and mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes are classified as 4 a 254 10 and a 254 10 m 1 respectively the results suggested that the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 might be a more sensitive single indicator of the trophic state than tn tp chla and sdd therefore we proposed a cdom absorption coefficient and determined the threshold for defining the trophic state of a lake several advantages of measuring and estimating cdom including rapid experimental measurements potential in situ optical sensor measurements and large spatial scale remote sensing estimations make it superior to traditional tsi techniques for the rapid monitoring and assessment of lake trophic states graphical abstract image 1 keywords chromophoric dissolved organic matter trophic state index total nitrogen total phosphorus chlorophyll a 1 introduction the most commonly used paradigm to study lake environments and ecosystems is their trophic state which is widely used to assess the trophic level of lakes and manage the water quality in lakes carlson 1977 oligotrophic lakes have low nutrient loading and low productivity whereas eutrophic lakes show high nutrient loading and productivity wetzel 2001 this paradigm has been widely adopted by the general ecological community as well as by limnologists and lake managers knowledge of the trophic state of a lake is vital to understanding the structure and function of a lake s ecosystem and to predicting future trends under changing environmental conditions and developing appropriate mitigation strategies in general the trophic state of a lake is assessed using four water quality indicators total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chla and secchi disk depth sdd carlson 1977 kratzer and brezonik 2010 wetzel 2001 tn tp and chla are measured via chemical methods in a laboratory using water samples and the collection transportation and filtration of the samples greatly inhibit the rapid assessment and evaluation of the trophic state of a lake in addition due to the limited number of water samples collected and the subsequent slow laboratory analysis the results from trophic state assessments have low temporal and spatial resolutions particularly for large lakes lakes should be continuously monitored and rapidly assessed using easy to analyze indices in recent years technological developments have led to an increase in the use of in situ high frequency sensors that allow measurements to be taken at far higher temporal and spatial resolutions than can be achieved with traditional discrete sampling crawford et al 2014 dickey et al 2008 unfortunately in situ tn and tp sensors for high frequency monitoring have not been developed but some sensors for nitrogen and phosphorus species have been reported blaen et al 2016 therefore an alternative scheme to rapidly assess the trophic states of lakes using representative indicators that can be monitored via high frequency monitoring sensors is urgently needed chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is an important optically active substance in aquatic ecosystems and affects the attenuation of ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation remote sensing estimations of the total suspended matter and chla concentrations global carbon and nutrient cycling ecosystem productivity heavy metal adsorption and transportation contaminant availability and drinking water treatment coble 2007 gonsior et al 2014 sharpless and blough 2014 zhang et al 2011c thus the sources composition cycle and transformation of cdom play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems in addition the fluorescent fraction of cdom referred to as cdom fluorescence or fluorescence dissolved organic matter fdom has been widely used to trace cdom distributions sources compositions and cycles zhang et al 2009 2010 and has been used as a surrogate for dissolved organic carbon doc lee et al 2015 biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations baker and inverarity 2004 liu et al 2014 at present several cdom fluorescence sensors such as the cyclops 7 turner designs usa the eco fl cdom fluorometer wetlabs usa the microflu cdom fluorometer trios gmbh germany the uv fluorometer seapoint and the exo2 fdom sensor ysi usa have been developed and widely used for the in situ monitoring of freshwater and marine ecosystems bowling et al 2016 joye et al 2011 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2014 watras et al 2011 therefore rapid development in the study of cdom has been observed with an increase of almost 150 sci papers every year in the past twenty years 1997 2016 fig s1 because cdom is one of the most important water color parameters and is closely linked to nutrients liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 some studies have proposed defining the lake trophic state using the nutrient color paradigm which includes cdom absorption webster et al 2008 williamson et al 1999 therefore the main aims of this study were to 1 present the cdom optical properties and composition changes along trophic gradients for more than 800 samples from 22 lakes ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic shallow to deep and small to large 2 develop an empirical relationship between cdom absorption and the trophic state index tsi and 3 discuss the potential application of assessing and monitoring the trophic state of a lake using cdom absorption 2 material and methods 2 1 study lakes and water sampling a total of 22 lakes around china fig 1 with elevations of less than 10 m to higher than 4450 m above sea level and various trophic states were sampled from 2004 to 2015 the lake areas ranged from less than 1 km2 2338 km2 a detailed description of the number of samples and the sampling time per lake are presented in table s1 the sampling time was from january to november however most of the samples were collected during the growing season from march to october table s1 which was consistent with carlson s tsi model that mainly considered the highest productive seasons in temperate lakes spring and summer carlson 1977 water samples were collected from a 0 1 0 m depth in 2 l or 5 l acid cleaned plastic bottles and were placed on ice in the field after collection the samples were immediately transported to the laboratory within 4 h in the laboratory most of the water samples were immediately filtered and then stored in the dark at 4 c the remaining water samples were stored at 20 c and filtered in less than three days and this process has been proven not to result in the loss of any chromophores zhang et al 2011a the water samples approximately 250 500 ml were filtered prior to the absorption analysis using pre combusted 0 7 μm gf f filters whatman to remove any organic matter and 0 22 μm cellulose membranes millipore that were pre rinsed with 50 ml of milli q water the filtrates were collected in brown glass bottles that had been heated at 450 c for 6 h to remove any organic matter the filtered samples were stored at 4 c in the laboratory and all of the measurements were completed within two weeks 2 2 uv visible uv vis absorption measurements the absorption spectra were obtained between 240 and 800 nm at 1 nm intervals using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2401pc with matching 4 cm quartz cells for samples collected from 2004 to 2008 a different uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550pc with matching 5 cm quartz cells was used for the samples collected from 2009 to 2015 for both the uv 2401pc and uv 2550pc spectrophotometers the slit width was 1 nm and the wavelength scan rate was 210 nm min 1 milli q water was used in the reference cell the absorbance measurements at each wavelength λ were corrected using the baseline for the backscattering of small particles and colloids through filters using the absorbance at 700 nm which has been widely used and accepted by many studies bricaud et al 1981 del castillo et al 1999 zhang et al 2011b the absorption coefficients were obtained using the following equation 1 a λ 2 303d λ r where a λ is the cdom absorption coefficient at wavelength λ m 1 d λ is the corrected optical density at wavelength λ and r is the cuvette path length in m because the optical density detection limit of the shimadzu uv 2401pc and uv 2550pc spectrophotometers is 0 0001 the precision of the cdom absorption coefficient is 0 005 m 1 the cdom abundance is often expressed using the absorption coefficient m 1 at a wavelength of 254 nm 350 nm or other longer wavelength in many studies table s2 although we measured the cdom absorption from 240 to 800 nm the absorption is near the limit or negative for wavelengths longer than 350 nm for some very clear water fig 2 therefore we used a 254 which has been widely used in other similar studies as the cdom abundance in this study clark et al 2008 maie et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 table s2 which has been suggested for other studies in the future particularly for very clear water absorption spectral slopes and slope ratios have been proposed as indicators of molecular weight and a source of cdom the slope ratio was calculated as the ratio of the spectral slope s 275 295 to s 350 400 helms et al 2008 because our dataset included some low cdom absorption samples with absorption coefficients near zero in the wavelength range of 350 400 nm the calculation of the spectral slope s 350 400 induced large uncertainty and error therefore we only used s 275 295 to characterize the cdom composition and sources in this study s 275 295 was calculated via a non linear regression over the 275 295 nm wavelength range to remove noise signals using the following equation helms et al 2008 stedmon et al 2000 2 a λ a λ 0 exp s λ 0 λ k where a λ is the absorption coefficient at wavelength λ a λ 0 is the absorption coefficient at a reference wavelength λ 0 and s is the spectral slope a measure of the decrease in the absorption with the increasing wavelength k is a background parameter that accounts for baseline shifts or attenuation due to factors other than the cdom the relative molecular size m i e the average molecular weight of the humic solute molecules was estimated from the ratio of the absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm which is based on the fact that decreasing ratios indicate an increasing molecular size jones et al 1988 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 3 m a 250 a 365 where a 250 and a 365 are the absorption coefficients at 250 nm and 365 nm respectively however for some very clear waters with a 365 less than 0 the m value was not calculated and excluded from further analysis our previous studies have indicated that the spectral slope is highly significantly correlated to the m value zhang et al 2011b and a significantly positive correlation between s 275 295 and the m value for our dataset in this study showed that both can be used to trace the cdom molecular weight fig 3 2 3 other water quality parameters information about the observation sites including the latitude longitude and altitude was obtained in situ using a global position system gps with an accuracy of 2 0 m a standard 30 cm diameter black and white quadrant secchi disk was used to measure the sdd kalff 2002 the water samples for chla 50 5000 ml based on the amount of phytoplankton were filtered through whatman gf f fiberglass filters chla was extracted with ethanol 90 at 80 c and analyzed spectrophotometrically at 750 and 665 nm before and after acidification with 1 mol l 1 hcl with a correction for phaeophytin a simis et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 the tn and tp were determined spectrophotometrically after the samples were digested with alkaline potassium persulfate according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater clesceri et al 1998 2 4 trophic state assessment over the past 40 years numerous studies have attempted to assess the trophic state of lakes using water quality indices carlson 1977 and walker 1979 proposed an assessment of the eutrophication progress based on the tsi which depends on the mean chla tp concentrations and sdd many authors improved and revised the tsi by including the tn water color doc and dissolved reactive manganese cudowski 2015 forsberg 1980 webster et al 2008 williamson et al 1999 the trophic state was assessed using the improved carlson tsi based on four water quality indices chla tn tp and sdd jing et al 2008 wang et al 2013 specifically tsi was calculated through weighted mean based on the following five equations 4 tsi 0 326tsi chla 0 219tsi tn 0 230tsi tp 0 225tsi sdd 5 tsi chla 10 2 5 1 0861nchla 6 tsi tp 10 9 436 1 6241ntp 7 tsi tn 10 5 453 1 6941ntn 8 tsi sdd 10 5 118 1 941nsdd where tsi chla tsi tn tsi tp and tsi sdd were trophic state index in relation to chla tn tp and sdd respectively chla tn tp and sdd were chlorophyll a μg l total nitrogen mg l and total phosphorus mg l concentrations and secchi disk depth m 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses including the mean values as well as linear and non linear fitting were performed using statistical program for social sciences spss 11 0 software because the number of different trophic states substantially differed the differences in the parameters among different trophic states were assessed using independent sample t tests p 05 regression analyses were used to examine the relationships among the a 254 s 275 295 m value sdd nutrients and pigment concentrations the significance levels are reported as not significant p 05 or significant p 05 distribution maps of lakes and sampling sites were made using arcgis 11 2 and other data graphs were made using origin 10 5 including prediction intervals around the regression line 3 results 3 1 water chemistry and lake trophic state the sampled lakes and sampling sites covered a wide range of nutrient compositions phytoplankton biomass concentrations transparencies trophic states and cdom absorptions and compositions table 1 the tn tp chla and sdd values ranged from 0 02 to 24 75 mg l 0 002 3 471 mg l 0 03 882 66 μg l and 0 05 17 30 m respectively the maximum values of tn tp chla and sdd were 1650 2042 29422 and 346 folds greater than the minimum values respectively in comparison the tsi and the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 exhibited smaller ranges and the ratios of the maximum to minimum values were 64 and 55 respectively however the a 254 and tsi values still showed large variations from 1 68 to 92 65 m 1 and 1 55 to 98 91 respectively revealing a span from oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes the cdom composition parameters s 275 295 and the m value ranged from 14 73 to 59 55 μm 1 and 3 66 to 49 05 respectively in addition the mean values were markedly higher than the median values for tn tp chla and sdd however the mean values were close to the median value for the tsi and a 254 overall our lake dataset covered a wide range of trophic states with differences from one to five orders of magnitude in the tn tp chla and sdd values which showed that our dataset was representative of a wide variety of lakes according to the standard trophic categories jing et al 2008 wang et al 2013 tsi 30 indicates oligotrophic 30 tsi 50 indicates mesotrophic and tsi 50 indicates eutrophic our lake dataset contained lake samples from oligotrophic 144 17 5 mesotrophic 213 26 0 and eutrophic lakes 464 56 5 3 2 cdom optical properties along trophic gradients the cdom absorption coefficient almost linearly increased with increases in the trophic level i e 3 23 0 93 6 07 2 65 13 43 3 29 19 32 3 86 and 27 52 9 83 m 1 for the oligotrophic mesotrophic light eutrophic middle eutrophic and hyper eutrophic levels respectively fig 4 fig s2 the cdom composition parameters namely the spectral slope and relative molecular size significantly decreased from the oligotrophic level to the other trophic levels p 001 as determined by t tests fig 4 for example the spectral slope and relative molecular size were 34 08 8 77 μm 1 and 16 56 9 29 for the oligotrophic level and 23 61 5 81 μm 1 and 8 52 1 88 for the mesotrophic level however the spectral slope and relative molecular size either did not change or only slightly decreased from the mesotrophic level to the other trophic levels fig 4 these results showed that the cdom absorption coefficient significantly increased but the cdom composition only slightly changed from the mesotrophic level to the other high trophic levels the cdom was expected to have a dominant autochthonous input for the oligotrophic level and a dominant allochthonous input for the other trophic levels therefore the cdom absorption coefficient significantly increased but the cdom position only slightly changed from the mesotrophic level to the other high trophic levels 3 3 correlations between the cdom optical properties and the tsi tsi tn tp and chla were all significantly positively correlated with the cdom absorption coefficient whereas the sdd significantly negatively was correlated with the cdom absorption coefficient figs 5 and 6 of the four independent parameters the chla concentration provided the best explanation of the variation in the cdom absorption fig 5 however the sub dataset with lnchla less than 2 in fig 5c does not conform to a linear regression which is partially attributed to the measurement limit and accuracy of cdom and chla due to very low chla concentrations in addition the power function regressions performed to correlate the cdom absorption coefficient with tn r 2 0 66 tp r 2 0 70 chla r 2 0 83 and sdd r 2 0 81 as the sole parameters had lower explanatory rates than the regressions performed with tn tp chla and sdd to calculate the tsi r 2 0 92 as a synthetic parameter and thus correlate the cdom absorption coefficient figs 5 and 6 therefore the cdom absorption coefficient can be considered a synthetic indicator to characterize the trophic level of a lake using the linear relationships of the cdom absorption coefficient and the tsi tsi 24 00 lna 254 5 17 fig 6a and the trophic state classification standard based on the tsi jing et al 2008 wang et al 2013 we proposed a trophic state classification standard using the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm table 2 a 254 values less than 4 m 1 correspond to a tsi less than 30 and are defined to classify an oligotrophic state 4 a 254 10 and a 254 10 are defined to classify mesotrophic and eutrophic states respectively table 2 additionally the light eutrophic moderately eutrophic and hyper eutrophic states are classified according to 10 a 254 15 15 a 254 23 and a 254 23 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 optical properties and composition changes in cdom along trophic gradients numerous studies on the optical and fluorescence properties transformation and cycle processes and remote sensing estimations of cdom have been reported fellman et al 2010 helms et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 2010 zhu et al 2013 our dataset with a 254 from 1 68 to 92 65 m 1 s 275 295 from 14 73 to 59 55 μm 1 and m values from 3 66 to 49 05 covered most values reported in inland waters with different trophic levels table s2 however to the best of our knowledge this study constitutes the first comprehensive investigation of the cdom absorption coefficient and composition characteristics over a large range of trophic gradients although we previously reported that the cdom absorption increased significantly as the trophic state increased from oligotrophic to mesotrophic and eutrophic states in the yungui plateau lakes zhang et al 2010 the dataset in this study included data from lakes that were more complex than those used in our previous study in addition although bio optical and biogeochemical properties such as the chla specific absorption coefficient and the phytoplankton size classes of different trophic gradients have been reported in oceanic waters brotas et al 2013 oubelkheir et al 2005 few studies have focused on the relationship among the cdom absorption coefficient the composition parameters and the tsi zhang et al 2010 the large range of trophic states explored in the present study provided a unique opportunity to determine general trends in the cdom absorption and composition variability in lake ecosystems along the trophic gradient the present study confirmed that the natural logarithm value of the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 linearly increased with increases in the tsi fig 6a in contrast the cdom composition parameters i e the spectral slope and relative molecular size varied greatly when the tsi was lower than 30 and only slightly varied when the tsi was greater than 30 fig 6b and c therefore significant differences in the cdom composition were recorded between the oligotrophic state and the other trophic states in addition the cdom spectral slope and the relative molecular size decreased as the tsi increased which indicated that the mesotrophic and eutrophic states had higher molecular weight compositions than the oligotrophic state although no systematic study has investigated the cdom absorption coefficient and composition as a function of the trophic state some piecemeal comparative studies and literature data confirmed and supported our results table s2 for example the hyper eutrophic pampulha reservoir had significantly higher nutrient concentrations 21 folds higher for tn and 28 for tp and chla value 5 8 times than the oligotrophic lake dom helvécio which corresponded to a higher cdom absorption coefficient at 350 nm 3 3 fold higher brandão et al 2016 additionally the hyper eutrophic pampulha reservoir s 275 295 20 μm 1 m value 7 0 7 3 had a lower spectral slope and smaller molecular size values than oligotrophic lake dom helvécio s 275 295 30 μm 1 m value 11 8 13 7 similar to our study results which indicated the higher molecular size of the cdom in the pampulha reservoir than in lake dom helvécio brandão et al 2016 in addition the literature data showed that the cdom absorption coefficients of clear and oligotrophic alpine and mountain lakes were markedly lower than those of mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes and reservoirs gons et al 2008 laurion et al 2000 liu et al 2014 mladenov et al 2011 sandjensen and staehr 2009 zhang et al 2009 2010 for lakes with different trophic states the land use watershed land cover hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic activities varied greatly and the variations resulted in large differences in the cdom abundances and compositions gons et al 2008 sandjensen and staehr 2009 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 therefore additional future studies are needed to link the land use land cover hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic activities with the lake trophic state and the cdom abundance and composition 4 2 implications for monitoring and assessing lake eutrophication eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment is a global water environmental problem smith et al 1999 lake eutrophication can result in algal blooms and water quality degradation which affect the services provided by the lake ecosystem the tsi provides an overall assessment of the trophic degree and promotes data grouping and organization to guide decision making and aid water resource management therefore over the past four decades efforts have been devoted to the classification of the trophic states of different aquatic ecosystems carlson 1977 cunha et al 2013 dodds et al 1998 walker 1979 webster et al 2008 most classification systems have been based on water column variables such as the inorganic nutrient concentrations phytoplankton abundance and biomass and primary production values a tsi for temperate lakes was proposed by carlson and was based on the empirical relationships among the chla tp and sdd values carlson 1977 cunha et al proposed a new tsi for tropical subtropical reservoirs using the tp and chla concentrations cunha et al 2013 webster et al integrated the tp and colored doc values to define the lake trophic state using a diverse dataset from 1646 northern temperate lakes webster et al 2008 the highly linear relationship between the cdom absorption and the tsi based on the large dataset in our study which covers lakes with different trophic states provides strong quantitative support for considering the cdom absorption coefficient as a trophic classification standard because the effect of water color on the chla and sdd values is independent of the tp concentration ignoring the water color can result in a serious misinterpretation of the limnological data particularly for lower sdd values solely due to an increased algal biomass stimulated by nutrient enrichment webster et al 2008 in contrast the cdom absorption characterizes the water color and includes the nutrients more importantly using the cdom absorption coefficient instead of the nutrients to characterize the lake trophic state has at least three other marked advantages first cdom optical measurements are relatively simple and sensitive and only require minimal sample pretreatment thus rapid cdom measurement covering a large amount samples can be carried out second the spatial distribution of the cdom absorption coefficient can be easily mapped using remote sensing with a wide spatial resolution of less than 1 m to more than 1 km currently many algorithms exist to estimate the cdom absorption coefficient 412 355 300 nm and other wavelengths and to map the spatial distribution using handheld airborne spectrometers land observing satellite sensors e g ikonos landsat etm spot and ocean color satellite sensors e g seawifs meris modis kahru and mitchell 2001 kowalczuk et al 2010 kutser 2012 kutser et al 2005 zhu et al 2011 2013 third a cdom high frequency in situ monitoring sensor can provide a high temporal resolution minute and hour scales for cdom dynamics bowling et al 2016 joye et al 2011 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2014 watras et al 2011 combining the high spatial resolution of remote sensing and the high temporal resolution of in situ monitoring a proposed trophic state classification using the cdom absorption coefficient can provide a global or regional estimation of the long term continuous dynamic changes in the trophic states of lakes and this method can make up for the disadvantages of trophic state assessments using nutrients and phytoplankton biomass in addition knowing the global distribution and long term dynamics of the trophic states of lakes is vital for eutrophication prevention and control drinking water safety and lake ecosystem management 4 3 data uncertainty our analysis endeavored to include a large dataset that covered the large variability in trophic states and cdom absorption coefficients therefore our assessment model should be applicable for most lakes around the world with similar nutrient and cdom ranges as those found in this study tn 0 02 25 00 mg l tp 0 002 3 500 mg l and a 254 1 50 to 95 00 m 1 as compared in table s2 however our dataset did not include humic lakes with low nutrient concentrations but high amounts of humic substances i e a low trophic level tn less than 2 50 mg l and tp less than 40 μg l and a high cdom absorption i e an a 254 value of more than 340 m 1 groeneveld et al 2016 and these lakes are extensively distributed throughout north america and europe therefore some errors or uncertainties are likely if the proposed trophic state classification is applied to lakes with high humification due to peat covered catchment areas overgrown coniferous forests and peat mosses caution should be taken in performing tsi assessments for lakes with high humification using cdom absorption caution should be taken in performing tsi assessment for high humification lakes using cdom absorption another potential weakness is that the numbers of samples for the different trophic states were not evenly distributed our dataset included a relatively low percentage of oligotrophic samples 17 5 which might introduce some uncertainties for oligotrophic lakes and this is particularly true for extremely clear alpine and polar lakes that have a cdom absorption coefficient a 254 which is markedly less than the minimum value of 1 68 m 1 in our dataset mladenov et al 2011 if the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 is correlated to the tsi for the sub dataset blue hollow square which has a tsi less than 20 the linear fit yellow linear fitting line in fig 6a still provides the highest coefficient of determination and explanation rate but the linear slope and coefficient of determination tsi 11 03 lna 254 0 42 r 2 0 31 n 78 p 001 is markedly lower than that of the whole dataset fig 6a which is partially attributed to the measurement limit and accuracy of cdom tn tp chla and sdd china has a large number of clear alpine lakes on the tibetan plateau ma et al 2010 in the future we will collect additional clear oligotrophic lake samples to complement and refine our dataset we also welcome data contributions from other lakes around the world to obtain a global comprehensive dataset including the lake trophic state and the cdom absorption coefficient 5 conclusions 1 this study elucidated the optical properties and composition change in the cdom along trophic gradients and proposed a new classification of the trophic state using the cdom absorption coefficient which is easily and simply measured as the trophic level increased the cdom absorption coefficient significantly increased and a high molecular weight composition accounted for the higher percentage the large ranges of the cdom absorption coefficient

19787,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is an important optically active substance in aquatic environments and plays a key role in light attenuation and in the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemical cycles although the optical properties abundance sources cycles compositions and remote sensing estimations of cdom have been widely reported in different aquatic environments little is known about the optical properties and composition changes in cdom along trophic gradients therefore we collected 821 samples from 22 lakes along a trophic gradient oligotrophic to eutrophic in china from 2004 to 2015 and determined the cdom spectral absorption and nutrient concentrations the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chlorophyll a chla concentrations and the secchi disk depth sdd ranged from 0 02 to 24 75 mg l 0 002 3 471 mg l 0 03 882 66 μg l and 0 05 17 30 m respectively the trophic state index tsi ranged from 1 55 to 98 91 and covered different trophic states from oligotrophic to hyper eutrophic the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm a 254 ranged from 1 68 to 92 65 m 1 additionally the cdom sources and composition parameters including the spectral slope and relative molecular size value exhibited a substantial variability from the oligotrophic level to other trophic levels the natural logarithm value of the cdom absorption lna 254 is highly linearly correlated with the tsi r 2 0 92 p 001 n 821 oligotrophic lakes are distinguished by a 254 4 m 1 and mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes are classified as 4 a 254 10 and a 254 10 m 1 respectively the results suggested that the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 might be a more sensitive single indicator of the trophic state than tn tp chla and sdd therefore we proposed a cdom absorption coefficient and determined the threshold for defining the trophic state of a lake several advantages of measuring and estimating cdom including rapid experimental measurements potential in situ optical sensor measurements and large spatial scale remote sensing estimations make it superior to traditional tsi techniques for the rapid monitoring and assessment of lake trophic states graphical abstract image 1 keywords chromophoric dissolved organic matter trophic state index total nitrogen total phosphorus chlorophyll a 1 introduction the most commonly used paradigm to study lake environments and ecosystems is their trophic state which is widely used to assess the trophic level of lakes and manage the water quality in lakes carlson 1977 oligotrophic lakes have low nutrient loading and low productivity whereas eutrophic lakes show high nutrient loading and productivity wetzel 2001 this paradigm has been widely adopted by the general ecological community as well as by limnologists and lake managers knowledge of the trophic state of a lake is vital to understanding the structure and function of a lake s ecosystem and to predicting future trends under changing environmental conditions and developing appropriate mitigation strategies in general the trophic state of a lake is assessed using four water quality indicators total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chla and secchi disk depth sdd carlson 1977 kratzer and brezonik 2010 wetzel 2001 tn tp and chla are measured via chemical methods in a laboratory using water samples and the collection transportation and filtration of the samples greatly inhibit the rapid assessment and evaluation of the trophic state of a lake in addition due to the limited number of water samples collected and the subsequent slow laboratory analysis the results from trophic state assessments have low temporal and spatial resolutions particularly for large lakes lakes should be continuously monitored and rapidly assessed using easy to analyze indices in recent years technological developments have led to an increase in the use of in situ high frequency sensors that allow measurements to be taken at far higher temporal and spatial resolutions than can be achieved with traditional discrete sampling crawford et al 2014 dickey et al 2008 unfortunately in situ tn and tp sensors for high frequency monitoring have not been developed but some sensors for nitrogen and phosphorus species have been reported blaen et al 2016 therefore an alternative scheme to rapidly assess the trophic states of lakes using representative indicators that can be monitored via high frequency monitoring sensors is urgently needed chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom is an important optically active substance in aquatic ecosystems and affects the attenuation of ultraviolet and photosynthetically active radiation remote sensing estimations of the total suspended matter and chla concentrations global carbon and nutrient cycling ecosystem productivity heavy metal adsorption and transportation contaminant availability and drinking water treatment coble 2007 gonsior et al 2014 sharpless and blough 2014 zhang et al 2011c thus the sources composition cycle and transformation of cdom play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems in addition the fluorescent fraction of cdom referred to as cdom fluorescence or fluorescence dissolved organic matter fdom has been widely used to trace cdom distributions sources compositions and cycles zhang et al 2009 2010 and has been used as a surrogate for dissolved organic carbon doc lee et al 2015 biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations baker and inverarity 2004 liu et al 2014 at present several cdom fluorescence sensors such as the cyclops 7 turner designs usa the eco fl cdom fluorometer wetlabs usa the microflu cdom fluorometer trios gmbh germany the uv fluorometer seapoint and the exo2 fdom sensor ysi usa have been developed and widely used for the in situ monitoring of freshwater and marine ecosystems bowling et al 2016 joye et al 2011 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2014 watras et al 2011 therefore rapid development in the study of cdom has been observed with an increase of almost 150 sci papers every year in the past twenty years 1997 2016 fig s1 because cdom is one of the most important water color parameters and is closely linked to nutrients liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 some studies have proposed defining the lake trophic state using the nutrient color paradigm which includes cdom absorption webster et al 2008 williamson et al 1999 therefore the main aims of this study were to 1 present the cdom optical properties and composition changes along trophic gradients for more than 800 samples from 22 lakes ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic shallow to deep and small to large 2 develop an empirical relationship between cdom absorption and the trophic state index tsi and 3 discuss the potential application of assessing and monitoring the trophic state of a lake using cdom absorption 2 material and methods 2 1 study lakes and water sampling a total of 22 lakes around china fig 1 with elevations of less than 10 m to higher than 4450 m above sea level and various trophic states were sampled from 2004 to 2015 the lake areas ranged from less than 1 km2 2338 km2 a detailed description of the number of samples and the sampling time per lake are presented in table s1 the sampling time was from january to november however most of the samples were collected during the growing season from march to october table s1 which was consistent with carlson s tsi model that mainly considered the highest productive seasons in temperate lakes spring and summer carlson 1977 water samples were collected from a 0 1 0 m depth in 2 l or 5 l acid cleaned plastic bottles and were placed on ice in the field after collection the samples were immediately transported to the laboratory within 4 h in the laboratory most of the water samples were immediately filtered and then stored in the dark at 4 c the remaining water samples were stored at 20 c and filtered in less than three days and this process has been proven not to result in the loss of any chromophores zhang et al 2011a the water samples approximately 250 500 ml were filtered prior to the absorption analysis using pre combusted 0 7 μm gf f filters whatman to remove any organic matter and 0 22 μm cellulose membranes millipore that were pre rinsed with 50 ml of milli q water the filtrates were collected in brown glass bottles that had been heated at 450 c for 6 h to remove any organic matter the filtered samples were stored at 4 c in the laboratory and all of the measurements were completed within two weeks 2 2 uv visible uv vis absorption measurements the absorption spectra were obtained between 240 and 800 nm at 1 nm intervals using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2401pc with matching 4 cm quartz cells for samples collected from 2004 to 2008 a different uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550pc with matching 5 cm quartz cells was used for the samples collected from 2009 to 2015 for both the uv 2401pc and uv 2550pc spectrophotometers the slit width was 1 nm and the wavelength scan rate was 210 nm min 1 milli q water was used in the reference cell the absorbance measurements at each wavelength λ were corrected using the baseline for the backscattering of small particles and colloids through filters using the absorbance at 700 nm which has been widely used and accepted by many studies bricaud et al 1981 del castillo et al 1999 zhang et al 2011b the absorption coefficients were obtained using the following equation 1 a λ 2 303d λ r where a λ is the cdom absorption coefficient at wavelength λ m 1 d λ is the corrected optical density at wavelength λ and r is the cuvette path length in m because the optical density detection limit of the shimadzu uv 2401pc and uv 2550pc spectrophotometers is 0 0001 the precision of the cdom absorption coefficient is 0 005 m 1 the cdom abundance is often expressed using the absorption coefficient m 1 at a wavelength of 254 nm 350 nm or other longer wavelength in many studies table s2 although we measured the cdom absorption from 240 to 800 nm the absorption is near the limit or negative for wavelengths longer than 350 nm for some very clear water fig 2 therefore we used a 254 which has been widely used in other similar studies as the cdom abundance in this study clark et al 2008 maie et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 table s2 which has been suggested for other studies in the future particularly for very clear water absorption spectral slopes and slope ratios have been proposed as indicators of molecular weight and a source of cdom the slope ratio was calculated as the ratio of the spectral slope s 275 295 to s 350 400 helms et al 2008 because our dataset included some low cdom absorption samples with absorption coefficients near zero in the wavelength range of 350 400 nm the calculation of the spectral slope s 350 400 induced large uncertainty and error therefore we only used s 275 295 to characterize the cdom composition and sources in this study s 275 295 was calculated via a non linear regression over the 275 295 nm wavelength range to remove noise signals using the following equation helms et al 2008 stedmon et al 2000 2 a λ a λ 0 exp s λ 0 λ k where a λ is the absorption coefficient at wavelength λ a λ 0 is the absorption coefficient at a reference wavelength λ 0 and s is the spectral slope a measure of the decrease in the absorption with the increasing wavelength k is a background parameter that accounts for baseline shifts or attenuation due to factors other than the cdom the relative molecular size m i e the average molecular weight of the humic solute molecules was estimated from the ratio of the absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm which is based on the fact that decreasing ratios indicate an increasing molecular size jones et al 1988 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 3 m a 250 a 365 where a 250 and a 365 are the absorption coefficients at 250 nm and 365 nm respectively however for some very clear waters with a 365 less than 0 the m value was not calculated and excluded from further analysis our previous studies have indicated that the spectral slope is highly significantly correlated to the m value zhang et al 2011b and a significantly positive correlation between s 275 295 and the m value for our dataset in this study showed that both can be used to trace the cdom molecular weight fig 3 2 3 other water quality parameters information about the observation sites including the latitude longitude and altitude was obtained in situ using a global position system gps with an accuracy of 2 0 m a standard 30 cm diameter black and white quadrant secchi disk was used to measure the sdd kalff 2002 the water samples for chla 50 5000 ml based on the amount of phytoplankton were filtered through whatman gf f fiberglass filters chla was extracted with ethanol 90 at 80 c and analyzed spectrophotometrically at 750 and 665 nm before and after acidification with 1 mol l 1 hcl with a correction for phaeophytin a simis et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 the tn and tp were determined spectrophotometrically after the samples were digested with alkaline potassium persulfate according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater clesceri et al 1998 2 4 trophic state assessment over the past 40 years numerous studies have attempted to assess the trophic state of lakes using water quality indices carlson 1977 and walker 1979 proposed an assessment of the eutrophication progress based on the tsi which depends on the mean chla tp concentrations and sdd many authors improved and revised the tsi by including the tn water color doc and dissolved reactive manganese cudowski 2015 forsberg 1980 webster et al 2008 williamson et al 1999 the trophic state was assessed using the improved carlson tsi based on four water quality indices chla tn tp and sdd jing et al 2008 wang et al 2013 specifically tsi was calculated through weighted mean based on the following five equations 4 tsi 0 326tsi chla 0 219tsi tn 0 230tsi tp 0 225tsi sdd 5 tsi chla 10 2 5 1 0861nchla 6 tsi tp 10 9 436 1 6241ntp 7 tsi tn 10 5 453 1 6941ntn 8 tsi sdd 10 5 118 1 941nsdd where tsi chla tsi tn tsi tp and tsi sdd were trophic state index in relation to chla tn tp and sdd respectively chla tn tp and sdd were chlorophyll a μg l total nitrogen mg l and total phosphorus mg l concentrations and secchi disk depth m 2 5 statistical analyses statistical analyses including the mean values as well as linear and non linear fitting were performed using statistical program for social sciences spss 11 0 software because the number of different trophic states substantially differed the differences in the parameters among different trophic states were assessed using independent sample t tests p 05 regression analyses were used to examine the relationships among the a 254 s 275 295 m value sdd nutrients and pigment concentrations the significance levels are reported as not significant p 05 or significant p 05 distribution maps of lakes and sampling sites were made using arcgis 11 2 and other data graphs were made using origin 10 5 including prediction intervals around the regression line 3 results 3 1 water chemistry and lake trophic state the sampled lakes and sampling sites covered a wide range of nutrient compositions phytoplankton biomass concentrations transparencies trophic states and cdom absorptions and compositions table 1 the tn tp chla and sdd values ranged from 0 02 to 24 75 mg l 0 002 3 471 mg l 0 03 882 66 μg l and 0 05 17 30 m respectively the maximum values of tn tp chla and sdd were 1650 2042 29422 and 346 folds greater than the minimum values respectively in comparison the tsi and the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 exhibited smaller ranges and the ratios of the maximum to minimum values were 64 and 55 respectively however the a 254 and tsi values still showed large variations from 1 68 to 92 65 m 1 and 1 55 to 98 91 respectively revealing a span from oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes the cdom composition parameters s 275 295 and the m value ranged from 14 73 to 59 55 μm 1 and 3 66 to 49 05 respectively in addition the mean values were markedly higher than the median values for tn tp chla and sdd however the mean values were close to the median value for the tsi and a 254 overall our lake dataset covered a wide range of trophic states with differences from one to five orders of magnitude in the tn tp chla and sdd values which showed that our dataset was representative of a wide variety of lakes according to the standard trophic categories jing et al 2008 wang et al 2013 tsi 30 indicates oligotrophic 30 tsi 50 indicates mesotrophic and tsi 50 indicates eutrophic our lake dataset contained lake samples from oligotrophic 144 17 5 mesotrophic 213 26 0 and eutrophic lakes 464 56 5 3 2 cdom optical properties along trophic gradients the cdom absorption coefficient almost linearly increased with increases in the trophic level i e 3 23 0 93 6 07 2 65 13 43 3 29 19 32 3 86 and 27 52 9 83 m 1 for the oligotrophic mesotrophic light eutrophic middle eutrophic and hyper eutrophic levels respectively fig 4 fig s2 the cdom composition parameters namely the spectral slope and relative molecular size significantly decreased from the oligotrophic level to the other trophic levels p 001 as determined by t tests fig 4 for example the spectral slope and relative molecular size were 34 08 8 77 μm 1 and 16 56 9 29 for the oligotrophic level and 23 61 5 81 μm 1 and 8 52 1 88 for the mesotrophic level however the spectral slope and relative molecular size either did not change or only slightly decreased from the mesotrophic level to the other trophic levels fig 4 these results showed that the cdom absorption coefficient significantly increased but the cdom composition only slightly changed from the mesotrophic level to the other high trophic levels the cdom was expected to have a dominant autochthonous input for the oligotrophic level and a dominant allochthonous input for the other trophic levels therefore the cdom absorption coefficient significantly increased but the cdom position only slightly changed from the mesotrophic level to the other high trophic levels 3 3 correlations between the cdom optical properties and the tsi tsi tn tp and chla were all significantly positively correlated with the cdom absorption coefficient whereas the sdd significantly negatively was correlated with the cdom absorption coefficient figs 5 and 6 of the four independent parameters the chla concentration provided the best explanation of the variation in the cdom absorption fig 5 however the sub dataset with lnchla less than 2 in fig 5c does not conform to a linear regression which is partially attributed to the measurement limit and accuracy of cdom and chla due to very low chla concentrations in addition the power function regressions performed to correlate the cdom absorption coefficient with tn r 2 0 66 tp r 2 0 70 chla r 2 0 83 and sdd r 2 0 81 as the sole parameters had lower explanatory rates than the regressions performed with tn tp chla and sdd to calculate the tsi r 2 0 92 as a synthetic parameter and thus correlate the cdom absorption coefficient figs 5 and 6 therefore the cdom absorption coefficient can be considered a synthetic indicator to characterize the trophic level of a lake using the linear relationships of the cdom absorption coefficient and the tsi tsi 24 00 lna 254 5 17 fig 6a and the trophic state classification standard based on the tsi jing et al 2008 wang et al 2013 we proposed a trophic state classification standard using the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm table 2 a 254 values less than 4 m 1 correspond to a tsi less than 30 and are defined to classify an oligotrophic state 4 a 254 10 and a 254 10 are defined to classify mesotrophic and eutrophic states respectively table 2 additionally the light eutrophic moderately eutrophic and hyper eutrophic states are classified according to 10 a 254 15 15 a 254 23 and a 254 23 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 optical properties and composition changes in cdom along trophic gradients numerous studies on the optical and fluorescence properties transformation and cycle processes and remote sensing estimations of cdom have been reported fellman et al 2010 helms et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 2010 zhu et al 2013 our dataset with a 254 from 1 68 to 92 65 m 1 s 275 295 from 14 73 to 59 55 μm 1 and m values from 3 66 to 49 05 covered most values reported in inland waters with different trophic levels table s2 however to the best of our knowledge this study constitutes the first comprehensive investigation of the cdom absorption coefficient and composition characteristics over a large range of trophic gradients although we previously reported that the cdom absorption increased significantly as the trophic state increased from oligotrophic to mesotrophic and eutrophic states in the yungui plateau lakes zhang et al 2010 the dataset in this study included data from lakes that were more complex than those used in our previous study in addition although bio optical and biogeochemical properties such as the chla specific absorption coefficient and the phytoplankton size classes of different trophic gradients have been reported in oceanic waters brotas et al 2013 oubelkheir et al 2005 few studies have focused on the relationship among the cdom absorption coefficient the composition parameters and the tsi zhang et al 2010 the large range of trophic states explored in the present study provided a unique opportunity to determine general trends in the cdom absorption and composition variability in lake ecosystems along the trophic gradient the present study confirmed that the natural logarithm value of the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 linearly increased with increases in the tsi fig 6a in contrast the cdom composition parameters i e the spectral slope and relative molecular size varied greatly when the tsi was lower than 30 and only slightly varied when the tsi was greater than 30 fig 6b and c therefore significant differences in the cdom composition were recorded between the oligotrophic state and the other trophic states in addition the cdom spectral slope and the relative molecular size decreased as the tsi increased which indicated that the mesotrophic and eutrophic states had higher molecular weight compositions than the oligotrophic state although no systematic study has investigated the cdom absorption coefficient and composition as a function of the trophic state some piecemeal comparative studies and literature data confirmed and supported our results table s2 for example the hyper eutrophic pampulha reservoir had significantly higher nutrient concentrations 21 folds higher for tn and 28 for tp and chla value 5 8 times than the oligotrophic lake dom helvécio which corresponded to a higher cdom absorption coefficient at 350 nm 3 3 fold higher brandão et al 2016 additionally the hyper eutrophic pampulha reservoir s 275 295 20 μm 1 m value 7 0 7 3 had a lower spectral slope and smaller molecular size values than oligotrophic lake dom helvécio s 275 295 30 μm 1 m value 11 8 13 7 similar to our study results which indicated the higher molecular size of the cdom in the pampulha reservoir than in lake dom helvécio brandão et al 2016 in addition the literature data showed that the cdom absorption coefficients of clear and oligotrophic alpine and mountain lakes were markedly lower than those of mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes and reservoirs gons et al 2008 laurion et al 2000 liu et al 2014 mladenov et al 2011 sandjensen and staehr 2009 zhang et al 2009 2010 for lakes with different trophic states the land use watershed land cover hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic activities varied greatly and the variations resulted in large differences in the cdom abundances and compositions gons et al 2008 sandjensen and staehr 2009 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 therefore additional future studies are needed to link the land use land cover hydrologic conditions and anthropogenic activities with the lake trophic state and the cdom abundance and composition 4 2 implications for monitoring and assessing lake eutrophication eutrophication due to excessive nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment is a global water environmental problem smith et al 1999 lake eutrophication can result in algal blooms and water quality degradation which affect the services provided by the lake ecosystem the tsi provides an overall assessment of the trophic degree and promotes data grouping and organization to guide decision making and aid water resource management therefore over the past four decades efforts have been devoted to the classification of the trophic states of different aquatic ecosystems carlson 1977 cunha et al 2013 dodds et al 1998 walker 1979 webster et al 2008 most classification systems have been based on water column variables such as the inorganic nutrient concentrations phytoplankton abundance and biomass and primary production values a tsi for temperate lakes was proposed by carlson and was based on the empirical relationships among the chla tp and sdd values carlson 1977 cunha et al proposed a new tsi for tropical subtropical reservoirs using the tp and chla concentrations cunha et al 2013 webster et al integrated the tp and colored doc values to define the lake trophic state using a diverse dataset from 1646 northern temperate lakes webster et al 2008 the highly linear relationship between the cdom absorption and the tsi based on the large dataset in our study which covers lakes with different trophic states provides strong quantitative support for considering the cdom absorption coefficient as a trophic classification standard because the effect of water color on the chla and sdd values is independent of the tp concentration ignoring the water color can result in a serious misinterpretation of the limnological data particularly for lower sdd values solely due to an increased algal biomass stimulated by nutrient enrichment webster et al 2008 in contrast the cdom absorption characterizes the water color and includes the nutrients more importantly using the cdom absorption coefficient instead of the nutrients to characterize the lake trophic state has at least three other marked advantages first cdom optical measurements are relatively simple and sensitive and only require minimal sample pretreatment thus rapid cdom measurement covering a large amount samples can be carried out second the spatial distribution of the cdom absorption coefficient can be easily mapped using remote sensing with a wide spatial resolution of less than 1 m to more than 1 km currently many algorithms exist to estimate the cdom absorption coefficient 412 355 300 nm and other wavelengths and to map the spatial distribution using handheld airborne spectrometers land observing satellite sensors e g ikonos landsat etm spot and ocean color satellite sensors e g seawifs meris modis kahru and mitchell 2001 kowalczuk et al 2010 kutser 2012 kutser et al 2005 zhu et al 2011 2013 third a cdom high frequency in situ monitoring sensor can provide a high temporal resolution minute and hour scales for cdom dynamics bowling et al 2016 joye et al 2011 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2014 watras et al 2011 combining the high spatial resolution of remote sensing and the high temporal resolution of in situ monitoring a proposed trophic state classification using the cdom absorption coefficient can provide a global or regional estimation of the long term continuous dynamic changes in the trophic states of lakes and this method can make up for the disadvantages of trophic state assessments using nutrients and phytoplankton biomass in addition knowing the global distribution and long term dynamics of the trophic states of lakes is vital for eutrophication prevention and control drinking water safety and lake ecosystem management 4 3 data uncertainty our analysis endeavored to include a large dataset that covered the large variability in trophic states and cdom absorption coefficients therefore our assessment model should be applicable for most lakes around the world with similar nutrient and cdom ranges as those found in this study tn 0 02 25 00 mg l tp 0 002 3 500 mg l and a 254 1 50 to 95 00 m 1 as compared in table s2 however our dataset did not include humic lakes with low nutrient concentrations but high amounts of humic substances i e a low trophic level tn less than 2 50 mg l and tp less than 40 μg l and a high cdom absorption i e an a 254 value of more than 340 m 1 groeneveld et al 2016 and these lakes are extensively distributed throughout north america and europe therefore some errors or uncertainties are likely if the proposed trophic state classification is applied to lakes with high humification due to peat covered catchment areas overgrown coniferous forests and peat mosses caution should be taken in performing tsi assessments for lakes with high humification using cdom absorption caution should be taken in performing tsi assessment for high humification lakes using cdom absorption another potential weakness is that the numbers of samples for the different trophic states were not evenly distributed our dataset included a relatively low percentage of oligotrophic samples 17 5 which might introduce some uncertainties for oligotrophic lakes and this is particularly true for extremely clear alpine and polar lakes that have a cdom absorption coefficient a 254 which is markedly less than the minimum value of 1 68 m 1 in our dataset mladenov et al 2011 if the cdom absorption coefficient a 254 is correlated to the tsi for the sub dataset blue hollow square which has a tsi less than 20 the linear fit yellow linear fitting line in fig 6a still provides the highest coefficient of determination and explanation rate but the linear slope and coefficient of determination tsi 11 03 lna 254 0 42 r 2 0 31 n 78 p 001 is markedly lower than that of the whole dataset fig 6a which is partially attributed to the measurement limit and accuracy of cdom tn tp chla and sdd china has a large number of clear alpine lakes on the tibetan plateau ma et al 2010 in the future we will collect additional clear oligotrophic lake samples to complement and refine our dataset we also welcome data contributions from other lakes around the world to obtain a global comprehensive dataset including the lake trophic state and the cdom absorption coefficient 5 conclusions 1 this study elucidated the optical properties and composition change in the cdom along trophic gradients and proposed a new classification of the trophic state using the cdom absorption coefficient which is easily and simply measured as the trophic level increased the cdom absorption coefficient significantly increased and a high molecular weight composition accounted for the higher percentage the large ranges of the cdom absorption coefficient and the trophic states and the highly significantly correlation between the cdom absorption coefficient and the tsi demonstrated that the cdom absorption coefficient can be used as a new trophic state classification index 2 the rapid and simple experimental measurements large spatial scale remote sensing estimation and high frequency in situ monitoring offered by this new method will allow more rapid monitoring and assessments of lake trophic states than can be achieved using the traditional tsi methods 3 our results highlight the importance of cdom for both management applications and expanding our understanding of how lakes are influenced by the cdom input and cycle future works should focus on the global assessment of lake trophic states using our proposed classification standard

based on reference standards and internal materials the major transformation products were identified as 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole 2 mebt for the degradation of 1h benzotriazole bt and as 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt and 1 4 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole 1 4 dmebt for the degradation of 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 mebt and most probably also 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5 mebt the leakage of wastewater pipelines is most probably the source of bts sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity give rise to perched aquifer conditions that lead to the temporal storage of leaking effluents and presumably the majority of bts transformation processes via methylation and tautomerization the most stable bttps entered the saturated zone of the aquifer where they prevailed concentrations up to 1500 ng l 1 were measured for the 2 4 dmebt which suggest a contamination risk for groundwater that is or may be used as a source for drinking water in the case of a constant input of pollutant loads from sewer systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban groundwater intergranular aquifer leaking effluents benzotriazoles transformation products 1 introduction many different synthetic organic chemicals are used in large quantities worldwide for different purposes and they are continuously released into the aquatic environment some of them are classified as contaminants of emerging concern cecs and might be candidates for future regulation anderson et al 2012 benzotriazoles bts have been regarded as cecs because they are widespread and persistent in the aquatic environment cantwell et al 2015 dummer 2014 giraudo et al 2017 richardson and ternes 2014 as an effective corrosion inhibitor they are used for the protection of metal surfaces and as an additive for several substances and materials that could come into contact with metals during use finšgar and milošev 2010 janna et al 2011 kadar et al 2010 kim et al 2011 vetter and lorenz 2013 the 1h benzotriazole bt parent compound and its derivatives 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 mebt and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5 mebt are the most widely employed bts hart et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2010 they may not be degraded easily they have a limited sorption tendency they are only 10 70 removed by conventional wastewater treatments and they are resistant to photochemical degradation in aquifers due to the lack of light hart et al 2004 janna et al 2011 liu et al 2011a 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 voutsa et al 2006 weiss et al 2006 although the occurrence sources and concentrations of bts in wastewaters surface and groundwaters are well known alotaibi et al 2015a cantwell et al 2015 careghini et al 2015 giger et al 2006 herrero et al 2014 kiss and fries 2009 2012 liu et al 2011b 2013 information about their fate in aquifers remains absent the process has generally been investigated using laboratory experiments alotaibi et al 2015b ilieva et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 and to a much lesser extent at field sites breedveld et al 2003 which can be attributed to the difficulty of monitoring the bts transformation in the aquifer breedveld et al 2003 investigated the behaviour of bts in groundwater resulting from the use of de icing fluids at an abandoned airport two years after the termination of these de icing activities no proof of the bts transformation could be found in the anaerobic aquifer in contrast to the field observations the laboratory studies conducted by liu et al 2011b 2013 and alotaibi et al 2015b detected the degradation of bt and 5 mebt while 4 mebt was not investigated the microcosm and column experiments using fresh water and aquifer materials indicated an about 60 degradation of bt and 5 mebt under aerobic or anaerobic conditions several transformation products were proposed and this is commented on in subsection 3 3 the differences in the biodegradation studies of bts in mimic and native aquifers alotaibi et al 2015b breedveld et al 2003 ilieva et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 indicated that the bts biotransformation pathways depend on site specific hydrogeological and biogeochemical conditions as well as on the organic loading the factors controlling the bts behaviour in an oxic intergranular aquifer were investigated in ljubljana the capital of slovenia the qualitative groundwater monitoring identified a plume of unknown contaminants with a significant peak from a compound with a base ion mass to charge ratio m z of 147 within an industrialized area which has prompted a detailed study the gc ms and lc ms analytical testing of groundwater suggested that the investigated compounds belong to a chemical class of bts and their transformation products bttps to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the bts fate in groundwater on the field scale however huntscha et al 2014 investigated the bttps in effluents of wastewater treatment plants and their impacts on rivers and groundwater near a riverbank filtration which means their findings are also valuable for the present study the first aim of our investigation was to identify and quantify the bttps in urban intergranular aquifers based on gc ms and lc ms techniques which was a great challenge due to the lack of reference standards the second aim was to investigate the possible pathways for bts degradation with respect to the environmental forces and anthropogenic activities that lead to it entering groundwater bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the plume of the bt pollutants was detected in the piezometer pu 9 the study site fig 1 is a part of an unconfined ljubljana field alluvial aquifer the unsaturated zone is 20 m deep on average whereas the aquifer depth is approximately 90 m the sediments composed mainly of carbonates and silicates uhan and krajnc 2003 are very heterogeneous the upper strata consist mostly of sands and gravels and the lower mostly of conglomerates bračič železnik et al 2005 vizintin et al 2009 the lenses of the low permeability clay and the sandy clay layers locally divide the aquifer into the upper and lower aquifers the site s effective porosity ranges between 5 and 12 and the groundwater velocity is between 5 and 19 m day 1 trček et al 2010 the aquifer receives a natural recharge from rainfall and via a lateral inflow from the south 2 2 experimental set up the study was established at the piezometer pu 9 and at three boreholes at distances up to 500 m the upper saturated zone was investigated in the piezometers pu 6 and pu 7 and the lower saturated zone in the piezometer pu 7 and the well pu 4 fig 1 the latter is only 2 m from the piezometer pu 9 but it penetrates layers of the lower aquifer that is a source of drinking water for about 280 000 inhabitants during the experiment the groundwater table t and sec were recorded continuously at 1 h intervals for all the observation points with the solinst dataloggers model 3001 ltc junior www solinst com and the basic physicochemical and microbiological properties of groundwater were determined to trace groundwater flow the contaminant transport and impacts on bts transformation table 1 the oxic conditions were reflected in the aquifer for 1 5 years the monitoring protocol was focused on identifying and quantifying the compound with m z 147 and the accompanying compounds groundwater sampling was performed alternately for the qualitative and quantitative gc ms analysis in a monthly period samples were taken after five times the volume of the piezometer was pumped out and ph t and sec had stabilized while pumping the pump was installed in borehole screens 10 and 40 m below the water table for sampling the upper and lower aquifers respectively a total of 72 groundwater samples were collected all the samples were stored in brown glass bottles without any treatment the samples were transported to the accredited laboratory of the public water supply company vodovod kanalizacija slovenia vo ka immediately at the beginning and at the end of the experiment vo ka prepared two groundwater samples of the piezometer pu 9 also for lc ms and lc tof ms analyses at the jožef stefan institute department of environmental sciences slovenia the research was oriented to an exploration of possible pathways for the bts transformation in the aquifer afterwards as the plume of the bts pollutants was already diluted the passive inox samplers with integrated active carbon ac were installed at three different depths of the pu 9 pu 6 and pu 7 screens fig 1 for approximately 4 months to monitor the distribution of the bts and bttps in the aquifer s horizontal and vertical directions the preparation of the passive samplers and the gc ms analyses of the materials adsorbed on them were conducted by vo ka according to the iso 5667 23 2011 standards for sampling the passive samplers were all made of stainless steel just prior to installation in the piezometers approximately 3 g of ac was added into each passive sampler the ac was pre treated in the laboratory after cleaning by heating to 300 c it was reactivated by a water steam and transported in ultrapure water upw to the field site the ac for the field blanks was exposed to air at the sampling site during the installation of the passive samplers as well as during their collection at the end of the experiment the seasonal monitoring for the quantification of the two most abundant bttps was established for the observation locations pu 4 pu 6 and pu 9 fig 1 a total of 29 groundwater samples have been collected so far and analysed by gc ms at vo ka 2 3 chemical analysis 2 3 1 chemicals extra pure food grade quality 1 5 mm granular ac merck germany was applied for the passive sampling devices all the chemicals were purchased in the highest available purity as described in the supplementary material 2 3 2 gc ms qualitative analyses of water samples the compounds were extracted from 7 l of water samples using dcm and a separator funnel with a ptfe stopcock 1000 ml of the water sample was mixed with 75 ml of dcm and shaken carefully until the water and organic phases were separated and then the water phase was discarded the extract was dried by anhydrous sodium sulphate and transferred to the evaporation tube after evaporation by a steam of nitrogen the remaining extract 50 μl was transferred to chromatographic vials all the extracts were analysed by gc ms agilent gc6900 qp5890 usa the target compounds were separated on the hp 5ms ui column 30 m 0 22 mm 0 25 μm thickness with helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 constant flow

temperatures were set to 250 280 250 and 170 c respectively the interpretation of the total ion chromatograms tic of the gc ms in scan mode was performed with the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system amdis the deconvolution was covered by the agilent retention times library 5989 5076en and the library of mass spectra auersperger et al 2008 2011 three types of laboratory blanks were also analysed along with the samples to assess the potential sample contamination as described in auersperger et al 2008 2 3 3 gc ms qualitative analyses of adsorbed material on the passive sampler after the collection the granular ac was dried in an oven at 100 c for 1 h 3 ml of dcm were added for the elution of the adsorbed material in the ultrasonic bath the extract was transferred to chromatographic vials and concentrated in a stream of nitrogen all the extracts were analysed by gc ms clarus 600 perkin elmer usa the target compounds were separated on the hp 5ms ui column 30 m 0 22 mm 0 25 μm thickness with helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 constant flow after 2 min a volume of 8 μl was injected pulsed split less the oven was programmed from 35 c 1 min to 280 c with a total run time of 50 min the inlet injection port transfer line and ion source temperatures were set to 80 280 280 and 250 c respectively the gc ms chromatogram interpretation was performed as described in subsection 2 3 2 ac was stored in the laboratory in upw for the entire installation duration of each sampling series and analysed along with the passive samplers for quality control compounds that were identified in the blank tests were excluded from the reports a spiked quality control sample with volatile and semi volatile compounds from benzene to carbamazepine was processed in parallel with each series of samples 2 3 4 bts and bttps identification the mass spectrum of each peak in the tic of the gc ms in scan mode was de convoluted with amdis the tentative identification of the bts and bttps was performed by comparing their retention times and area ratios with those from the nist 2008 library of mass spectra the bts and candidate bttps were further confirmed or rejected by authentic and internal standards matching their masses since the reference standards for some bttps were not available two mixtures were synthesised from reference parent compounds the experiment based on well known facts about relative stabilities of bts tautomers roth et al 1999 the first mixture was prepared by the direct heating of two glass vials filled with 3 mg of bt and 100 μl iodomethane respectively under the closed system conditions at 80 c the synthesised compound was re dissolved in dcm and analysed by gc ms two bttps were identified and confirmed by reference standards 1 mebt and 2 mebt the second mixture was prepared from 4 mebt the glass vials with 3 mg of 4 mebt was heated at 80 c in a glass tube together with 100 μl of iodomethane for 1 h the synthesised compound was re dissolved in the dcm and analysed by gc ms three bttps were identified based on the nist 2008 library of mass spectra and the analogy with the first synthetized mixture 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt 1 4 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole 1 5 dmebt the reference standards and synthesised compounds were also verified by lc ms and lc tof ms analyses 2 3 4 1 lc ms and lc tof ms analysis the mass measurements were run on a hybrid quadruple time of flight mass spectrometer q tof provided with an orthogonal z spray electrospray esi interface waters micromass manchester uk for the lc ms measurements the mass spectrometer was interfaced to an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system based on a water acquity waters milford usa binary pump in the first set of the experiment the c18 ascentis express 50 2 1 mm 2 0 μm particles supelco lc column was used while the longer luna omega c18 100 2 1 mm 1 6 μm particles phenomenex column was used in the second set at the same elution conditions the mobile phases consisted of 0 1 of formic acid in water a and acetonitrile b the elution gradient was linearly increased from 10 b to 90 b in 6 min and then back to the initial conditions the total run time including the conditioning of the column to the initial conditions was 7 min compressed nitrogen was used as both the drying and the nebulizing gas the nebulizer gas flow rate was set to approximately 20 l h 1 and the de solvation gas flow rate to 600 l h 1 a cone voltage of 30 v and a capillary voltage of 3 0 kv were used in positive ion mode the de solvation temperature was set to 300 c and the source temperature to 130 c a mass resolution of approximately 9000 was used for accurate mass measurements hrms and the determination of the elemental composition of the target ions the mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode over an m z range of 50 1000 in a scan time 1 s and an inter scan time 0 1 s similar experimental conditions were used for tandem mass spectrometric ms ms measurements of selected ions at 20 v collision energy the data station operating software was mass lynx v 4 1 micromass manchester 2 3 5 gc ms quantitative analyses of water samples the concentrations were quantified for two bttps with the most intensive peak areas 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt due to the volatility of the discussed bttps the modified epa 525 2 method was applied it is based on solid phase extraction spe and gc ms analyses as described in auersperger et al 2005 the first modification referred to the evaporation of the spe extracts 100 μl of extract was taken for the first gc ms analysis from 1 ml of the remaining dcm after partial evaporation the remaining dcm was evaporated to dryness and re dissolved in acetone for the second gc ms analysis the second modification referred to the injection technique a cold injection was used quantification was made according to the internal standard method the commercially available 2 mebt was used for the analysis of both bttps because a reference material for 2 4 dmebt is not available the concentrations of 2 4 dmebt were reported relative to the response for 2 mebt for an internal standard deuterated 1 methyl 1h benzotriazole d4 prepared from commercially available 1 h benzotriazole d4 by methylation with iodomethane was used the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were 1 0 and 3 3 for 2 mebt and 2 0 and 6 7 for 2 4 dmebt respectively field blanks were prepared according to the epa 525 2 method from upw that was sequentially transferred from one bottle to another at each sampling site regular spiked quality control samples were analysed with each chromatographic run including blanks of spring water used for the calibration 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of bts pollutants the scan data from the gc ms qualitative analyses were carefully screened for the bts pollutants they were tentatively identified by a comparison of their mass spectra with data from the nist 2008 mass spectral library the candidates were either confirmed or rejected through gc ms retention times and area ratios on the one hand and through lc ms matching on the other the results indicated that the investigated compounds belong to a chemical class of bts pollutants that are listed in table 2 the 2 mebt and 1 mebt were identified based on the synthesised compound from the bt reference standard subsection 2 3 4 considering a different physical properties boiling points of the parent compound and two bttps that were reflected in retention time and b the fact that 2h tautomers are more favourable in gas phase at higher temperatures roth et al 1999 the two bttps were confirmed by the reference standards as well as the parent compounds for more information refer to figs s 1a f s 3 and s 4a e based on the lc tof ms study c8h9n3 was found to be the most probable molecular formula for the other three bttps with m z equal to 147 table 2 consequently the gc ms study tentatively identified the most abundant compound in groundwater as 2 4 dmebt and the other two with the same molecular formula but different retention time as 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt the only available dimethyl bts reference standard for purchase was 5 6 dmebt since there was no matching with any of the three bttps figs s 1g and s 4f i the synthesised compound from the 4 mebt reference standard was used for their confirmation the compound contained a mixture of 1 4 dmebt 2 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt listed in terms of their abundance subsection 2 3 4 they were identified based on differences in physical properties boiling points retention time between 4 mebt and 1 4 dmebt 5 mebt and 1 5 dmebt and the analogy with the bt transformation related to 2h tautomers the tic of the gc ms analyses of the synthesised mixture and the mass spectrum of its bttps are presented in figs s 2a d whereas the lc ms ion chromatograms and the mass spectrum of the discussed compounds are presented in figs s 4g h i respectively ion chromatogram at m z 148 illustrated in fig s 4g indicated that the synthesised compound from 4 mebt contained at least two isomers of dmebt based on the gc ms data the isomer at a retention time of 2 02 is the 2 4 dmebt figs s 1a g s 2 s 4a f g h i table 2 the peak areas of the investigated compounds obtained from the gc ms qualitative analyses of the water samples are illustrated in fig 2 it should be noted that they do not reflect the concentration of a compound completely because of the different ionization efficiencies comparing with other sampling locations the abundance of bts pollutants was as expected 7 to 30 times higher in groundwater of the piezometer pu 9 nevertheless the bttps prevailed everywhere the 2 4 dmebt 2 mebt 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt were identified in all the groundwater samples but in different proportions depending on the location the peak intensities of the 1 5 dmebt were negligible everywhere while the 1 mebt was not detected at all the latter bttp was identified only by a gc ms qualitative analysis of the adsorbed material on the passive sampler that was installed in the piezometer pu 9 table 3 the 2 4 dmebt was the most intense bttps in the piezometer pu 9 and in the adjacent well pu 4 capturing groundwater of the upper and lower aquifers respectively fig 2 the peak intensity was at least one third lower for the 1 4 dmebt and even more for the 2 mebt the 4 mebt was the most abundant bts in the discussed groundwater particularly in the piezometer pu 9 on the other hand the proportions between the 2 4 dmebt and 2 mebt responses were similar in groundwater of the piezometers pu 7 and pu 6 capturing the upper aquifer at a 240 m and 480 m distance respectively the 1 4 dmebt was more than 50 less abundant in these waters where the bt prevailed among the bts the vertical distribution of bts pollutants in the aquifer was investigated using the data from the 2 m distant boreholes pu 4 and pu 9 fig 1 in comparison with pu 9 the abundance of pollutants is approximately 20 times lower in the pu 4 groundwater whereas the proportions between the compounds are similar except for the bt with higher peak intensity among the bts fig 2 the vertical distribution of bttps in the aquifer was also examined with the help of passive samplers fig 1 the results of the gc ms qualitative analyses of the adsorbed material in the piezometers pu 9 pu 7 and pu 6 are presented in table 3 the bttps are reported in relative intensities 1 5 based on the peak areas for 80 100 of the maximum peak area the relative intensity was defined as very high 5 for 60 80 it was high 4 for 40 60 it was moderate 3 for 20 40 it was low 2 while for 0 20 it was very low 1 the highest abundance of bttps is found in groundwater above the clayey lenses at depths between 25 and 28 m fig 1 3 2 environmental relevance of the bttps the concentrations were quantified and semi quantified for two of the most abundant and presumably most stable bttps by gc ms i e 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively the time plot of the 2 4 dmebt concentration in the sampled groundwater before the plume s dilution is illustrated in fig 2e whereas table 4 presents the minimum median and maximum values of 2 4 dmebt and 2 mebt at sampling locations before and after the plume s dilution the 2 mebt concentration was measured only after the plume s dilution the parameter ranged between 4 5 and 174 ng l 1 its median values were 40 70 lower in comparison to the 2 4 dmebt values in the upper aquifer the 2 4 dmebt concentration ranged between 6 1 and 1458 ng l 1 in groundwater before the plume s dilution while its range was between 0 1 and 145 ng l 1 afterwards the 2 4 dmebt oscillation fig 2e suggested a pulse input of bts pollutants in the pu 9 vicinity the water table 2 4 dmebt and sec of the piezometer pu 9 were not correlated nevertheless an increase in the sec values was most often connected with a significant increase in the water table which reflects the displacement of pre stored water in the aquifer it is presumed that groundwater with higher sec values is stored above the upper clayey lenses and it is discharged to the aquifer s lower parts during intensive hydrological events this explains the highest abundance of bts pollutants in groundwater flowing above the sector with the densest lenses of clayey sediments at depths between 25 and 28 m fig 2 table 3 where the recharged water has been concentrated and the horizontal flow has been developed the process was determined also with environmental tracers and 3h 3he isotopic investigations trček et al 2013 indicating that the pu 4 groundwater is 7 years older from the pu 9 groundwater on average accordingly the 2 4 dmebt medians were 22 times lower before and after the plume s dilution in the well pu 4 capturing groundwater of the lower aquifer than in the adjacent piezometer pu 9 however the 2 4 dmebt oscillation was not correlated neither among the two and nor among the other sampling locations the pu 6 was the only location where the median of the discussed parameter increased after the plume s dilution which most probably reflects a connection to a different pollution source the leakage of the industrial and or public wastewater pipelines is supposed to be the most probable source of bts pollutants in the study site which has already been highlighted as a problem for this area and for the whole city of ljubljana trček et al 2013 vizintin et al 2009 wastewater could contain up to 100 000 ng l 1 of bts due to their widespread use alotaibi et al 2015a it was discovered that approximately 99 of the bts amount used in the dishwasher did not remain on the dishes but was released into the wastewater treatment vetter and lorenz 2013 whereas the discharge from dishwashing machines represents approximately 30 of the total input of bts into residential wastewater janna et al 2011 a part of the wastewater pipelines had to be repaired during the presented study which resulted in an 87 reduction of the 2 4 dmebt median after the plume s dilution in both the piezometer pu 9 and the adjacent well pu 4 table 4 nevertheless these data warn of a contamination risk for groundwater sources stored in the lower aquifer in the case of a constant input of pollutant loads from sewer systems 3 3 proposed mechanism and biotransformation pathways low permeability clayey layers give rise to perched aquifer conditions that lead to the temporal storage of leaked wastewater and presumably the majority of the bts transformation processes considering that the transformation in groundwater has not been substantiated with a calculation using the advection dispersion equation data not shown here as well as with previous field investigations breedveld et al 2003 the presence of organic matter in wastewater and on a clay surface might stimulate the bts transformation mcallister and semple 2010 the results of batch experiments huntscha et al 2014 indicated that no specific bacterial population had to grow and no specific enzymes had to be induced for the transformation which was referred to the co metabolic biotransformation alvarez cohen and speitel 2001 the transformation process may also have been encouraged by the increased wastewater temperature due to the significant impacts of hot industrial effluents or larger quantities of dishwasher discharge cheng et al 2006 puttanna et al 1999 the non degraded bts and bttps have been gradually discharging from the unsaturated zone and entered the aquifer saturated zone where stable bttps prevailed table 2 fig 2 their proposed transformation pathways are presented in fig 4 the 5 mebt and bt were shown to degrade much faster than the 4 mebt under aerobic conditions huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 weiss et al 2006 which resulted in a negligible abundance of the 5 mebt and bt in comparison to the 4 mebt in the piezometer pu 9 where the residence time of the bts pollutants was the shortest fig 2 thus it is presumed that the bt and the 5 mebt were almost completely transformed on the other hand the comparison with data from the hydraulically connected boreholes pu 4 and pu 7 indicated an increase of the bt portion with a longer residence time according to ex situ experiments liu et al 2011b 2013 the bt could be the result of a transformation of the 4 mebt via a demethylation process however the contribution of the parent bt from additional pollution sources could not be excluded the 2 4 dmebt 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt were shown to be transformation products of the 4 mebt formed via methylation and tautomerization subsection 3 1 besides other bttp candidates bttps with m z equal to 147 were also detected with microcosm and batch experiments under aerobic conditions but tentatively identified as 2 5 dimethyl benzoxazole transformed from 5 mebt liu et al 2011b 2013 4 5 dimethyl benzotriazole transformed from 4 mebt and 5 mebt huntscha et al 2014 and 4 6 or 7 dimethyl benzotriazole transformed from 5 mebt huntscha et al 2014 according to the presented findings the 2 4 dmebt 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt could also be transformation products of the 5 mebt which is supported with fig 3 illustrating the strong correlation between the three bttps responses in all sampled groundwater obtained by gc ms qualitative analyses the 1 mebt and 2 mebt are transformation products of the bt formed via methylation and tautomerization which was demonstrated with the synthesised compound from the bt reference standard subsections 2 3 4 and 3 1 the 2 mebt was the most abundant transformation product of the bt in the sampled groundwater since the abundance of 1 mebt was negligible fig 2 table 2 the 1 mebt was listed among the bio transformation products of bt in papers about laboratory experiments huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b but not the 2 mebt this indicates that the 1 mebt could be transformed into the 2 mebt which could be related with the temperature effect during transformation process subsection 3 1 or the stability of the products the same process can be transferred to the transformation of the 4 mebt and 5 mebt with 2 4 dmebt as the final most abundant product which was demonstrated with the synthesised compound from the 4 mebt reference standard subsections 2 3 4 and 3 1 and sampling results figs 2 and 3 table 2 it is presumed that the 5 mebt was almost completely transformed into the 2 4 dmebt whereas the 4 mebt was also partly transformed into the 1 4 dmebt considering that it degrades much slower huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 weiss et al 2006 the laboratory experiments huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b identified also the hydroxy and metoxy bttps however 1 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole 4 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole 5 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole 5 metoxy 1h benzotriazole and 4 metoxy 1h benzotriazole were not detected with lc ms analyses in the presented groundwater 4 conclusions wastewater pipeline leakage is an emerging concern with respect to the potential effects of leaking effluents on groundwater contamination all over the world the constant input of bts pollutant loads from sewer systems was shown to result in some potentially environmentally relevant bttps formed via methylation and tautomerization 2 4 dmebt and 2 mebt were found to be the most abundant and most stable bttps in groundwater of an urban oxic intergranular aquifer the sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity enable the formation of perched aquifers where leaking effluents could be temporarily stored and presumably the majority of the bts transformation could be processed the most stable bttps entered the aquifer saturated zone where concentrations up to 1500 ng l 1 were measured even 2 4 dmebt was identified only on the basis of internal material with gc ms and lc ms techniques the analogy with the synthesis and behaviour of 2 mebt with an available reference standard in the laboratory and in the field respectively confirms the result the proposed mechanism and transformation pathways should be subject to further investigations focusing on the identification of bttps as a function of co metabolic processes for the bts transformation time and temperature considering that the 2 mebt 2 4 dmebt and 1 4 dmebt were synthesised in the laboratory from parent bts with heating and that the referred bttps of the microcosm and batch experiments were transformed under different conditions but constant temperatures acknowledgements the authors would

19788,benzotriazoles bts are considered as contaminants of emerging concern cecs however information about their fate in aquifers continues to be absent this was the focus of the present study which provides the first evidence for relevant bts degradation products bttps in urban aquifers that may impact the groundwater quality the mechanisms and biotransformation pathways of bts were investigated in an oxic intergranular medium the bts and bttps were identified and quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analytical techniques based on reference standards and internal materials the major transformation products were identified as 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole 2 mebt for the degradation of 1h benzotriazole bt and as 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt and 1 4 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole 1 4 dmebt for the degradation of 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 mebt and most probably also 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5 mebt the leakage of wastewater pipelines is most probably the source of bts sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity give rise to perched aquifer conditions that lead to the temporal storage of leaking effluents and presumably the majority of bts transformation processes via methylation and tautomerization the most stable bttps entered the saturated zone of the aquifer where they prevailed concentrations up to 1500 ng l 1 were measured for the 2 4 dmebt which suggest a contamination risk for groundwater that is or may be used as a source for drinking water in the case of a constant input of pollutant loads from sewer systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban groundwater intergranular aquifer leaking effluents benzotriazoles transformation products 1 introduction many different synthetic organic chemicals are used in large quantities worldwide for different purposes and they are continuously released into the aquatic environment some of them are classified as contaminants of emerging concern cecs and might be candidates for future regulation anderson et al 2012 benzotriazoles bts have been regarded as cecs because they are widespread and persistent in the aquatic environment cantwell et al 2015 dummer 2014 giraudo et al 2017 richardson and ternes 2014 as an effective corrosion inhibitor they are used for the protection of metal surfaces and as an additive for several substances and

and its derivatives 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 mebt and 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 5 mebt are the most widely employed bts hart et al 2004 reemtsma et al 2010 they may not be degraded easily they have a limited sorption tendency they are only 10 70 removed by conventional wastewater treatments and they are resistant to photochemical degradation in aquifers due to the lack of light hart et al 2004 janna et al 2011 liu et al 2011a 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 voutsa et al 2006 weiss et al 2006 although the occurrence sources and concentrations of bts in wastewaters surface and groundwaters are well known alotaibi et al 2015a cantwell et al 2015 careghini et al 2015 giger et al 2006 herrero et al 2014 kiss and fries 2009 2012 liu et al 2011b 2013 information about their fate in aquifers remains absent the process has generally been investigated using laboratory experiments alotaibi et al 2015b ilieva et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 and to a much lesser extent at field sites breedveld et al 2003 which can be attributed to the difficulty of monitoring the bts transformation in the aquifer breedveld et al 2003 investigated the behaviour of bts in groundwater resulting from the use of de icing fluids at an abandoned airport two years after the termination of these de icing activities no proof of the bts transformation could be found in the anaerobic aquifer in contrast to the field observations the laboratory studies conducted by liu et al 2011b 2013 and alotaibi et al 2015b detected the degradation of bt and 5 mebt while 4 mebt was not investigated the microcosm and column experiments using fresh water and aquifer materials indicated an about 60 degradation of bt and 5 mebt under aerobic or anaerobic conditions several transformation products were proposed and this is commented on in subsection 3 3 the differences in the biodegradation studies of bts in mimic and native aquifers alotaibi et al 2015b breedveld et al 2003 ilieva et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 indicated that the bts biotransformation pathways depend on site specific hydrogeological and biogeochemical conditions as well as on the organic loading the factors controlling the bts behaviour in an oxic intergranular aquifer were investigated in ljubljana the capital of slovenia the qualitative groundwater monitoring identified a plume of unknown contaminants with a significant peak from a compound with a base ion mass to charge ratio m z of 147 within an industrialized area which has prompted a detailed study the gc ms and lc ms analytical testing of groundwater suggested that the investigated compounds belong to a chemical class of bts and their transformation products bttps to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the bts fate in groundwater on the field scale however huntscha et al 2014 investigated the bttps in effluents of wastewater treatment plants and their impacts on rivers and groundwater near a riverbank filtration which means their findings are also valuable for the present study the first aim of our investigation was to identify and quantify the bttps in urban intergranular aquifers based on gc ms and lc ms techniques which was a great challenge due to the lack of reference standards the second aim was to investigate the possible pathways for bts degradation with respect to the environmental forces and anthropogenic activities that lead to it entering groundwater bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the plume of the bt pollutants was detected in the piezometer pu 9 the study site fig 1 is a part of an unconfined ljubljana field alluvial aquifer the unsaturated zone is 20 m deep on average whereas the aquifer depth is approximately 90 m the sediments composed mainly of carbonates and silicates uhan and krajnc 2003 are very heterogeneous the upper strata consist mostly of sands and gravels and the lower mostly of conglomerates bračič železnik et al 2005 vizintin et al 2009 the lenses of the low permeability clay and the sandy clay layers locally divide the aquifer into the upper and lower aquifers the site s effective porosity ranges between 5 and 12 and the groundwater velocity is between 5 and 19 m day 1 trček et al 2010 the aquifer receives a natural recharge from rainfall and via a lateral inflow from the south 2 2 experimental set up the study was established at the piezometer pu 9 and at three boreholes at distances up to 500 m the upper saturated zone was investigated in the piezometers pu 6 and pu 7 and the lower saturated zone in the piezometer pu 7 and the well pu 4 fig 1 the latter is only 2 m from the piezometer pu 9 but it penetrates layers of the lower aquifer that is a source of drinking water for about 280 000 inhabitants during the experiment the groundwater table t and sec were recorded continuously at 1 h intervals for all the observation points with the solinst dataloggers model 3001 ltc junior www solinst com and the basic physicochemical and microbiological properties of groundwater were determined to trace groundwater flow the contaminant transport and impacts on bts transformation table 1 the oxic conditions were reflected in the aquifer for 1 5 years the monitoring protocol was focused on identifying and quantifying the compound with m z 147 and the accompanying compounds groundwater sampling was performed alternately for the qualitative and quantitative gc ms analysis in a monthly period samples were taken after five times the volume of the piezometer was pumped out and ph t and sec had stabilized while pumping the pump was installed in borehole screens 10 and 40 m below the water table for sampling the upper and lower aquifers respectively a total of 72 groundwater samples were collected all the samples were stored in brown glass bottles without any treatment the samples were transported to the accredited laboratory of the public water supply company vodovod kanalizacija slovenia vo ka immediately at the beginning and at the end of the experiment vo ka prepared two groundwater samples of the piezometer pu 9 also for lc ms and lc tof ms analyses at the jožef stefan institute department of environmental sciences slovenia the research was oriented to an exploration of possible pathways for the bts transformation in the aquifer afterwards as the plume of the bts pollutants was already diluted the passive inox samplers with integrated active carbon ac were installed at three different depths of the pu 9 pu 6 and pu 7 screens fig 1 for approximately 4 months to monitor the distribution of the bts and bttps in the aquifer s horizontal and vertical directions the preparation of the passive samplers and the gc ms analyses of the materials adsorbed on them were conducted by vo ka according to the iso 5667 23 2011 standards for sampling the passive samplers were all made of stainless steel just prior to installation in the piezometers approximately 3 g of ac was added into each passive sampler the ac was pre treated in the laboratory after cleaning by heating to 300 c it was reactivated by a water steam and transported in ultrapure water upw to the field site the ac for the field blanks was exposed to air at the sampling site during the installation of the passive samplers as well as during their collection at the end of the experiment the seasonal monitoring for the quantification of the two most abundant bttps was established for the observation locations pu 4 pu 6 and pu 9 fig 1 a total of 29 groundwater samples have been collected so far and analysed by gc ms at vo ka 2 3 chemical analysis 2 3 1 chemicals extra pure food grade quality 1 5 mm granular ac merck germany was applied for the passive sampling devices all the chemicals were purchased in the highest available purity as described in the supplementary material 2 3 2 gc ms qualitative analyses of water samples the compounds were extracted from 7 l of water samples using dcm and a separator funnel with a ptfe stopcock 1000 ml of the water sample was mixed with 75 ml of dcm and shaken carefully until the water and organic phases were separated and then the water phase was discarded the extract was dried by anhydrous sodium sulphate and transferred to the evaporation tube after evaporation by a steam of nitrogen the remaining extract 50 μl was transferred to chromatographic vials all the extracts were analysed by gc ms agilent gc6900 qp5890 usa the target compounds were separated on the hp 5ms ui column 30 m 0 22 mm 0 25 μm thickness with helium as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 constant flow

temperatures were set to 250 280 250 and 170 c respectively the interpretation of the total ion chromatograms tic of the gc ms in scan mode was performed with the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system amdis the deconvolution was covered by the agilent retention times library 5989 5076en and the library of mass spectra auersperger et al 2008 2011 three types of laboratory blanks were also analysed along with the samples to assess the potential sample contamination as described in auersperger et al 2008 2 3 3 gc ms qualitative analyses of adsorbed material on the passive sampler after the collection the granular ac was dried in an oven at 100 c for 1 h 3 ml of dcm were added for the elution of the adsorbed material in the ultrasonic bath the extract was transferred to chromatographic vials and concentrated in a stream of nitrogen all the extracts were analysed by gc ms clarus 600 perkin elmer usa the target compounds were separated on the hp 5ms ui

35 c 1 min to 280 c with a total run time of 50 min the inlet injection port transfer line and ion source temperatures were set to 80 280 280 and 250 c respectively the gc ms chromatogram interpretation was performed as described in subsection 2 3 2 ac was stored in the laboratory in upw for the entire installation duration of each sampling series and analysed along with the passive samplers for quality control compounds that were identified in the blank tests were excluded from the reports a spiked quality control sample with volatile and semi volatile compounds from benzene to carbamazepine was processed in parallel with each series of samples 2 3 4 bts and bttps identification the mass spectrum of each peak in the tic of the gc ms in scan mode was de convoluted with amdis the tentative identification of the bts and bttps was performed by comparing their retention times and area ratios with those from the nist 2008 library of mass spectra the bts and candidate bttps were further confirmed or rejected by authentic and internal standards matching their masses since the reference standards for some bttps were not available two mixtures were synthesised from reference parent compounds the experiment based on well known facts about relative stabilities of bts tautomers roth et al 1999 the first mixture was prepared by the direct heating of two glass vials filled with 3 mg of bt and 100 μl iodomethane respectively under the closed system conditions at 80 c the synthesised compound was re dissolved in dcm and analysed by gc ms two bttps were identified and confirmed by reference standards 1 mebt and 2 mebt the second mixture was prepared from 4 mebt the glass vials with 3 mg of 4 mebt was heated at 80 c in a glass tube together with 100 μl of iodomethane for 1 h the synthesised compound was re dissolved in the dcm and analysed by gc ms three bttps were identified based on the nist 2008 library of mass spectra and the analogy with the first synthetized mixture 2 4 dimethyl 2h benzotriazole 2 4 dmebt 1 4 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole 1 5 dmebt the reference standards and synthesised compounds were also verified by lc ms and lc tof ms analyses 2 3 4 1 lc ms and lc tof ms analysis the mass measurements were run on a hybrid quadruple time of flight mass spectrometer q tof provided with an orthogonal z spray electrospray esi interface waters micromass manchester uk for the lc ms measurements the mass spectrometer was interfaced to an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc system based on a water acquity waters milford usa binary pump in the first set of the experiment the c18 ascentis express 50 2 1 mm 2 0 μm particles supelco lc column was used while the longer luna omega c18 100 2 1 mm 1 6 μm particles phenomenex column was used in the second set at the same elution conditions the mobile phases consisted of 0 1 of formic acid in water a and acetonitrile b the elution gradient was linearly increased from 10 b to 90 b in 6 min and then back to the initial conditions the total run time including the conditioning of the column to the initial conditions was 7 min compressed nitrogen was used as both the drying and the nebulizing gas the nebulizer gas flow rate was set to approximately 20 l h 1 and the de solvation gas flow rate to 600 l h 1 a cone voltage of 30 v and a capillary voltage of 3 0 kv were used in positive ion mode the de solvation temperature was set to 300 c and the source temperature to 130 c a mass resolution of approximately 9000 was used for accurate mass measurements hrms and the determination of the elemental composition of the target ions the mass spectra were acquired in centroid mode over an m z range of 50 1000 in a scan time 1 s and an inter scan time 0 1 s similar experimental conditions were used for tandem mass spectrometric ms ms measurements of selected ions at 20 v collision energy the data station operating software was mass lynx v 4 1 micromass manchester 2 3 5 gc ms quantitative analyses of water samples the concentrations were quantified for two bttps with the most intensive peak areas 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt due to the volatility of the discussed bttps the modified epa 525 2 method was applied it is based on solid phase extraction spe and gc ms analyses as described in auersperger et al 2005 the first modification referred to the evaporation of the spe extracts 100 μl of extract was taken for the first gc ms analysis from 1 ml of the remaining dcm after partial evaporation the remaining dcm was evaporated to dryness and re dissolved in acetone for the second gc ms analysis the second modification referred to the injection technique a cold injection was used quantification was made according to the internal standard method the commercially available 2 mebt was used for the analysis of both bttps because a reference material for 2 4 dmebt is not available the concentrations of 2 4 dmebt were reported relative to the response for 2 mebt for an internal standard deuterated 1 methyl 1h benzotriazole d4 prepared from commercially available 1 h benzotriazole d4 by methylation with iodomethane was used the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were 1 0 and 3 3 for 2 mebt and 2 0 and 6 7 for 2 4 dmebt respectively field blanks were prepared according to the epa 525 2 method from upw that was sequentially transferred from one bottle to another at each sampling site regular spiked quality control samples were analysed with each chromatographic run including blanks of spring water used for the calibration 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of bts pollutants the scan data from the gc ms qualitative analyses were carefully screened for the bts pollutants they were tentatively identified by a comparison of their mass spectra with data from the nist 2008 mass spectral library the candidates were either confirmed or rejected through gc ms retention times and area ratios on the one hand and through lc ms matching on the other the results indicated that the investigated compounds belong to a chemical class of bts pollutants that are listed in table 2 the 2 mebt and 1 mebt were identified based on the synthesised compound from the bt reference standard subsection 2 3 4 considering a different physical properties boiling points of the parent compound and two bttps that were reflected in retention time and b the fact that 2h tautomers are more favourable in gas phase at higher temperatures roth et al 1999 the two bttps were confirmed by the reference standards as well as the parent compounds for more information refer to figs s 1a f s 3 and s 4a e based on the lc tof ms study c8h9n3 was found to be the most probable molecular formula for the other three bttps with m z equal to 147 table 2 consequently the gc ms study tentatively identified the most abundant compound in groundwater as 2 4 dmebt and the other two with the same molecular formula but different retention time as 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt the only available dimethyl bts reference standard for purchase was 5 6 dmebt since there was no matching with any of the three bttps figs s 1g and s 4f i the synthesised compound from the 4 mebt reference standard was used for their confirmation the compound contained a mixture of 1 4 dmebt 2 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt listed in terms of their abundance subsection 2 3 4 they were identified based on differences in physical properties boiling points retention time between 4 mebt and 1 4 dmebt 5 mebt and 1 5 dmebt and the analogy with the bt transformation related to 2h tautomers the tic of the gc ms analyses of the synthesised mixture and the mass spectrum of its bttps are presented in figs s 2a d whereas the lc ms ion chromatograms and the mass spectrum of the discussed compounds are presented in figs s 4g h i respectively ion chromatogram at m z 148 illustrated in fig s 4g indicated that the synthesised compound from 4 mebt contained at least two isomers of dmebt based on the gc ms data the isomer at a retention time of 2 02 is the 2 4 dmebt figs s 1a g s 2 s 4a f g h i table 2 the peak areas of the investigated compounds obtained from the gc ms qualitative analyses of the water samples are illustrated in fig 2 it should be noted that they do not reflect the concentration of a compound completely because of the different ionization efficiencies comparing with other sampling locations the abundance of bts pollutants was as expected 7 to 30 times higher in groundwater of the piezometer pu 9 nevertheless the bttps prevailed everywhere the 2 4 dmebt 2 mebt 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt were identified in all the groundwater samples but in different proportions depending on the location the peak intensities of the 1 5 dmebt were negligible everywhere while the 1 mebt was not detected at all the latter bttp was identified only by a gc ms qualitative analysis of the adsorbed material on the passive sampler that was installed in the piezometer pu 9 table 3 the 2 4 dmebt was the most intense bttps in the piezometer pu 9 and in the adjacent well pu 4 capturing groundwater of the upper and lower aquifers respectively fig 2 the peak intensity was at least one third lower for the 1 4 dmebt and even more for the 2 mebt the 4 mebt was the most abundant bts in the discussed groundwater particularly in the piezometer pu 9 on the other hand the proportions between the 2 4 dmebt and 2 mebt responses were similar in groundwater of the piezometers pu 7 and pu 6 capturing the upper aquifer at a 240 m and 480 m distance respectively the 1 4 dmebt was more than 50 less abundant in these waters where the bt prevailed among the bts the vertical distribution of bts pollutants in the aquifer was investigated using the data from the 2 m distant boreholes pu 4 and pu 9 fig 1 in comparison with pu 9 the abundance of pollutants is approximately 20 times lower in the pu 4 groundwater whereas the proportions between the compounds are similar except for the bt with higher peak intensity among the bts fig 2 the vertical distribution of bttps in the aquifer was also examined with the help of passive samplers fig 1 the results of the gc ms qualitative analyses of the adsorbed material in the piezometers pu 9 pu 7 and pu 6 are presented in table 3 the bttps are reported in relative intensities 1 5 based on the peak areas for 80 100 of the maximum peak area the relative intensity was defined as very high 5 for 60 80 it was high 4 for 40 60 it was moderate 3 for 20 40 it was low 2 while for 0 20 it was very low 1 the highest abundance of bttps is found in groundwater above the clayey lenses at depths between 25 and 28 m fig 1 3 2 environmental relevance of the bttps the concentrations were quantified and semi quantified for two of the most abundant and presumably most stable bttps by gc ms i e 2 mebt and 2 4 dmebt respectively the time plot of the 2 4 dmebt concentration in the sampled groundwater before the plume s dilution is illustrated in fig 2e whereas table 4 presents the minimum median and maximum values of 2 4 dmebt and 2 mebt at sampling locations before and after the plume s dilution the 2 mebt concentration was measured only after the plume s dilution the parameter ranged between 4 5 and 174 ng l 1 its median values were 40 70 lower in comparison to the 2 4 dmebt values in the upper aquifer the 2 4 dmebt concentration ranged between 6 1 and 1458 ng l 1 in groundwater before the plume s dilution while its range was between 0 1 and 145 ng l 1 afterwards the 2 4 dmebt oscillation fig 2e suggested a pulse input of bts pollutants in the pu 9 vicinity the water table 2 4 dmebt and sec of the piezometer pu 9 were not correlated nevertheless an increase in the sec values was most often connected with a significant increase in the water table which reflects the displacement of pre stored water in the aquifer it is presumed that groundwater with higher sec values is stored above the upper clayey lenses and it is discharged to the aquifer s lower parts during intensive hydrological events this explains the highest abundance of bts pollutants in groundwater flowing above the sector with the densest lenses of clayey sediments at depths between 25 and 28 m fig 2 table 3 where the recharged water has been concentrated and the horizontal flow has been developed the process was determined also with environmental tracers and 3h 3he isotopic investigations trček et al 2013 indicating that the pu 4 groundwater is 7 years older from the pu 9 groundwater on average accordingly the 2 4 dmebt medians were 22 times lower before and after the plume s dilution in the well pu 4 capturing groundwater of the lower aquifer than in the adjacent piezometer pu 9 however the 2 4 dmebt oscillation was not correlated neither among the two and nor among the other sampling locations the pu 6 was the only location where the median of the discussed parameter increased after the plume s dilution which most probably reflects a connection to a different pollution source the leakage of the industrial and or public wastewater pipelines is supposed to be the most probable source of bts pollutants in the study site which has already been highlighted as a problem for this area and for the whole city of ljubljana trček et al 2013 vizintin et al 2009 wastewater could contain up to 100 000 ng l 1 of bts due to their widespread use alotaibi et al 2015a it was discovered that approximately 99 of the bts amount used in the dishwasher did not remain on the dishes but was released into the wastewater treatment vetter and lorenz 2013 whereas the discharge from dishwashing machines represents approximately 30 of the total input of bts into residential wastewater janna et al 2011 a part of the wastewater pipelines had to be repaired during the presented study which resulted in an 87 reduction of the 2 4 dmebt median after the plume s dilution in both the piezometer pu 9 and the adjacent well pu 4 table 4 nevertheless these data warn of a contamination risk for groundwater sources stored in the lower aquifer in the case of a constant input of pollutant loads from sewer systems 3 3 proposed mechanism and biotransformation pathways low permeability clayey layers give rise to perched aquifer conditions that lead to the temporal storage of leaked wastewater and presumably the majority of the bts transformation processes considering that the transformation in groundwater has not been substantiated with a calculation using the advection dispersion equation data not shown here as well as with previous field investigations breedveld et al 2003 the presence of organic matter in wastewater and on a clay surface might stimulate the bts transformation mcallister and semple 2010 the results of batch experiments huntscha et al 2014 indicated that no specific bacterial population had to grow and no specific enzymes had to be induced for the transformation which was referred to the co metabolic biotransformation alvarez cohen and speitel 2001 the transformation process may also have been encouraged by the increased wastewater temperature due to the significant impacts of hot industrial effluents or larger quantities of dishwasher discharge cheng et al 2006 puttanna et al 1999 the non degraded bts and bttps have been gradually discharging from the unsaturated zone and entered the aquifer saturated zone where stable bttps prevailed table 2 fig 2 their proposed transformation pathways are presented in fig 4 the 5 mebt and bt were shown to degrade much faster than the 4 mebt under aerobic conditions huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 weiss et al 2006 which resulted in a negligible abundance of the 5 mebt and bt in comparison to the 4 mebt in the piezometer pu 9 where the residence time of the bts pollutants was the shortest fig 2 thus it is presumed that the bt and the 5 mebt were almost completely transformed on the other hand the comparison with data from the hydraulically connected boreholes pu 4 and pu 7 indicated an increase of the bt portion with a longer residence time according to ex situ experiments liu et al 2011b 2013 the bt could be the result of a transformation of the 4 mebt via a demethylation process however the contribution of the parent bt from additional pollution sources could not be excluded the 2 4 dmebt 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt were shown to be transformation products of the 4 mebt formed via methylation and tautomerization subsection 3 1 besides other bttp candidates bttps with m z equal to 147 were also detected with microcosm and batch experiments under aerobic conditions but tentatively identified as 2 5 dimethyl benzoxazole transformed from 5 mebt liu et al 2011b 2013 4 5 dimethyl benzotriazole transformed from 4 mebt and 5 mebt huntscha et al 2014 and 4 6 or 7 dimethyl benzotriazole transformed from 5 mebt huntscha et al 2014 according to the presented findings the 2 4 dmebt 1 4 dmebt and 1 5 dmebt could also be transformation products of the 5 mebt which is supported with fig 3 illustrating the strong correlation between the three bttps responses in all sampled groundwater obtained by gc ms qualitative analyses the 1 mebt and 2 mebt are transformation products of the bt formed via methylation and tautomerization which was demonstrated with the synthesised compound from the bt reference standard subsections 2 3 4 and 3 1 the 2 mebt was the most abundant transformation product of the bt in the sampled groundwater since the abundance of 1 mebt was negligible fig 2 table 2 the 1 mebt was listed among the bio transformation products of bt in papers about laboratory experiments huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b but not the 2 mebt this indicates that the 1 mebt could be transformed into the 2 mebt which could be related with the temperature effect during transformation process subsection 3 1 or the stability of the products the same process can be transferred to the transformation of the 4 mebt and 5 mebt with 2 4 dmebt as the final most abundant product which was demonstrated with the synthesised compound from the 4 mebt reference standard subsections 2 3 4 and 3 1 and sampling results figs 2 and 3 table 2 it is presumed that the 5 mebt was almost completely transformed into the 2 4 dmebt whereas the 4 mebt was also partly transformed into the 1 4 dmebt considering that it degrades much slower huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b 2013 reemtsma et al 2010 weiss et al 2006 the laboratory experiments huntscha et al 2014 liu et al 2011b identified also the hydroxy and metoxy bttps however 1 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole 4 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole 5 hydroxy 1h benzotriazole 5 metoxy 1h benzotriazole and 4 metoxy 1h benzotriazole were not detected with lc ms analyses in the presented groundwater 4 conclusions wastewater pipeline leakage is an emerging concern with respect to the potential effects of leaking effluents on groundwater contamination all over the world the constant input of bts pollutant loads from sewer systems was shown to result in some potentially environmentally relevant bttps formed via methylation and tautomerization 2 4 dmebt and 2 mebt were found to be the most abundant and most stable bttps in groundwater of an urban oxic intergranular aquifer the sediments with a lower hydraulic conductivity enable the formation of perched aquifers where leaking effluents could be temporarily stored and presumably the majority of the bts transformation could be processed the most stable bttps entered the aquifer saturated zone where concentrations up to 1500 ng l 1 were measured even 2 4 dmebt was identified only on the basis of internal material with gc ms and lc ms techniques the analogy with the synthesis and behaviour of 2 mebt with an available reference standard in the laboratory and in the field respectively confirms the result the proposed mechanism and transformation pathways should be subject to further investigations focusing on the identification of bttps as a function of co metabolic processes for the bts transformation time and temperature considering that the 2 mebt 2 4 dmebt and 1 4 dmebt were synthesised in the laboratory from parent bts with heating and that the referred bttps of the microcosm and batch experiments were transformed under different conditions but constant temperatures acknowledgements the authors would

concentration 4 1 104 5 8 108 cells cm2 metal accumulation including iron lead and copper and microbiome composition including presence of potential opportunistic pathogens in countries using disinfectant biofilms had on average lower cell concentrations and diversity metal accumulation up to 5 μg fe cm2 75 ng pb cm2 and 460 ng cu cm2 seemed to be partially responsible for discoloration in biofilms and likely originated from other pipes upstream in the building while some genera that may contain potential opportunistic pathogens legionella detected in 21 78 shower hoses were positively correlated with biofilm cell concentration others mycobacterium pseudomonas had surprisingly non existent or negative correlations with biofilm cell concentrations in a controlled study 15 identical shower hoses were installed for the same time period in the same country and both stagnant and flowing water samples were collected ecological theory of dispersal and selection helped to explain microbiome composition and diversity of different sample types shower hose age was related to metal accumulation but not biofilm cell concentration while frequency of use appeared to influence biofilm

and ashbolt 2011 however surprisingly little research attention has been paid to these final meters of water distribution i e shower heads feazel et al 2009 thomson et al 2013 and shower hoses collins et al 2017 lienard et al 2017 moat et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 soto giron et al 2016 whiley et al 2015 within the building drinking water plumbing context shower hoses are uniquely exposed to a triple threat of exacerbated bacterial growth factors 1 they are typically exposed to warm water rather than only cold or hot water and are subject to distal end cooling even if used with properly regulated and controlled hot water recirculation systems rhoads et al 2016 2 they typically have long stagnation intervals in a study including more than 700 homes with 2 6 persons household showers were used for 1 8 showers day with 7 8 min shower on average i e stagnant 23 8 h day deoreo et al 2016 3 the interior hose is made from flexible polymeric materials that leach significant amounts of biodegradable organic carbon considerably more than hard pipe materials used otherwise in building drinking water plumbing bucheli witschel et al 2012 proctor et al 2016 excessive bacterial growth in the last meters before consumer exposure during showers presents a potential health risk opportunistic pathogens including legionella pneumophila mycobacterium avium pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba polyphaga can infect consumers lungs eyes or open wounds causing pneumonia like symptoms or other infections falkinham et al 2015 kilvington et al 2004 the hygienic implications for end users are real for example mycobacterium species were found in shower aerosols of patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm pulmonary disease thomson et al 2013 from 2011 to 2012 l pneumophila was implicated in 21 outbreaks in the usa alone beer et al 2015 and many were suspected to involve showers along the same lines regular reports in news media show that legionella related disease or even just legionella detection is becoming increasingly disruptive and costly triggering facility shut downs remediation measures and legal actions table s1 interest in building drinking water plumbing opportunistic pathogen management is increasing slowly for example regulations in germany require periodic l pneumophila testing in homes when water boilers exceed 400 l in size bmjv 2011 and new swiss legislation requires testing of shower water in public buildings edi 2016 however these monitoring activities are extremely laborious and the regulations often fall short both in terms of sampling methods wang et al 2017 and preventative actions for example materials in household drinking water plumbing are typically quality controlled to some extent e g cen 2013 but the materials used specifically in shower plumbing are often completely unregulated because shower water is not necessarily considered as potable water bver lmg 2017 moreover while other pipe materials are installed by qualified professionals shower hoses remain one of few components of water distribution that can be replaced by the consumers themselves consumers choice in replacement hoses is often driven by functionality and aesthetics alone with ignorance concerning potential health impacts this is especially concerning because shower hoses are literally the last meter before water reaches the end user and are often used to more easily bathe patients and the elderly whom are at higher risk for opportunistic pathogen infection the unique bacterial growth environment and potential relevance to human health necessitates a better understanding of the biofilms that develop in shower hoses the overarching goal of this study was a detailed characterization of biofilms in real world shower hoses on a global scale the specific aims were to investigate the importance of engineering and consumer choices on that environment i e disinfectant use material quality age of hoses and specific use patterns and to explore ecological relationships amongst bacterial communities and the potential risks posed by these biofilms to achieve these aims a global survey of shower hoses investigated biofilm concentrations of bacteria and metals microbiome composition and the presence of potential opportunistic pathogens in 78 shower hoses from around the world additionally a controlled study with shower hose material hose age and water type controlled was conducted to remove some of the variability in the global survey to identify the key factors in biofilm formation and to determine biofilms relationship to the water phase 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection global survey shower hoses were collected from 78 showers across 11 countries on 3 continents belgium 8 denmark 10 germany

samples were geographically condensed in some countries i e shared workplace with the exception of 4 hoses from a swiss office building locker room all samples were from domestic settings volunteers were instructed to detach the shower hose from all fittings and to gently decant water from the hose hoses were sealed with autoclaved ½ inch stoppers and stored in plastic bags for transport to the lab within one week of removal shipping time was minimized but variable by country hand delivery in luggage and 24 h shipping were used when possible all volunteers were also asked to complete a brief survey to ascertain hose age time since hose installation and general water quality i e disinfection by chlorination water was not collected or analyzed in this portion of the work all shower hoses were processed within one day of arrival to the laboratory the outer casing was removed and the flexible plastic hose was cut into sections for analysis two 5 cm sections from either end were stored in greiner tubes with 0 2 μm filtered mineral water evian france for biofilm visualization a 90 cm section was used for biofilm extraction and the remainder was discarded the 90 cm section was filled with 20 ml sterile glass beads 3 mm diameter and filtered mineral water all sections were stored at 4 c in the dark until analysis controlled study a controlled study was conducted for 15 showers in switzerland where disinfectant is not used all participants were given the same type of pvc p shower hose to use for 1 5 years hoses and more detailed information on use patterns were collected as described above in addition three 1 l water samples were taken from each home 1 stagnant from the shower hose after overnight stagnation exact stagnation duration unknown 2 warm flowing from the

and 15 μm respectively for biofilms penetration depths up to 1 7 mm are typically observed due to their higher refractive index scanning electron microscopy sem was performed at the center for

sonication strategy that was optimized and used previously proctor et al 2016 the 90 cm section with glass beads and filtered mineral water was inverted five times and then sonicated in a bath bandelin sonorex rangendingen germany for 5 min the water was collected and replaced with fresh filtered mineral water the water volume varied with hose diameter in total five rounds of sonication and replacement were completed for each hose after which the beads were removed and discarded and the hoses were filled with only filtered mineral water for a final rinsing step the total biofilm suspension volume ranging 84 423 ml was sonicated with a needle sonoplus hd 2200 bandelin sonrex rangendingen germany for 30 s for homogenization and was aliquoted for further analyses a negative

and the controlled study the negative control was excluded from further analysis due to low dna yields 2 9 statistical analysis for correlations in the global survey non parametric tests spearman kruskal wallis as labeled were used because data was not normally distributed parametric tests pearson s correlation were used to quantify correlations in the controlled study for sequencing data

dissimilarity the adonis and ordiellipse functions from the vegan package oksanen et al 2013 were used to relate environmental data to microbiome composition in the controlled study the number of core otus was calculated as the otus present in all locations of each sample type or overlapping type 3 results for each of the following sections the results are presented separately for the two experiments the global survey and the controlled study in the global survey 78 shower hoses with largely unknown histories were collected from 11 countries in the controlled study 15 identical pvc p shower hoses were installed in swiss homes and collected after 1 5 years of use together with three types of water samples from each location 3 1 biofilm and bacterial concentrations were high and variable 3 1 1 global survey biofilm thickness ranged from non detectable to 0 40 mm fig 1 and varied considerably across different hoses and along a single shower hose oct fig s1 sem imaging of a representative biofilm indicated a thick matrix of cellular non cellular organic and inorganic constituents fig 1 fig s2 the biofilm surface concentration hereafter biofilm concentration was measured using the biofilm suspension from the 90 cm section of hose biofilm total cell concentration biofilm tcc measured with fcm ranged from 4 1 104 5 8 108 cells cm2 fig 2 a other measures of biofilm concentration including intact cells and adenosine tri phosphate correlated well with biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 95 and 0 87 respectively p 001 fig s3 biofilm concentrations of 16s rrna genes qpcr total organic carbon toc and optical density od546 correlated poorly with biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 52 0 57 and 0 65 respectively p 001 discussed further with fig s3 biofilm tcc varied significantly based on country of origin seemingly related to the use non use of disinfectant when comparing biofilm tcc between countries that used disinfectant belgium latvia portugal serbia uk and us n 39 and those that did not denmark germany south africa spain and switzerland n 39 biofilm tcc was significantly higher without disinfectant p 001 kruskal wallis fig 2a this dichotomous classification for disinfectant use non use does not take disinfectant concentration or type into account for example drinking water systems in belgium were known to use only low disinfectant concentrations and systems in latvia were known for disinfectant loss during distribution 3 1 2 controlled study in the controlled study biofilm tcc ranged between 0 3 2 0 108 cells cm2 fig 4a which was a narrower range compared to the same 15 locations investigated during the global survey 0 04 1 2 108 cells cm2 in 9 of 15 locations biofilm tcc was higher during the controlled study than in the global survey fig 3 a this occurred even though hoses were usually older during the global survey than in the controlled study hoses from 12 of 15 controlled sample locations were estimated to be 2 8 years old during the global survey while 3 were known to be 6 months old the importance of hose age is further discussed in section 4 2 3 water tcc varied amongst the three types of water samples collected in the controlled study fig 4b with stagnant water having the highest tcc in 12 of 15 locations additional water quality parameters i e aqueous chemistry for the cold flowing water and use patterns were also measured and were similarly variable table s7 while water quality did not correlate well with biofilm tcc data not shown biofilm tcc correlated positively with the frequency of use pearson s r 0 72 p 004 table s8 3 2 metals accumulate in biofilms 3 2 1 global survey color was notably variable across biofilms e g deep red orange translucent white yellow fig 5 fig s4 which can presumably be at least partly attributed to metal deposition some color may also be attributed to the proliferation of specific bacteria as discussed in section 4 3 2 although not detected in all biofilms biofilm concentrations of iron lead and copper were as high as 5 μg fe cm2 south africa 75 ng pb cm2 denmark and 460 ng cu cm2 latvia these metals all correlated to one another spearman s ρ 0 75 p 001 reflecting the tendency of copper and lead to sorb to amorphous iron minerals in circumneutral aqueous environments these metals also correlated moderately with optical density of biofilm suspensions data not shown correlations strongly affected by outliers calcium and magnesium were detected in all biofilms and correlated separately with one another spearman s ρ 0 6 p 001 as might be expected for these chemically similar alkaline earth metals there were no strong correlations between metal concentrations and biofilm tcc fig s5 3 2 2 controlled study the concentrations of copper and lead in biofilms tended to be higher in the global survey where hoses were older than during the controlled study fig 3b c d concentrations were similar when hoses were from the same building and had similar ages e g hoses 3 6 were from one building and had similar ages in both experiments fig 3b c d 3 3 microbiome composition reveals a diverse ecological niche 3 3 1 global survey the number of otus observed in each biofilm ranged from 74 to 481 this measure of diversity correlated significantly but weakly with biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 28 p 01 and was lower amongst biofilms in countries that use disinfectant p 01 kruskal wallis fig 2b some similarities could be seen in biofilm microbiome compositions from the same country fig 6 a but the origin of the hose country only explained 24 of variation in microbiome composition adonis p 001 the use of disinfectant was not a useful parameter for explaining microbiome composition 4 explained by disinfectant use adonis p 001 fig 6b the most abundant otus may have driven some of these variations with the sum of the top ten otus accounting for 3 41 of individual microbiomes this proportion was significantly higher when disinfectant was used kruskal wallis p 001 biofilm tcc also correlated with the relative abundance of several of the ten most abundant genera fig s6 significant negative correlations were found with sphingomonas pseudomonas and limnobacter spearman s ρ 0 56 0 55 0 47 respectively p 001 while positive correlations were found with dok59 sphingobium and meiothermus spearman s ρ 0 57 p 001 0 21 p 17 0 21 p 12 respectively 3 3 2 controlled study of all investigated water types cold flowing water had the highest number of otus followed by warm flowing water and stagnant water fig 4c the biofilms had a much lower bacterial diversity than the water samples e g between 90 and 98 fewer otus than cold water fig 4c microbiome composition also varied between three types of water samples and the biofilm fig 4d even at the phylum and class level each sample type clearly harbored different types of bacteria fig 7 three taxa betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes that accounted for 91 of biofilm sequences only accounted for 31 of the cold influent water microbiome seven taxa od1 op3 deltaprotobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi chlamydiae and nitrospirae that accounted for 51 of cold water microbiomes only accounted for 2 of biofilm microbiomes another four taxa acidobacteria actinobacteria deinococcus thermus and tm7 were clearly enriched in warm water 16 core otus were also distinct between the sample types with only 6 otus shared by all samples fig 7 sample type i e three water types biofilm however only explained 18 of microbiome variation adonis p 001 household i e building of sample origin explained 41 of microbiome variation adonis p 001 fig s7 3 4 specific organisms in shower hose biofilms may present risk 3 4 1 global survey two potential opportunistic pathogens mycobacterium avium and legionella pneumophila and two amoebae acanthamoeba ployphaga and verbamoeba vermiformis were detected via qpcr in 11 21 4 and 21 hoses respectively the maximum concentrations on these hoses was 6 6 107 gene copies gc cm2 6 6 105 gc cm2 2 5 104 gc cm2 and 2 8 105 gc cm2 respectively l pneumophila co occurred with a potential amoebae host v vermiformis in six hoses and it co occurred with m avium in two hoses several genera that might include potential opportunistic pathogens were also detected in sequencing data legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas were detected in 43 64 and 34 hoses respectively while 31 of 34 pseudomonas positive hoses were also positive for mycobacterium only 14 were also positive for legionella 37 hoses were positive for both legionella and mycobacterium and 13 hoses were positive for all three genera of interest absolute abundance of these genera was calculated by multiplying the relative abundance with tcc as done previously props et al 2016 yielding in some cases substantial maximum concentrations of these genera legionella 7 8 105 cells cm2 belgium mycobacterium 4 1 107 cells cm2 belgium and pseudomonas 3 1 106 cells cm2 switzerland this calculation of absolute abundance changes perception of the data e g the hose with the highest relative abundance of mycobacterium 35 only had the 17th highest concentration by calculated absolute abundance 5 9 105 cells cm2 because biofilm tcc was low when legionella was detected biofilm tcc was significantly higher kruskal wallis p 001 fig 8 a indicating that legionella is more likely to be found with a higher biofilm tcc there was also a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of legionella and biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 36 p 001 however for mycobacterium and pseudomonas detection was associated with reduced biofilm tcc kruskal wallis p 06 and 001 respectively fig 8d and e biofilm tcc was not a predictor for detection of l pneumophila m avium or v vermiformis fig 8b c f which may have been caused by the relatively few detects of these species with qpcr 3 4 2 controlled study surprisingly cold influent water was consistently positive for low concentrations of legionella 12 12 mycobacterium 12 12 and pseudomonas 11 12 biofilms were more sporadically positive for these genera legionella 6 15 mycobacterium 7 15 and pseudomonas 13 15 of all investigated water types the highest calculated absolute abundances of these three genera were found in the stagnant water samples 6 8 103 6 9 103 and 6 2 102 cells ml respectively for legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas and these maximums corresponded with detection of the genera in the respective biofilms 4 discussion several interesting trends could be disentangled from the data despite the uncontrolled and unknown factors that are inevitable with samples from real homes although all investigated shower hoses have similarities e g flexible materials installed after mixing valves each shower hose presented a unique environment 4 1 which harbored many bacteria 4 1 1 and inorganic mineral deposits 4 1 2 these environments were heavily influenced by engineering and consumer choices 4 2 such as disinfectant use 4 2 1 hose material 4 2 2 age of hoses 4 2 3 and specific use patterns 4 2 4 ecological relationships between microbiomes were evident 4 3 especially concerning the dispersal and selection of bacteria within buildings 4 3 1 and composition that co correlated with biofilm tcc 4 3 2 while some risk could be attributed to shower hose biofilms 4 4 1 we present several options for monitoring 4 4 2 and managing 4 4 3 these risks 4 1 shower hoses are a unique environment 4 1 1 shower hoses harbor many bacteria the physiochemical conditions common to nearly all shower hoses including mild to warm temperatures ranging from room temperature to maximum shower temperatures of c a 43 c long stagnation and nutrient migration from flexible plastic materials proctor et al 2016 may promote high biofilm tcc although a literature comparison of biofilm data is complicated by differences in sampling and analysis methods wang et al 2017 our study indicates that biofilm tcc tends to be higher on shower hoses average 107 cells cm2 than on hard pipe materials typically used in building drinking water plumbing copper and pex pipes 5 7 105 cells cm2 inkinen et al 2014 or drinking water plumbing simulators pe xc 2 106 cells cm2 proctor et al 2016 in addition to bacteria the studied shower hose biofilms also harbored non bacterial cells likely including fungi moat et al 2016 and amoebae fig 8 lienard et al 2017 visualizations of the shower hose biofilms indicate a thick complex matrix fig 1 with non cellular organic and inorganic matter e g eps mineralized metal precipitates that likely affects bacterial proliferation 4 1 2 metal accumulation originates from upstream pipes in the building the biofilm concentrations of metals varied considerably but were similar in hoses from the same buildings fig 3b d with hoses 3 6 from the same building while elements like calcium and magnesium are presumably related to local influent water quality e g hardness metals such as lead copper and iron may also originate from upstream pipes and fittings in the building gonzalez et al 2013 pipe corrosion is a well known problem and building drinking water plumbing materials are generally not well documented or known to consumers for instance risks from lead in pipes and brass fittings are known but regulations are not applied retroactively to replace building drinking water plumbing components and building drinking water plumbing still contributes significantly to lead in water haider et al 2002 in addition certain metals can also leach from plastic pipes e g lead is used as a stabilizer for certain pvc plastics zhang and lin 2015 4 2 engineering and consumer choices influence this environment 4 2 1 disinfectant use during water treatment affects biofilms in buildings the use of disinfectants during drinking water treatment can lower both the concentration prest et al 2016 and diversity bautista de los santos et al 2016 of bacteria in drinking water it is unclear however how this would affect biofilms at the distal end of building drinking water plumbing systems where the disinfectant residual is often lost lipphaus et al 2014 in the present study disinfected drinking water resulted in biofilms with lower tcc decreased diversity and an increased relative abundance of the ten most abundant otus figs 2 and 6 it could thus be argued that either 1 residual disinfectant acts as a selective force directly on biofilms or 2 disinfectant acts as an indirect selective force reducing the diversity in the source water which in turn reduces the diversity in the seed available for biofilm colonization with purely stochastic immigration to the biofilm diversity in the metacommunity in this case the influent water would be reflected in the biofilm microbiome battin et al 2007 since several countries with relatively high disinfectant residuals clustered closer together fig 6b prolonged exposure to disinfectant may be more selective e g a surviving resistome jia et al 2015 lack of stronger correlation to biofilm composition may be due to the fact that exact type and concentration of disinfectant were not known in this study 4 2 2 shower hose material quality is a problematic unknown the amount and type of carbon leaching from plastic pipe materials is critical for determining biofilm concentration and composition proctor et al 2016 wen et al 2015 composition of hoses in the global survey was clearly variable fig 5 but was not determined in the global survey in part due to difficulties quantifying compounds that have already leached out of the pipe e g plasticizers heim and dietrich 2007 skjevrak et al 2003 in contrast identical pvc p hoses were used in the controlled study this specific material encouraged biofilm growth more than other materials up to 2 108 cells cm2 over 8 months proctor et al 2016 and this was linked to carbon leaching under optimal conditions pvc p hoses leached large amounts of biodegradable carbon 9 7 μg c cm2 supporting 4 8 107 cells cm2 in 7 days the generally higher biofilm concentrations during the controlled study fig 3a may thus be linked to the common material however leaching behavior is variable with an initial peak diminishing over time bucheli witschel et al 2012 thus the common young age of the materials in the controlled study can also contribute to the high narrow range of biofilm tcc discussed further below 4 2 3 are new shower hoses worse than old ones within the same household accumulation of metals in biofilms seemed to increase with age fig 3b d but this was difficult to confirm since age of hoses during the survey was usually unknown beyond a minimum e g time of move in furthermore while passive metal accumulation through metal precipitation increases with time primary biofilm development may involve active accumulation e g iron as trace nutrient calcium as biofilm structural support biofilm tcc is dependent on availability of nutrients for growth carbon leaching diminishes over time bucheli witschel et al 2012 resulting in a nutrient rich environment in new hoses and a nutrient poor environment in old hoses other nutrients necessary for growth e g n and p are typically present in oligotrophic concentrations in drinking water and thus enter the shower hose based on use frequency over time here in cases where hose age could be estimated ranging 3 months to 30 years there was no correlation between hose age and biofilm tcc data not shown the hose with the most biofilm 5 8 108 cells cm2 was only installed for one year and tcc was often higher in the younger biofilms during the controlled study fig 3a a lack of correlation between age and biofilm concentration has been observed before wingender and flemming 2004 and may be explained by a growth plateau that is reached quickly after fast exhaustion of easily available and leachable carbon proctor et al 2016 wen et al 2015 4 2 4 specific use patterns affect biofilms frequency of use has previously been shown to affect tap specific colonization of opportunistic pathogens rudi et al 2009 and microbiomes in a model hot water distribution system ji et al 2017 in this study the more frequently used hoses in the controlled study had higher biofilm tcc with their stagnation patterns shower hoses could be thought of as batch reactors nutrient loads other than carbon which is provided by the hose itself are determined by frequency of use and their concentration in water table s8 interestingly the three hoses with the highest biofilm concentration were used frequently during the workweek but only rarely on weekends thus the nutrient loads in these hoses were high but stagnation was irregular since frequent use both supplies nutrients and potentially disrupts biofilms by changing hydraulics and delivering stress elements e g chlorine heat the complexities of irregular use should be the theme of future research here in the controlled study residual chlorine was not present but the hose with the lowest biofilm concentration was typically only used for high temperature cleaning of the tub 70 c essentially providing a heat shock to the biofilm 4 3 simple ecological relationships evident in microbiomes 4 3 1 the microbiome of a building drinking water plumbing system is explained by dispersal and selection in the controlled study household explained much of the microbiome variation i e water and biofilm samples were similar within a household fig s7 this might be expected as the microbiology of the entire building s drinking water plumbing system is inevitably dictated by dispersal from the cold distribution system water however clear differences between various water sample types and biofilms were evident across households in terms of tcc diversity and microbiome composition figs 4 and 7 if one considers the path water takes through the home as a microbiome continuum proctor and hammes 2015 then one can explain these changes through the concepts of dispersal and selection warm water was less diverse and had lower tcc than cold water together with the enrichment of deinococcus thermus fig 7 which consists almost entirely of extremophiles this indicates water heater stress as a strong selective force while the dna based sequencing methods cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria the percentage of intact cells in warm water remained high average above 50 indicating that live bacteria contributed substantially to this result table s7 negative relationships between diversity and temperature were previously observed in building plumbing simulators ji et al 2017 however cold and warm water samples still shared 23 core otus while cold water is the source and metacommunity for warm water warm water was collected only at moderate temperatures 35 40 c i e mixing of cold and hot water and thus there was also direct dispersal from cold water stagnant water was similar in terms of water tcc diversity and composition to its source and metacommunity the warm water however dispersal from the biofilm phase i e biofilm detachment during stagnation increased tcc and lowered diversity as the microbiome converged with biofilm microbiomes figs 4 and 7 phylogenetic convergence between stagnant water and biofilm samples has been noted previously inkinen et al 2014 and might be tied to the duration of stagnation ji et al 2017 biofilms all had low diversity compared to water and were also different from each other with only 8 otus shared by all biofilms fig 7 organic carbon leaching from the hoses likely provide a positive selective force and pvc p is specifically known to select for a low diversity in biofilms compared to other materials proctor et al 2016 growth in biofilms might be a selective force in and of itself as reduced diversity in biofilms compared to water has been noted previously in building drinking water plumbing inkinen et al 2016 and a chlorinated distribution system douterelo et al 2017 but not a non chlorinated distribution system liu et al 2014 4 3 2 biofilm composition is driven by multiple factors that co vary with biofilm tcc biofilm tcc seemed to drive some components of microbiome composition fig s6 while some bacteria may be affected by biofilm thickness itself e g more diverse niche space in thick biofilms with localized gradients flemming et al 2016 multiple selective forces affect biofilm tcc and composition simultaneously for example sphingomonas had a negative correlation with biofilm tcc it is resistant to chlorine jia et al 2015 and thus disinfectant may be acting as a selective force that dictates both sphingomonas abundance and biofilm tcc limnobacter also had a negative correlation with biofilm tcc but is susceptible to chlorine jia et al 2015 since it can degrade phenol vedler et al 2013 which leaches from some plastic pipes skjevrak et al 2003 this suggests the positive selective force of plastic pipes when growth conditions are otherwise non ideal meiothermus is an interesting example of a genus positively correlating with biofilm tcc it is slightly thermophilic has a reddish color causes biofouling and has been isolated in geothermal springs with iron oxidizing activity kolari et al 2003 urbieta et al 2015 here meiothemus accounted for 12 of two notably red biofilms from south africa fig s4b with high iron concentrations 0 09 and 5 μg cm2 suggesting that temperature iron oxidation and high biofilm cell concentrations were all contributing selective factors for the presence of this organism 4 4 quantifying and managing risk from shower hose biofilms 4 4 1 shower hose biofilms hold risks toxic metals and potential opportunistic pathogens were found in shower hose biofilms metal exposure is through consumption drinking and thus exposure from showers would be low but not obsolete e g brushing teeth in shower additionally particulate lead is sporadically detected in building drinking water deshommes et al 2010 and could result from biofilm detachment i e dislodged during hose manipulation however the metal biofilm concentrations in the shower hoses e g 75 ng pb cm2 are probably lower than detected in distributions systems lehtola et al 2004 and thus the metal concentrations in the biofilms are unlikely to be a major contributor to risk all of the reported potential opportunistic pathogens present a risk specifically for showering with routes of infection either through inhalation or wound exposure falkinham et al 2015 the presence of potential opportunistic pathogens in these biofilms agrees with their identification in previous local surveys collins et al 2017 moat et al 2016 soto giron et al 2016 however it is difficult to interpret the clinical relevance of the concentrations since little is understood about 1 how these biofilms detach into the water phase and 2 what dose is required for infection moreover for reported genera derived from sequencing data species and strain level definition was not possible and thus these do not necessarily present risks a common argument for biofilm control is that reducing total biofilm also reduces risk of exposure to opportunistic pathogens however biofilm tcc likely co varies with or affects biofilm microbiome composition as discussed above l pneumophila is thought to proliferate in thick biofilms and recently a threshold biofilm concentration for l pneumophila growth was proposed at 106 cells cm2 van der kooij et al 2017 most of our biofilm concentrations were above this threshold and l pneumophila was even detected below the proposed threshold although a positive relationship between tcc and l pneumophila was not found fig 8b legionella data correlated positively with tcc fig 8a indicating that decreasing biofilm tcc can protect against this particular potential risk other potential opportunistic pathogens may have a negative correlation with biofilm tcc e g mycobacterium and p aeruginosa meier and bendinger 2016 proctor et al 2016 or with other potential opportunistic pathogens e g legionella with p aeruginosa leoni et al 2001 in this study mycobacterium and pseudomonas correlated negatively with biofilm tcc fig 8d and e and co occurred with each other more than with legionella in a study of shower hose biofilms exposed to chlorine residual in the us mycobacterium dominated soto giron et al 2016 and thus disinfectant resistance may play a role in these correlations with biofilm management strategies it is necessary to weigh the risks of many potential pathogens simultaneously reducing biofilm concentration i e with disinfectant may reduce risk from some potential pathogens while increasing risk from others stagnant water which is influenced by detached biofilm had the highest potential risk of the three water types tested however biofilm was not the only source for these genera since the cold water was also frequently positive for potential opportunistic pathogens in a previous study of showers in the uk only 40 of stagnant water samples positive for legionella were also positive in shower hose biofilm swabs collins et al 2017 further indicating that other sources e g cold water distribution systems may be equally important for shower exposure 4 4 2 shower hose biofilms represent a meaningful sampling point water samples are the easiest type of sample to collect from household drinking water plumbing systems wang et al 2017 however 2 of bacterial biomass of distribution systems is present in the planktonic phase with most biomass in biofilms and loosely deposited material liu et al 2014 our data in combination with the available evidence on real shower environments collins et al 2017 feazel et al 2009 soto giron et al 2016 suggest that potential opportunistic pathogens are harbored in shower related biofilms shower hoses offer one of the most convenient sampling locations for biofilm monitoring in building drinking water plumbing i e excluding wastewater plumbing most components of building drinking water plumbing are not removable and are difficult to sample e g manual swabbing thus limiting reproducibility and representativeness in contrast shower hoses can be removed and replaced offering large sections 350 800 cm2 of easily accessible biofilms an aged biofilm may also be more representative of the building drinking water plumbing system than a grab water sample i e accumulation of metals over time variable disinfection concentrations and temperature in water such a biofilm based approach will complement the wealth of knowledge on building drinking water plumbing water and is necessary for a more complete understanding of the ecology and risks of household drinking water plumbing 4 4 3 shower hoses can be managed better shower hoses offer a critical area for improvement of building drinking water plumbing management strategies these hoses typically fall outside potable water material regulations but clearly microbiology needs to be considered as it stands consumers assume all risks and receive little guidance about this portion of easily controlled building drinking water plumbing moreover shower hoses are not necessary for all homes and could be replaced with safer hard pipe material hospitals and old age homes are generally better informed about limiting risk from shower environments programs for quarterly shower hose and head replacement aimed at reducing risk are available for such facilities table s9 given the tenuous relationship between age and biofilm tcc in this study a more radical strategy like single use shower hoses table s9 may be necessary for high risk patients less aggressive strategies such as allowing shower hoses to dry between uses are not likely sufficient to prevent colonization by potential opportunistic pathogens whiley et al 2015 in any case an effective management of building drinking water plumbing should be backed up by effective monitoring 4 4 2 above 5 conclusions in a global survey and controlled study shower hoses were characterized in detail in terms of biofilm concentrations metal accumulation and microbiome composition while many factors were uncontrolled some trends were apparent when disinfectants were used cell concentrations and diversity were reduced young shower hose age and bad material quality likely contributed to high cell concentrations frequent but irregular use likely contributed to high cell concentrations the microbiome along the path of water delivery in a building could be explained by dispersal and selection biofilm microbiome composition was shaped by several factors some of which co varied with cell concentration genera that may contain potential opportunistic pathogens were detected with either a positive legionella or negative mycobacterium pseudomonas correlation with cell concentration metals accumulated over time in biofilms likely originating from other building drinking water plumbing components while more controlled studies should further explore these trends it is clear that shower hoses offer a perfect biofilm sampling point to complement building water studies and that shower hoses should be considered in building drinking water plumbing risk management strategies acknowledgements the authors acknowledge financial support from mermaid

19789,shower hoses offer an excellent bacterial growth environment in close proximity to a critical end user exposure route within building drinking water plumbing however the health risks associated with and processes underlying the development of biofilms in shower hoses are poorly studied in a global survey biofilms from 78 shower hoses from 11 countries were characterized in terms of cell concentration 4 1 104 5 8 108 cells cm2 metal accumulation including iron lead and copper and microbiome composition including presence of potential opportunistic pathogens in countries using disinfectant biofilms had on average lower cell concentrations and diversity metal accumulation up to 5 μg fe cm2 75 ng pb cm2 and 460 ng cu cm2 seemed to be partially responsible for discoloration in biofilms and likely originated from other pipes upstream in the building while some genera that may contain potential opportunistic pathogens legionella detected in 21 78 shower hoses were positively correlated with biofilm cell concentration others mycobacterium pseudomonas had surprisingly non existent or negative correlations with biofilm cell concentrations in a controlled study 15 identical shower hoses were installed for the same time period in the same country and both stagnant and flowing water samples were collected ecological theory of dispersal and selection helped to explain microbiome composition and diversity of different sample types shower hose age was related to metal accumulation but not biofilm cell concentration while frequency of use appeared to influence biofilm cell concentration this study shows that shower hose biofilms are clearly a critical element of building drinking water plumbing and a potential target for building drinking water plumbing monitoring graphical abstract image 1 keywords shower hose building plumbing biofilm microbiome heavy metals 1 introduction showers have been implicated as a route of infection for opportunistic pathogens schoen and ashbolt 2011 however surprisingly little research attention has been paid to these final meters of water distribution i e shower heads feazel et al 2009 thomson et al 2013 and shower hoses collins et al 2017 lienard et al 2017 moat et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 soto giron et al 2016 whiley et al 2015 within the building drinking water plumbing context shower hoses are uniquely exposed to a triple threat of exacerbated bacterial growth factors 1 they are typically exposed to warm water rather than only cold or hot water and are subject to distal end cooling even if used with properly regulated and controlled hot water recirculation systems rhoads et al 2016 2 they typically have long stagnation intervals in a study including more than 700 homes with 2 6 persons household showers were used for 1 8 showers day with 7 8 min shower on average i e stagnant 23 8 h day deoreo et al 2016 3 the interior hose is made from flexible polymeric materials that leach significant amounts of biodegradable organic carbon considerably more than hard pipe materials used otherwise in building drinking water plumbing bucheli witschel et al 2012 proctor et al 2016 excessive bacterial growth in the last meters before consumer exposure during showers presents a potential health risk opportunistic pathogens including legionella pneumophila mycobacterium avium pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba polyphaga can infect consumers lungs eyes or open wounds causing pneumonia like symptoms or other infections falkinham et al 2015 kilvington et al 2004 the hygienic implications for end users are real for example mycobacterium species were found in shower aerosols of patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm pulmonary disease thomson et al 2013 from 2011 to 2012 l pneumophila was implicated in 21 outbreaks in the usa alone beer et al 2015 and many were suspected to involve showers along the same lines regular reports in news media show that legionella related disease or even just legionella detection is becoming increasingly disruptive and costly triggering facility shut downs remediation measures and legal actions table s1 interest in building drinking water plumbing opportunistic pathogen management is increasing slowly for example regulations in germany require periodic l pneumophila testing in homes when water boilers exceed 400 l in size bmjv 2011 and new swiss legislation requires testing of shower water in public buildings edi 2016 however these monitoring activities are extremely laborious and the regulations often fall short both in terms of sampling methods wang et al 2017 and preventative actions for example materials in household drinking water plumbing are typically quality controlled to some extent e g cen 2013 but the materials used specifically in shower plumbing are often completely unregulated because shower water is not necessarily considered as potable water bver lmg 2017 moreover while other pipe materials are installed by qualified professionals shower hoses remain one of few components of water distribution that can be replaced by the consumers themselves consumers choice in replacement hoses is often driven by functionality and aesthetics alone with ignorance concerning potential health impacts this is especially concerning because shower hoses are literally the last meter before water reaches the end user and are often used to more easily bathe patients and the elderly whom are at higher risk for opportunistic pathogen infection the unique bacterial growth environment and potential relevance to human health necessitates a better understanding of the biofilms that develop in shower hoses the overarching goal of this study was a detailed characterization of biofilms in real world shower hoses on a global scale the specific aims were to investigate the importance of engineering and consumer choices on that environment i e disinfectant use material quality age of hoses and specific use patterns and to explore ecological relationships amongst bacterial communities and the potential risks posed by these biofilms to achieve these aims a global survey of shower hoses investigated biofilm concentrations of bacteria and metals microbiome composition and the presence of potential opportunistic pathogens in 78 shower hoses from around the world additionally a controlled study with shower hose material hose age and water type controlled was conducted to remove some of the variability in the global survey to identify the key factors in biofilm formation and to determine biofilms relationship to the water phase 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection global survey shower hoses were collected from 78 showers across 11 countries on 3 continents belgium 8 denmark 10 germany

samples were geographically condensed in some countries i e shared workplace with the exception of 4 hoses from a swiss office building locker room all samples were from domestic settings volunteers were instructed to detach the shower hose from all fittings and to gently decant water from the hose hoses were sealed with autoclaved ½ inch stoppers and stored in plastic bags for transport to the lab within one week of removal shipping time was minimized but variable by country hand delivery in luggage and 24 h shipping were used when possible all volunteers were also asked to complete a brief survey to ascertain hose age time since hose installation and general water quality i e disinfection by chlorination water was not collected or analyzed in this portion of the work all shower hoses were processed within one day of arrival to the laboratory the outer casing was removed and the flexible plastic hose was cut into sections for analysis two 5 cm sections from either end were stored in greiner tubes with 0 2 μm filtered mineral water evian france for biofilm visualization a 90 cm section was used for biofilm extraction and the remainder was discarded the 90 cm section was filled with 20 ml sterile glass beads 3 mm diameter and filtered mineral water all sections were stored at 4 c in the dark until analysis controlled study a controlled study was conducted for 15 showers in switzerland where disinfectant is not used all participants were given the same type of pvc p shower hose to use for 1 5 years hoses and more detailed information on use patterns were collected as described above in addition three 1 l water samples were taken from each home 1 stagnant from the shower hose after overnight stagnation exact stagnation duration unknown 2 warm flowing from the shower hose after 5 min of flushing with warm water i e showering temperature 35 45 c and 3 cold flowing from the nearest tap after 5 min of flushing with cold water i e distribution system water without shower hose influence 2 2 biofilm visualization biofilm structure and thickness were characterized with optical coherence tomography oct using a spectral domain oct imaging system 930 nm oct system ganymede thorlabs gmbh dachau germany the long wavelength light allows penetration up to a depth of 2 7 mm in air i e with a refractive index of 1 with axial and lateral resolutions of 4 4 μm and 15 μm respectively for biofilms penetration depths up to 1 7 mm are typically observed due to their higher refractive index scanning electron microscopy sem was performed at the center for microscopy and image analysis university of zurich on 1 cm2 pieces that were fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde and stored at 4 c in the dark 2 3 biofilm extraction biofilm was extracted using a repeated sonication strategy that was optimized and used previously proctor et al 2016 the 90 cm section with glass beads and filtered mineral water was inverted five times and then sonicated in a bath bandelin sonorex rangendingen germany for 5 min the water was collected and replaced with fresh filtered mineral water the water volume varied with hose diameter in total five rounds of sonication and replacement were completed for each hose after which the beads were removed and discarded and the hoses were filled with only filtered mineral water for a final rinsing step the total biofilm suspension volume ranging 84 423 ml was sonicated with a needle sonoplus hd 2200 bandelin sonrex rangendingen germany for 30 s for homogenization and was aliquoted for further analyses a negative control sample for dna based analyses was also produced using the same filtered mineral water and homogenization with needle 2 4 flow cytometry fcm staining and fcm analysis was done as described previously prest et al 2013 briefly a working solution of sybr green i sg invitrogen ag basel switzerland was prepared by 100 dilution in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide dmso water samples and biofilm suspensions were stained with sg at 10 μl ml samples were preheated to 35 c 3 min then incubated with stain in the dark for 10 min at 35 c before measurement fcm measurements were performed on a bd accuri c6 instrument bd accuri cytometers belgium data analysis was performed using the bd accuri cflow software following the procedure described previously prest et al 2013 to calculate total cell concentration tcc water tcc was used directly cells ml and biofilm tcc was calculated using the hose surface area cells cm2 2 5 elemental analysis homogenized 100 μl aliquots of the biofilm

quality control was conducted by triplicate analysis of selected digestates and by analyzing procedural blanks and aqueous reference standards merck x and nist 1643f 2 6 dna extraction the remaining volume of biofilm suspension was filtered on a 0 2 μm polycarbonate nucleopore membrane filter 47 mm diameter whatman kent uk the filter was inserted into a 5 ml tube and stored at 20 c before dna extraction with the power water dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to manufacturers instructions 2 7 qpcr qpcr was used to quantify specific organisms including l

and the controlled study the negative control was excluded from further analysis due to low dna yields 2 9 statistical analysis for correlations in the global survey non parametric tests spearman kruskal wallis as labeled were used because data was not normally distributed parametric tests pearson s correlation were used to quantify correlations in the controlled study for sequencing data sequences were merged trimmed filtered and clustered into operational taxonomical units otus according to several algorithms table s6 sequences were identified according to greengenes v 13 5 desantis

from switzerland global survey were removed from analysis due to low number of reads non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to visualize microbiome similarities using bray curtis dissimilarity the adonis and ordiellipse functions from the vegan package oksanen et al 2013 were used to relate environmental data to microbiome composition in the controlled study the number of core otus was calculated as the otus present in all locations of each sample type or overlapping type 3 results for each of the following sections the results are presented separately for the two experiments the global survey and the controlled study in the global survey 78 shower hoses with largely unknown histories were collected from 11 countries in the controlled study 15 identical pvc p shower hoses were installed in swiss homes and collected after 1 5 years of use together with three types of water samples from each location 3 1 biofilm and bacterial concentrations were high and variable 3 1 1 global survey biofilm thickness ranged from non detectable to 0 40 mm fig 1 and varied considerably across different hoses and along a single shower hose oct fig s1 sem imaging of a representative biofilm indicated a thick matrix of cellular non cellular organic and inorganic constituents fig 1 fig s2 the biofilm surface concentration hereafter biofilm concentration was measured using the biofilm suspension from the 90 cm section of hose biofilm total cell concentration biofilm tcc measured with fcm ranged from 4 1 104 5 8 108 cells cm2 fig 2 a other measures of biofilm concentration including intact cells and adenosine tri phosphate correlated well with biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 95 and 0 87 respectively p 001 fig s3 biofilm concentrations of 16s rrna genes qpcr total organic carbon toc and optical density od546 correlated poorly with biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 52 0 57 and 0 65 respectively p 001 discussed further with fig s3 biofilm tcc varied significantly based on country of origin seemingly related to the use non use of disinfectant when comparing biofilm tcc between countries that used disinfectant belgium latvia portugal serbia uk and us n 39 and those that did not denmark germany south africa spain and switzerland n 39 biofilm tcc was significantly higher without disinfectant p 001 kruskal wallis fig 2a this dichotomous classification for disinfectant use non use does not take disinfectant concentration or type into account for example drinking water systems in belgium were known to use only low disinfectant concentrations and systems in latvia were known for disinfectant loss during distribution 3 1 2 controlled study in the controlled study biofilm tcc ranged between 0 3 2 0 108 cells cm2 fig 4a which was a narrower range compared to the same 15 locations investigated during the global survey 0 04 1 2 108 cells cm2 in 9 of 15 locations biofilm tcc was higher during the controlled study than in the global survey fig 3 a this occurred even though hoses were usually older during the global survey than in the controlled study hoses from 12 of 15 controlled sample locations were estimated to be 2 8 years old during the global survey while 3 were known to be 6 months old the importance of hose age is further discussed in section 4 2 3 water tcc varied amongst the three types of water samples collected in the controlled study fig 4b with stagnant water having the highest tcc in 12 of 15 locations additional water quality parameters i e aqueous chemistry for the cold flowing water and use patterns were also measured and were similarly variable table s7 while water quality did not correlate well with biofilm tcc data not shown biofilm tcc correlated positively with the frequency of use pearson s r 0 72 p 004 table s8 3 2 metals accumulate in biofilms 3 2 1 global survey color was notably variable across biofilms e g deep red orange translucent white yellow fig 5 fig s4 which can presumably be at least partly attributed to metal deposition some color may also be attributed to the proliferation of specific bacteria as discussed in section 4 3 2 although not detected in all biofilms biofilm concentrations of iron lead and copper were as high as 5 μg fe cm2 south africa 75 ng pb cm2 denmark and 460 ng cu cm2 latvia these metals all correlated to one another spearman s ρ 0 75 p 001 reflecting the tendency of copper and lead to sorb to amorphous iron minerals in circumneutral aqueous environments these metals also correlated moderately with optical density of biofilm suspensions data not shown correlations strongly affected by outliers calcium and magnesium were detected in all biofilms and correlated separately with one another spearman s ρ 0 6 p 001 as might be expected for these chemically similar alkaline earth metals there were no strong correlations between metal concentrations and biofilm tcc fig s5 3 2 2 controlled study the concentrations of copper and lead in biofilms tended to be higher in the global survey where hoses were older than during the controlled study fig 3b c d concentrations were similar when hoses were from the same building and had similar ages e g hoses 3 6 were from one building and had similar ages in both experiments fig 3b c d 3 3 microbiome composition reveals a diverse ecological niche 3 3 1 global survey the number of otus observed in each biofilm ranged from 74 to 481 this measure of diversity correlated significantly but weakly with biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 28 p 01 and was lower amongst biofilms in countries that use disinfectant p 01 kruskal wallis fig 2b some similarities could be seen in biofilm microbiome compositions from the same country fig 6 a but the origin of the hose country only explained 24 of variation in microbiome composition adonis p 001 the use of disinfectant was not a useful parameter for explaining microbiome composition 4 explained by disinfectant use adonis p 001 fig 6b the most abundant otus may have driven some of these variations with the sum of the top ten otus accounting for 3 41 of individual microbiomes this proportion was significantly higher when disinfectant was used kruskal wallis p 001 biofilm tcc also correlated with the relative abundance of several of the ten most abundant genera fig s6 significant negative correlations were found with sphingomonas pseudomonas and limnobacter spearman s ρ 0 56 0 55 0 47 respectively p 001 while positive correlations were found with dok59 sphingobium and meiothermus spearman s ρ 0 57 p 001 0 21 p 17 0 21 p 12 respectively 3 3 2 controlled study of all investigated water types cold flowing water had the highest number of otus followed by warm flowing water and stagnant water fig 4c the biofilms had a much lower bacterial diversity than the water samples e g between 90 and 98 fewer otus than cold water fig 4c microbiome composition also varied between three types of water samples and the biofilm fig 4d even at the phylum and class level each sample type clearly harbored different types of bacteria fig 7 three taxa betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes that accounted for 91 of biofilm sequences only accounted for 31 of the cold influent water microbiome seven taxa od1 op3 deltaprotobacteria planctomycetes chloroflexi chlamydiae and nitrospirae that accounted for 51 of cold water microbiomes only accounted for 2 of biofilm microbiomes another four taxa acidobacteria actinobacteria deinococcus thermus and tm7 were clearly enriched in warm water 16 core otus were also distinct between the sample types with only 6 otus shared by all samples fig 7 sample type i e three water types biofilm however only explained 18 of microbiome variation adonis p 001 household i e building of sample origin explained 41 of microbiome variation adonis p 001 fig s7 3 4 specific organisms in shower hose biofilms may present risk 3 4 1 global survey two potential opportunistic pathogens mycobacterium avium and legionella pneumophila and two amoebae acanthamoeba ployphaga and verbamoeba vermiformis were detected via qpcr in 11 21 4 and 21 hoses respectively the maximum concentrations on these hoses was 6 6 107 gene copies gc cm2 6 6 105 gc cm2 2 5 104 gc cm2 and 2 8 105 gc cm2 respectively l pneumophila co occurred with a potential amoebae host v vermiformis in six hoses and it co occurred with m avium in two hoses several genera that might include potential opportunistic pathogens were also detected in sequencing data legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas were detected in 43 64 and 34 hoses respectively while 31 of 34 pseudomonas positive hoses were also positive for mycobacterium only 14 were also positive for legionella 37 hoses were positive for both legionella and mycobacterium and 13 hoses were positive for all three genera of interest absolute abundance of these genera was calculated by multiplying the relative abundance with tcc as done previously props et al 2016 yielding in some cases substantial maximum concentrations of these genera legionella 7 8 105 cells cm2 belgium mycobacterium 4 1 107 cells cm2 belgium and pseudomonas 3 1 106 cells cm2 switzerland this calculation of absolute abundance changes perception of the data e g the hose with the highest relative abundance of mycobacterium 35 only had the 17th highest concentration by calculated absolute abundance 5 9 105 cells cm2 because biofilm tcc was low when legionella was detected biofilm tcc was significantly higher kruskal wallis p 001 fig 8 a indicating that legionella is more likely to be found with a higher biofilm tcc there was also a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of legionella and biofilm tcc spearman s ρ 0 36 p 001 however for mycobacterium and pseudomonas detection was associated with reduced biofilm tcc kruskal wallis p 06 and 001 respectively fig 8d and e biofilm tcc was not a predictor for detection of l pneumophila m avium or v vermiformis fig 8b c f which may have been caused by the relatively few detects of these species with qpcr 3 4 2 controlled study surprisingly cold influent water was consistently positive for low concentrations of legionella 12 12 mycobacterium 12 12 and pseudomonas 11 12 biofilms were more sporadically positive for these genera legionella 6 15 mycobacterium 7 15 and pseudomonas 13 15 of all investigated water types the highest calculated absolute abundances of these three genera were found in the stagnant water samples 6 8 103 6 9 103 and 6 2 102 cells ml respectively for legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas and these maximums corresponded with detection of the genera in the respective biofilms 4 discussion several interesting trends could be disentangled from the data despite the uncontrolled and unknown factors that are inevitable with samples from real homes although all investigated shower hoses have similarities e g flexible materials installed after mixing valves each shower hose presented a unique environment 4 1 which harbored many bacteria 4 1 1 and inorganic mineral deposits 4 1 2 these environments were heavily influenced by engineering and consumer choices 4 2 such as disinfectant use 4 2 1 hose material 4 2 2 age of hoses 4 2 3 and specific use patterns 4 2 4 ecological relationships between microbiomes were evident 4 3 especially concerning the dispersal and selection of bacteria within buildings 4 3 1 and composition that co correlated with biofilm tcc 4 3 2 while some risk could be attributed to shower hose biofilms 4 4 1 we present several options for monitoring 4 4 2 and managing 4 4 3 these risks 4 1 shower hoses are a unique environment 4 1 1 shower hoses harbor many bacteria the physiochemical conditions common to nearly all shower hoses including mild to warm temperatures ranging from room temperature to maximum shower temperatures of c a 43 c long stagnation and nutrient migration from flexible plastic materials proctor et al 2016 may promote high biofilm tcc although a literature comparison of biofilm data is complicated by differences in sampling and analysis methods wang et al 2017 our study indicates that biofilm tcc tends to be higher on shower hoses average 107 cells cm2 than on hard pipe materials typically used in building drinking water plumbing copper and pex pipes 5 7 105 cells cm2 inkinen et al 2014 or drinking water plumbing simulators pe xc 2 106 cells cm2 proctor et al 2016 in addition to bacteria the studied shower hose biofilms also harbored non bacterial cells likely including fungi moat et al 2016 and amoebae fig 8 lienard et al 2017 visualizations of the shower hose biofilms indicate a thick complex matrix fig 1 with non cellular organic and inorganic matter e g eps mineralized metal precipitates that likely affects bacterial proliferation 4 1 2 metal accumulation originates from upstream pipes in the building the biofilm concentrations of metals varied considerably but were similar in hoses from the same buildings fig 3b d with hoses 3 6 from the same building while elements like calcium and magnesium are presumably related to local influent water quality e g hardness metals such as lead copper and iron may also originate from upstream pipes and fittings in the building gonzalez et al 2013 pipe corrosion is a well known problem and building drinking water plumbing materials are generally not well documented or known to consumers for instance risks from lead in pipes and brass fittings are known but regulations are not applied retroactively to replace building drinking water plumbing components and building drinking water plumbing still contributes significantly to lead in water haider et al 2002 in addition certain metals can also leach from plastic pipes e g lead is used as a stabilizer for certain pvc plastics zhang and lin 2015 4 2 engineering and consumer choices influence this environment 4 2 1 disinfectant use during water treatment affects biofilms in buildings the use of disinfectants during drinking water treatment can lower both the concentration prest et al 2016 and diversity bautista de los santos et al 2016 of bacteria in drinking water it is unclear however how this would affect biofilms at the distal end of building drinking water plumbing systems where the disinfectant residual is often lost lipphaus et al 2014 in the present study disinfected drinking water resulted in biofilms with lower tcc decreased diversity and an increased relative abundance of the ten most abundant otus figs 2 and 6 it could thus be argued that either 1 residual disinfectant acts as a selective force directly on biofilms or 2 disinfectant acts as an indirect selective force reducing the diversity in the source water which in turn reduces the diversity in the seed available for biofilm colonization with purely stochastic immigration to the biofilm diversity in the metacommunity in this case the influent water would be reflected in the biofilm microbiome battin et al 2007 since several countries with relatively high disinfectant residuals clustered closer together fig 6b prolonged exposure to disinfectant may be more selective e g a surviving resistome jia et al 2015 lack of stronger correlation to biofilm composition may be due to the fact that exact type and concentration of disinfectant were not known in this study 4 2 2 shower hose material quality is a problematic unknown the amount and type of carbon leaching from plastic pipe materials is critical for determining biofilm concentration and composition proctor et al 2016 wen et al 2015 composition of hoses in the global survey was clearly variable fig 5 but was not determined in the global survey in part due to difficulties quantifying compounds that have already leached out of the pipe e g plasticizers heim and dietrich 2007 skjevrak et al 2003 in contrast identical pvc p hoses were used in the controlled study this specific material encouraged biofilm growth more than other materials up to 2 108 cells cm2 over 8 months proctor et al 2016 and this was linked to carbon leaching under optimal conditions pvc p hoses leached large amounts of biodegradable carbon 9 7 μg c cm2 supporting 4 8 107 cells cm2 in 7 days the generally higher biofilm concentrations during the controlled study fig 3a may thus be linked to the common material however leaching behavior is variable with an initial peak diminishing over time bucheli witschel et al 2012 thus the common young age of the materials in the controlled study can also contribute to the high narrow range of biofilm tcc discussed further below 4 2 3 are new shower hoses worse than old ones within the same household accumulation of metals in biofilms seemed to increase with age fig 3b d but this was difficult to confirm since age of hoses during the survey was usually unknown beyond a minimum e g time of move in furthermore while passive metal accumulation through metal precipitation increases with time primary biofilm development may involve active accumulation e g iron as trace nutrient calcium as biofilm structural support biofilm tcc is dependent on availability of nutrients for growth carbon leaching diminishes over time bucheli witschel et al 2012 resulting in a nutrient rich environment in new hoses and a nutrient poor environment in old hoses other nutrients necessary for growth e g n and p are typically present in oligotrophic concentrations in drinking water and thus enter the shower hose based on use frequency over time here in cases where hose age could be estimated ranging 3 months to 30 years there was no correlation between hose age and biofilm tcc data not shown the hose with the most biofilm 5 8 108 cells cm2 was only installed for one year and tcc was often higher in the younger biofilms during the controlled study fig 3a a lack of correlation between age and biofilm concentration has been observed before wingender and flemming 2004 and may be explained by a growth plateau that is reached quickly after fast exhaustion of easily available and leachable carbon proctor et al 2016 wen et al 2015 4 2 4 specific use patterns affect biofilms frequency of use has previously been shown to affect tap specific colonization of opportunistic pathogens rudi et al 2009 and microbiomes in a model hot water distribution system ji et al 2017 in this study the more frequently used hoses in the controlled study had higher biofilm tcc with their stagnation patterns shower hoses could be thought of as batch reactors nutrient loads other than carbon which is provided by the hose itself are determined by frequency of use and their concentration in water table s8 interestingly the three hoses with the highest biofilm concentration were used frequently during the workweek but only rarely on weekends thus the nutrient loads in these hoses were high but stagnation was irregular since frequent use both supplies nutrients and potentially disrupts biofilms by changing hydraulics and delivering stress elements e g chlorine heat the complexities of irregular use should be the theme of future research here in the controlled study residual chlorine was not present but the hose with the lowest biofilm concentration was typically only used for high temperature cleaning of the tub 70 c essentially providing a heat shock to the biofilm 4 3 simple ecological relationships evident in microbiomes 4 3 1 the microbiome of a building drinking water plumbing system is explained by dispersal and selection in the controlled study household explained much of the microbiome variation i e water and biofilm samples were similar within a household fig s7 this might be expected as the microbiology of the entire building s drinking water plumbing system is inevitably dictated by dispersal from the cold distribution system water however clear differences between various water sample types and biofilms were evident across households in terms of tcc diversity and microbiome composition figs 4 and 7 if one considers the path water takes through the home as a microbiome continuum proctor and hammes 2015 then one can explain these changes through the concepts of dispersal and selection warm water was less diverse and had lower tcc than cold water together with the enrichment of deinococcus thermus fig 7 which consists almost entirely of extremophiles this indicates water heater stress as a strong selective force while the dna based sequencing methods cannot distinguish between live and dead bacteria the percentage of intact cells in warm water remained high average above 50 indicating that live bacteria contributed substantially to this result table s7 negative relationships between diversity and temperature were previously observed in building plumbing simulators ji et al 2017 however cold and warm water samples still shared 23 core otus while cold water is the source and metacommunity for warm water warm water was collected only at moderate temperatures 35 40 c i e mixing of cold and hot water and thus there was also direct dispersal from cold water stagnant water was similar in terms of water tcc diversity and composition to its source and metacommunity the warm water however dispersal from the biofilm phase i e biofilm detachment during stagnation increased tcc and lowered diversity as the microbiome converged with biofilm microbiomes figs 4 and 7 phylogenetic convergence between stagnant water and biofilm samples has been noted previously inkinen et al 2014 and might be tied to the duration of stagnation ji et al 2017 biofilms all had low diversity compared to water and were also different from each other with only 8 otus shared by all biofilms fig 7 organic carbon leaching from the hoses likely provide a positive selective force and pvc p is specifically known to select for a low diversity in biofilms compared to other materials proctor et al 2016 growth in biofilms might be a selective force in and of itself as reduced diversity in biofilms compared to water has been noted previously in building drinking water plumbing inkinen et al 2016 and a chlorinated distribution system douterelo et al 2017 but not a non chlorinated distribution system liu et al 2014 4 3 2 biofilm composition is driven by multiple factors that co vary with biofilm tcc biofilm tcc seemed to drive some components of microbiome composition fig s6 while some bacteria may be affected by biofilm thickness itself e g more diverse niche space in thick biofilms with localized gradients flemming et al 2016 multiple selective forces affect biofilm tcc and composition simultaneously for example sphingomonas had a negative correlation with biofilm tcc it is resistant to chlorine jia et al 2015 and thus disinfectant may be acting as a selective force that dictates both sphingomonas abundance and biofilm tcc limnobacter also had a negative correlation with biofilm tcc but is susceptible to chlorine jia et al 2015 since it can degrade phenol vedler et al 2013 which leaches from some plastic pipes skjevrak et al 2003 this suggests the positive selective force of plastic pipes when growth conditions are otherwise non ideal meiothermus is an interesting example of a genus positively correlating with biofilm tcc it is slightly thermophilic has a reddish color causes biofouling and has been isolated in geothermal springs with iron oxidizing activity kolari et al 2003 urbieta et al 2015 here meiothemus accounted for 12 of two notably red biofilms from south africa fig s4b with high iron concentrations 0 09 and 5 μg cm2 suggesting that temperature iron oxidation and high biofilm cell concentrations were all contributing selective factors for the presence of this organism 4 4 quantifying and managing risk from shower hose biofilms 4 4 1 shower hose biofilms hold risks toxic metals and potential opportunistic pathogens were found in shower hose biofilms metal exposure is through consumption drinking and thus exposure from showers would be low but not obsolete e g brushing teeth in shower additionally particulate lead is sporadically detected in building drinking water deshommes et al 2010 and could result from biofilm detachment i e dislodged during hose manipulation however the metal biofilm concentrations in the shower hoses e g 75 ng pb cm2 are probably lower than detected in distributions systems lehtola et al 2004 and thus the metal concentrations in the biofilms are unlikely to be a major contributor to risk all of the reported potential opportunistic pathogens present a risk specifically for showering with routes of infection either through inhalation or wound exposure falkinham et al 2015 the presence of potential opportunistic pathogens in these biofilms agrees with their identification in previous local surveys collins et al 2017 moat et al 2016 soto giron et al 2016 however it is difficult to interpret the clinical relevance of the concentrations since little is understood about 1 how these biofilms detach into the water phase and 2 what dose is required for infection moreover for reported genera derived from sequencing data species and strain level definition was not possible and thus these do not necessarily present risks a common argument for biofilm control is that reducing total biofilm also reduces risk of exposure to opportunistic pathogens however biofilm tcc likely co varies with or affects biofilm microbiome composition as discussed above l pneumophila is thought to proliferate in thick biofilms and recently a threshold biofilm concentration for l pneumophila growth was proposed at 106 cells cm2 van der kooij et al 2017 most of our biofilm concentrations were above this threshold and l pneumophila was even detected below the proposed threshold although a positive relationship between tcc and l pneumophila was not found fig 8b legionella data correlated positively with tcc fig 8a indicating that decreasing biofilm tcc can protect against this particular potential risk other potential opportunistic pathogens may have a negative correlation with biofilm tcc e g mycobacterium and p aeruginosa meier and bendinger 2016 proctor et al 2016 or with other potential opportunistic pathogens e g legionella with p aeruginosa leoni et al 2001 in this study mycobacterium and pseudomonas correlated negatively with biofilm tcc fig 8d and e and co occurred with each other more than with legionella in a study of shower hose biofilms exposed to chlorine residual in the us mycobacterium dominated soto giron et al 2016 and thus disinfectant resistance may play a role in these correlations with biofilm management strategies it is necessary to weigh the risks of many potential pathogens simultaneously reducing biofilm concentration i e with disinfectant may reduce risk from some potential pathogens while increasing risk from others stagnant water which is influenced by detached biofilm had the highest potential risk of the three water types tested however biofilm was not the only source for these genera since the cold water was also frequently positive for potential opportunistic pathogens in a previous study of showers in the uk only 40 of stagnant water samples positive for legionella were also positive in shower hose biofilm swabs collins et al 2017 further indicating that other sources e g cold water distribution systems may be equally important for shower exposure 4 4 2 shower hose biofilms represent a meaningful sampling point water samples are the easiest type of sample to collect from household drinking water plumbing systems wang et al 2017 however 2 of bacterial biomass of distribution systems is present in the planktonic phase with most biomass in biofilms and loosely deposited material liu et al 2014 our data in combination with the available evidence on real shower environments collins et al 2017 feazel et al 2009 soto giron et al 2016 suggest that potential opportunistic pathogens are harbored in shower related biofilms shower hoses offer one of the most convenient sampling locations for biofilm monitoring in building drinking water plumbing i e excluding wastewater plumbing most components of building drinking water plumbing are not removable and are difficult to sample e g manual swabbing thus limiting reproducibility and representativeness in contrast shower hoses can be removed and replaced offering large sections 350 800 cm2 of easily accessible biofilms an aged biofilm may also be more representative of the building drinking water plumbing system than a grab water sample i e accumulation of metals over time variable disinfection concentrations and temperature in water such a biofilm based approach will complement the wealth of knowledge on building drinking water plumbing water and is necessary for a more complete understanding of the ecology and risks of household drinking water plumbing 4 4 3 shower hoses can be managed better shower hoses offer a critical area for improvement of building drinking water plumbing management strategies these hoses typically fall outside potable water material regulations but clearly microbiology needs to be considered as it stands consumers assume all risks and receive little guidance about this portion of easily controlled building drinking water plumbing moreover shower hoses are not necessary for all homes and could be replaced with safer hard pipe material hospitals and old age homes are generally better informed about limiting risk from shower environments programs for quarterly shower hose and head replacement aimed at reducing risk are available for such facilities table s9 given the tenuous relationship between age and biofilm tcc in this study a more radical strategy like single use shower hoses table s9 may be necessary for high risk patients less aggressive strategies such as allowing shower hoses to dry between uses are not likely sufficient to prevent colonization by potential opportunistic pathogens whiley et al 2015 in any case an effective management of building drinking water plumbing should be backed up by effective monitoring 4 4 2 above 5 conclusions in a global survey and controlled study shower hoses were characterized in detail in terms of biofilm concentrations metal accumulation and microbiome composition while many factors were uncontrolled some trends were apparent when disinfectants were used cell concentrations and diversity were reduced young shower hose age and bad material quality likely contributed to high cell concentrations frequent but irregular use likely contributed to high cell concentrations the microbiome along the path of water delivery in a building could be explained by dispersal and selection biofilm microbiome composition was shaped by several factors some of which co varied with cell concentration genera that may contain potential opportunistic pathogens were detected with either a positive legionella or negative mycobacterium pseudomonas correlation with cell concentration metals accumulated over time in biofilms likely originating from other building drinking water plumbing components while more controlled studies should further explore these trends it is clear that shower hoses offer a perfect biofilm sampling point to complement building water studies and that shower hoses should be considered in building drinking water plumbing risk management strategies acknowledgements the authors acknowledge financial support from mermaid
