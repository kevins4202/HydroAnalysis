will be made available on request 1 introduction china is the largest producer of electrolytic manganese metal with an annual output of about 1 4 million tons accounting for more than 97 0 of the global supply shu et al 2020 manganese resources are widely required by the steel non ferrous metals and chemical industry issa et al 2020 li and zhang 2020 zhan et al 2019 but electrolysis manganese slag ems containing a large amount of heavy metal mn2 and inorganic nh4 n is also produced an et al 2021a shu et al 2020 through atmospheric deposition waste residue infiltration wastewater discharge and other ways the highly toxic mn2 and nh4 n containing leachate infiltrated into the water body and surrounding soil resulting in cumulative pollution and human and ecological hazards bai et al 2020 feng et al 2017 under the dual challenges of resources and the environment there is an urgent need to take steps to avoid these negative effects conventional heavy metal and inorganic nitrogen remediation methods include physicochemical methods plants microorganisms and other single remediation techniques and combined remediation techniques oehmen et al 2006 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however single physicochemical method had disadvantages such as expensive chemical agents high risk of secondary pollution and energy consumption kumar et al 2022 in addition most of the current mn2 related studies show that bacteria can only remove low concentrations of mn2 huang et al 2020 li et al 2020 and there is a lack to explore co contaminated of mn2 and nh4 n abu hasan et al 2012 kara et al 2021 therefore a cost effective alternative to address these limitations is in great need considering the recycling and utilization of biomass solid waste a new type of biochar material is used as microbial carriers zhang et al 2021a and a stable and efficient microbial biochar coupling system has attracted wide attention to provide new ideas for the efficient restoration stabilization and green energy conservation in water and soil so as to alleviate industrial pollution aqwa et al 2020 tu et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 as an environmentally friendly and inexpensive material biochar provides attachment sites for microorganisms and provides nutrients to address the limitations of free bacteria in terms of cell separation cell growth rate and environmental factors yang et al 2020a zhang et al al 2021a and the enhanced microbial activity further promotes the ability to remove heavy metal tan et al 2016 yang et al 2020a studies showed that the combined action of biochar bacteria can effectively and synergistically improve the removal capacity of heavy metal pollutants wu et al 2019 used nano iron activated carbon composites in conjunction with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 to remove 26 5 mg l 1 of cr6 in a short time 3 5 min and the removal efficiency was as high as 99 90 deng et al 2022 studied that the biosorption capacity of bacillus cereus rc 1 immobilized on straw biochar was 93 02 mg g 1 of 180 mg l 1 cd2 however the efficiency and mechanism of the biochar bacteria system to remove high concentrations of mn2 and nh4 n from complex real water bodies containing environmental factors and soils are still unclear firstly the practical application of biochar bacteria system should fully consider the problem of high environmental sensitivity of bacteria su et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 secondly the inhibitory or facilitative effects of greenhouse gases from carbon nitrogen metabolism during biochar bacteria treatment remain unclear research on the regulation of greenhouse gases has practical guiding significance zhang et al 2021b thirdly the knowledge of soil related parameters affected by biochar bacteria system was limited biochar bacteria system will also cause changes in soil environment such as soil physicochemical properties soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure which will affect soil fertility and pollutant transformation capacity li et al 2018 tu et al 2020 based on the above the main purpose of this paper is 1 simulating the removal of high concentrations of mn2 and nh4 n by the biochar bacteria system in the sequencing batch bioreactor sbr under different environmental conditions c n temperature and coexisting metals mg2 and ca2 and exploring the reaction pathway 2 to explore the immobilization of mn2 and nh4 n in the soil by the biochar bacteria system through soil column experiments 3 to explore the effect of the biochar bacteria system on soil physicochemical properties enzyme activities and microbial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 grapefruit peel waste and strain grapefruit peel biochar bc was obtained by the pyrolysis of grapefruit peel waste and the detailed method was followed by an et al 2020 the strain used was acinetobacter sp al 6 strain al 6 gen bank id ky930369 that had been isolated with nitrification and mn2 removal properties an et al 2021b strain al 6 was activated in luria bertani medium lb for 24 h under 30 c and 120 rpm and bc was sterilized in an autoclave before use then inoculated into sbr for experiments the information of media could be seen in the supplementary materials s1 2 2 performance of grapefruit peel biochar and strain al 6 in sbr in the previous study an et al 2021b we found that the combination of bc and strain al 6 could effectively remove mn2 and nh4 n with synergistic effect and it was verified that the strain al 6 was attached to the biochar further in this study to explore the removal characteristics of bc composite strain al 6 on mn2 and nh4 n contaminated water under actual complex environmental conditions the reactor environment was set to different c n 5 10 15 su et al 2020 temperature 20 30 40 c su et al 2021 and coexisting metals only mn2 mn2 mg2 ca2 pareuil et al 2010 the specific sbr experimental preparation and process could refer to supplementary materials s3 the summary of the operating phase of sbr could be seen in table 1 and the sbr installation diagram could be seen in fig s1 the pellets after centrifugation were freeze dried then the surface functional groups and crystal structure were tested by fourier transforms infrared spectrophotometer ftir and x ray diffraction analysis xrd respectively 2 3 effect of biochar and strain al 6 to gas emission to analyze the effect of bc and strain al 6 to the gas n2 n2o co2 emission during the treatment of mn2 and nh4 n contaminated wastewater the specific gas measurement process methods and instruments could refer to supplementary materials s4 2 4 soil cultivation experiment the soil was collected from an uncontaminated site in chengkou county chongqing city 31 37 n 108 15 e to study the remediation of soil by bc and strain al 6 column experiments were carried out and the soil column installation diagram could be seen in fig s2 the specific preparation and settings of the soil column experiment could be seen in the supplementary materials s5 2 5 soil physicochemical properties soil microscopic morphology surface functional groups and soil texture and mineral composition could be observed by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds bet method ftir and xrd respectively ph electric potential eh total organic carbon toc and cation exchange capacity cec were also parameters to assess soil physicochemical properties to investigate the effect of bc and strain al 6 to soil physicochemical properties after treating mn2 and nh4 n bc and strain al 6 was added into contaminated soil treating for 45 d to tested the above properties the detailed method could be seen in the supplementary materials s6 2 6 determination of soil enzyme activity to explore the change of enzymes activity in the mn2 and nh4 n contaminated soil after treating with bc and strain al 6 the urease and catalase activity of soil were detected urea is used as the substrate the urease activity was determined by the sodium hypochlorite sodium phenolic colorimetric method and expressed as mg nh4 n g 1 24 h 1 bhaduri et al 2016 catalase activity was measured by potassium permanganate assay using hydrogen peroxide as a substrate and expressed as 0 02 mol l 1 kmno4 h 1g 1 roldan et al 1996 2 7 soil microecology the cultivated soil with and without bc and strain al 6 were sent to beijing qingke new industry biotechnology co ltd for testing and soil dna was extracted using soil dna kit then the 16s rrna gene was amplified by a thermocycling pcr system with primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 bacterial communities were analyzed on the illumina novaseq platform by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 simultaneous mn2 and nh4 n removal performance of the bioreactor 3 1 1 effect of c n on bioreactor performance carbon and nitrogen sources are important nutritional factors for bacterial growth and affect the removal of heavy metals the effect of c n on the removal of nh4 n in sbr could be seen in fig 1 a phase 1 2 3 it showed that under c n 5 10 and 15 the nh4 n was removed to 97 7 94 4 and 94 0 p 0 05 respectively the results showed that the outstanding removal efficiency of bc and strain al 6 even under the condition of poor carbon source lower c n ratios eg 5 will impair the growth of heterotrophs and the availability of electron donors for denitrification chen et al 2019 as well as inefficient removal ability of strain to heavy metals however due to the addition of biochar the carbon source can be adequately provided for the system to avoid this effect chen et al 2016 wu et al 2020 also bc and strain al 6 removed mn2 remarkably fig 1 b phase 1 2 3 showed that the mn2 removal ratios were 99 3 99 8 and 98 5 p 0 05 respectively compared with our previous study an et al 2021b the introduction of trace elements and aeration promoted the growth of microorganisms and improved the removal of mn2 as shown in the blank group the mn2 had the highest removal efficiency of 38 0 and the trend showed that mn2 concentration decreased to the highest degree at 48 h and increased after then the reason was that during the aeration mn2 was oxidized to mnco3 precipitates which was verified by the xrd spectrum fig s4 and then the precipitates decreased presumably due to the release of mn2 by prolonged aeration in addition the cod removal ratios were showed in the fig 1 c 1 2 3 which were 82 3 84 0 and 76 5 p 0 05 respectively actually with the increase of c n ratio and the cod concentration utilized by bacteria were 1323 2 2688 and 3672 mg l 1 respectively the total amount of cod utilized by bacteria increased with the increase of c n ratio the reason was that the cod removal effect is related to the colony forming units of bacteria and with the increase of cod concentration the bacteria grow better so there is a higher cod utilization ahmad et al 2008 in the whole phase the nitrate concentrations were range from 0 1 04 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 1 d and the nitrite concentrations were range from 0 02 0 92 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 1 e the results showed the low accumulation of nitrates and nitrites the possible reason is that the presence of heavy metals significantly inhibited the expression of nitrate nr and nitrite reductase gene nir miao et al 2018 ramirez et al 2018 from the fig 1 f ph raised from 7 to 9 in the experiment group and from 5 5 to 7 5 in the blank group the increase in ph was due to the formation of mnco3 in the process and the reason for the initial decrease in ph in blank group is that the reaction between metal ions and ammonium ions makes the system acidic wang et al 2019 on the whole c n 5 can provide sufficient conditions for bc and strain al 6 to remove mn2 and nh4 n 3 1 2 effect of temperature on bioreactor performance temperature changes can affect the interaction between bacteria and pollutants and thus affect the removal efficiency cucchiari et al 2008 govarthanan et al 2016 qin et al 2013 the effect of temperature on the removal of nh4 n in sbr could be seen in the fig 1 a phase 4 5 6 it showed that under 20 30 40 c the nh4 n was removed to 43 6 98 0 and 97 0 p 0 05 respectively the removal of nh4 n by bc and strain al 6 was affected by lower temperature 20 c in addition from fig 1 c phase 4 5 6 cod removal ratios were 68 6 78 2 and 89 7 p 0 05 respectively which indicated that the cod removal was slightly affected at lower temperatures studies have shown that lower or higher temperatures are not suitable for the expression of bacterial growth related genes which will affect their life activities resulting in poor microbial removal performance wang et al 2021 the best efficiency is usually achieved at 30 0 c chang et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 in particular strain al 6 demonstrated its high temperature tolerance in fig 1 b phase 4 5 6 the influence of temperature to mn2 removal was slight even the removal ratios of mn2 reached the maximum 100 at 20 c the maintenance of mn2 removal effect may be related to aeration oxidation totally 30 c is the optimal condition for mn2 and nh4 n removal by bc and strain al 6 3 1 3 effect of coexisting ions on bioreactor performance researches showed that in addition to mn2 and nh4 n the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 are also high in the emr leaching solution ma et al 2016 it is obvious in fig 1 a phase 7 8 that the coexisting ions had inhibition on the removal of nh4 n in sbr it showed that under mn2 mg2 and ca2 group the concentration of nh4 n was removed by 90 1 p 0 05 at 24 h however then nh4 n concentration increased the reason could be that ca2 and mg2 are the substances required for the physiological metabolism of microorganisms and they are also the regulatory substances for the active reactions of physiological metabolism inorganic salts with an appropriate concentration can promote the growth and metabolism of microorganisms and the synthesis process of products however excessive concentrations can cause obvious inhibitory effects on the normal combination of other ions and enzymes and reduce the activity of nitrifying bacteria to reduce ammonia nitrogen qing et al 2007 specifically microorganisms mainly respond to external ion stress by secreting protein pn song et al 2016 when the ca2 concentration is too high bacteria secrete pn into eps providing more binding sites for ca2 amino acids in dna act as major bridging groups higgins novak 1997 liao 2000 which decompose to nh4 n in water causing the increase of nh4 n conversely from fig 1 b phase 7 8 mn2 removal efficiency was still excellent above 99 similarly in the research of phatai et al 2014 the presence of ca2 and mg2 had no negative effect on the removal of mn2 in the fig 1 f phase 8 ph increased from 6 to 9 gradually therefore the phenomenon could be analyzed by that the addition of mg2 and ca2 promotes the hydrolysis of the ions and makes the solution in a higher alkaline environment which is more conducive to the precipitation of mn2 and the cod removal ratios were 82 7 and 98 1 p 0 05 respectively it showed that the adding of mg2 and ca2 had not decreased the removal of carbon sources same as the research of gong et al 2008 in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the removal ratio of serratia ficaria to 190 mg l 1 of cod was 84 5 the above results showed that coexisting ions mg2 and ca2 in the experimental group had apparent inhibition to nh4 n removal but had no negative effects on the removal of mn2 and cod in addition the removal characteristics of bc and strain al 6 in sbr could be seen in the supplementary materials s7 3 2 detection and characterization of gas products generated to account for the impact of bc and strain al 6 on nitrogen and carbon conversion n2o n2 and co2 produced during a typical cycle of water process were also measured in fig 2 the blank group showed that the proportions of n2 co2 and n2o were 89 56 10 40 and 0 03 respectively while those in the experimental group were 39 58 60 40 and 0 02 respectively especially in the fig 2 b c n2o concentration difference between the experimental group and the blank group is not significant but n2 concentration in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the blank group the experimental results showed that the formation of n2 during the action of bc and strain al 6 indicated the complete denitrification process and the content of greenhouse gas n2o produced during the removal of pollutants by bc and strain al 6 is small the existence of biochar provides more organic carbon for the system which further promotes the process of n reduction chen et al 2016 wu et al 2020 in addition previous studies have found that biochar can reduce n2o generation in two ways i biochar can reduce n2o emissions by inhibiting the reduction of nitrate or nitrite to n2o wu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 ii biochar can directly stimulate microorganisms to reduce n2o to n2 liu et al 2019 harter et al 2014 xu et al 2014 since the previous experimental results showed that ammonia nitrogen was basically removed and the production of nitrate and nitrite was minute which indicated that the second way was the main reason for the decrease of n2o while a small amount of n2o was generated the content of co2 increased therefore it could be speculated that biochar further promotes the utilization of organic nitrogen by bacteria and converted organic carbon to co2 researches showed that the reducing power of nitrogen reduction is generated by carbon oxidative catabolism dias et al 2010 zhang et al 2021b zumft 1997 so from the perspective of individual metabolism the accumulation of intermediate n2o is also possibly the result of an imbalance in carbon and nitrogen metabolism during denitrification dai et al 2020 3 3 immobilization of mn2 and nh4 n in soil by bc and strain al 6 3 3 1 characterization of soil immobilized bc and strain al 6 to observe the surface morphology and element changes of soil biochar and microbial mixture the soils treated by bc and strain al 6 before and after were taken to measure sem eds from fig s5 b c d the soil is in close contact with the bc thus bc and soil can react with the microorganisms attached to it in addition it is obvious that there is irregular flocculent material on the surface of bc the elemental composition of the precipitates was analyzed by eds especially compare fig s5 e with fig s5 f it is obvious that after the addition of bc mn and a large amount of c o appeared on the precipitation surface therefore it could be speculated that the soil mixture had a continuous immobilization effect on mn obviously the carbon content of the system was increased by bc from table 2 bet detection showed that the bet value of soil with biochar and strain al 6 treatment was 7 4014 m2 g 1 the total pore volume was 1 8204 10 2 cm3 g 1 and the mean pore diameter was 9 8382 nm the bet value total pore volume and mean pore diameter of pure soil was 10 838 m2 g 1 3 0 10 2 cm3 g 1 3 758 nm respectively it can be seen that due to biochar possess porous structure the adding of it reduced the specific surface area of soil mixture and increased the mean pore diameter of soil mixture and the result is consistent with the fact that specific surface area is positively correlated with pore volume and negatively correlated with pore size 3 3 2 immobilization performance of bc and strain al 6 to mn2 and nh4 n in soil from fig 3 a mn2 concentration after treating with bc and strain al 6 was 423 41 mg l 1 39 74 mg l 1 11 81 mg l 1 and 0 59 mg l 1 under 0 3 15 45 d and that of the blank group without bc and strain al 6 treatment was 542 27 mg l 1 229 41 mg l 1 93 39 mg l 1 22 58 mg l 1 respectively however 1 84 g kg 1 mn in soils by burkholderia sp z 90 was 52 2 after 5 d yang et al 2016 results showed that soil with bc and strain al 6 treatment reached the remarkable immobilization effect on mn2 in highly toxic soil environments biochar possesses special pore structure and surface active sites that can attach and enrich microorganisms zhang et al 2021a and provides nutrients to maintain bacterial species yang et al 2020b this helps to improve the removal efficiency of heavy metal by microbial tan et al 2016 fig 3 a also showed that the nh4 n initially detected from the soil in bc and strain al 6 group was only 36 67 mg l 1 and the blank group was 143 33 mg l 1 after 3 d there is no nh4 n leaching from the soil in experiment group and 5 33 mg l 1 of nh4 n detection in blank group in addition fig 3 b showed the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were range from 0 002 0 5 mg l 1 it showed that nh4 n was reduced to nitrogen by strain and immobilized by bc same as the effect of mn2 bc and strain al 6 demonstrated effective nh4 n removal novak et al 2010 found that water leachate collected from soils treated with switchgrass biochar had no detectable nh4 n after 67 d and the reduction of nh4 n in the leaching solution after biochar addition was mainly attributed to the increase of soil water holding capacity n immobilization capacity and nh4 n adsorption by biochar and nitrogen bioavailability zheng et al 2013 the detailed immobilization characteristics analysis could be seen in the supplementary materials s8 in general bc and strain al 6 could effectively control the leakage of mn2 and nh4 n in soil while the removal of nh4 n was mainly through efficient biological transformation promoted by bc that of mn2 was mainly through soil functional group function promoted by bc and strain al 6 3 4 effects of bc and strain al 6 on soil physicochemical properties from fig 4 toc increased from 11 93 g kg 1 to 33 33 g kg 1 study showed that the effect of biochar on organic carbon in soil is gradual yuan et al 2022 the phenomenon confirmed that biochar provides soil with a large amount of organic matter which facilitates microbial growth palansooriya et al 2019 cec is defined as the amount of exchangeable cations such as ca2 mg2 k na and nh4 bound to the soil sample lee et al 2010 cec increased from 8 cmol kg 1 to 25 59 cmol kg 1 which showed that the soil has strong fertilizer retention therefore the soil has a stronger ability to maintain and supply the nutrients needed by microorganism chen et al 2016 wu et al 2020 similar enhancement of soil toc and cec by biochar occurred in the research of liu et al 2022 and schulz and glaser 2012 ph increased from 6 19 to 7 89 and the reason was biochar is alkaline in fact an alkaline environment is more conducive to the growth of bacteria in a similar study soil ph increased from 6 6 to 7 5 by e bugandensis tj6 resulting in a 30 8 increase in cd2 removal with a concomitant increase in the amount of urease han et al 2020 additionally the reduction of h ions in solution allows more positively charged binary heavy metal ions to combine with anionic functional groups on the bacterial surface increasing the adsorption capacity of bacterial cell walls for heavy metals huang et al 2017 eh decreased from 28 to 68 the same eh decrease happen in the study of stephen et al 2015 the phenomenon showed that the soil has changed from oxidation state to strongly reduced state eh contributes to biotransformation in bc by altering the redox potential of soil bc matrix sumaraj and padhye 2017 totally the adding of bc and strain al 6 increased the soil fertility and facilitated the transformation of pollutants 3 5 soil activity analysis studies have shown that the application of biochar can affect soil activity and thus affect the transformation of soil pollutants yang et al 2020a the effect of biochar addition on soil microbial metabolism of heavy metals was routinely assessed by the activities of soil enzymes catalase and urease he et al 2019 shi et al 2017 after soil remediation with bc and strain al 6 for 45 d catalase activity increased obviously which was 0 26 1 54 1 92 10 26 0 02 mol l 1 kmno4 h 1g 1 under 0 3 15 45 d respectively fig 5 urease activity was 0 126 4 57 4 865 5 10 mg nh3 n g 124 h 1 under 0 3 15 45 d respectively fig 5 overall soil enzyme activities showed an increasing trend similar trend could be found that soil urease activity increased by 115 169 in biochar and metal fixing bacteria treatments cheng et al 2020 biochar modified soil loaded with 5 pseudomonas frederiksbergensis nt 2 had the high level of catalase activity than pure soil tu et al 2020 this might be due to the protective effect of the porous biochar structure on soil enzyme activity richard et al 2013 making the soil function self recovery ability faster and higher 3 6 microbial community diversity analysis the relative abundance of bacteria in soil after bc and strain al 6 treatments at the end of soil column experiments 45 d was quantified from high throughput dna sequencing results a total of 160 276 available sequences were obtained for analysis of species diversity in all treated soil samples the species diversity within a single soil sample was studied by alpha diversity analysis and the ace chao1 shannon and simpson indices of each sample were calculated in addition the results showed that coverage 1 0 the higher the value the higher the probability that the species in the sample is detected which illustrated the scientific and referential nature of the data chen and achal 2019 the feature ace chao 1 simpson and shannon indices of the experimental group were lower than those of the blank group in the case of the same species abundance the smaller the uniformity of each species in the experimental group community the smaller the diversity of the community and the lower the species diversity of the sample grice et al 2009 this indicated that soil bacterial diversity and richness decreased after bc and strain al 6 remediation fig 6 a showed the microbial composition at the phylum level proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteriota account for the top three types of soil samples from high to low proteobacteria accounted for 44 8 and 48 6 in the layers of control and bc strain al 6 group respectively the data suggest that most denitrifying bacteria belong to this phylum proteobacteria si et al 2018 relative abundances of class level α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria were higher compared to controls fig 6 b the results showed that the addition of bc and strain al 6 increased the abundance of proteobacteria thus verifying that the bacteria played an important role in the removal of nitrate from ammonia nitrogen conversion in addition the addition of strain al 6 made actinobacteriota in the experimental group significantly higher than the control group indicating that actinobacteriota played a key role in the soil mn2 fixation and nh4 n conversion as actinobacteriota has a thicker peptidoglycan layer that increases the surface area for binding metals supports metal elasticity and increases metabolic activity at contaminated sites hema et al 2014 mackie et al 2015 zhan and sun 2014 these results could provide useful information for understanding bc and strain al 6 on the process of soil immobilization of heavy metal mn2 and biological nitrogen conversion 4 conclusion the coupling of grapefruit peel biochar with strain al 6 could promote efficient nitrification and mn2 immobilization in water especially in a short time the presence of biochar promoted microbial carbon and nitrogen transformation to generate co2 and reduce n2o and even at a lower rate of strain al 6 and bc substrate soil environmental quality and microbial metabolic activity was improved remarkably which contributed to the transformation of pollutants these findings will provide some new insights into the interaction between nh4 n reduction and mn2 immobilization and the biochar bacteria system especially as a

global supply shu et al 2020 manganese resources are widely required by the steel non ferrous metals and chemical industry issa et al 2020 li and zhang 2020 zhan et al 2019 but electrolysis manganese slag ems containing a large amount of heavy metal mn2 and inorganic nh4 n is also produced an et al 2021a shu et al 2020 through atmospheric deposition waste residue infiltration wastewater discharge

2012 kara et al 2021 therefore a cost effective alternative to address these limitations is in great need considering the recycling and utilization of biomass solid waste a new type of biochar material is used as microbial carriers zhang et al 2021a and a stable and efficient microbial biochar coupling system has attracted wide attention to provide new ideas for the efficient restoration stabilization and green energy conservation in water and soil so as to alleviate industrial pollution aqwa et al 2020 tu et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 as an environmentally friendly and inexpensive material biochar provides attachment sites for microorganisms and provides nutrients to address the limitations of free bacteria in terms of cell separation cell growth rate and environmental factors yang et al 2020a zhang et al al 2021a and the enhanced microbial activity further promotes the ability to remove heavy metal tan et al 2016 yang et al 2020a studies showed that the combined action of biochar bacteria can effectively and synergistically improve the removal capacity of heavy metal pollutants wu et al 2019 used nano iron activated carbon composites in conjunction with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 to remove 26 5 mg l 1 of cr6 in a short time 3 5 min and the removal efficiency was as high as 99 90 deng et al 2022 studied that the biosorption capacity of bacillus cereus rc 1 immobilized on straw biochar was 93 02 mg g 1 of 180 mg l 1 cd2 however the efficiency and mechanism of the biochar bacteria system to remove high concentrations of mn2 and nh4 n from complex real water bodies containing environmental factors and soils are still unclear firstly the practical application of biochar bacteria system should fully consider the problem of high environmental sensitivity of bacteria su et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 secondly the inhibitory or facilitative effects of greenhouse gases from carbon nitrogen metabolism during biochar bacteria treatment remain unclear research on the regulation of greenhouse gases has practical guiding significance zhang et al 2021b thirdly the knowledge of soil related parameters affected by biochar bacteria system was limited biochar bacteria system will also cause changes in soil environment such as soil physicochemical properties soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure which will affect soil fertility and pollutant transformation capacity li et al 2018 tu et al 2020 based on the above the main purpose of this paper is 1 simulating the removal of high concentrations of mn2 and nh4 n by the biochar bacteria system in the sequencing batch bioreactor sbr under different environmental conditions c n temperature and coexisting metals mg2 and ca2 and exploring the reaction pathway 2 to explore the immobilization of mn2 and nh4 n in the soil by the biochar bacteria system through soil column experiments 3 to explore the effect of the biochar bacteria system on soil physicochemical properties enzyme activities and microbial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 grapefruit peel waste and strain grapefruit peel biochar bc was obtained by the pyrolysis of grapefruit peel waste and the detailed method was followed by an et al 2020 the strain used was acinetobacter sp al 6 strain al 6 gen bank id ky930369 that had been isolated with nitrification and mn2 removal properties an et al 2021b strain al 6 was activated in luria bertani medium lb for 24 h under 30 c and 120 rpm and bc was sterilized in an autoclave before use then inoculated into sbr for experiments the information of media could be seen in the supplementary materials s1 2 2 performance of grapefruit peel biochar and strain al 6 in sbr in the previous study an et al 2021b we found that the combination of bc and strain al 6 could effectively remove mn2 and nh4 n with synergistic effect and it was verified that the strain al 6 was attached to the biochar further in this study to explore the removal characteristics of bc composite strain al 6 on mn2 and nh4 n contaminated water under actual complex environmental conditions the reactor environment was set to different c n 5 10 15 su et al 2020 temperature 20 30 40 c su et al 2021 and coexisting metals only mn2 mn2 mg2 ca2 pareuil et al 2010 the specific sbr experimental preparation and process could refer to supplementary materials s3 the summary of the operating phase of sbr could be seen in table 1 and the sbr installation diagram could be seen in fig s1 the pellets after centrifugation were freeze dried then the surface functional groups and crystal structure were tested by fourier transforms infrared spectrophotometer ftir and x ray diffraction analysis xrd respectively 2 3 effect of biochar and strain al 6 to gas emission to analyze the effect of bc and strain al 6 to the gas n2 n2o co2 emission during the treatment of mn2 and nh4 n contaminated wastewater the specific gas measurement process methods and instruments could refer to supplementary materials s4 2 4 soil cultivation experiment the soil was collected from an uncontaminated site in chengkou county chongqing city 31 37 n 108 15 e to study the remediation of soil by bc and strain al 6 column experiments were carried out and the soil column installation diagram could be seen in fig s2 the specific preparation and settings of the soil column experiment could be seen in the supplementary materials s5 2 5 soil physicochemical properties soil microscopic morphology surface functional groups and soil texture and mineral composition could be observed by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds bet method ftir and xrd respectively ph electric potential eh total organic carbon toc and cation exchange capacity cec were also parameters to assess soil physicochemical properties to investigate the effect of bc and strain al 6 to soil physicochemical properties after treating mn2 and nh4 n bc and strain al 6 was added into contaminated soil treating for 45 d to tested the above properties the detailed method could be seen in the supplementary materials s6 2 6 determination of soil enzyme activity to explore the change of enzymes activity in the mn2 and nh4 n contaminated soil after treating with bc and strain al 6 the urease and catalase activity of soil were detected urea is used as the substrate the urease activity was determined by the sodium hypochlorite sodium phenolic colorimetric method and expressed as mg nh4 n g 1 24 h 1 bhaduri et al 2016 catalase activity was measured by potassium permanganate assay using hydrogen peroxide as a substrate and expressed as 0 02 mol l 1 kmno4 h 1g 1 roldan et al 1996 2 7 soil microecology the cultivated soil with and without bc and strain al 6 were sent to beijing qingke new industry biotechnology co ltd for testing and soil dna was extracted using soil dna kit then the 16s rrna gene was amplified by a thermocycling pcr system with primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 bacterial communities were analyzed on the illumina novaseq platform by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 simultaneous mn2 and nh4 n removal performance of the bioreactor 3 1 1 effect of c n on bioreactor performance carbon and nitrogen sources are important nutritional factors for bacterial growth and affect the removal of heavy metals the effect of c n on the removal of nh4 n in sbr could be seen in fig 1 a phase 1 2 3 it showed that under c n 5 10 and 15 the nh4 n was removed to 97 7 94 4 and 94 0 p 0 05 respectively the results showed that the outstanding removal efficiency of bc and strain al 6 even under the condition of poor carbon source lower c n ratios eg 5 will impair the growth of heterotrophs and the availability of electron donors for denitrification chen et al 2019 as well as inefficient removal ability of strain to heavy metals however due to the addition of biochar the carbon source can be adequately provided for the system to avoid this effect chen et al 2016 wu et al 2020 also bc and strain al 6 removed mn2 remarkably fig 1 b phase 1 2 3 showed that the mn2 removal ratios were 99 3 99 8 and 98 5 p 0 05 respectively compared with our previous study an et al 2021b the introduction of trace elements and aeration promoted the growth of microorganisms and improved the removal of mn2 as shown in the blank group the mn2 had the highest removal efficiency of 38 0 and the trend showed that mn2 concentration decreased to the highest degree at 48 h and increased after then the reason was that during the aeration mn2 was oxidized to mnco3 precipitates which was verified by the xrd spectrum fig s4 and then the precipitates decreased presumably due to the release of mn2 by prolonged aeration in addition the cod removal ratios were showed in the fig 1 c 1 2 3 which were 82 3 84 0 and 76 5 p 0 05 respectively actually with the increase of c n ratio and the cod concentration utilized by bacteria were 1323 2 2688 and 3672 mg l 1 respectively the total amount of cod utilized by bacteria increased with the increase of c n ratio the reason was that the cod removal effect is related to the colony forming units of bacteria and with the increase of cod concentration the bacteria grow better so there is a higher cod utilization ahmad et al 2008 in the whole phase the nitrate concentrations were range from 0 1 04 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 1 d and the nitrite concentrations were range from 0 02 0 92 mg l 1 p 0 05 fig 1 e the results showed the low accumulation of nitrates and nitrites the possible reason is that the presence of heavy metals significantly inhibited the expression of nitrate nr and nitrite reductase gene nir miao et al 2018 ramirez et al 2018 from the fig 1 f ph raised from 7 to 9 in the experiment group and from 5 5 to 7 5 in the blank group the increase in ph was due to the formation of mnco3 in the process and the reason for the initial decrease in ph in blank group is that the reaction between metal ions and ammonium ions makes the system acidic wang et al 2019 on the whole c n 5 can provide sufficient conditions for bc and strain al 6 to remove mn2 and nh4 n 3 1 2 effect of temperature on bioreactor performance temperature changes can affect the interaction between bacteria and pollutants and thus affect the removal efficiency cucchiari et al 2008 govarthanan et al 2016 qin et al 2013 the effect of temperature on the removal of nh4 n in sbr could be seen in the fig 1 a phase 4 5 6 it showed that under 20 30 40 c the nh4 n was removed to 43 6 98 0 and 97 0 p 0 05 respectively the removal of nh4 n by bc and strain al 6 was affected by lower temperature 20 c in addition from fig 1 c phase 4 5 6 cod removal ratios were 68 6 78 2 and 89 7 p 0 05 respectively which indicated that the cod removal was slightly affected at lower temperatures studies have shown that lower or higher temperatures are not suitable for the expression of bacterial growth related genes which will affect their life activities resulting in poor microbial removal performance wang et al 2021 the best efficiency is usually achieved at 30 0 c chang et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 in particular strain al 6 demonstrated its high temperature tolerance in fig 1 b phase 4 5 6 the influence of temperature to mn2 removal was slight even the removal ratios of mn2 reached the maximum 100 at 20 c the maintenance of mn2 removal effect may be related to aeration oxidation totally 30 c is the optimal condition for mn2 and nh4 n removal by bc and strain al 6 3 1 3 effect of coexisting ions on bioreactor performance researches showed that in addition to mn2 and nh4 n the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 are also high in the emr leaching solution ma et al 2016 it is obvious in fig 1 a phase 7 8 that the coexisting ions had inhibition on the removal of nh4 n in sbr it showed that under mn2 mg2 and ca2 group the concentration of nh4 n was removed by 90 1 p 0 05 at 24 h however then nh4 n concentration increased the reason could be that ca2 and mg2 are the substances required for the physiological metabolism of microorganisms and they are also the regulatory substances for the active reactions of physiological metabolism inorganic salts with an appropriate concentration can promote the growth and metabolism of microorganisms and the synthesis process of products however excessive concentrations can cause obvious inhibitory effects on the normal combination of other ions and enzymes and reduce the activity of nitrifying bacteria to reduce ammonia nitrogen qing et al 2007 specifically microorganisms mainly respond to external ion stress by secreting protein pn song et al 2016 when the ca2 concentration is too high bacteria secrete pn into eps providing more binding sites for ca2 amino acids in dna act as major bridging groups higgins novak 1997 liao 2000 which decompose to nh4 n in water causing the increase of nh4 n conversely from fig 1 b phase 7 8 mn2 removal efficiency was still excellent above 99 similarly in the research of phatai et al 2014 the presence of ca2 and mg2 had no negative effect on the removal of mn2 in the fig 1 f phase 8 ph increased from 6 to 9 gradually therefore the phenomenon could be analyzed by that the addition of mg2 and ca2 promotes the hydrolysis of the ions and makes the solution in a higher alkaline environment which is more conducive to the precipitation of mn2 and the cod removal ratios were 82 7 and 98 1 p 0 05 respectively it showed that the adding of mg2 and ca2 had not decreased the removal of carbon sources same as the research of gong et al 2008 in the presence of mg2 and ca2 the removal ratio of serratia ficaria to 190 mg l 1 of cod was 84 5 the above results showed that coexisting ions mg2 and ca2 in the experimental group had apparent inhibition to nh4 n removal but had no negative effects on the removal of mn2 and cod in addition the removal characteristics of bc and strain al 6 in sbr could be seen in the supplementary materials s7 3 2 detection and characterization of gas products generated to account for the impact of bc and strain al 6 on nitrogen and carbon conversion n2o n2 and co2 produced during a typical cycle of water process were also measured in fig 2 the blank group showed that the proportions of n2 co2 and n2o were 89 56 10 40 and 0 03 respectively while those in the experimental group were 39 58 60 40 and 0 02 respectively especially in the fig 2 b c n2o concentration difference between the experimental group and the blank group is not significant but n2 concentration in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the blank group the experimental results showed that the formation of n2 during the action of bc and strain al 6 indicated the complete denitrification process and the content of greenhouse gas n2o produced during the removal of pollutants by bc and strain al 6 is small the existence of biochar provides more organic carbon for the system which further promotes the process of n reduction chen et al 2016 wu et al 2020 in addition previous studies have found that biochar can reduce n2o generation in two ways i biochar can reduce n2o emissions by inhibiting the reduction of nitrate or nitrite to n2o wu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 ii biochar can directly stimulate microorganisms to reduce n2o to n2 liu et al 2019 harter et al 2014 xu et al 2014 since the previous experimental results showed that ammonia nitrogen was basically removed and the production of nitrate and nitrite was minute which indicated that the second way was the main reason for the decrease of n2o while a small amount of n2o was generated the content of co2 increased therefore it could be speculated that biochar further promotes the utilization of organic nitrogen by bacteria and converted organic carbon to co2 researches showed that the reducing power of nitrogen reduction is generated by carbon oxidative catabolism dias et al 2010 zhang et al 2021b zumft 1997 so from the perspective of individual metabolism the accumulation of intermediate n2o is also possibly the result of an imbalance in carbon and nitrogen metabolism during denitrification dai et al 2020 3 3 immobilization of mn2 and nh4 n in soil by bc and strain al 6 3 3 1 characterization of soil immobilized bc and strain al 6 to observe the surface morphology and element changes of soil biochar and microbial mixture the soils treated by bc and strain al 6 before and after were taken to measure sem eds from fig s5 b c d the soil is in close contact with the bc thus bc and soil can react with the microorganisms attached to it in addition it is obvious that there is irregular flocculent material on the surface of bc the elemental composition of the precipitates was analyzed by eds especially compare fig s5 e with fig s5 f it is obvious that after the addition of bc mn and a large amount of c o appeared on the precipitation surface therefore it could be speculated that the soil mixture had a continuous immobilization effect on mn obviously the carbon content of the system was increased by bc from table 2 bet detection showed that the bet value of soil with biochar and strain al 6 treatment was 7 4014 m2 g 1 the total pore volume was 1 8204 10 2 cm3 g 1 and the mean pore diameter was 9 8382 nm the bet value total pore volume and mean pore diameter of pure soil was 10 838 m2 g 1 3 0 10 2 cm3 g 1 3 758 nm respectively it can be seen that due to biochar possess porous structure the adding of it reduced the specific surface area of soil mixture and increased the mean pore diameter of soil mixture and the result is consistent with the fact that specific surface area is positively correlated with pore volume and negatively correlated with pore size 3 3 2 immobilization performance of bc and strain al 6 to mn2 and nh4 n in soil from fig 3 a mn2 concentration after treating with bc and strain al 6 was 423 41 mg l 1 39 74 mg l 1 11 81 mg l 1 and 0 59 mg l 1 under 0 3 15 45 d and that of the blank group without bc and strain al 6 treatment was 542 27 mg l 1 229 41 mg l 1 93 39 mg l 1 22 58 mg l 1 respectively however 1 84 g kg 1 mn in soils by burkholderia sp z 90 was 52 2 after 5 d yang et al 2016 results showed that soil with bc and strain al 6 treatment reached the remarkable immobilization effect on mn2 in highly toxic soil environments biochar possesses special pore structure and surface active sites that can attach and enrich microorganisms zhang et al 2021a and provides nutrients to maintain bacterial species yang et al 2020b this helps to improve the removal efficiency of heavy metal by microbial tan et al 2016 fig 3 a also showed that the nh4 n initially detected from the soil in bc and strain al 6 group was only 36 67 mg l 1 and the blank group was 143 33 mg l 1 after 3 d there is no nh4 n leaching from the soil in experiment group and 5 33 mg l 1 of nh4 n detection in blank group in addition fig 3 b showed the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were range from 0 002 0 5 mg l 1 it showed that nh4 n was reduced to nitrogen by strain and immobilized by bc same as the effect of mn2 bc and strain al 6 demonstrated effective nh4 n removal novak et al 2010 found that water leachate collected from soils treated with switchgrass biochar had no detectable nh4 n after 67 d and the reduction of nh4 n in the leaching solution after biochar addition was mainly attributed to the increase of soil water holding capacity n immobilization capacity and nh4 n adsorption by biochar and nitrogen bioavailability zheng et al 2013 the detailed immobilization characteristics analysis could be seen in the supplementary materials s8 in general bc and strain al 6 could effectively control the leakage of mn2 and nh4 n in soil while the removal of nh4 n was mainly through efficient biological transformation promoted by bc that of mn2 was mainly through soil functional group function promoted by bc and strain al 6 3 4 effects of bc and strain al 6 on soil physicochemical properties from fig 4 toc increased from 11 93 g kg 1 to 33 33 g kg 1 study showed that the effect of biochar on organic carbon in soil is gradual yuan et al 2022 the phenomenon confirmed that biochar provides soil with a large amount of organic matter which facilitates microbial growth palansooriya et al 2019 cec is defined as the amount of exchangeable cations such as ca2 mg2 k na and nh4 bound to the soil sample lee et al 2010 cec increased from 8 cmol kg 1 to 25 59 cmol kg 1 which showed that the soil has strong fertilizer retention therefore the soil has a stronger ability to maintain and supply the nutrients needed by microorganism chen et al 2016 wu et al 2020 similar enhancement of soil toc and cec by biochar occurred in the research of liu et al 2022 and schulz and glaser 2012 ph increased from 6 19 to 7 89 and the reason was biochar is alkaline in fact an alkaline environment is more conducive to the growth of bacteria in a similar study soil ph increased from 6 6 to 7 5 by e bugandensis tj6 resulting in a 30 8 increase in cd2 removal with a concomitant increase in the amount of urease han et al 2020 additionally the reduction of h ions in solution allows more positively charged binary heavy metal ions to combine with anionic functional groups on the bacterial surface increasing the adsorption capacity of bacterial cell walls for heavy metals huang et al 2017 eh decreased from 28 to 68 the same eh decrease happen in the study of stephen et al 2015 the phenomenon showed that the soil has changed from oxidation state to strongly reduced state eh contributes to biotransformation in bc by altering the redox potential of soil bc matrix sumaraj and padhye 2017 totally the adding of bc and strain al 6 increased the soil fertility and facilitated the transformation of pollutants 3 5 soil activity analysis studies have shown that the application of biochar can affect soil activity and thus affect the transformation of soil pollutants yang et al 2020a the effect of biochar addition on soil microbial metabolism of heavy metals was routinely assessed by the activities of soil enzymes catalase and urease he et al 2019 shi et al 2017 after soil remediation with bc and strain al 6 for 45 d catalase activity increased obviously which was 0 26 1 54 1 92 10 26 0 02 mol l 1 kmno4 h 1g 1 under 0 3 15 45 d respectively fig 5 urease activity was 0 126 4 57 4 865 5 10 mg nh3 n g 124 h 1 under 0 3 15 45 d respectively fig 5 overall soil enzyme activities showed an increasing trend similar trend could be found that soil urease activity increased by 115 169 in biochar and metal fixing bacteria treatments cheng et al 2020 biochar modified soil loaded with 5 pseudomonas frederiksbergensis nt 2 had the high level of catalase activity than pure soil tu et al 2020 this might be due to the protective effect of the porous biochar structure on soil enzyme activity richard et al 2013 making the soil function self recovery ability faster and higher 3 6 microbial community diversity analysis the relative abundance of bacteria in soil after bc and strain al 6 treatments at the end of soil column experiments 45 d was quantified from high throughput dna sequencing results a total of 160 276 available sequences were obtained for analysis of species diversity in all treated soil samples the species diversity within a single soil sample was studied by alpha diversity analysis and the ace chao1 shannon and simpson indices of each sample were calculated in addition the results showed that coverage 1 0 the higher the value the higher the probability that the species in the sample is detected which illustrated the scientific and referential nature of the data chen and achal 2019 the feature ace chao 1 simpson and shannon indices of the experimental group were lower than those of the blank group in the case of the same species abundance the smaller the uniformity of each species in the experimental group community the smaller the diversity of the community and the lower the species diversity of the sample grice et al 2009 this indicated that soil bacterial diversity and richness decreased after bc and strain al 6 remediation fig 6 a showed the microbial composition at the phylum level proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteriota account for the top three types of soil samples from high to low proteobacteria accounted for 44 8 and 48 6 in the layers of control and bc strain al 6 group respectively the data suggest that most denitrifying bacteria belong to this phylum proteobacteria si et al 2018 relative abundances of class level α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria were higher compared to controls fig 6 b the results showed that the addition of bc and strain al 6 increased the abundance of proteobacteria thus verifying that the bacteria played an important role in the removal of nitrate from ammonia nitrogen conversion in addition the addition of strain al 6 made actinobacteriota in the experimental group significantly higher than the control group indicating that actinobacteriota played a key role in the soil mn2 fixation and nh4 n conversion as actinobacteriota has a thicker peptidoglycan layer that increases the surface area for binding metals supports metal elasticity and increases metabolic activity at contaminated sites hema et al 2014 mackie et al 2015 zhan and sun 2014 these results could provide useful information for understanding bc and strain al 6 on the process of soil immobilization of heavy metal mn2 and biological nitrogen conversion 4 conclusion the coupling of grapefruit peel biochar with strain al 6 could promote efficient nitrification and mn2 immobilization in water especially in a short time the presence of biochar promoted microbial carbon and nitrogen transformation to generate co2 and reduce n2o and even at a lower rate of strain al 6 and bc substrate soil environmental quality and microbial metabolic activity was improved remarkably which contributed to the transformation of pollutants these findings will provide some new insights into the interaction between nh4 n reduction and mn2 immobilization and the biochar bacteria system especially as a

15556,long term exposure to excessive iodine via drinking water significantly increases the risk of thyroid diseases further the mechanisms and feasible technologies for iodine removal are far from being well elucidated in this study we constructed a heterogeneous bi2o3 mno2 interface with oxidation and adsorption efficiency toward iodide i and investigated the performance and mechanisms involved in iodine removal bi2o3 mno2 at the optimized bi mn ratio of 0 05 1 had a maximum adsorption capacity of 1 19 1 21 and 1 06 mg g toward i iodine elemental i2 and iodate io3 respectively according to the density functional theory dft calculation bi2o3 mno2 had an adsorption energy of 2 34 2 11 and 3 89 ev for i i2 and io3 and exhibited a better band structure and state density character for iodine removal based on the results of xps hplc and lc icp ms characterization bi2o3 plays an important role in adsorbing and capturing i whereas mno2 dominates the moderate oxidation of i and the adsorption of i and i2 the adsorbed i and i2 concentrations on the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces were 146 3 μg l and 18 3 μg l notably io3 was not detected owing to its moderate oxidation effect the coexisting ions of chloride cl and bromide br tended to occupy the bi2o3 lattice and form insoluble biocl and biobr further reductive species such as sulphite so3 2 may reduce mno2 to mn iii and mn ii the synergistic effect between moderate oxidation and adsorption led to bi2o3 mno2 with high iodine removal capability overall this study proposes a strategy for designing suitable interfaces and adsorbents for iodine removal however further studies are necessary to advance its application in practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodine bi2o3 mno2 heterogeneous interface drinking water moderate oxidation adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the widespread occurrence of toxic inorganics such as arsenic fluorine and iodine in groundwater has led to remarkable health problems in residents worldwide he et al 2020 2021 podgorski and berg 2020 in recent decades many studies have investigated the removal of as and fluorine from drinking water bakshi et al 2018 hu et al 2015 qu et al 2010 in fact different commercial adsorbents such as gho alumina and feasible technologies have been developed for practical applications unfortunately only few studies have focused on the removal of iodine from groundwater and suitable technologies to control iodine exposure via drinking water are lacking iodine is an important basic element for the synthesis of thyroid hormones and maintenance of human health miles et al 2022 thyroid diseases tend to occur owing to iodine deficiency or excess iodine intake the world health organization who recommends daily iodine intakes of 150 120 and 250 μg d for adults children and pregnant women respectively la vecchia et al 2015 in the groundwater of la pampa argentina iodine concentrations were found to be as high as 316 μg l watts et al 2010 further the concentrations of iodine in the water supply from rabouni and el aiune in southwestern algeria were 724 and 934 μg l respectively barikmo et al 2011 people in somalia also intake excessive levels of iodine via drinking water as its iodine concentration is above 300 μg l kassim et al 2014 high iodine groundwater with total iodine concentrations above 100 μg l is widely found throughout the north china plain shen et al 2011 accordingly over 30 million people are potentially exposed to excessive iodine via drinking water andersen et al 2009 xue et al 2019 which might markedly increase the occurrence of thyroid disease and other endemic diseases farebrother et al 2019 in china the newly issued sanitary standard for drinking water gb 5749 stipulates that the maximum level of total iodine should be 0 1 mg l i is the main iodine species in groundwater accounting for over 95 of the total iodine small amounts of hoi i2 io3 and organic iodine are also found in groundwater cox and arai 2014 suitable technologies must be developed to remove i from groundwater whose concentrations are relatively lower than those in industrial wastewaters such as radioactive wastewater most studies have focused on the removal of i at concentrations ranging from several decades to several mg l adsorption is viewed as one of the best available technologies for iodine removal owing to its low cost and simple maintenance the ag doped silicon based nanospheres prepared using the layer by layer assembly method were found to have a high adsorption capacity of 236 98 mg g toward radioactive i li and li 2019 the bio adsorbent prepared with mangosteen pericarps and red onion peels achieved 90 iodine removal initial i concentration i 0 10 mg l within 30 min phanthuwongpakdee et al 2020 an innovative adsorbent with a cross linked chitosan porous metal organic framework was developed to remove radioactive i and an i adsorption capacity as high as 399 69 mg g was observed at an i 0 of 400 mg l el shahat et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 developed cross linked chitosan microspheres with a maximum adsorption capacity of 0 88 mmol g within 40 mins i 0 2 mmol l ph 5 the i removal efficiency was found to be above 95 over a wide ph range and in the presence of coexisting ions zhang et al 2019 notably these studies mainly focused on the heterogeneous adsorption of i as a result the transformation of iodine species rarely occurred heterogeneous oxidation and transformation have been widely reported to markedly improve the removal efficiency fe mn binary oxides with heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption exhibit good removal performance toward antimony iii xu et al 2011 and organoarsenic compounds joshi et al 2017 the monovalent ion i is difficult to adsorb on a solid interface and the heterogeneous oxidation of i to i2 is expected to improve iodine removal however chemicals such as chlorine sahulka et al 2021 ozone iakovides et al 2019 and chlorite dioxide sorlini et al 2014 are usually dosed as pre oxidants for disinfection as a result the oxidation of i to io3 mackeown et al 2022 inevitably and significantly inhibits iodine removal generally adsorbents exhibit good adsorption performance toward specific iodine species such as i i2 and io3 owing to their rather different characteristics heterogeneous interfaces with different sorbing sites for various iodine species should be constructed to achieve the simultaneous removal of multiple iodine species and simplify the treatment processes as much as possible mno2 may theoretically oxidise i to i2 and io3 in neutral and weakly alkaline ph ranges and i2 can be adsorbed on the surface of δ mno2 allard et al 2009 loading bi2o3 nanoparticles onto the surfaces of mxene pda resin was found to significantly improve the selectivity toward i sha et al 2020 yu et al 2022 the composite doping of binary oxides with different properties markedly improves the adsorption performance through synergistic effects zhang et al 2007a further the bi2o3 mno2 binary oxide is assumed to exhibit high performance toward iodine in detail bi2o3 is expected to capture and enrich i and io3 on surfaces and mno2 may accept electrons from the adsorbed i and achieve moderate oxidation of i to i2 with stronger affinity toward surfaces to the best of our knowledge only few studies have investigated the mechanisms and pathways involved in the moderate oxidation and adsorption of iodine on heterogeneous surfaces and have proposed innovative adsorbents for various iodine species the objectives of this study were to 1 construct a suitable heterogeneous bi2o3 mno2 interface for iodine and investigate its surface characteristics by sem hrtem and xrd 2 evaluate the macroscopic removal performance and species transformation of iodine using hplc xps and lc icp ms and 3 propose the optimum structure using dft and clarify the mechanisms involved in iodine adsorption on bi2o3 mno2 the study findings advance current understanding of the mechanisms involved in iodine removal and propose a strategy for iodine removal from drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemical reagents used in the experiment are detailed in the supporting information 2 2 raw source water used in the experiments to verify the iodine removal efficiency of bi2o3 mno2 in high iodine groundwater groundwater samples were collected from heze city shandong province e 115 83 n 35 67 huaibei city anhui province e 116

perform dft calculations within the generalized gradient approximation gga using the pbe perdew et al 1996 formulation the projected augmented wave paw potentials blöchl et al 2003 kresse and joubert 1999 were selected to describe the ionic cores and consider valence electrons using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 ev the partial occupancies of the kohn sham orbitals were allowed using the gaussian smearing method with a width of 0 05 ev the electronic energy was considered to be self consistent when the energy change was less than 10 5 ev geometry optimization was considered convergent when the force change was smaller than 0 02 ev å grimme s dft d3 methodology grimme et al 2010 was used to describe the dispersion interactions on site corrections dft u were applied to the 3d electrons of the ti atoms ueff 4 2 ev using a previous approach grimme et al 2010 the equilibrium lattice constants of the γ mno2 unit cell were optimised using a 2 10 6 monkhorst pack k point grid for brillouin zone sampling as follows a 13 819 å b 2 843 å c 4 305 å α 90 β 89 01 and γ 90 these constants were then used to construct a γ mno2 131 surface model model 1 with p 1 1 periodicity in the x and y directions and four stoichiometric layers in the z direction separated by a vacuum layer at a depth of 15 å to separate the surface slab from its periodic duplicates the

surface slab from its periodic duplicates model 4 comprised 32 bi atoms and 48 o atoms during structural optimization the γ point in the brillouin zone was used for k point sampling and the bottom two

experiments to investigate the i i2 and io3 removal performance 20 mg bi2o3 mno2 was added to 100 ml of magnetically stirred solutions with i 0 i2 0 and io3 0 of 200 μg l in cylindrical plexiglas containers at room temperature 25 c samples were collected at different time intervals and filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters jinteng china prior to the analysis of the total iodine iodine species and mn2 concentrations to investigate the mechanism and reaction pathways involved in iodine adsorption bi2o3 mno2 was pretreated with solutions containing different concentrations of cl br or so3 2 0 to 200 mg l for 24 h subsequently i adsorption experiments were conducted according to the aforementioned methods all experiments were carried out at room temperature to evaluate the effects of different water matrix on i removal the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 10 using 0 1 mol l h2so4 and naoh solutions and the solutions of coexisting inorganic ions i e silicate sio4 2 sulphate so4 2 carbonate co3 2 and phosphate po4 2 were added to obtain desired concentrations of 0 5 mg l the reaction conditions for i removal from groundwater were the same as those for the deionised water system all experiments were carried out at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and performance of bi2o3 mno2 3 1 1 physical and chemical properties the lattice composition and surface morphology of bi2o3 mno2 5 are illustrated in fig 1 a f bi2o3 mno2 5 was composed of spherical particles of bi 7 6 mn 59 7 and o 32 7 fig 1 b and c show the lattice characteristics of bi2o3 mno2 5 according to the analysis by the digitalmicrograph software the lattice spacing of bi2o3 mno2 5 was 0 23 nm 0 28 nm 0 45 nm 0 26 nm and 0 22 nm which corresponded to the mno2 230 bi2o3 211 bi2o3 111 bi2o3 022 and bi2o3 222 crystal planes jcpds no 71 2274 and 14 0644 combined with the sem results fig 1 d and e bi2o3 mno2 5 was identified to be mainly composed of floc and rod like crystals further fine bi2o3 crystals were evenly distributed on the spherical surface the xrd patterns of bi2o3 γ mno2 and bi2o3 mno2 5 are shown in fig 1 g the diffraction peaks in bi2o3 mno2 5 were assigned to bi2o3 and the γ type crystal of mno2 the diffraction peaks at 25 7 26 9 49 9 and 56 5 corresponded to the 002 122 114 and 242 crystal planes of bi2o3 jcpds no 71 2274 and those at 22 4 37 1 42 6 and 65 6 corresponded to the 120 131 300 and 421 crystal planes of γ mno2 jcpds no 14 0644 the bet surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter of bi2o3 mno2 5 were 45 67 m2 g 0 11 cm3 g and 9 48 nm respectively the values for these parameters were less than those of γ mno2 80 36 m2 g 0 20 cm3 g and 14 30 nm as shown in table s1 this result may be due to the changes in the characteristics of γ mno2 and reduction in specific surface area induced by doping with bi2o3 3 1 2 performance of the total iodine removal process after bi2o3 mno2 composites with bi mn molar ratios of 0 1 2 5 8 and 10 were prepared their total iodine removal efficiencies were assessed the results are shown in fig 1 h when the bi mn molar ratio was increased from 0 to 5 the total iodine removal efficiency increased from 50 3 to 83 4 however when the bi mn molar ratios were 8 and 10 the degradation efficiency gradually decreased to 74 4 and 73 8 respectively thus the optimal bi mn molar ratio for bi2o3 mno2 was 5 owing to the selectivity and affinity of bi3 to iodine the contents of bi2o3 in bi2o3 mno2 increased as the bi mn molar ratio increased thereby improving the adsorption efficiency of iodine sha et al 2020 however at bi mn molar ratios above 5 the formation of bi2o3 significantly reduced the specific surface area of bi2o3 mno2 and the adsorption removal efficiency of iodine decreased accordingly based on these results bi2o3 mno2 5 was selected for the subsequent studies 3 2 construction of the iodine removal interface by theoretical calculation the optimal adsorption structures of mno2 bi2o3 and bi2o3 mno2 were constructed using dft calculations as shown in figs 2 and s1 thereafter the adsorption structures of bi2o3 mno2 and mno2 for i i2 and io3 were optimized the adsorption energy of bi2o3 mno2 for i i2 and io3 was 2 34 ev 2 11 ev and 3 89 ev respectively as shown in table s2 the adsorption energy was reported to be negatively correlated with adsorption performance li et al 2012 comparatively the bond length formed on bi2o3 mno2 was slightly larger whereas the adsorption energy of iodine was significantly lower than that of mno2 owing to the selectivity of bi2o3 accordingly the adsorption of iodine was favoured the adsorption of io3 onto bi2o3 mno2 generated the bi o bond with a bond length of 2 37 å this length was lower than that of the bi i bonds 3 08 and 3 55 å involved in the adsorption of i and i2 on bi2o3 mno2 respectively the length of the bi x bond formed by adsorption was proportional to the adsorption energy which is related to the better adsorption of io3 than i and i2 on bi2o3 mno2 cao et al 2021 bi2o3 mno2 and mno2 possess redox efficacy and their electron transfer ability reflects the activity of metal oxides the band structure results obtained by theoretical calculations are shown in fig s2 a and c the gap interval of bi2o3 mno2 was significantly smaller than that of mno2 and the higher overlap extent of the conduction band and valence band was beneficial to electron transfer which enabled bi2o3 mno2 to possess a higher activity than mno2 li et al 2012 fig s2 b and d show the density of states dos of mno2 and bi2o3 mno2 before and after i adsorption respectively the characteristic peaks of the surface dos of mno2 and bi2o3 mno2 deviated from the original energy level after iodine adsorption the decreased peak intensity could be attributed to the charge transfer of iodine to the heterogeneous interfaces the extent of variation in bi2o3 mno2 was significantly greater than that in mno2 interestingly the adsorption of i onto bi2o3 mno2 significantly changed the dos curve fig s2 d and the appearance of a new continuous density peak at 4 5 ev indicated a strong interaction between iodide and the bi2o3 mno2 surface tan et al 2021 comparatively upon adsorption of i onto mno2 no new peaks appeared on the dos curve at the same position such finding supports the higher affinity of iodine to the bi2o3 mno2 surface relative to mno2 3 3 iodine species variation involved in the different systems 3 3 1 reactions of i i2 and io3 adsorption onto bi2o3 mno2 the removal kinetics of i i2 io3 and total iodine by bi2o3 mno2 are shown in fig s3 and the fitting results of the three kinetic equations are presented in table 1 as indicated by the regression coefficient value of r2 the pseudo second order kinetics was the best option for describing the adsorption performance further the chemisorption processes were inferred to involve external liquid solid interface diffusion surface adsorption and particle diffusion fu et al 2016 the maximum adsorption capacities of different iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 were 1186 36 1213 41 and 1062 46 μg g for i i2 and io3 respectively comparatively the adsorption rate of io3 onto bi2o3 mno2 was 9 41e 04 μg g 1 min 1 which was one fold higher than that of i and i2 to elucidate the dominant reactions involved in the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 the transformation of the iodine species was investigated figs 4 a and 5 a when the reaction time was 60 min the residual i concentrations decreased from 200 0 to 25 5 μg l fig 4a while the hoi i2 concentrations increased and then decreased the maximum hoi i2 accumulation was 18 9 μg l at a reaction time of 20 min but decreased to 8 7 μg l after 60 min of reaction io3 formation rarely occurred and the final io3 concentration was as low as 1 2 μg l the concentration of solid phase iodine increased continuously to as high as 164 6 μg l with a reaction time of 60 min such finding supported the heterogeneous transfer and adsorption of iodine on the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces fig 5 a shows the xps results of bi2o3 mno2 reacted with i with characteristic peaks at binding energies be of 619 0 630 5 620 0 and 631 9 ev this result indicated the existence of two iodine species i and i2 on the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces kang et al 2020 mu et al 2016 with elemental ratios of 88 9 and 11 1 table 2 respectively in addition nearly 100 of mn iv was converted to mn iii mn ii and 17 6 of mn iii was further transformed to mn ii in the adsorption of i onto bi2o3 mno2 fig s4 moderate oxidation of i to i2 and the adsorption of various iodine species were inferred to occur during the adsorption of i onto bi2o3 mno2 moreover mn iv and mn iii were involved in the reactions with a maximum iodine removal of as high as 87 3 fig 3 a and b illustrate the removal trends of different iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 with the addition of i2 as the model pollutant upon addition to water i2 tends to undergo a series of disproportionation reactions to form i hoi i2 and io3 eqs 2 4 baldwin 1986 cox and arai 2014 herein the concentrations of i hoi i2 and io3 were 137 0 39 5 and 7 5 μg l fig 3a respectively 2 i 2 h 2 o i i o 3 h 3 i 2 h 2 o hoi i h 4 3 ioh i o 3 2 i 3 h the concentrations of i hoi i2 and io3 decreased to 29 3 26 6 and 0 7 μg l as the reaction time prolonged the concentrations of solid phase iodine on bi2o3 mno2 increased continuously to 127 2 μg l supporting the strong affinity toward various iodine species of i hoi i2 and io3 based on previous studies kang et al 2020 mao et al 2016 the results of xps analysis of elemental i fig 3 b indicated that i and io3 were the dominant iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 accounting for 21 2 and 78 8 of the total iodine however i2 spectra could hardly be observed on the bi2o3 mno2 surface which might be due to the rare existence of stable i2 and the low sensitivity of the equipment as indicated by the mn xps spectra fig s4 e the ratios of mn iv and mn iii decreased from 24 0 to 0 and 66 7 to 57 3 respectively and that of mn ii increased from 9 3 to 42 7 respectively similar to the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 mn iv and mn iii tended to oxidise either i or hoi i2 to iodine species with a higher valence in addition the characteristic peak on the in situ raman spectra at 523 nm disappeared upon addition of i fig s5 which supports the occurrence of moderate oxidation fig 3 c illustrates the removal trends of different iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 with the addition of io3 as the model pollutant io3 was gradually adsorbed onto bi2o3 mno2 with a prolonged reaction time and the removal efficiency was as high as 77 2 after 60 min combined with the xps results in fig 3 d io3 was identified as the main iodine species and other iodine species could hardly be detected in both the solution and solid phases this result indicates a strong adsorption of io3 on bi2o3 mno2 and the rare involvement of electron transfer in the adsorption in the reactions with i i2 and io3 the xps spectra of bi displayed little variation fig s4 and elemental bi was rarely involved in the electron transfer and oxidation of the different iodine species bi2o3 mno2 exhibited good efficiency at removing various iodine species from water further the removal of i and i2 was achieved by moderate oxidation and adsorption whereas that of io3 was achieved via adsorption 3 3 2 effects of cl br and so3 2 on the adsorption of iodine onto bi2o3 mno2 as halogen elements the chloride cl and bromide br ions displayed similar properties to i bi2o3 has been reported to exhibit good adsorption efficiency toward cl and br which occupy the lattice and adsorption sites of bi2o3 to generate biocl and biobr shi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2012 yang et al 2016 the coexisting cl and br are assumed to inhibit the adsorption of iodine additionally so3 2 a typical reducing agent was reported to effectively consume the oxidising capability of mno2 and reduce the amount of mn iv available for oxidation zhang et al 2007b to further illustrate the roles of the active components of bi2o3 and mno2 in i removal the cl br and so3 2 ions were added to occupy the bi2o3 sorption sites and consume the mno2 oxidation sites evaluating the effects of these ions on i removal may advance our understanding of iodine species transformation and the mechanisms involved in iodine adsorption onto bi2o3 mno2 synergistic effects between bi2o3 and mno2 were observed with regard to i removal by bi2o3 mno2 fig 1h fig s6 demonstrates the effects of cl br and so3 2 at different doses on the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 of note the removal of total iodine decreased more remarkably with elevated doses the total iodine removal decreased from 76 6 to 50 5 53 0 and 23 4 with the addition of 200 mg l of cl br and so3 2 further the inhibitory effects followed the trend so3 2 cl br the variations in the characteristic xps peaks on bi2o3 mno2 after the addition of cl br and so3 2 are shown in figs 5 and s7 according to the xps analysis of mn and bi figs 5b and s7 the pre adsorption of cl and br had insignificant effects on the mn iv spectra in bi2o3 mno2 table 2 further so3 2 pretreatment significantly decreased the proportion of mn iv from 24 0 to 0 0 and increased that of mn ii from 9 3 to 57 0 so3 2 pretreatment also significantly weakened the raman peaks of γ crystal mno2 within bi2o3 mno2 at wavelengths of 640 574 and 523 nm fig 5 d supporting the remarkable consumption of mno2 oxidation capacity by so3 2 fig 5 c shows the xrd results for bi2o3 mno2 for different reaction systems after the reaction with i new bioi crystal phases appeared on the crystal planes of the original bi2o3 including 002 012 122 114 and 242 indicating the important role of bi2o3 with regard to i removal i was captured and adsorbed into the lattice jcpds no 85 0863 and the adsorption of cl and br by bi2o3 mno2 was similar after pretreatment new phases of biocl and biobr were formed on the crystal plane of the original bi2o3 jcpds no 85 0861 and 73 2061 further the lattice occupied by cl and br atoms had markedly less adsorption toward i after so3 2 pretreatment the mnso4 crystal phase formed on bi2o3 mno2 and a new crystal phase appeared jcpds no 73 1361 which was attributed to the direct reduction of mn iv to mn ii by so3 2 and the adsorption and occupation of mn ii on the original active sites zhang et al 2007b this effect markedly inhibited the oxidation and adsorption ability of mno2 the bi xps spectra indicated that the bi valence state rarely varied after pretreatment with cl br and so3 2 and the characteristic peak ratio of bi was stable at 0 44 0 56 fig s7 3 3 3 iodide removal performance of pretreated bi2o3 mno2 to further illustrate the effects of cl br and so3 2 on the removal of different iodine species by bi2o3 mno2 the species transformation trends of iodine in the liquid and solid phases are shown in figs 4 and 5 compared to the original bi2o3 mno2 the adsorption of i onto cl br and so3 2 pretreated bi2o3 mno2 was investigated after a 60 min reaction the residual i concentrations increased from 25 5 μg l to 62 9 57 0 and 109 2 μg l the inhibitory effects were found to be consistent with the trends in total iodine removal herein 13 0 and 32 4 μg l of hoi i2 were initially generated during the adsorption of i onto cl and br pretreated bi2o3 mno2 but decreased to 12 0 and 29 3 μg l respectively such finding suggests that i was moderately oxidised by bi2o3 mno2 to i2 and then removed by adsorption the xps results support the existence of i and i2 on these four pretreated bi2o3 mno2 surfaces fig 5 a the occupation of the bi2o3 mno2 lattices by cl and br inhibited the adsorption of i from 88 9 to 61 0 and 52 3 respectively table 2 the ratios of adsorbed i2 increased from 11 1 to 39 0 and 47 7 while mn iv completely transformed into mn iii mn ii with lower chemical valence table 2 and fig s8 this is because pretreatment with cl and br did not affect the oxidation of mno2 in bi2o3 mno2 comparatively so3 2 pretreatment decreased the ratio of adsorbed i2 to 8 7 whereas that of adsorbed i increased to 91 3 owing to the significantly weakened oxidation capability of bi2o3 mno2 in the adsorption of iodine onto bi2o3 mno2 bi2o3 mainly provides sorbing sites for i whereas mno2 dominates in moderate i oxidation and i i2 adsorption the synergistic effects between moderate oxidation and adsorption play important roles in i removal 3 4 proposed mechanisms involved in iodide removal by bi2o3 mno2 the dominant reactions and pathways involved in the removal of iodine by bi2o3 mno2 at multiple sites are shown in fig 6 and table 3 in natural groundwater different coexisting iodine species of i hoi i2 and io3 tend to undergo disproportionation reactions eqs 2 and 3 upon addition of bi2o3 mno2 aqueous i transferred onto the heterogeneous surfaces via the formation of a bi i bond with bi2o3 mno2 eq 5 and i occupied the bi2o3 lattice in bi2o3 mno2 to generate bioi eq 6 simultaneously mno2 in bi2o3 mno2 tended to moderately oxidise aqueous i and adsorb i to i2 eq 7 and provided adsorption sites for i and i2 in this case mn iv was reduced to mn iii and mn ii eqs 8 and 9 the mn release concentration is presented in the supplementary material mn iii was also involved in the oxidation of i eq 10 aqueous hoi i2 may be adsorbed onto the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces by the formation of two bi i bonds eq 11 and heterogeneous oxidation to io3 by mn iv also occurred eq 12 aqueous io3 easily forms bi o bonds with bi2o3 mno2 and is removed accordingly eq 13 mn iv can be reduced to mn ii eq 14 by coexisting reductants such as so3 2 which markedly inhibits the oxidation of i and hoi i2 the reductively dissolved mn ii may be re adsorbed onto the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces eq 15 and potentially competes with iodine for adsorption sites coexisting halogen ions such as cl and br may occupy the bi2o3 mno2 lattices to form biocl and biobr eqs 16 and 17 further the removal of i was markedly inhibited 3 5 effects of water matrix on iodine removal fig 7 a illustrates the effect of ph on the removal of total iodine by bi2o3 mno2 at ph 4 1 8 6 the removal efficiencies of total iodine in bi2o3 mno2 were 80 6 76 2 71 6 and 78 6 and the reaction rates were 2 4 10 2 2 2 10 2 1 9 10 2 and 2 3 10 2 min 1 respectively the removal efficiency of total iodine by bi2o3 mno2 was higher in acidic and weakly alkaline ph ranges than at ph 10 1 where the reaction rate was as low as 0 7 10 2 min 1 thus the solution ph affects iodine speciation and i can hardly coexist with io3 under acidic conditions and tends to be converted to hoi and i2 this effect favours i oxidation and the adsorption of various iodine species eq 18 baldwin 1986 cox and arai 2014 under strong alkali conditions i can hardly be converted to hoi and i2 as they are prone to conversion into i and io3 eq 19 cox and arai 2014 under acidic ph conditions bi2o3 mno2 had positive surfaces owing to the protonation effect and h accumulation and concentration improved the adsorption of negative i zhao et al 2018 bi2o3 mno2 has negative surfaces at elevated ph i e higher oh concentrations and the attraction and attachment of i are markedly inhibited by electrostatic repulsion li et al 2020 comparatively γ mno2 could hardly remove i at alkaline ph fig s9 a and bi3 within bi2o3 mno2 may selectively adsorb i of note i removal is less ph dependant fig 7 b illustrates the apparent rate constant kobs of total iodine removal by bi2o3 mno2 at different concentrations of inorganic ions i e sio4 2 po4 2 so4 2 and co3 2 the presence of sio4 2 so4 2 and co3 2 inhibited the removal of total iodine and the kobs values decreased from 2 6 10 2 min 1 to 2 2 10 2 2 3 10 2 2 1 10 2 and 1 1 10 2 min 1 due to the addition of 5 mg l of sio4 2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 2 po4 2 tends to form oxygen anion ternary complexes with low valence mn of mn iii and mn ii within bi2o3 mno2 which potentially interferes with heterogeneous electron transfer jia et al 2021 yu et al 2020 the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 was less affected by coexisting ions relative to γ mno2 fig s9 b 18 5 i i o 3 6 h 3 i 2 3 h 2 o 19 3 i 2 3 h 2 o 5 i i o 3 6 h fig 7 c shows the total iodine removal rate of bi2o3 mno2 at different concentrations of humic acid a representative nom the presence of nom significantly inhibited total iodine removal and the removal efficiency decreased from 77 4 to 60 5 54 0 38 9 and 21 0 due to the addition of 2 701 4 364 6 540 and 15 24 mg l of nom respectively hoi i2 tends to react with nom to form iodo disinfection byproducts during iodine removal by bi2o3 mno2 ultimately inhibiting the total iodine removal efficiency typical high iodine groundwater samples with total iodine concentrations ranging from 200 to 400 μg l were collected to evaluate the removal performance of bi2o3 mno2 fig 7 d the total iodine adsorption capacities of bi2o3 mno2 involved in the treatment of gw i gw ii gw iii and di were 175 2 488 1 41 1 and 1109 8 μg g after a 60 min reaction the remarkable decrease in adsorption capability was ascribed to the coexisting ions of f cl so4 2 and hco3 table s3 which inhibited i adsorption by occupying the lattice and decreasing the surface charges of bi2o3 mno2 the micro nano bi2o3 bi2s3 composite was observed to achieve 87 7 removal at a dose of 8 g l and i 0 of 50 μg l within 3 h nariyan et al 2020 compared with this study bi2o3 mno2 was found to display remarkable iodine removal performance in the present study and i 0 of 200 μg l and bi2o3 mno2 at 200 mg l contributed as much as 83 4 of the total iodine removal after a 60 min reaction similarly the bi2o3 bi2s3 composite exhibited a low i adsorption capacity of 0 61 mg g toward i after 14 h in the presence of cl br and so4 2 coexistence nariyan et al 2020 therefore owing to the affinity of bi the removal efficiency of i by bi2o3 mno2 in the presence of multiple anions remained high additionally the elevated bi2o3 mno2 doses and prolonged contact time may improve i removal and the dissolution of elemental mn and bi rarely increased fig s10 in deionised water iodine removal by bi2o3 mno2 causes a significant amount of mn release which deserves attention of note the mn release concentration was less than 100 μg l in the process of iodine removal from actual groundwater by bi2o3 mno2 owing to the complex composition of groundwater fig s10 b the proportion of mn in the adsorbent will be adjusted in a future study to reduce mn release based on previous engineering experience a small amount of potassium permanganate can be added to promote the efficiency of iodine removal from the adsorbent while removing the released mn 4 conclusions to remove trace iodine in high iodine groundwater a heterogeneous interface of bi2o3 mno2 was constructed to regulate iodine species transformation and remove different inorganic iodine i e i i2 and io3 by moderate oxidation and efficient adsorption bi2o3 mno2 at a bi mn molar ratio of 5 displayed the best performance toward iodine further 200 mg l bi2o3 mno2 contributed as much as 83 4 of the total iodine removal after 60 min of reaction dft calculations indicated that bi2o3 mno2 had a better band structure and state density than mno2 and provided more suitable sites for the oxidation and adsorption of iodine the adsorption energy of i i2 and io3 onto bi2o3 mno2 was 2 34 2 11 and 3 89 ev enabling bi2o3 mno2 to decrease their concentrations from 200 μg l to below 30 60 μg l within 60 min within bi2o3 mno2 bi2o3 plays an important role in i adsorption and enrichment whereas mno2 achieves moderate oxidation of i and adsorption of i and i2 the removal performance was slightly inhibited at alkaline ph and markedly affected by coexisting ions such as po4 2 and cl owing to the formation of oxygen anion ternary complexes and the occupation of the lattice on bi2o3 mno2 fortunately doping with bi2o3 decreased the inhibitory effects of ph and coexisting ions on iodine removal by mno2 the findings of this study advance current understanding of the strategy for designing adsorbents to remove iodine from drinking water and nuclear wastewater bi2o3 mno2 is potentially effective for iodine removal from an engineering point of view however further studies are necessary to achieve practical implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15556,long term exposure to excessive iodine via drinking water significantly increases the risk of thyroid diseases further the mechanisms and feasible technologies for iodine removal are far from being well elucidated in this study we constructed a heterogeneous bi2o3 mno2 interface with oxidation and adsorption efficiency toward iodide i and investigated the performance and mechanisms involved in iodine removal bi2o3 mno2 at the optimized bi mn ratio of 0 05 1 had a maximum adsorption capacity of 1 19 1 21 and 1 06 mg g toward i iodine elemental i2 and iodate io3 respectively according to the density functional theory dft calculation bi2o3 mno2 had an adsorption energy of 2 34 2 11 and 3 89 ev for i i2 and io3 and exhibited a better band structure and state density character for iodine removal based on the results of xps hplc and lc icp ms characterization bi2o3 plays an important role in adsorbing and capturing i whereas mno2 dominates the moderate oxidation of i and the adsorption of i and i2 the adsorbed i and i2 concentrations on the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces were 146 3 μg l and 18 3 μg l notably io3 was not detected owing to its moderate oxidation effect the coexisting ions of chloride cl and bromide br tended to occupy the bi2o3 lattice and form insoluble biocl and biobr further reductive species such as sulphite so3 2 may reduce mno2 to mn iii and mn ii the synergistic effect between moderate oxidation and adsorption led to bi2o3 mno2 with high iodine removal capability overall this study proposes a strategy for designing suitable interfaces and adsorbents for iodine removal however further studies are necessary to advance its application in practice graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iodine bi2o3 mno2 heterogeneous interface drinking water moderate oxidation adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the widespread occurrence of toxic inorganics such as arsenic fluorine and iodine in groundwater has led to remarkable health problems in residents worldwide he et al 2020 2021 podgorski and berg 2020 in recent decades many studies have investigated the removal of as and fluorine from drinking water bakshi et al 2018 hu et al 2015 qu et al 2010 in fact different commercial adsorbents such as gho alumina and feasible technologies have been developed for practical applications unfortunately only few studies have focused on the removal of iodine from groundwater and suitable technologies to control iodine exposure via drinking water are lacking iodine is an important basic element for the synthesis of thyroid hormones and maintenance of human health miles et al 2022 thyroid diseases tend to occur owing to iodine deficiency or excess iodine intake the world health organization who recommends daily iodine intakes of 150 120 and 250 μg d for adults children and pregnant women respectively la vecchia et al 2015 in the groundwater of la pampa argentina iodine concentrations were found to be as high as 316 μg l watts et al 2010 further the concentrations of iodine in the water supply from rabouni and el aiune in southwestern algeria were 724 and 934 μg l respectively barikmo et al 2011 people in somalia also intake excessive levels of iodine via drinking water as its iodine concentration is above 300 μg l kassim et al 2014 high iodine groundwater with total iodine concentrations above 100 μg l is widely found throughout the north china plain shen et al 2011 accordingly over 30 million people are potentially exposed to excessive iodine via drinking water andersen et al 2009 xue et al 2019 which might markedly increase the occurrence of thyroid disease and other endemic diseases farebrother et al 2019 in china the newly issued sanitary standard for drinking water gb 5749 stipulates that the maximum level of total iodine should be 0 1 mg l i is the main iodine species in groundwater accounting for over 95 of the total iodine small amounts of hoi i2 io3 and organic iodine are also found in groundwater cox and arai 2014 suitable technologies must be developed to remove i from groundwater whose concentrations are relatively lower than those in industrial wastewaters such as radioactive wastewater most studies have focused on the removal of i at concentrations ranging from several decades to several mg l adsorption is viewed as one of the best available technologies for iodine removal owing to its low cost and simple maintenance the ag doped silicon based nanospheres prepared using the layer by layer assembly method were found to have a high adsorption capacity of 236 98 mg g toward radioactive i li and li 2019 the bio adsorbent prepared with mangosteen pericarps and red onion peels achieved 90 iodine removal initial i concentration i 0 10 mg l within 30 min phanthuwongpakdee et al 2020 an innovative adsorbent with a cross linked chitosan porous metal organic framework was developed to remove radioactive i and an i adsorption capacity as high as 399 69 mg g was observed at an i 0 of 400 mg l el shahat et al 2020 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 developed cross linked chitosan microspheres with a maximum adsorption capacity of 0 88 mmol g within 40 mins i 0 2 mmol l ph 5 the i removal efficiency was found to be above 95 over a wide ph range and in the presence of coexisting ions zhang et al 2019 notably these studies mainly focused on the heterogeneous adsorption of i as a result the transformation of iodine species rarely occurred heterogeneous oxidation and transformation have been widely reported to markedly improve the removal efficiency fe mn binary oxides with heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption exhibit good removal performance toward antimony iii xu et al 2011 and organoarsenic compounds joshi et al 2017 the monovalent ion i is difficult to adsorb on a solid interface and the heterogeneous oxidation of i to i2 is expected to improve iodine removal however chemicals such as chlorine sahulka et al 2021 ozone iakovides et al 2019 and chlorite dioxide sorlini et al 2014 are usually dosed as pre oxidants for disinfection as a result the oxidation of i to io3 mackeown et al 2022 inevitably and significantly inhibits iodine removal generally adsorbents exhibit good adsorption performance toward specific iodine species such as i i2 and io3 owing to their rather different characteristics heterogeneous interfaces with different sorbing sites for various iodine species should be constructed to achieve the simultaneous removal of multiple iodine species and simplify the treatment processes as much as possible mno2 may theoretically oxidise i to i2 and io3 in neutral and weakly alkaline ph ranges and i2 can be adsorbed on the surface of δ mno2 allard et al 2009 loading bi2o3 nanoparticles onto the surfaces of mxene pda resin was found to significantly improve the selectivity toward i sha et al 2020 yu et al 2022 the composite doping of binary oxides with different properties markedly improves the adsorption performance through synergistic effects zhang et al 2007a further the bi2o3 mno2 binary oxide is assumed to exhibit high performance toward iodine in detail bi2o3 is expected to capture and enrich i and io3 on surfaces and mno2 may accept electrons from the adsorbed i and achieve moderate oxidation of i to i2 with stronger affinity toward surfaces to the best of our knowledge only few studies have investigated the mechanisms and pathways involved in the moderate oxidation and adsorption of iodine on heterogeneous surfaces and have proposed innovative adsorbents for various iodine species the objectives of this study were to 1 construct a suitable heterogeneous bi2o3 mno2 interface for iodine and investigate its surface characteristics by sem hrtem and xrd 2 evaluate the macroscopic removal performance and species transformation of iodine using hplc xps and lc icp ms and 3 propose the optimum structure using dft and clarify the mechanisms involved in iodine adsorption on bi2o3 mno2 the study findings advance current understanding of the mechanisms involved in iodine removal and propose a strategy for iodine removal from drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the chemical reagents used in the experiment are detailed in the supporting information 2 2 raw source water used in the experiments

perform dft calculations within the generalized gradient approximation gga using the pbe perdew et al 1996 formulation the projected augmented wave paw potentials blöchl et al 2003 kresse and joubert

allowed using the gaussian smearing method with a width of 0 05 ev the electronic energy was considered to be self consistent when the energy change was less than 10 5 ev geometry optimization was considered convergent when the force change was smaller than 0 02 ev å grimme s dft d3 methodology grimme et al 2010 was used to describe the dispersion interactions on site corrections dft u were applied to the 3d electrons of the ti atoms ueff 4 2 ev using a previous approach grimme et al 2010 the equilibrium lattice constants of the γ mno2 unit cell were optimised using a 2 10 6 monkhorst pack k point grid for brillouin zone sampling as follows a 13 819 å b 2 843 å c 4 305 å α 90 β 89 01 and γ 90 these constants were then used to construct a γ mno2 131 surface model model 1 with p 1 1 periodicity in the x and y directions and four stoichiometric layers in the z direction separated by a vacuum layer at a depth of 15 å to separate the surface slab from its periodic duplicates the

experiments to investigate the i i2 and io3 removal performance 20 mg bi2o3 mno2 was added to 100 ml of magnetically stirred solutions with i 0 i2 0 and io3 0 of 200 μg l in cylindrical plexiglas containers at room temperature 25 c samples were collected at different time intervals and filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters jinteng china prior to the analysis of the total iodine iodine species and mn2 concentrations to investigate the mechanism and reaction pathways involved in iodine adsorption bi2o3 mno2 was pretreated with solutions containing different concentrations of cl br or so3 2 0 to 200 mg l for 24 h subsequently i adsorption experiments were conducted according to the aforementioned methods all experiments were carried out at room temperature to evaluate the effects of different water matrix on i removal the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 10 using 0 1 mol l h2so4 and naoh solutions and the solutions of coexisting inorganic ions i e silicate sio4 2 sulphate so4 2 carbonate co3 2 and phosphate po4 2 were added to obtain desired concentrations of 0 5 mg l the reaction conditions for i removal from groundwater were the same as those for the deionised water system all experiments were carried out at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and performance of bi2o3 mno2 3 1 1 physical and chemical properties the lattice composition and surface morphology of bi2o3 mno2 5 are illustrated in fig 1 a f bi2o3 mno2 5 was composed of spherical particles of bi 7 6 mn 59 7 and o 32 7 fig 1 b and c show the lattice characteristics of bi2o3 mno2 5 according to the analysis by the digitalmicrograph software the lattice spacing of bi2o3 mno2 5 was 0 23 nm 0 28 nm 0 45 nm 0 26 nm and 0 22 nm which corresponded to the mno2 230 bi2o3 211 bi2o3 111 bi2o3 022 and bi2o3 222 crystal planes jcpds no 71 2274 and 14 0644 combined with the sem results fig 1 d and e bi2o3 mno2 5 was identified to be mainly composed of floc and rod like crystals further fine bi2o3 crystals were evenly distributed on the spherical surface the xrd patterns of bi2o3 γ mno2 and bi2o3 mno2 5 are shown in fig 1 g the diffraction peaks in bi2o3 mno2 5 were assigned to bi2o3 and the γ type crystal of mno2 the diffraction peaks at 25 7 26 9 49 9 and 56 5 corresponded to the 002 122 114 and 242 crystal planes of bi2o3 jcpds no 71 2274 and those at 22 4 37 1 42 6 and 65 6 corresponded to the 120 131 300 and 421 crystal planes of γ mno2 jcpds no 14 0644 the bet surface area total pore volume and average pore diameter of bi2o3 mno2 5 were 45 67 m2 g 0 11 cm3 g and 9 48 nm respectively the values for these parameters were less than those of γ mno2 80 36 m2 g 0 20 cm3 g and 14 30 nm as shown in table s1 this result may be due to the changes in the characteristics of γ mno2 and reduction in specific surface area induced by doping with bi2o3 3 1 2 performance of the total iodine removal process after bi2o3 mno2 composites with bi mn molar ratios of 0 1 2 5 8 and 10 were prepared their total iodine removal efficiencies were assessed the results are shown in fig 1 h when the bi mn molar ratio was increased from 0 to 5 the total iodine removal efficiency increased from 50 3 to 83 4 however when the bi mn molar ratios were 8 and 10 the degradation efficiency gradually decreased to 74 4 and 73 8 respectively thus the optimal bi mn molar ratio for bi2o3 mno2 was 5 owing to the selectivity and affinity of bi3 to iodine the contents of bi2o3 in bi2o3 mno2 increased as the bi mn molar ratio increased thereby improving the adsorption efficiency of iodine sha et al 2020 however at bi mn molar ratios above 5 the formation of bi2o3 significantly reduced the specific surface area of bi2o3 mno2 and the adsorption removal efficiency of iodine decreased accordingly based on these results bi2o3 mno2 5 was selected for the subsequent studies 3 2 construction of the iodine removal interface by theoretical calculation the optimal adsorption structures of mno2 bi2o3 and bi2o3 mno2 were constructed using dft calculations as shown in figs 2 and s1 thereafter the adsorption structures of bi2o3 mno2 and mno2 for i i2 and io3 were optimized the adsorption energy of bi2o3 mno2 for i i2 and io3 was 2 34 ev 2 11 ev and 3 89 ev respectively as shown in table s2 the adsorption energy was reported to be negatively correlated with adsorption performance li et al 2012 comparatively the bond length formed on bi2o3 mno2 was slightly larger whereas the adsorption energy of iodine was significantly lower than that of mno2 owing to the selectivity of bi2o3 accordingly the adsorption of iodine was favoured the adsorption of io3 onto bi2o3 mno2 generated the bi o bond with a bond length of 2 37 å this length was lower than that of the bi i bonds 3 08 and 3 55 å involved in the adsorption of i and i2 on bi2o3 mno2 respectively the length of the bi x bond formed by adsorption was proportional to the adsorption energy which is related to the better adsorption of io3 than i and i2 on bi2o3 mno2 cao et al 2021 bi2o3 mno2 and mno2 possess redox efficacy and their electron transfer ability reflects the activity of metal oxides the band structure results obtained by theoretical calculations are shown in fig s2 a and c the gap interval of bi2o3 mno2 was significantly smaller than that of mno2 and the higher overlap extent of the conduction band and valence band was beneficial to electron transfer which enabled bi2o3 mno2 to possess a higher activity than mno2 li et al 2012 fig s2 b and d show the density of states dos of mno2 and bi2o3 mno2 before and after i adsorption respectively the characteristic peaks of the surface dos of mno2 and bi2o3 mno2 deviated from the original energy level after iodine adsorption the decreased peak intensity could be attributed to the charge transfer of iodine to the heterogeneous interfaces the extent of variation in bi2o3 mno2 was significantly greater than that in mno2 interestingly the adsorption of i onto bi2o3 mno2 significantly changed the dos curve fig s2 d and the appearance of a new continuous density peak at 4 5 ev indicated a strong interaction between iodide and the bi2o3 mno2 surface tan et al 2021 comparatively upon adsorption of i onto mno2 no new peaks appeared on the dos curve at the same position such finding supports the higher affinity of iodine to the bi2o3 mno2 surface relative to mno2 3 3 iodine species variation involved in the different systems 3 3 1 reactions of i i2 and io3 adsorption onto bi2o3 mno2 the removal kinetics of i i2 io3 and total iodine by bi2o3 mno2 are shown in fig s3 and the fitting results of the three kinetic equations are presented in table 1 as indicated by the regression coefficient value of r2 the pseudo second order kinetics was the best option for describing the adsorption performance further the chemisorption processes were inferred to involve external liquid solid interface diffusion surface adsorption and particle diffusion fu et al 2016 the maximum adsorption capacities of different iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 were 1186 36 1213 41 and 1062 46 μg g for i i2 and io3 respectively comparatively the adsorption rate of io3 onto bi2o3 mno2 was 9 41e 04 μg g 1 min 1 which was one fold higher than that of i and i2 to elucidate the dominant reactions involved in the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 the transformation of the iodine species was investigated figs 4 a and 5 a when the reaction time was 60 min the residual i concentrations decreased from 200 0 to 25 5 μg l fig 4a while the hoi i2 concentrations increased and then decreased the maximum hoi i2 accumulation was 18 9 μg l at a reaction time of 20 min but decreased to 8 7 μg l after 60 min of reaction io3 formation rarely occurred and the final io3 concentration was as low as 1 2 μg l the concentration of solid phase iodine increased continuously to as high as 164 6 μg l with a reaction time of 60 min such finding supported the heterogeneous transfer and adsorption of iodine on the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces fig 5 a shows the xps results of bi2o3 mno2 reacted with i with characteristic peaks at binding energies be of 619 0 630 5 620 0 and 631 9 ev this result indicated the existence of two iodine species i and i2 on the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces kang et al 2020 mu et al 2016 with elemental ratios of 88 9 and 11 1 table 2 respectively in addition nearly 100 of mn iv was converted to mn iii mn ii and 17 6 of mn iii was further transformed to mn ii in the adsorption of i onto bi2o3 mno2 fig s4 moderate oxidation of i to i2 and the adsorption of various iodine species were inferred to occur during the adsorption of i onto bi2o3 mno2 moreover mn iv and mn iii were involved in the reactions with a maximum iodine removal of as high as 87 3 fig 3 a and b illustrate the removal trends of different iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 with the addition of i2 as the model pollutant upon addition to water i2 tends to undergo a series of disproportionation reactions to form i hoi i2 and io3 eqs 2 4 baldwin 1986 cox and arai 2014 herein the concentrations of i hoi i2 and io3 were 137 0 39 5 and 7 5 μg l fig 3a respectively 2 i 2 h 2 o i i o 3 h 3 i 2 h 2 o hoi i h 4 3 ioh i o 3 2 i 3 h the concentrations of i hoi i2 and io3 decreased to 29 3 26 6 and 0 7 μg l as the reaction time prolonged the concentrations of solid phase iodine on bi2o3 mno2 increased continuously to 127 2 μg l supporting the strong affinity toward various iodine species of i hoi i2 and io3 based on previous studies kang et al 2020 mao et al 2016 the results of xps analysis of elemental i fig 3 b indicated that i and io3 were the dominant iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 accounting for 21 2 and 78 8 of the total iodine however i2 spectra could hardly be observed on the bi2o3 mno2 surface which might be due to the rare existence of stable i2 and the low sensitivity of the equipment as indicated by the mn xps spectra fig s4 e the ratios of mn iv and mn iii decreased from 24 0 to 0 and 66 7 to 57 3 respectively and that of mn ii increased from 9 3 to 42 7 respectively similar to the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 mn iv and mn iii tended to oxidise either i or hoi i2 to iodine species with a higher valence in addition the characteristic peak on the in situ raman spectra at 523 nm disappeared upon addition of i fig s5 which supports the occurrence of moderate oxidation fig 3 c illustrates the removal trends of different iodine species on bi2o3 mno2 with the addition of io3 as the model pollutant io3 was gradually adsorbed onto bi2o3 mno2 with a prolonged reaction time and the removal efficiency was as high as 77 2 after 60 min combined with the xps results in fig 3 d io3 was identified as the main iodine species and other iodine species could hardly be detected in both the solution and solid phases this result indicates a strong adsorption of io3 on bi2o3 mno2 and the rare involvement of electron transfer in the adsorption in the reactions with i i2 and io3 the xps spectra of bi displayed little variation fig s4 and elemental bi was rarely involved in the electron transfer and oxidation of the different iodine species bi2o3 mno2 exhibited good efficiency at removing various iodine species from water further the removal of i and i2 was achieved by moderate oxidation and adsorption whereas that of io3 was achieved via adsorption 3 3 2 effects of cl br and so3 2 on the adsorption of iodine onto bi2o3 mno2 as halogen elements the chloride cl and bromide br ions displayed similar properties to i bi2o3 has been reported to exhibit good adsorption efficiency toward cl and br which occupy the lattice and adsorption sites of bi2o3 to generate biocl and biobr shi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2012 yang et al 2016 the coexisting cl and br are assumed to inhibit the adsorption of iodine additionally so3 2 a typical reducing agent was reported to effectively consume the oxidising capability of mno2 and reduce the amount of mn iv available for oxidation zhang et al 2007b to further illustrate the roles of the active components of bi2o3 and mno2 in i removal the cl br and so3 2 ions were added to occupy the bi2o3 sorption sites and consume the mno2 oxidation sites evaluating the effects of these ions on i removal may advance our understanding of iodine species transformation and the mechanisms involved in iodine adsorption onto bi2o3 mno2 synergistic effects between bi2o3 and mno2 were observed with regard to i removal by bi2o3 mno2 fig 1h fig s6 demonstrates the effects of cl br and so3 2 at different doses on the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 of note the removal of total iodine decreased more remarkably with elevated doses the total iodine removal decreased from 76 6 to 50 5 53 0 and 23 4 with the addition of 200 mg l of cl br and so3 2 further the inhibitory effects followed the trend so3 2 cl br the variations in the characteristic xps peaks on bi2o3 mno2 after the addition of cl br and so3 2 are shown in figs 5 and s7 according to the xps analysis of mn and bi figs 5b and s7 the pre adsorption of cl and br had insignificant effects on the mn iv spectra in bi2o3 mno2 table 2 further so3 2 pretreatment significantly decreased the proportion of mn iv from 24 0 to 0 0 and increased that of mn ii from 9 3 to 57 0 so3 2 pretreatment also significantly weakened the raman peaks of γ crystal mno2 within bi2o3 mno2 at wavelengths of 640 574 and 523 nm fig 5 d supporting the remarkable consumption of mno2 oxidation capacity by so3 2 fig 5 c shows the xrd results for bi2o3 mno2 for different reaction systems after the reaction with i new bioi crystal phases appeared on the crystal planes of the original bi2o3 including 002 012 122 114 and 242 indicating the important role of bi2o3 with regard to i removal i was captured and adsorbed into the lattice jcpds no 85 0863 and the adsorption of cl and br by bi2o3 mno2 was similar after pretreatment new phases of biocl and biobr were formed on the crystal plane of the original bi2o3 jcpds no 85 0861 and 73 2061 further the lattice occupied by cl and br atoms had markedly less adsorption toward i after so3 2 pretreatment the mnso4 crystal phase formed on bi2o3 mno2 and a new crystal phase appeared jcpds no 73 1361 which was attributed to the direct reduction of mn iv to mn ii by so3 2 and the adsorption and occupation of mn ii on the original active sites zhang et al 2007b this effect markedly inhibited the oxidation and adsorption ability of mno2 the bi xps spectra indicated that the bi valence state rarely varied after pretreatment with cl br and so3 2 and the characteristic peak ratio of bi was stable at 0 44 0 56 fig s7 3 3 3 iodide removal performance of pretreated bi2o3 mno2 to further illustrate the effects of cl br and so3 2 on the removal of different iodine species by bi2o3 mno2 the species transformation trends of iodine in the liquid and solid phases are shown in figs 4 and 5 compared to the original bi2o3 mno2 the adsorption of i onto cl br and so3 2 pretreated bi2o3 mno2 was investigated after a 60 min reaction the residual i concentrations increased from 25 5 μg l to 62 9 57 0 and 109 2 μg l the inhibitory effects were found to be consistent with the trends in total iodine removal herein 13 0 and 32 4 μg l of hoi i2 were initially generated during the adsorption of i onto cl and br pretreated bi2o3 mno2 but decreased to 12 0 and 29 3 μg l respectively such finding suggests that i was moderately oxidised by bi2o3 mno2 to i2 and then removed by adsorption the xps results support the existence of i and i2 on these four pretreated bi2o3 mno2 surfaces fig 5 a the occupation of the bi2o3 mno2 lattices by cl and br inhibited the adsorption of i from 88 9 to 61 0 and 52 3 respectively table 2 the ratios of adsorbed i2 increased from 11 1 to 39 0 and 47 7 while mn iv completely transformed into mn iii mn ii with lower chemical valence table 2 and fig s8 this is because pretreatment with cl and br did not affect the oxidation of mno2 in bi2o3 mno2 comparatively so3 2 pretreatment decreased the ratio of adsorbed i2 to 8 7 whereas that of adsorbed i increased to 91 3 owing to the significantly weakened oxidation capability of bi2o3 mno2 in the adsorption of iodine onto bi2o3 mno2 bi2o3 mainly provides sorbing sites for i whereas mno2 dominates in moderate i oxidation and i i2 adsorption the synergistic effects between moderate oxidation and adsorption play important roles in i removal 3 4 proposed mechanisms involved in iodide removal by bi2o3 mno2 the dominant reactions and pathways involved in the removal of iodine by bi2o3 mno2 at multiple sites are shown in fig 6 and table 3 in natural groundwater different coexisting iodine species of i hoi i2 and io3 tend to undergo disproportionation reactions eqs 2 and 3 upon addition of bi2o3 mno2 aqueous i transferred onto the heterogeneous surfaces via the formation of a bi i bond with bi2o3 mno2 eq 5 and i occupied the bi2o3 lattice in bi2o3 mno2 to generate bioi eq 6 simultaneously mno2 in bi2o3 mno2 tended to moderately oxidise aqueous i and adsorb i to i2 eq 7 and provided adsorption sites for i and i2 in this case mn iv was reduced to mn iii and mn ii eqs 8 and 9 the mn release concentration is presented in the supplementary material mn iii was also involved in the oxidation of i eq 10 aqueous hoi i2 may be adsorbed onto the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces by the formation of two bi i bonds eq 11 and heterogeneous oxidation to io3 by mn iv also occurred eq 12 aqueous io3 easily forms bi o bonds with bi2o3 mno2 and is removed accordingly eq 13 mn iv can be reduced to mn ii eq 14 by coexisting reductants such as so3 2 which markedly inhibits the oxidation of i and hoi i2 the reductively dissolved mn ii may be re adsorbed onto the bi2o3 mno2 surfaces eq 15 and potentially competes with iodine for adsorption sites coexisting halogen ions such as cl and br may occupy the bi2o3 mno2 lattices to form biocl and biobr eqs 16 and 17 further the removal of i was markedly inhibited 3 5 effects of water matrix on iodine removal fig 7 a illustrates the effect of ph on the removal of total iodine by bi2o3 mno2 at ph 4 1 8 6 the removal efficiencies of total iodine in bi2o3 mno2 were 80 6 76 2 71 6 and 78 6 and the reaction rates were 2 4 10 2 2 2 10 2 1 9 10 2 and 2 3 10 2 min 1 respectively the removal efficiency of total iodine by bi2o3 mno2 was higher in acidic and weakly alkaline ph ranges than at ph 10 1 where the reaction rate was as low as 0 7 10 2 min 1 thus the solution ph affects iodine speciation and i can hardly coexist with io3 under acidic conditions and tends to be converted to hoi and i2 this effect favours i oxidation and the adsorption of various iodine species eq 18 baldwin 1986 cox and arai 2014 under strong alkali conditions i can hardly be converted to hoi and i2 as they are prone to conversion into i and io3 eq 19 cox and arai 2014 under acidic ph conditions bi2o3 mno2 had positive surfaces owing to the protonation effect and h accumulation and concentration improved the adsorption of negative i zhao et al 2018 bi2o3 mno2 has negative surfaces at elevated ph i e higher oh concentrations and the attraction and attachment of i are markedly inhibited by electrostatic repulsion li et al 2020 comparatively γ mno2 could hardly remove i at alkaline ph fig s9 a and bi3 within bi2o3 mno2 may selectively adsorb i of note i removal is less ph dependant fig 7 b illustrates the apparent rate constant kobs of total iodine removal by bi2o3 mno2 at different concentrations of inorganic ions i e sio4 2 po4 2 so4 2 and co3 2 the presence of sio4 2 so4 2 and co3 2 inhibited the removal of total iodine and the kobs values decreased from 2 6 10 2 min 1 to 2 2 10 2 2 3 10 2 2 1 10 2 and 1 1 10 2 min 1 due to the addition of 5 mg l of sio4 2 so4 2 co3 2 and po4 2 po4 2 tends to form oxygen anion ternary complexes with low valence mn of mn iii and mn ii within bi2o3 mno2 which potentially interferes with heterogeneous electron transfer jia et al 2021 yu et al 2020 the removal of i by bi2o3 mno2 was less affected by coexisting ions relative to γ mno2 fig s9 b 18 5 i i o 3 6 h 3 i 2 3 h 2 o 19 3 i 2 3 h 2 o 5 i i o 3 6 h fig 7 c shows the total iodine removal rate of bi2o3 mno2 at different concentrations of humic acid a representative nom the presence of nom significantly inhibited total iodine removal and the removal efficiency decreased from 77 4 to 60 5 54 0 38 9 and 21 0 due to the addition of 2 701 4 364 6 540 and 15 24 mg l of nom respectively hoi i2 tends to react with nom to form iodo disinfection byproducts during iodine removal by bi2o3 mno2 ultimately inhibiting the total iodine removal efficiency typical high iodine groundwater samples with total iodine concentrations ranging from 200 to 400 μg l were collected to evaluate the removal performance of bi2o3 mno2 fig 7 d the total iodine adsorption capacities of bi2o3 mno2 involved in the treatment of gw i gw ii gw iii and di were 175 2 488 1 41 1 and 1109 8 μg g after a 60 min reaction the remarkable decrease in adsorption capability was ascribed to the coexisting ions of f cl so4 2 and hco3 table s3 which inhibited i adsorption by occupying the lattice and decreasing the surface charges of bi2o3 mno2 the micro nano bi2o3 bi2s3 composite was observed to achieve 87 7 removal at a dose of 8 g l and i 0 of 50 μg l within 3 h nariyan et al 2020 compared with this study bi2o3 mno2 was found to display remarkable iodine removal performance in the present study and i 0 of 200 μg l and bi2o3 mno2 at 200 mg l contributed as much as 83 4 of the total iodine removal after a 60 min reaction similarly the bi2o3 bi2s3 composite exhibited a low i adsorption capacity of 0 61 mg g toward i after 14 h in the presence of cl br and so4 2 coexistence nariyan et al 2020 therefore owing to the affinity of bi the removal efficiency of i by bi2o3 mno2 in the presence of multiple anions remained high additionally the elevated bi2o3 mno2 doses and prolonged contact time may improve i removal and the dissolution of elemental mn and bi rarely increased fig s10 in deionised water iodine removal by bi2o3 mno2 causes a significant amount of mn release which deserves attention of note the mn release concentration was less than 100 μg l in the process of iodine removal from actual groundwater by bi2o3 mno2 owing to the complex composition of groundwater fig s10 b the proportion of mn in the adsorbent will be adjusted in a future study to reduce mn release based on previous engineering experience a small amount of potassium permanganate can be added to promote the efficiency of iodine removal from the adsorbent while removing the released mn 4 conclusions to remove trace iodine in high iodine groundwater a heterogeneous interface of bi2o3 mno2 was constructed to regulate iodine species transformation and remove different inorganic iodine i e i i2 and io3 by moderate oxidation and efficient adsorption bi2o3 mno2 at a bi mn molar ratio of 5 displayed the best performance toward iodine further 200 mg l bi2o3 mno2 contributed as much as 83 4 of the total iodine removal after 60 min of reaction dft calculations indicated that bi2o3 mno2 had a better band structure and state density than mno2 and provided more suitable sites for the oxidation and adsorption of iodine the adsorption energy of i i2 and io3 onto bi2o3 mno2 was 2 34 2 11 and 3 89 ev enabling bi2o3 mno2 to decrease their concentrations from 200 μg l to below 30 60 μg l within 60 min within bi2o3 mno2 bi2o3 plays an important role in i adsorption and enrichment whereas mno2 achieves moderate oxidation of i and adsorption of i and i2 the removal performance was slightly inhibited at alkaline ph and markedly affected by coexisting ions such as po4 2 and cl owing to the formation of oxygen anion ternary complexes and the occupation of the lattice on bi2o3 mno2 fortunately doping with bi2o3 decreased the inhibitory effects of ph and coexisting ions on iodine removal by mno2 the findings of this study advance current understanding of the strategy for designing adsorbents to remove iodine from drinking water and nuclear wastewater bi2o3 mno2 is potentially effective for iodine removal from an engineering point of view however further studies are necessary to achieve practical implementation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15557,electrode passivation is the most challenging technical problem in electrocoagulation ec water treatment process but research on understanding and mitigating passivation evolution are still lacking herein homogenization of current density cd distribution was found to be a critical factor in alleviating the anode passivation during ec process decreasing electrode area decelerated the growth of passivation layer on anode through homogenizing cd distribution which was quantified by the ratios of cd distributed at the electrode edges and centers when aluminum anode area decreased from 8 cm2 to 2 cm2 with a constant cd the homogenization degree increased by 24 0 and passivation was reduced by 24 3 the depth profiles of passivated anodes confirmed the inhomogeneity of the anode passivation thicker passivation layers were observed at edges due to high cd distributions which originated from the edge effect of electric field distribution between parallel plate electrodes a facile strategy to homogenize cd distribution by splitting electrodes into smaller electrodes is then proposed for passivation mitigation which can save energy consumption by 21 8 with unchanged

formed by metal oxides on electrode surface enlarge overpotential and decrease current efficiency the severely passivated electrodes have to be replaced from service leading to increased operation and maintenance costs chow et al 2021 xu et al 2015 therefore effective strategies are urgently needed to overcome electrode passivation in the ec process there are some previous research reports on ec electrode passivation under various solution environments and operational parameters mansouri et al 2011 wellner et al 2018 sacrificial metal anodes tend to form an oxide e g al2o3 or hydroxide e g al oh 3 layer on the anode surface at weakly acidic and neutral ph leading to severe anode passivation amin et al 2010 in addition intense electrolytic reactions induced by a high current density cd

previous ec research achieving a high contaminant removal was the primary purpose that determined the optimized operation parameters rather than mitigating electrode passivation passivation control

2020 golder et al 2011 wang et al 2009 indicated that these technologies have limitations in overcoming passivation problems periodic polarity reversal was also an effective to control electrode fouling but the trade off between coagulant production and fouling rate should be taken into consideration yasri et al 2022 the in depth recognition of the passivation growth procedure was essential and a passivation mitigation method that does not compromise or complicate the water treatment process is strongly demanded in this study the degrees of passivation of anodes were evaluated by the equivalent electrical resistance rct of passivation layers homogenization of cd was investigated to control anode passivation the cd distributions on distinct electrode areas were quantified by computational simulation the element compositions and depth distributions in the passivation layer on the edges and centers of the anodes were detected the forming mechanism of passivation on the anode surface based on homogenization of cd distribution was proposed furthermore a facile and effective strategy has been proposed for passivation mitigation by splitting large anodes into smaller anodes which provides unique insights into passivation control and designs of ec electrode systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and synthetic feed water na2so4 8 0 g l was employed as the electrolyte in deionized water milli q merck millipore germany with a conductivity of 10 3 0 2 ms cm which was measured by an electrical conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo switzerland sodium sulfate feed water was used to explore the passivation behaviors during ec humic acid ha sigma aldrich u s a feed water sun et al 2018 which consisted of 200 mg l na2so4 and 0 5 mm nahco3 was used to determine the performance of the passivation mitigation strategy the initial ph of the synthetic feed water was adjusted by 0 1 mol l naoh and 0 1 mol l h2so4 naoh na2so4 and anhydrous ethanol were received at analytical pure grade h2so4 was received at guaranteed reagent grade all reagents were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china aluminum electrodes with 99 9 purity thickness 0 3 mm were purchased from the qinghe guantai metal materials co ltd china unless otherwise specified the ph was adjusted to 7 and the anode was polished by sic sandpaper with 2000 meshes 2 2 preparation of aluminum anodes since the aluminum electrodes may be oxidized in the air during transportation and storage it was essential to prepolish the aluminum electrode surface before use the pretreatment process was as follows first the aluminum electrodes were polished by sic sandpaper with 500 2000 and 3000 meshes to achieve anode surfaces with different roughnesses then the polished electrodes were placed in anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 10 min by an ultrasonic cleaner to remove the residual sic particles on the surface of the electrodes finally the electrodes were placed in self sealing bags until use 2 3 ec passivation experiments two parallel aluminum electrodes with effective areas of 0 8 cm2 1 cm 0 8 cm 2 cm2 1 cm 2 cm 4 cm2 2 cm 2 cm and 8 cm2 3 2 cm 2 5 cm were used in the ec experiments the distance between the two electrodes was fixed at 1 cm hu et al 2017 2016 to keep the reaction area of the electrode constant the unreacted regions of the electrode were covered by polyimide insulating tape fifty milliliters of synthetic feed water were used in each experiment which was well mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm cds of 5 10 and 50 a m2 were employed at a constant current during each ec period 30 min 2 4 electrochemical tests electrochemical tests were used to determine the passivation process cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were applied to analyze the current variation before and after ec passivation the detailed method for electrode preparation is described in si text s1 and fig s1 a small potential range is used to avoid electrochemical reactions higher currents at the same voltage indicate higher conductivities of the electrode and relatively lower degrees of passivation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements of anodes were carried out on an electrochemical workstation interface 1000 gamry usa in the frequency range of 10 khz 0 1 hz martin et al 2005 mechelhoff et al 2013 using the nyquist curve of the eis the electron transfer hindrance by the passivation layer on the aluminum anode surface can be quantified and the magnitude of passivation under different conditions can be deduced electrode preparation for passivation homogenization investigation is described in si text s2 and fig s2 2 5 anode characterization the pristine and passivated anodes were directly observed under a scanning electron microscope sem jsm7401f jedl japan equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds system the element variation during the oxidation process that occurred on the anode surface was measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa the aluminum component below the passivation surface was obtained by ar ion bombardment the sputtering time was 360 s for each layer with an ion gun energy of 4 kev fig s3 yang et al 2015 in addition the depth profiles of the passivated anodes were acquired using time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims v ion tof gmbh germany cornette et al 2020 infrared images were obtained with a thermal imaging camera e6 flir usa to visualize the development of the passivation on different regions of the anodes si text s3 the cd distributions on anodes were evaluated by finite element simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 size effect on anode passivation cds of 5 10 and 50 a m2 were investigated the plots of voltage evolution as a function of operational time are shown in fig 1 a the cd was first tuned by changing the current value of the ec and the effective electrode areas were kept constant at 2 cm2 the voltage increased from 3 6 0 2 v to 32 1 0 8 v when the cd increased from 5 to 50 a m2 after ec for 30 min the increasing voltages were attributed to the overpotentials on anode and cathode and ir drops the ir drops were 0 05 v 0 1 v and 0 5 v at the current density of 5 a m2 10 a m2 and 50 a m2 table s1 respectively which were relatively low and negligible for passivation analysis when the cd increased to 50 a m2 the voltage rose dramatically in the initial 7 min from 0 v to 29 8 0 3 v and then grew slowly until reaching the maximum output power indicating that the cd played a significant role in electrode passivation in addition an obvious size effect could be identified in which the voltages varied when the effective electrode areas and current values increased proportionally with a constant cd the voltage decreased when the effective electrode areas were reduced indicating a lower degree of passivation the final voltages were raised by 1 4 v and 9 0 v when the electrode areas were quadrupled at 5 a m2 and doubled at 10 a m2 respectively furthermore the final voltages declined from 32 1 0 8 v to 23 3 1 3 v during an ec period of 10 min when the electrode areas were reduced from 2 cm2 to 0 8 cm2 at 50 a m2 the size effect indicated that the size of the electrode may be a dominant factor in passivation process the ph increased from 7 91 to 8 76 when the cd increased from 5 to 50 a m2 table s2 which may facilitate the devastation of the passivated layer according to the pourbaix images of aluminum chugh et al 2022 de la fuente 2022 pan et al 2021 however the degree of passivation was still high at 50 a m2 and the voltage increased rapidly suggesting that the impact of the cd was higher than that of ph in this study the increasing in operational voltage could not be attributed entirely to anode passivation because the cell voltage contained the thermodynamic equilibrium potential anodic and cathodic overpotentials and ir drops therefore further investigations on anode were essential to figure out the anode passivation degree the cv plots of the anodes at different cds are shown in fig 1b and 1c the apparent resistance on the passivation layer increased when the cd in ec increased from 5 to 50 a m2 according to the decline in the detected cds in cv tests in addition when the electrode area increased in ec the resultant resistance of the anode increased and vice versa which was consistent with the results shown in fig 1a the passivation degrees of the anodes under different cds were further analyzed by eis measurements fig 1d and table s3 the rct increased from 114 8 to 151 6 ω when the anode area decreased from 8 cm2 to 2 cm2 at 5 a m2 when the area increased from 2 to 4 cm2 the rct increased from 174 0 to 190 6 ω at 10 a m2 in addition the effective cd which referred to the current divided by effective electrode area containing the specific surface attributed by the surface roughness of the anode may also influence anode passivation therefore passivation experiments with different surface roughnesses were carried out as a supplement si text s4 and fig s4 the results showed that anode passivation was mitigated when the anode surface roughness was promoted which indicated that decreasing the effective cd was a critical factor in controlling anode passivation 3 2 analysis of inhomogeneous passivation in general the electric field between two parallel plate electrodes was considered to be homogeneous to simplify the analysis however the electric field distribution was inhomogeneous at the edges of the electrodes in practice as was the cd distribution on the electrode surface wang et al 2019 therefore the cd distributions of electrodes with different areas were investigated by computational simulation the detailed simulation methods are described in si text s5 the results shown in fig 2 a 2c indicated that the four corners of the electrodes exhibited the highest cd of 369 0 a m2 with an electrode area of 2 cm 1 cm the cd at the edges was 52 0 a m2 which was lower than that of the corners but higher than that of the centers 4 9 a m2 when the area of the electrode increased to 3 2 cm 2 5 cm the differences in cd were more pronounced and the distribution was more inhomogeneous an obvious edge effect of the cd distribution on the electrodes can be observed fig s5 more current went through the edges of the electrode rather than the central region gupta et al 2021 wang et al yariv 2021 indicating that the edge effect was the nature of the size effect the edge effect could also be obviously observed even when the cd declined to 0 1 a m2 fig s6 in addition the edge effect was enhanced when the electrode area increased which was evaluated by the ratios of cds at the edges and in the centers fig 2d the ratios decreased from 99 06 to 75 31 at 5 a m2 indicating the promotion of homogenization of cd distribution which explained the lower passivation layer when the anode was small when the cd increased the homogenization of cd distribution was promoted but the homogeneous distributed high cd would lead to serious oxidation reactions that significantly facilitated passivation the central region and the marginal region of the passivated anode were then selected for further investigation the cv plots and eis spectra of different regions of the passivated anode are shown in fig 2e and 2f the results showed that the equivalent resistance at the anode edge 128 2 ω was higher than that at the anode center 88 9 ω these results confirmed that the passivation degree of the anode surface was inhomogeneous which was controlled by the cd distribution further experimental analysis of the anode passivation degree was carried out to support the simulation results the aluminum element underneath the anode surfaces was detected by xps after surface etching fig 3 the unreacted aluminum regions were applied as the control group all of the spectra of the anode exhibited two peaks the peak at 72 6 ev was ascribed to metallic aluminum almet liu et al 2013 the peak at 74 6 ev was attributed to oxidized aluminum alox figueiredo et al 2011 moroz et al 2009 the unreacted region of the passivated anode exhibited similar peak shapes in all three layers suggesting that the al species were stable the degrees of passivation evaluated by the almet alox values in different layers of the passivated anode are summarized in table s4 the almet alox decreased both in the central and marginal regions from the first layer to the third layer indicating that the degree of passivation decreased with increasing depth in the anode the marginal regions showed a higher alox peak in each layer confirming that the degrees of passivation at the edges were higher than those in the centers which certified the occurrence of the edge effect in anode passivation the only al o bond in the spectra of o 1 s indicated that the structure of passivation layer was simple fig s7 different regions of the anode surface were detected using energy dispersive spectroscopy method fig s8 eds mappings of different regions of unreacted and passivated anodes indicated that the o al value increased fastest in the corner of anodes figs s9 and s10 the central regions exhibited a relative lower o al value suggesting the passivation degree was low which was in line with the xps spectra fig s11 the depth profiles of the central and marginal regions of passivated anodes were investigated by the tof sims technique fig 4 the signals of alox decreased with increasing detection depth sputtering times which was in line with the xps spectra thicker passivation layers could be observed at the marginal region according to the higher sputtering times lu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 which verified an inhomogeneous passivation forming rate at different regions of anodes in addition large cracks were observed on the surface of the anode in the centers demonstrating the massive dissolution of aluminum si text s6 and fig s12 the cracks at the edges were small indicating that dissolution was obstructed by passivation 3 3 evolution of anode passivation growth the development of passivation on the anode surface was monitored by an ir imaging camera since the temperature of the surface of an object is closely related to the emissivity of the object itself the objects with different emissivities exhibited temperature differences in the ir thermogram the oxygen in aluminum increased the emissivity coefficient of aluminum from 0 06 aluminum to 0 46 aluminum oxide bramson 1968 therefore the difference in emissivity between aluminum and aluminum oxide can be utilized to intuitively observe the distribution of the passivation layer aluminum oxide on the anode surface the eis spectra in fig 5 indicated that the degrees of passivation at the edges of the anodes were larger than those in the central regions of the anodes the inserts demonstrated that the passivation layer was first formed at the edge of the anode during the initial 1 min then the oxidized state dominated region extended from the edge to the center gradually after ec for 10 min and most regions of the anode tended to be passivated yellow color by 20 min the passivation of the anode was almost homogeneous except for a small region in the center a continuous aluminum oxide passivation layer was formed at 30 min although the color in the insert of fig 5d seems to be homogeneous by direct observation the rct at the edge was 1 36 times as high as that in the center after ec for 30 min confirming inhomogeneous passivation on the anode surface it could be summarized that passivation predominantly occurred at the edge of the anode first due to higher cds after serious passivation at the edges the increased rct led to declines in cds resulting in a decrease in the passivation rate at the edges since the passivated marginal regions had high rct values the cd distribution was renewed and more current went through the central regions of the anodes leading to increased degrees of passivation in the centers therefore the passivation layer gradually develops toward the center from the corners as the ec proceeds the cd distribution on the anode was the intrinsic factor explaining the edge effect of anode passivation therefore with respect to smaller anodes the relatively smaller differences in cds between edges and centers rendered lower degrees of passivation to exclude the influence of the total electrode area the passivation degrees of four anodes 1 cm 1 cm with a total anode area of 4 cm2 and a complete anode with an area of 4 cm2 2 cm 2 cm were taken into comparison the total current was kept constant to obtain the same dissolved amount of aluminum the voltage of the four anode system was 2 6 v lower than that of one large anode system fig 6 furthermore the rct of the small anode 1 21 104 ω was much lower than that of the large anode 2 21 105 ω 3 4 anode passivation mitigation strategy the passivation control strategy that improving the homogenization of cd distribution was a simple and convenient approach without interfering with pollutant removal the cd distributions on small electrodes were more homogeneous than those on large electrodes indicating that the electrode splitting method was efficient in mitigating passivation and applicable in practical engineering fig 7 a the total current was kept constant to obtain the same dissolved amount of aluminum the working voltage decreased obviously when the anode was split into quarters leading to a reduction in the energy consumption by 21 8 calculated by the integration of power over time fig 7b furthermore the ha removal of the split anodes was similar to that of the complete anode fig 7c which was ascribed to the similar al production fig s13 suggesting that the electrode splitting method wouldn t interfere with the production of al coagulant and the removal process the faradaic efficiencies showed in table s5 were a little higher than 100 which could be explained by the chemical corrosion of al electrode chen et al 2020 anodes with smaller dimensions exhibited more homogeneous cd distributions which originated from the edge effect of electric field distribution between parallel plate electrodes wang et al homogenizing the cd distribution by physical means is independent of the contaminant removal process by chemical method implying superior feasibility and applicability for practical applications currently mitigation of anode passivation could be realized by splitting the entire anodes into smaller parts and connected to the power supply separately which homogenized the cd distributions on anode surfaces the method to split available ec electrodes was simple low cost and environmentally friendly furthermore geometric sharps such as annular tanneru et al 2014 circular kim et al 2021 xie et al 2021 and cylindrical electrode su et al 2021 configurations that possess homogeneous cd distribution may be a promising avenue for anode passivation mitigation santis et al 2006 a more representative solution and the effect of water chemistry on anode passivation should be investigated in further studies in addition the mechanism of mitigating the anode passivation by controlling the current density distribution was independent of the previous reported mechanisms such as alternating pulsed current and ultrasound therefore these methods could incorporate with electrode splitting method to further improve the anti passivation performance table s6 4 conclusion this work proposed a distinctive understanding of the anode passivation evolution and inhibited anode passivation by physical means the cd distributions on distinct electrode areas were quantitatively analyzed by computational simulation explaining that homogeneous cd distributions were achieved by smaller anodes the element compositions and depth distributions in the passivation layer on the edges and centers of the anodes confirmed that the edges suffered higher degrees of passivation then the mitigation mechanism of passivation on the anode surface based on homogenization of cd distribution was proposed improving the homogenization of cd distribution by tuning anode geometric dimensions has been clarified to be an effective passivation mitigation strategy which declined the average current densities on anode when aluminum anode area decreased from 8 cm2 to 2 cm2 with a constant cd the homogenization degree increased by 24 0 and passivation was reduced by 24 3 the depth profiles of passivated anodes confirmed the inhomogeneity of the anode passivation that thicker passivation layers were observed at edges due to high cd distributions a facile strategy to homogenize cd distribution by splitting electrodes into smaller electrodes is then proposed for passivation mitigation which can save energy consumption by 21 8 with unchanged removal efficiency the findings in this study provide a unique insight into electrode passivation inhibition by a physical approach and give a theoretical basis for

15557,electrode passivation is the most challenging technical problem in electrocoagulation ec water treatment process but research on understanding and mitigating passivation evolution are still lacking herein homogenization of current density cd distribution was found to be a critical factor in alleviating the anode passivation during ec process decreasing electrode area decelerated the growth of passivation layer on anode through homogenizing cd distribution which was quantified by the ratios of cd distributed at the electrode edges and centers when aluminum anode area decreased from 8 cm2 to 2 cm2 with a constant cd the homogenization degree increased by 24 0 and passivation was reduced by 24 3 the depth profiles of passivated anodes confirmed the inhomogeneity of the anode passivation thicker passivation layers were observed at edges due to high cd distributions which originated from the edge effect of electric field distribution between parallel plate electrodes a facile strategy to homogenize cd distribution by splitting electrodes into smaller electrodes is then proposed for passivation mitigation which can save energy consumption by 21 8 with unchanged

water urban wastewater and industrial wastewater treatments bandaru et al 2020 li et al 2021 sun et al 2017 in practical ec application electrode passivation is becoming the most challenging technical problem dubrawski et al 2014 ingelsson et al 2020 liu et al 2020 which deteriorates the water treatment performance and raises energy consumption qasem et al 2021 xu et al 2014 the passivation layers formed by metal oxides on electrode surface enlarge overpotential and decrease current efficiency the severely passivated electrodes have to be replaced from service leading to increased operation and maintenance costs chow et al 2021 xu et al 2015 therefore effective strategies are urgently needed to overcome electrode passivation in the ec process there are some previous research reports on ec electrode passivation under various solution environments and operational parameters mansouri et al 2011 wellner et al 2018 sacrificial metal anodes tend to form an oxide e g al2o3 or hydroxide e g al oh 3 layer on the anode surface at weakly acidic and neutral ph leading to severe anode passivation amin et al 2010 in addition intense electrolytic reactions induced by a high current density cd would result in a high degree of passivation and intense side reactions dubrawski et al 2015 optimizing the ph and cd in ec was conducive to retarding passivation mcbeath et al 2020 reviewing the previous ec research achieving a high contaminant removal was the primary purpose that determined the optimized operation parameters rather than mitigating electrode passivation passivation control technologies such as ultrasonic waves he et al 2018 alternating pulsed current apc chow et al 2021 and adding depassivation agents e g chloride ions ansaf et al 2016 have been reported in previous articles however the high energy consumption he et al 2016 2018 instabilities of passivation mitigation ashraf et al 2019 yang et al 2015 and potential risk for effluent water quality abdel aziz et al 2020 golder et al 2011 wang et al 2009 indicated that these technologies have limitations in overcoming passivation problems periodic polarity reversal was also an effective to control electrode fouling but the trade off between coagulant production and fouling rate should be taken into consideration yasri et al 2022 the in depth recognition of the passivation growth procedure was essential and a passivation mitigation method that does not compromise or complicate the water treatment process is strongly demanded in this study the degrees of passivation of anodes were evaluated by the equivalent electrical resistance rct of passivation layers homogenization of cd was investigated to control anode passivation the cd distributions on distinct electrode areas were quantified by computational simulation the element compositions and depth distributions in the passivation layer on the edges and centers of the anodes were detected the forming mechanism of passivation on the anode surface based on homogenization of cd distribution was proposed furthermore a facile and effective strategy has been proposed for passivation mitigation by splitting large anodes into smaller anodes which provides unique insights into passivation control and designs of ec electrode systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and synthetic feed water na2so4 8 0 g l was employed as the electrolyte in deionized water milli q merck millipore germany with a conductivity of 10 3 0 2 ms cm which was measured by an electrical conductivity meter s230 mettler toledo switzerland sodium sulfate feed water was used to explore the passivation behaviors during ec humic acid ha sigma aldrich u s a feed water sun et al 2018 which consisted of 200 mg l na2so4 and 0 5 mm nahco3 was used to determine the performance of the passivation mitigation strategy the initial ph of the synthetic feed water was adjusted by 0 1 mol l naoh and 0 1 mol l h2so4 naoh na2so4 and anhydrous ethanol were received at analytical pure grade h2so4 was received at guaranteed reagent grade all reagents were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china aluminum electrodes with 99 9 purity thickness 0 3 mm were purchased from the qinghe guantai metal materials co ltd china unless otherwise specified the ph was adjusted to 7 and the anode was polished by sic sandpaper with 2000 meshes 2 2 preparation of aluminum anodes since the aluminum electrodes may be oxidized in the air during transportation and storage it was essential to prepolish the aluminum electrode surface before use the pretreatment process was as follows first the aluminum electrodes were polished by sic sandpaper with 500 2000 and 3000 meshes to achieve anode surfaces with different roughnesses then the polished electrodes were placed in anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 10 min by an ultrasonic cleaner to remove the residual sic particles on the surface of the electrodes finally the electrodes were placed in self sealing bags until use 2 3 ec passivation experiments two parallel aluminum electrodes with effective areas of 0 8 cm2 1 cm 0 8 cm 2 cm2 1 cm 2 cm 4 cm2 2 cm 2 cm and 8 cm2 3 2 cm 2 5 cm were used in the ec experiments the distance between the two electrodes was fixed at 1 cm hu et al 2017 2016 to keep the reaction area of the electrode constant the unreacted regions of the electrode were covered by polyimide insulating tape fifty milliliters of synthetic feed water were used in each experiment which was well mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm cds of 5 10 and 50 a m2 were employed at a constant current during each ec period 30 min 2 4 electrochemical tests electrochemical tests were used to determine the passivation process cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were applied to analyze the current variation before and after ec passivation the detailed method for electrode preparation is described in si text s1 and fig s1 a small potential range is used to avoid electrochemical reactions higher currents at the same voltage indicate higher conductivities of the electrode and relatively lower degrees of passivation electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements of anodes were carried out on an electrochemical workstation interface 1000 gamry usa in the frequency range of 10 khz 0 1 hz martin et al 2005 mechelhoff et al 2013 using the nyquist curve of the eis the electron transfer hindrance by the passivation layer on the aluminum anode surface can be quantified and the magnitude of passivation under different conditions can be deduced electrode preparation for passivation homogenization investigation is described in si text s2 and fig s2 2 5 anode characterization the pristine and passivated anodes were directly observed under a scanning electron microscope sem jsm7401f jedl japan equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds system the element variation during the oxidation process that occurred on the anode surface was measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific usa the aluminum component below the passivation surface was obtained by ar ion bombardment the sputtering time was 360 s for each layer with an ion gun energy of 4 kev fig s3 yang et al 2015 in addition the depth profiles of the passivated anodes were acquired using time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry tof sims v ion tof gmbh germany cornette et al 2020 infrared images were obtained with a thermal imaging camera e6 flir usa to visualize the development of the passivation on different regions of the anodes si text s3 the cd distributions on anodes were evaluated by finite element simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 size effect on anode passivation cds of 5 10 and 50 a m2 were investigated the plots of voltage evolution as a function of operational time are shown in fig 1 a the cd was first tuned by changing the current value of the ec and the effective electrode areas were kept constant at 2 cm2 the voltage increased from 3 6 0 2 v to 32 1 0 8 v when the cd increased from 5 to 50 a m2 after ec for 30 min the increasing voltages were attributed to the overpotentials on anode and cathode and ir drops the ir drops were 0 05 v 0 1 v and 0 5 v at the current density of 5 a m2 10 a m2 and 50 a m2 table s1 respectively which were relatively low and negligible for passivation analysis when the cd increased to 50 a m2 the voltage rose dramatically in the initial 7 min from 0 v to 29 8 0 3 v and then grew slowly until reaching the maximum output power indicating that the cd played a significant role in electrode passivation in addition an obvious size effect could be identified in which the voltages varied when the effective electrode areas and current values increased proportionally with a constant cd the voltage decreased when the effective electrode areas were reduced indicating a lower degree of passivation the final voltages were raised by 1 4 v and 9 0 v when the electrode areas were quadrupled at 5 a m2 and doubled at 10 a m2 respectively furthermore the final voltages declined from 32 1 0 8 v to 23 3 1 3 v during an ec period of 10 min when the electrode areas were reduced from 2 cm2 to 0 8 cm2 at 50 a m2 the size effect indicated that the size of the electrode may be a dominant factor in passivation process the ph increased from 7 91 to 8 76 when the cd increased from 5 to 50 a m2 table s2 which may facilitate the devastation of the passivated layer according to the pourbaix images of aluminum chugh et al 2022 de la fuente 2022 pan et al 2021 however the degree of passivation was still high at 50 a m2 and the voltage increased rapidly suggesting that the impact of the cd was higher than that of ph in this study the increasing in operational voltage could not be attributed entirely to anode passivation because the cell voltage contained the thermodynamic equilibrium potential anodic and cathodic overpotentials and ir drops therefore further investigations on anode were essential to figure out the anode passivation degree the cv plots of the anodes at different cds are shown in fig 1b and 1c the apparent resistance on the passivation layer increased when the cd in ec increased from 5 to 50 a m2 according to the decline in the detected cds in cv tests in addition when the electrode area increased in ec the resultant resistance of the anode increased and vice versa which was consistent with the results shown in fig 1a the passivation degrees of the anodes under different cds were further analyzed by eis measurements fig 1d and table s3 the rct increased from 114 8 to 151 6 ω when the anode area decreased from 8 cm2 to 2 cm2 at 5 a m2 when the area increased from 2 to 4 cm2 the rct increased from 174 0 to 190 6 ω at 10 a m2 in addition the effective cd which referred to the current divided by effective electrode area containing the specific surface attributed by the surface roughness of the anode may also influence anode passivation therefore passivation experiments with different surface roughnesses were carried out as a supplement si text s4 and fig s4 the results showed that anode passivation was mitigated when the anode surface roughness was promoted which indicated that decreasing the effective cd was a critical factor in controlling anode passivation 3 2 analysis of inhomogeneous passivation in general the electric field between two parallel plate electrodes was considered to be homogeneous to simplify the analysis however the electric field distribution was inhomogeneous at the edges of the electrodes in practice as was the cd distribution on the electrode surface wang et al 2019 therefore the cd distributions of electrodes with different areas were investigated by computational simulation the detailed simulation methods are described in si text s5 the results shown in fig 2 a 2c indicated that the four corners of the electrodes exhibited the highest cd of 369 0 a m2 with an electrode area of 2 cm 1 cm the cd at the edges was 52 0 a m2 which was lower than that of the corners but higher than that of the centers 4 9 a m2 when the area of the electrode increased to 3 2 cm 2 5 cm the differences in cd were more pronounced and the distribution was more inhomogeneous an obvious edge effect of the cd distribution on the electrodes can be observed fig s5 more current went through the edges of the electrode rather than the central region gupta et al 2021 wang et al yariv 2021 indicating that the edge effect was the nature of the size effect the edge effect could also be obviously observed even when the cd declined to 0 1 a m2 fig s6 in addition the edge effect was enhanced when the electrode area increased which was evaluated by the ratios of cds at the edges and in the centers fig 2d the ratios decreased from 99 06 to 75 31 at 5 a m2 indicating the promotion of homogenization of cd distribution which explained the lower passivation layer when the anode was small when the cd increased the homogenization of cd distribution was promoted but the homogeneous distributed high cd would lead to serious oxidation reactions that significantly facilitated passivation the central region and the marginal region of the passivated anode were then selected for further investigation the cv plots and eis spectra of different regions of the passivated anode are shown in fig 2e and 2f the results showed that the equivalent resistance at the anode edge 128 2 ω was higher than that at the anode center 88 9 ω these results confirmed that the passivation degree of the anode surface was inhomogeneous which was controlled by the cd distribution further experimental analysis of the anode passivation degree was carried out to support the simulation results the aluminum element underneath the anode surfaces was detected by xps after surface etching fig 3 the unreacted aluminum regions were applied as the control group all of the spectra of the anode exhibited two peaks the peak at 72 6 ev was ascribed to metallic aluminum almet liu et al 2013 the peak at 74 6 ev was attributed to oxidized aluminum alox figueiredo et al 2011 moroz et al 2009 the unreacted region of the passivated anode exhibited similar peak shapes in all three layers suggesting that the al species were stable the degrees of passivation evaluated by the almet alox values in different layers of the passivated anode are summarized in table s4 the almet alox decreased both in the central and marginal regions from the first layer to the third layer indicating that the degree of passivation decreased with increasing depth in the anode the marginal regions showed a higher alox peak in each layer confirming that the degrees of passivation at the edges were higher than those in the centers which certified the occurrence of the edge effect in anode passivation the only al o bond in the spectra of o 1 s indicated that the structure of passivation layer was simple fig s7 different regions of the anode surface were detected using energy dispersive spectroscopy method fig s8 eds mappings of different regions of unreacted and passivated anodes indicated that the o al value increased fastest in the corner of anodes figs s9 and s10 the central regions exhibited a relative lower o al value suggesting the passivation degree was low which was in line with the xps spectra fig s11 the depth profiles of the central and marginal regions of passivated anodes were investigated by the tof sims technique fig 4 the signals of alox decreased with increasing detection depth sputtering times which was in line with the xps spectra thicker passivation layers could be observed at the marginal region according to the higher sputtering times lu et al 2021 wu et al 2021 which verified an inhomogeneous passivation forming rate at different regions of anodes in addition large cracks were observed on the surface of the anode in the centers demonstrating the massive dissolution of aluminum si text s6 and fig s12 the cracks at the edges were small indicating that dissolution was obstructed by passivation 3 3 evolution of anode passivation growth the development of passivation on the anode surface was monitored by an ir imaging camera since the temperature of the surface of an object is closely related to the emissivity of the object itself the objects with different emissivities exhibited temperature differences in the ir thermogram the oxygen in aluminum increased the emissivity coefficient of aluminum from 0 06 aluminum to 0 46 aluminum oxide bramson 1968 therefore the difference in emissivity between aluminum and aluminum oxide can be utilized to intuitively observe the distribution of the passivation layer aluminum oxide on the anode surface the eis spectra in fig 5 indicated that the degrees of passivation at the edges of the anodes were larger than those in the central regions of the anodes the inserts demonstrated that the passivation layer was first formed at the edge of the anode during the initial 1 min then the oxidized state dominated region extended from the edge to the center gradually after ec for 10 min and most regions of the anode tended to be passivated yellow color by 20 min the passivation of the anode was almost homogeneous except for a small region in the center a continuous aluminum oxide passivation layer was formed at 30 min although the color in the insert of fig 5d seems to be homogeneous by direct observation the rct at the edge was 1 36 times as high as that in the center after ec for 30 min confirming inhomogeneous passivation on the anode surface it could be summarized that passivation predominantly occurred at the edge of the anode first due to higher cds after serious passivation at the edges the increased rct led to declines in cds resulting in a decrease in the passivation rate at the edges since the passivated marginal regions had high rct values the cd distribution was renewed and more current went through the central regions of the anodes leading to increased degrees of passivation in the centers therefore the passivation layer gradually develops toward the center from the corners as the ec proceeds the cd distribution on the anode was the intrinsic factor explaining the edge effect of anode passivation therefore with respect to smaller anodes the relatively smaller differences in cds between edges and centers rendered lower degrees of passivation to exclude the influence of the total electrode area the passivation degrees of four anodes 1 cm 1 cm with a total anode area of 4 cm2 and a complete anode with an area of 4 cm2 2 cm 2 cm were taken into comparison the total current was kept constant to obtain the same dissolved amount of aluminum the voltage of the four anode system was 2 6 v lower than that of one large anode system fig 6 furthermore the rct of the small anode 1 21 104 ω was much lower than that of the large anode 2 21 105 ω 3 4 anode passivation mitigation strategy the passivation control strategy that improving the homogenization of cd distribution was a simple and convenient approach without interfering with pollutant removal the cd distributions on small electrodes were more homogeneous than those on large electrodes indicating that the electrode splitting method was efficient in mitigating passivation and applicable in practical engineering fig 7 a the total current was kept constant to obtain the same dissolved amount of aluminum the working voltage decreased obviously when the anode was split into quarters leading to a reduction in the energy consumption by 21 8 calculated by the integration of power over time fig 7b furthermore the ha removal of the split anodes was similar to that of the complete anode fig 7c which was ascribed to the similar al production fig s13 suggesting that the electrode splitting method wouldn t interfere with the production of al coagulant and the removal process the faradaic efficiencies showed in table s5 were a little higher than 100 which could be explained by the chemical corrosion of al electrode chen et al 2020 anodes with smaller dimensions exhibited more homogeneous cd distributions which originated from the edge effect of electric field distribution between parallel plate electrodes wang et al homogenizing the cd distribution by physical means is independent of the contaminant removal process by chemical method implying superior feasibility and applicability for practical applications currently mitigation of anode passivation could be realized by splitting the entire anodes into smaller parts and connected to the power supply separately which homogenized the cd distributions on anode surfaces the method to split available ec electrodes was simple low cost and environmentally friendly furthermore geometric sharps such as annular tanneru et al 2014 circular kim et al 2021 xie et al 2021 and cylindrical electrode su et al 2021 configurations that possess homogeneous cd distribution may be a promising avenue for anode passivation mitigation santis et al 2006 a more representative solution and the effect of water chemistry on anode passivation should be investigated in further studies in addition the mechanism of mitigating the anode passivation by controlling the current density distribution was independent of the previous reported mechanisms such as alternating pulsed current and ultrasound therefore these methods could incorporate with electrode splitting method to further improve the anti passivation performance table s6 4 conclusion this work proposed a distinctive understanding of the anode passivation evolution and inhibited anode passivation by physical means the cd distributions on distinct electrode areas were quantitatively analyzed by computational simulation explaining that homogeneous cd distributions were achieved by smaller anodes the element compositions and depth distributions in the passivation layer on the edges and centers of the anodes confirmed that the edges suffered higher degrees of passivation then the mitigation mechanism of passivation on the anode surface based on homogenization of cd distribution was proposed improving the homogenization of cd distribution by tuning anode geometric dimensions has been clarified to be an effective passivation mitigation strategy which declined the average current densities on anode when aluminum anode area decreased from 8 cm2 to 2 cm2 with a constant cd the homogenization degree increased by 24 0 and passivation was reduced by 24 3 the depth profiles of passivated anodes confirmed the inhomogeneity of the anode passivation that thicker passivation layers were observed at edges due to high cd distributions a facile strategy to homogenize cd distribution by splitting electrodes into smaller electrodes is then proposed for passivation mitigation which can save energy consumption by 21 8 with unchanged removal efficiency the findings in this study provide a unique insight into electrode passivation inhibition by a physical approach and give a theoretical basis for electrode design in ec declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

as iii aq decreasing to 0 16 and 1 43 g l in amd and bsm assays respectively no oxidation of as iii was detected during the immobilization process these findings can help predict as release from

of sulfidic minerals including absms thus promoting the generation of acid mine drainage amd corkhill et al 2008 several studies have investigated the mechanisms of the oxidation of arsenopyrite which

of the previously reported works were performed under laboratory conditions in deionized water containing different effectors with the solution ph adjusted using diluted h2so4 hcl hno3 or naoh and a

during arsenopyrite bio oxidation the oxidation of as proceeds in a series of one electron transfers in which as iii and as v are the dominant as species murciego et al 2019 the products of bio oxidation of iron fe and sulfur s in arsenopyrite fe3 and so4 2 promote the formation of various secondary products such as jarosites mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 where m is a monovalent cation such as nh4 k or

be expected the above factors can also significantly affect the mobility and fate of as most laboratory experiments are performed in culture media e g basal salts bsm 9k mac msm while the arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd can be expected to be a significantly more complex process a high orp and elevated concentrations of sulfate and metal loid s such as fe al zn in amd cheng et al 2009 can significantly affect the growth of bacteria dissolution of arsenopyrite physicochemical properties of secondary products and thus also the transport and fate of as for example a higher fe al molar

pollution in mine impacted environments as iii is significantly more toxic to biological systems than as v boussouga et al 2021 and can be immobilized using fe iii and al iii oxides via adsorption efficiency of which depends greatly on the ionic strength and ph wei et al 2019 by products generated by the secondary al industry have shown a great potential in metal loid removal red mud rm can regulate arsenopyrite dissolution and the fate of as during bio oxidation through changes in solution parameters such as ph as speciation and oxidation properties of biogenic fe s intermediates and

iii improved the as v adsorption capacity of fe iii al iii hydr oxides formed while no as iii immobilization was observed our knowledge is limited about the roles of rm in the immobilization of as particularly as iii during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd and the feasibility of using rm as a stabilizing agent of as bearing mine wastes remains unknown mining activities that generate amd as well as expose sulfidic minerals to the atmosphere inadvertently lead to an intensified contact of arsenopyrite with amd which can cause serious as contamination of waters and soils in the mining area park et al 2019 a better understanding is needed of the release and subsequent fate of as mobilized via bio oxidation of arsenopyrite on contact with amd since the composition of amd particularly high orp and elevated concentrations of dissolved ions such as so4 2 and fe3 can greatly affect as mobilization in this study bio oxidation of arsenopyrite and transport of as in natural amd originating in a polymetallic mine in china were investigated differences between the arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd and bsm were studies with a focus on solution chemistry morphology and composition of secondary precipitates and as speciation furthermore the effects of rm on the immobilization of as iii released via bio oxidation of arsenopyrite were evaluated the results of this work advance our

were evaluated by the reduced chi square value ravel and newville 2005 datta et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of arsenopyrite bio oxidation compared to the bsm assay the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in amd was expected to be more complex due to the elevated dissolved metal concentrations e g fe3 aq 0 7 g l and high orp 600 mv of the amd in both cases changes in the solution parameters including orp ph cell density fet fe3 ast as iii so4 2 and concentrations of other elements such as al si k na ca mn cu and zn were investigated the orp value fig 1 a in the amd systems was affected predominantly by fe3 aq fe2 aq fig 1c shows changes in fet aq and fe3 aq zhang et al 2015 and it sharply decreased from 621 mv to 378 mv after 1 day of arsenopyrite bio oxidation this can be explained by the high concentration of fe3 in the amd and its reduction to fe2 on reaction with arsenopyrite following eq 1 mckibben et al 2008 in the bsm assay the orp value gradually increased with the initial rapid bio oxidation of arsenopyrite first 2 days followed by a decrease due to an increase in fe2 aq fig 1c after the orp reached a maximum value on day 8 a slight decrease followed due to the formation of fe iii minerals which was verified by xrd results shown in fig 4 and xanes figs 8 and 9 fig 1c shows that at a later stage the dissolved fe in both amd and bsm biotic assays existed mainly as fe3 in amd fet aq reached 1 53 g l on day 10 which was a significantly higher value than in bsm reaching 0 48 g l on day 10 the continuous increase in both fet and fe3 in the amd system indicated that the dissolution of arsenopyrite and bio oxidation of fe2 were ongoing until the end of the experiment the initial rapid increase in ph fig 1a in both amd and bsm assays was caused predominantly by rapid bio oxidation of fe2 to fe3 eq 2 the formation of secondary products such as jarosites eq 3 and ferric arsenate eq 4 and bio oxidation of s eq 5 are h generating reactions that caused a gradual decrease in the solution ph after day 2 fig 1a 1 feass 5 f e 3 3 h 2 o 6 f e 2 h 3 as o 3 s 3 h 2 4 f e 2 4 h o 2 bacteria 4 f e 3 2 h 2 o 3 3 f e 3 2 s o 4 2 m 6 h 2 o mf e 3 s o 4 2 oh 6 6 h 4 h 3 as o 4 f e 3 feas o 4 3 h 5 2 s 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 4 h fig 1b shows that the high metal content in amd negatively affected the growth of s thermosulfidooxidans in the first 2 days compared to minimal medium the maximum cell density in the amd reached 2 1 108 cells ml on day 4 followed by a slight decrease the cell density in the amd system was greater at the later stage of arsenopyrite bio oxidation than that in the bsm assay generally the release of the electron donor fe2 and accumulation of toxic as are two main factors that affect the first positively and the latter negatively bacterial growth and fe oxidation during arsenopyrite bio oxidation high ast aq fig 1d and a formation of a passivation layer shown in fig 3a and b inhibited the dissolution of arsenopyrite which explains the decrease in the cell density particularly in the bsm assay after 2 days of bio oxidation the relatively low rates of fe2 oxidation by s thermosulfidooxidans in the first 2 days were ascribed to the inhibitory effects of the elevated concentrations of dissolved metals in amd assay and as released via arsenopyrite oxidative dissolution in both biotic assays while from day 2 6 the rate of fe oxidation was higher in amd fig 1c fig 1d f shows that ast aq and so4 2 aq gradually increased as the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite progressed an elevated ast aq was detected in the amd assay in the initial stage of the experiment indicating enhanced arsenopyrite dissolution due to a rapid attack of the fe3 present in amd on the mineral surface importantly in both amd and bsm the solubilized as occurred mainly as as iii fig 1d from day 2 ast aq and as iii aq in the amd assay were noticeably lower than those in bsm assay this was ascribed to the formation of as iii bearing precipitates e g tooeleite as shown in figs 4 and 7 of note an obvious decrease in the concentration of al iii was found at the initial stage during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in the amd assay fig 1e previous studies have reported that al iii can contribute to as removal via the formation of al iii fe iii hydroxides and al sulfoxyhydroxide e g basaluminite wang et al 2019 igarashi et al 2020 no significant changes were observed throughout the time course of the experiment in the concentrations of other elements in either of the two assays in the amd sterile control the orp value quickly dropped from 618 to 322 mv due to rapid fe3 reduction on contact with arsenopyrite eq 1 and then it marginally increased over time to 336 mv fig 2 a in the abiotic bsm assay orp increased slightly over time reaching a maximum of 328 mv on day 10 a value significantly lower than the value detected in the corresponding bio assay 536 mv the ph in both abiotic assays did not significantly change during chemical dissolution of arsenopyrite fig 2a soluble fe existed predominantly as fe2 in both systems fig 2b the as released from arsenopyrite in sterile amd water was mainly as iii while it occurred predominantly as as v in the sterile medium fig 2c in summary significantly lower arsenopyrite dissolution rates were observed in the abiotic systems fig 2 compared to the corresponding bio assays inoculated with s thermosulfidooxidans fig 1 3 2 elemental and mineralogical composition of arsenopyrite oxidation products to describe the surface structure of arsenopyrite residues and oxidation layers formed on the mineral surfaces and to analyze differences between solids from amd and bsm assays the leaching residues were investigated by sem eds figs 3 a and s2a show sem images of amorphous products that formed in large amounts within 2 days of bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in amd these products were composed predominantly of fe as s and o and attached to the surface of both arsenopyrite and bacterial cells in comparison the surface morphology of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residue collected from the bsm assay after 2 days fig 3b differed from that of the amd residue showing a fine and dense surface layer enriched in as s fe and o with a minor amount of k fig s2b meanwhile many bacterial cells were found attached to the mineral surfaces fig s3 after 10 days of bio oxidation the arsenopyrite completely dissolved in the amd biotic system and the typical structure corresponding to the mineral was not identified in the sem images but an amorphous precipitate that included bacterial cells occurred fig 3d in the bsm assay a well crystallized passivation layer comprising aggregated disk like microstructures with a diameter of 1 μm covered the mineral surface fig 3e and an elevated content of k besides fe s and o fig s4 implies that it was composed mainly of k jarosite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 an fe iii oxysulphoxyhydroxide known to incorporate as savage et al 2005 zhang et al 2020 the surface of the arsenopyrite in the bsm sterile control remained intact after 10 days fig 3c and only a low quantity of oxidation products was formed on the mineral surface in the amd control system fig 3f the xrd results fig 4 show that the phase composition of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residue from the amd system was more complex compared to the residue from bsm compared to the arsenopyrite residue collected from the bsm biotic system shown in fig 4b a greater amount of s0 and a lower quantity of crystalline jarosite were detected on the surface of the amd arsenopyrite residue after 2 days of arsenopyrite bio oxidation interestingly a significant amount of as iii bearing precipitate i e tooeleite was also detected fig 4a on the amd residue surface tooeleite has previously been identified as a material potentially suitable for as iii immobilization morin et al 2003 the formation of tooeleite eq 6 is affected primarily by the fe as ratio ph and so4 2 aq chai et al 2016 nishimura and robins 2008 the low solution ph fig 1a and elevated concentrations of fe3 affecting the fe as ratio fig 1c and so4 2 fig 1e in amd facilitated the enhanced accumulation of tooeleite during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in this study this also explains the lower ast aq and as iii aq detected in the amd system compared to those in bsm in fig 1d after 10 days of bio oxidation in amd the arsenopyrite almost disappeared and the solid phase comprised mainly tooeleite and s0 with minor amounts of jarosites goethite α feooh and biotite kfemg2 alsi3o10 oh 2 fig 4a in contrast the solids collected from bsm after 10 days fig 4b were composed mainly of jarosites which are considered the main components of passivation layers on sulfide surfaces in ore bioleaching larsson et al 1990 s0 and minor amounts of tooeleite and arsenopyrite no significant changes were detected in the arsenopyrite in the sterile controls fig 4c besides a greater amount of s0 detected in the amd residue compared to the bsm one 6 6 f e 3 4 h 3 as o 3 s o 4 2 8 h 2 o f e 6 as o 3 4 s o 4 oh 4 4 h 2 o 16 h the mla analysis results fig s5 table s2 show that in the amd biotic assay the content of tooeleite reached 72 02 after 10 days of arsenopyrite bio oxidation which was much higher than the tooeleite content in the bsm biotic assay 18 58 while the contents of jarosites 6 39 and arsenopyrite 2 14 in the amd assay were much lower than those in bsm 62 44 and 10 56 respectively 3 3 speciation transformations of as fe and s during arsenopyrite bio oxidation to identify as species in oxidation layers the arsenopyrite residues from amd and bsm assays were examined by xps at different reaction times the spectra of as3d 5 2 are shown in fig 5 and corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in table s3 the as species on the surface of arsenopyrite during bio oxidation in both amd and bsm were mainly as i s 41 1 ev as 0 41 8 ev as i o 43 5 ev as iii o 44 35 ev and as v o 45 25 ev in comparison to the original arsenopyrite fig 5i the intensities of as i s and as 0 peaks decreased and those of as iii o and as v o increased due to arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 5a and d and these trends gradually continued as the bio oxidation process progressed fig 5b c e f in the amd system fig 5a c the peak of as i s for arsenopyrite disappeared after 10 days and as iii o became a dominant as species in the oxidation layer reaching 43 9 fig 5c corresponding to the accumulation of tooeleite fig 3 in the bsm assay the percentage of as v o 46 6 was greater than that of as iii o 34 9 likely due to an increased formation of as v bearing minerals such as amorphous ferric arsenate and scorodite these findings are consistent with the results of xanes analysis described below fig 6 the as k edge xanes analysis was performed to further evaluate as speciation during arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 6 the xanes spectra of as bearing references are shown in fig 6a linear combination fitting lcf plots of xanes spectra for the arsenopyrite residues bio oxidized in amd and bsm for 10 days are shown in fig 6b dotted lines closely corresponding to the measured xanes spectra of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residues solid lines based on the edge energies as iii 11 871 3 ev dominated in the bio oxidized residue obtained from the amd system while as v 11 875 ev was dominant in the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residue in the bsm assay the lcf results show that as in the arsenopyrite residue collected from the bsm assay after 10 days of bio oxidation comprised of 48 4 amorphous fa 21 3 scorodite 15 6 tooeleite 8 9 disodium hydrogen arsenate na2haso4 and 5 8 arsenopyrite fig 6c in contrast the composition of the bio oxidized residue from the amd system was 70 1 tooeleite 17 5 amorphous fa and 12 4 na3aso3 while no arsenopyrite and scorodite were detected fig 6d due to its high stability scorodite is considered a suitable material for the immobilization and long term storage of arsenate vega hernandez et al 2019 the as released from arsenopyrite at the early stage of bio oxidation was mainly as iii which quickly reacted with fe3 and so4 2 in amd to form tooeleite these results demonstrate that fe3 cannot efficiently promote the oxidation of as iii to as v in amd even at the high concentrations indicating that the fate of as released from arsenopyrite in amd significantly differs from that of as mobilized in the bsm assay to investigate s speciation in the solid residues after arsenopyrite bio oxidation the s k edge xanes analysis and lcf were performed fig 7 a comparison with the spectra of s bearing references fig 7a showed that while a decrease in the intensity of the peak for arsenopyrite 2471 8 ev occurred the intensity of the peaks for s0 2472 6 ev and so4 2 2482 8 ev increased gradually during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in both amd and bsm systems fig 7b the lcf results fig 7c d show that the s species in the arsenopyrite residue after 2 days of bio oxidation in amd were composed of 40 3 arsenopyrite 27 s0 14 1 jarosites 9 4 schwertmannite and 9 2 tooeleite compared to 57 5 arsenopyrite 21 7 s0 15 6 jarosites and 5 2 schwertmannite in the bsm residue after 10 days of bio oxidation the s species were tooeleite 37 8 s0 30 6 schwertmannite 16 7 and jarosites 14 9 in the solids from amd and 48 2 jarosites 24 3 s0 11 9 arsenopyrite and minor amounts of schwertmannite 9 and tooeleite 6 6 in the bsm residue these results demonstrate that arsenopyrite bio oxidation was enhanced in the amd water simultaneously an increased formation of schwertmannite a poorly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxy sulfate mineral with a tunnel structure and strong binding affinity for metal loid s could facilitate partial immobilization of as under acidic conditions through adsorption or co precipitation reactions as described by burton et al 2009 a mechanism of arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd is proposed fig 8 based on the above results fe3 present in amd attacks the surface of arsenopyrite the fe2 generated via fe3 reduction and arsenopyrite dissolution serves as an electron donor to chemolithotrophic bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substances epss that coat bacterial cells can serve as nucleation sites for precipitation of fe or as bearing products wang et al 2020 bond et al 2000 dissolution of arsenopyrite and efficient bio oxidation of fe2 and s result in elevated as iii aq fe3 aq and so4 2 in amd promoting the formation of amorphous as iii fe iii sulfate oxy hydroxide minerals e g tooeleite and schwertmannite the elevated formation of the above secondary minerals facilitate as immobilization particularly that of as iii via co precipitation and or adsorption egal et al 2009 duquesne et al 2003 in comparison to amd a greater proportion of as released through bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in the bsm remains in solution mainly as as iii importantly the formation of a dense passivation layer composed mainly of jarosites s0 amorphous fa and scorodite on the surface of arsenopyrite in the bsm can limit the attack of fe3 on the mineral surface and mitigate the release of fe2 that would support the growth of chemolithotrophs thus inhibiting the dissolution of arsenopyrite 3 4 evaluation of rm for in situ as immobilization 3 4 1 effects of rm on amd enriched with as mobilized via arsenopyrite bio oxidation as shown above elevated concentration of dissolved as predominantly as as iii were detected in amd due to arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 1c d which together with the low ph of amd 2 0 fig 1a presents a serious risk for the environment and human health to investigate the potential of rm to serve as an as adsorbent small amounts 4 and 8 g l of alkaline rm were added to the amd and bsm assays after 10 days of arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 9 a illustrates that the additions of rm to the amd biotic systems resulted in a significant orp decrease and ph increase caused mainly by neutralization reactions and adsorption of fe3 onto solid surfaces four days after the addition of 4 and 8 g l rm i e on day 14 ph in the assays increased from 1 87 to 2 43 and 3 52 respectively and orp decreased from 578 mv to 445 and 315 mv respectively similar trends were observed in the bsm assay fig 9c fig 9b shows that the concentration of dissolved as significantly decreased in the amd systems four days after rm additions and the murky yellow color of both solutions with 4 and 8 g l rm cleared up after standing for 24 h interestingly the amount of fe precipitated similarly to as correlated with the amount of rm added fig 9b indicating that fe3 may play an important role in the as immobilization process meanwhile partial dissolution of rm caused by h and fe3 attack zhang et al 2022 resulted in the release of low amounts of al si ca and na into solution fig 9b the as iii aq decreased from 1 92 g l to 0 68 and 0 16 g l in the amd assays with 4 and 8 g l rm respectively fig 9b while in the bsm assay with 8 g l rm the as iii aq remained high 1 43 g l after 4 days of reaction fig 9d a slight increase in so4 2 in both amd and bsm was attributed to bio oxidation of s0 and or dissolution of jarosites as discussed below and shown in fig 14 in the abiotic assays an increase in ph and decrease in orp values occurred after 4 and 8 g l rm were added and no visible decrease in as aq and fe aq was observed fig s6 3 4 2 effects of rm on solid products of arsenopyrite bio oxidation the sem results show the morphology of the residue collected from the amd assay four days after the addition of 4 g l rm fig 10 a and b the morphology comprising structures of aggregated nano sized crystallites was similar to that of the arsenopyrite residue before rm addition shown in fig 3d but a low amount of gypsum caso4 2h2o was present fig 10a the predominance of as fe s and o fig 10c implies that the residue after rm addition was composed mainly of tooeleite which was also indicated by xrd results shown in fig 11 a when 8 g l rm was added to the amd bio oxidation assays more gypsum was formed and the solid precipitates together with bacterial cells accumulated as nanoscale spheroids diameter 100 300 nm fig 10d and e in contrast the main solid structures in the bsm after the addition of 8 g l rm were residual rm and undissolved arsenopyrite covered with a fine passivation layer fig s7 the xrd results fig 11 indicate that the residue collected from the amd system four days after the addition of 4 g l rm was composed of amorphous tooeleite s0 and gypsum with minor amounts of other phases such as ettringite ca6al2 so4 3 oh 12 26h2o jarosites and biotite kfemg2 alsi3o10 oh 2 fig 11a additionally the two broad peaks in the xrd pattern of the precipitate indicate that the analyzed solids contained substances with poor crystallinity interestingly a small amount of pharmacosiderite kfe4 aso4 3 oh 4 6 7h2o was detected in the assay with 4 g l rm pharmacosiderite has a similar composition to scorodite and its formation has been linked to as and fe redox reactions associated with microbial activity koo et al 2022 compared to the residue from the amd system with 4 g l rm the xrd pattern of the solid residue collected from the amd assay with 8 g l rm showed more prominent gypsum peaks while jarosite peaks became negligible fig 11b small amounts of muscovite kal2si3alo10 oh 2 and hematite fe2o3 were also detected in the residue the residue collected from bsm with 8 g l rm was composed of gypsum and s0 with minor amounts of tooeleite and arsenopyrite the intensity of the jarosite peaks decreased after the addition of rm fig s8 additionally the higher ph ph 4 fig 9c and lower fe3 aq fig 9d in the bsm assay compared to amd resulted in a greater abundance of rm components e g muscovite hematite kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 perovskite catio3 and diaspore β alo oh the results of the tem analysis fig 12 show that the surface of the residue from the amd assay before rm addition comprised an amorphous layer among needle like microstructures fig 12a four days after 8 g l rm were added the amorphous layer covering cell surfaces became denser and thicker with elevated distributions of as al si and o fig 12d compared to the element distribution before rm was added fig 12c the corresponding eds results fig s9 table s4 indicate that the oxidation layer formed on the cell surfaces before rm was added was comprised mainly of tooeleite in addition the decrease in the fe as ratio from 1 57 to 1 46 implies that dissolution recrystallization processes likely occurred after rm was added the dissolution and transformation of rm in fe3 rich amd resulted in a higher proportion of as immobilized in the precipitate the decrease in the content of s observed was likely primarily due to partial dissolution of tooeleite and or jarosites caused by the addition of alkaline rm and partially due to weak ion exchange reactions occurring between so4 2 and as iii during the as immobilization process fig s10 the xps analysis detected higher contents of o and si on the cell surfaces indicating a formation of a sio2 gel fig s11 table s5 which has been postulated favorable for the stabilization of as bearing precipitates adelman et al 2015 3 4 3 evaluation of as immobilization mechanism the above results indicate that rm greatly promoted the immobilization of dissolved as iii released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation based on the much lower as iii aq detected in amd compared to bsm there are two possible mechanisms for as iii immobilization i direct adsorption or co precipitation of as iii and ii initial oxidation of as iii to as v and subsequent formation of as v bearing precipitates to determine the mechanism the surface properties and the speciation of as and s of the precipitates after as iii immobilization were investigated using ft ir and as s k edge xanes the ft ir spectra of all solid samples after rm additions shown in fig s12 exhibited the bands ascribed to o h stretching 3000 3600 cm 1 and h o h bending 1627 cm 1 vibrations of adsorbed water the c o c band 1400 1500 cm 1 corresponding to calcite was not detected in the spectrum of the solid sample collected from the amd assay with 4 g l rm due to rm complete dissolution zhang et al 2022 as opposed to partial rm dissolution in assays with 8 g l rm an increase in the intensity of bands ascribed to ν 1 as o 3 3 770 cm 1 and ν 3 as o 3 3 the shoulder at 694 cm 1 indicate that more as iii was adsorbed onto the surface of the amd precipitate after a 8 g l rm addition compared to the bsm precipitate three so4 2 bands at 1 112 985 and 603 cm 1 corresponding to ν 3 so4 outer sphere bound ν 1 so4 and structural ν 4 so4 in tooeleite respectively chai et al 2016 were detected in all precipitates and the intensities of these peaks in the solids collected from the amd assays with rm were higher than in the precipitates from the bsm assay with rm the as k edge xanes spectra fig 13 a show that the intensity of the peak for as iii 11 871 3 ev increased significantly in the precipitates from the amd assays after rm additions while the peak for as v 11 875 ev remained almost unchanged a similar trend was observed in the precipitates from the bsm assay the lcf results fig 13b and c indicate that the as species in the precipitate obtained from the bsm assay with 8 g l rm were composed of 33 6 amorphous fa 28 8 tooeleite 23 2 na3aso3 and 14 4 scorodite in the solids from the amd assays tooeleite dominated with 70 4 and 73 1 in the assays with 4 and 8 g l rm respectively followed by na3aso3 18 8 and 20 6 respectively and 10 amorphous fa compared to the lcf results of the precipitates before rm additions the proportion of the as v bearing component i e amorphous fa decreased in the precipitates from both amd assays with 4 and 8 g l rm fig 13c based on the above results it can be concluded that no significant as oxidation occurred during rm dissolution and as iii immobilization the results of s k edge xanes show that compared to the spectrum of the residue from the bsm assay with 8 g l rm significantly lower intensities of the peak for s0 2472 6 ev and higher intensities of the peak for so4 2 2482 8 ev were observed in the spectra of the residues obtained from amd assays with both rm additions fig 14 a the lcf results fig 14b and table s6 show that the content of jarosites decreased in all assays after rm additions likely due to the increase in ph above the range within which jarosites are stable approx 1 2 5 and their subsequent transformation into schwertmannite bigham et al 1996 the dissolution of aluminosilicates e g kaolinite and katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 8 following eqs 7 and 8 respectively and ca bearing phases e g calcite eq 9 releases al3 and ca2 into solution these cations can react with so4 2 generated via s bio oxidation forming insoluble crystalline al2 so4 3 and caso4 eqs 10 and 11 respectively as shown in table s6 the s compounds in the precipitate collected from the amd assay four days after the addition of 4 g l rm comprised 35 6 tooeleite 27 4 caso4 and 12 8 s0 with minor amounts of schwertmannite 9 2 al2 so4 3 8 9 and jarosites 6 1 the contents of s0 and jarosites decreased to 6 3 and 0 respectively when a higher amount of rm 8 g l was added while the contents of schwertmannite tooeleite and caso4 increased slightly table s6 fig s13 shows that rm alone promotes s0 oxidation only marginally these results demonstrate that rm promotes oxidation of s0 and transformations of the secondary sulfate minerals 7 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 6 h 2 a l 3 2 h 4 si o 4 h 2 o 8 c a 3 a l 2 si o 4 oh 8 12 h 3 c a 2 2 a l 3 h 4 si o 4 8 h 2 o 9 cac o 3 2 h c a 2 h 2 o c o 2 10 2 a l 3 3 s o 4 2 a l 2 s o 4 3 11 c a 2 s o 4 2 cas o 4 it can be concluded that rm can promote immobilization of as iii released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation under acidic conditions especially in amd through the regulation of fe3 aq ph and orp and transformations of secondary products no detectable oxidation of as iii to as v was observed during the immobilization process indicating that the compounds in rm do not mediate as oxidation we speculate that there are three ways by which rm promotes as iii immobilization 1 the increase in solution ph caused by rm dissolution leads to a reduced stability of secondary sulfate minerals e g jarosites and schwertmannite and the unstable so4 2 groups contribute to as iii immobilization via ligand exchange supported by figs 9 12 and table s4 2 rm provides nucleation sites for fe3 precipitation thus promoting co precipitation of as iii as as iii fe iii oxyhydroxides such as tooeleite shown in figs 13 and 14 mamtaz and bache 2001 meng et al 2001 3 the positively charged surface of rm that results from extensive fe3 and h adsorption promotes the adsorption of as iii 4 conclusions this study investigated the release and transport of as during bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in natural amd and compared the processes with those in bsm besides the effects of an industrial solid waste i e rm on the immobilization of as iii solubilized via arsenopyrite bio oxidation were studied the main findings are summarized below 1 the rate of bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in amd was higher than that in bsm due to high concentrations of fe3 and so4 2 in amd that enhanced arsenopyrite dissolution and as immobilization only 2 14 of arsenopyrite remained in the solid phase in the amd biotic assay after 10 days of bio oxidation which was much less than in the bsm assay 10 56 2 the attack of fe3 on arsenopyrite present in amd generated elevated amounts of fe2 which could serve as an electron donor promoting the growth of s thermosulfidooxidans meanwhile the bacterial cells served as nucleation sites for the precipitation of minerals in contrast to jarosites dominating in bsm solids tooeleite was the main secondary product in amd residues 3 the as released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation existed in solution as as iii importantly ast aq detected in amd was significantly lower than in bsm this was ascribed to the higher fe iii as iii ratio and so4 2 in amd favoring the formation of tooeleite and other secondary minerals such as schwertmannite which could significantly contribute to as immobilization 4 rm can effectively promote in situ immobilization of as iii released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation the as iii aq in the amd assay decreased from 1 92 to 0 16 g l after 4 days of reaction which was a much lower value than that detected in bsm 1 43 g l the mechanism of as iii immobilization using alkaline rm includes a ligand exchange with so4 2 in sulfate minerals affected by elevated ph co precipitation with fe iii on the rm surface and direct adsorption of as iii to the rm surface positively charged after fe3 adsorption no oxidation of as iii to as v was detected during as immobilization the results of this work provide a better understanding of the processes involved in bio oxidation of arsenopyrite on contact with amd and the fate of the immobilized as the findings

15558,mining activities expose sulfidic minerals including arsenopyrite feass to acid mine drainage amd the subsequent release of toxic arsenic as can have great negative implications for the environment and human health this study investigated the evolution of secondary products and as speciation transformations during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd collected from a polymetallic mine immobilization of the as solubilized via arsenopyrite bio oxidation using red mud rm was also studied the results show that the high ionic strength concentrations of dissolved fe3 so4 2 and ca2 reached values up to 0 75 3 38 and 0 35 g l respectively and redox potential up to 621 mv of amd caused primarily by fe3 enhanced the dissolution of arsenopyrite a high fe aq as aq ratio in the amd favored the precipitation of tooeleite during arsenopyrite bio oxidation and the formation of other poorly crystalline products such as schwertmannite and amorphous ferric arsenate also contributed to as immobilization bacterial cells served as important nucleation sites for the precipitation of mineral phases arsenopyrite completely dissolved after 12 days of bio oxidation in amd and the as aq mainly present as as iii reached 1 92 g l while a greater as aq was observed in a basal salts medium bsm assay reaching 3 02 g l an rm addition significantly promoted as iii immobilization with final as iii aq decreasing to 0 16 and 1 43 g l in amd and bsm assays respectively no oxidation of as iii was detected during the immobilization process these findings can help predict as release from arsenopyrite on contact with amd and on a broader scale assist in designing remediation and treatment strategies to mitigate as contamination in mining graphical abstract image graphical abstract

arsenic as pollution in groundwater surface waters and soils can have serious negative effects on human health hong et al 2021 arsenic pollution is caused both by natural geomicrobiological processes and anthropogenic activities such as pesticide application landfill pile leaching and mining guo et al 2013 matschullat 2000 the latter is considered a primary source of as pollution in natural environments tabelin et al 2021 extraction and processing of valuable metals such as gold and copper lead to an elevated exposure of as bearing sulfide minerals absms e g arsenopyrite feass and enargite cu3ass4 to water and oxygen oxidation of absms results in a release of as into the environment iron and or sulfur oxidizing microorganisms isoms significantly enhance the rates of oxidation of sulfidic minerals including absms thus promoting the generation of acid mine drainage amd corkhill et al 2008 several studies have investigated the mechanisms of the oxidation of arsenopyrite which is the most abundant absm in many ore deposits including the effects of the following environmental factors oxygen walker et al 2006 ph yu et al 2007 oxidants and or metal oxides including h2o2 ma et al 2016 fe3 neil and jun 2016 mno2 and fe2o3 liu et al 2015 anions cl zheng et al 2020 po4 3 park et al 2020 and hco3 wu et al 2020 and organic matter humic and fulvic acids wu et al 2019 however most of the previously reported works were performed under laboratory conditions in deionized water containing different effectors with the solution ph adjusted using diluted h2so4 hcl hno3 or naoh and a very limited number of studies have systematically investigated the oxidation behavior of arsenopyrite mediated by acidophilic isoms and the subsequent release of as from the mineral in natural amd during arsenopyrite bio oxidation the oxidation of as proceeds in a series of one electron transfers in which as iii and as v are the dominant as species murciego et al 2019 the products of bio oxidation of iron fe and sulfur s in arsenopyrite fe3 and so4 2 promote the formation of various secondary products such as jarosites mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 where m is a monovalent cation such as nh4 k or h3o schwertmannite fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x where 1 x 1 75 elemental sulfur s0 amorphous ferric arsenate fa and scorodite feaso4 2h2o corkhill and vaughan 2009 the formation and transformations of these mineral phases are strongly affected by physicochemical parameters ph redox potential orp metal ions fe as and as s ratios etc as well as the composition and activity of microbial communities as could be expected the above factors can also significantly affect the mobility and fate of as most laboratory experiments are performed in culture media e g basal salts bsm 9k mac msm while the arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd can be expected to be a significantly more complex process a high orp and elevated concentrations of sulfate and metal loid s such as fe al zn in amd cheng et al 2009 can significantly affect the growth of bacteria dissolution of arsenopyrite physicochemical properties of secondary products and thus also the transport and fate of as for example a higher fe al molar ratio in as rich amd was reported to promote as immobilization adra et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 in situ immobilization of as released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation is a key step in controlling as pollution in mine impacted environments as iii is significantly more toxic to biological systems than as v boussouga et al 2021 and can be immobilized using fe iii and al iii oxides via adsorption efficiency of which depends greatly on the ionic strength and ph wei et al 2019 by products generated by the secondary al industry have shown a great potential in metal loid removal red mud rm can regulate arsenopyrite dissolution and the fate of as during bio oxidation through changes in solution parameters such as ph as speciation and oxidation properties of biogenic fe s intermediates and products zhang et al 2021 consequently fe iii and protons h generated during fe and s bio oxidation play a key role in the transformations of rm zhang et al 2022 reported that bacterially generated fe iii improved the as v adsorption capacity of fe iii al iii hydr oxides formed while no as iii immobilization was observed our knowledge is limited about the roles of rm in the immobilization of as particularly as iii during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd and the feasibility of using rm as a stabilizing agent of as bearing mine wastes remains unknown mining activities that generate amd as well as expose sulfidic minerals to the atmosphere inadvertently lead to an intensified contact of arsenopyrite with amd which can cause serious as contamination of waters and soils in the mining area park et al 2019 a better understanding is needed of the release and subsequent fate of as mobilized via bio oxidation of arsenopyrite on contact with amd since the composition of amd particularly high orp and elevated concentrations of dissolved ions such as so4 2 and fe3 can greatly affect as mobilization in this study bio oxidation of arsenopyrite and transport of as in natural amd originating in a polymetallic mine in china were investigated differences between the arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd and bsm were studies with a focus on solution chemistry morphology and composition of secondary precipitates and as speciation furthermore the effects of rm on the immobilization of as iii released via bio oxidation of arsenopyrite were evaluated the results of this work advance our understanding of the generation of as contaminated amd via bio oxidation of absms in mine wastes on a broader scale the findings provide information that could be useful in waste management specifically in applications using industrial by products to treat as polluted mine wastes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials arsenopyrite used in this study was collected from a carlin type gold

bio oxidation of arsenopyrite two sets of bioassays were designed to investigate oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite and the fate of the as released during the bio oxidation process the first set was carried out in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 10 g l arsenopyrite in 100 ml amd that was prior to use sterilized by filtration 0 22 µm strain yn 22 was inoculated at initial concentration of

were evaluated by the reduced chi square value ravel and newville 2005 datta et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of arsenopyrite bio oxidation compared to the bsm assay the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in amd was expected to be more complex due to the elevated dissolved metal concentrations e g fe3 aq 0 7 g l and high orp 600 mv of the amd in both cases changes in the solution parameters including orp ph cell density fet fe3 ast as iii so4 2 and concentrations of other elements such as al si k na ca mn cu and zn were investigated the orp value fig 1 a in the amd systems was affected predominantly by fe3 aq fe2 aq fig 1c shows changes in fet aq and fe3 aq zhang et al 2015 and it sharply decreased from 621 mv to 378 mv after 1 day of arsenopyrite bio oxidation this can be explained by the high concentration of fe3 in the amd and its reduction to fe2 on reaction with arsenopyrite following eq 1 mckibben et al 2008 in the bsm assay the orp value gradually increased with the initial rapid bio oxidation of arsenopyrite first 2 days followed by a decrease due to an increase in fe2 aq fig 1c after the orp reached a maximum value on day 8 a slight decrease followed due to the formation of fe iii minerals which was verified by xrd results shown in fig 4 and xanes figs 8 and 9 fig 1c shows that at a later stage the dissolved fe in both amd and bsm biotic assays existed mainly as fe3 in amd fet aq reached 1 53 g l on day 10 which was a significantly higher value than in bsm reaching 0 48 g l on day 10 the continuous increase in both fet and fe3 in the amd system indicated that the dissolution of arsenopyrite and bio oxidation of fe2 were ongoing until the end of the experiment the initial rapid increase in ph fig 1a in both amd and bsm assays was caused predominantly by rapid bio oxidation of fe2 to fe3 eq 2 the formation of secondary products such as jarosites eq 3 and ferric arsenate eq 4 and bio oxidation of s eq 5 are h generating reactions that caused a gradual decrease in the solution ph after day 2 fig 1a 1 feass 5 f e 3 3 h 2 o 6 f e 2 h 3 as o 3 s 3 h 2 4 f e 2 4 h o 2 bacteria 4 f e 3 2 h 2 o 3 3 f e 3 2 s o 4 2 m 6 h 2 o mf e 3 s o 4 2 oh 6 6 h 4 h 3 as o 4 f e 3 feas o 4 3 h 5 2 s 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 4 h fig 1b shows that the high metal content in amd negatively affected the growth of s thermosulfidooxidans in the first 2 days compared to minimal medium the maximum cell density in the amd reached 2 1 108 cells ml on day 4 followed by a slight decrease the cell density in the amd system was greater at the later stage of arsenopyrite bio oxidation than that in the bsm assay generally the release of the electron donor fe2 and accumulation of toxic as are two main factors that affect the first positively and the latter negatively bacterial growth and fe oxidation during arsenopyrite bio oxidation high ast aq fig 1d and a formation of a passivation layer shown in fig 3a and b inhibited the dissolution of arsenopyrite which explains the decrease in the cell density particularly in the bsm assay after 2 days of bio oxidation the relatively low rates of fe2 oxidation by s thermosulfidooxidans in the first 2 days were ascribed to the inhibitory effects of the elevated concentrations of dissolved metals in amd assay and as released via arsenopyrite oxidative dissolution in both biotic assays while from day 2 6 the rate of fe oxidation was higher in amd fig 1c fig 1d f shows that ast aq and so4 2 aq gradually increased as the bio oxidation of arsenopyrite progressed an elevated ast aq was detected in the amd assay in the initial stage of the experiment indicating enhanced arsenopyrite dissolution due to a rapid attack of the fe3 present in amd on the mineral surface importantly in both amd and bsm the solubilized as occurred mainly as as iii fig 1d from day 2 ast aq and as iii aq in the amd assay were noticeably lower than those in bsm assay this was ascribed to the formation of as iii bearing precipitates e g tooeleite as shown in figs 4 and 7 of note an obvious decrease in the concentration of al iii was found at the initial stage during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in the amd assay fig 1e previous studies have reported that al iii can contribute to as removal via the formation of al iii fe iii hydroxides and al sulfoxyhydroxide e g basaluminite wang et al 2019 igarashi et al 2020 no significant changes were observed throughout the time course of the experiment in the concentrations of other elements in either of the two assays in the amd sterile control the orp value quickly dropped from 618 to 322 mv due to rapid fe3 reduction on contact with arsenopyrite eq 1 and then it marginally increased over time to 336 mv fig 2 a in the abiotic bsm assay orp increased slightly over time reaching a maximum of 328 mv on day 10 a value significantly lower than the value detected in the corresponding bio assay 536 mv the ph in both abiotic assays did not significantly change during chemical dissolution of arsenopyrite fig 2a soluble fe existed predominantly as fe2 in both systems fig 2b the as released from arsenopyrite in sterile amd water was mainly as iii while it occurred predominantly as as v in the sterile medium fig 2c in summary significantly lower arsenopyrite dissolution rates were observed in the abiotic systems fig 2 compared to the corresponding bio assays inoculated with s thermosulfidooxidans fig 1 3 2 elemental and mineralogical composition of arsenopyrite oxidation products to describe the surface structure of arsenopyrite residues and oxidation layers formed on the mineral surfaces and to analyze differences between solids from amd and bsm assays the leaching residues were investigated by sem eds figs 3 a and s2a show sem images of amorphous products that formed in large amounts within 2 days of bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in amd these products were composed predominantly of fe as s and o and attached to the surface of both arsenopyrite and bacterial cells in comparison the surface morphology of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residue collected from the bsm assay after 2 days fig 3b differed from that of the amd residue showing a fine and dense surface layer enriched in as s fe and o with a minor amount of k fig s2b meanwhile many bacterial cells were found attached to the mineral surfaces fig s3 after 10 days of bio oxidation the arsenopyrite completely dissolved in the amd biotic system and the typical structure corresponding to the mineral was not identified in the sem images but an amorphous precipitate that included bacterial cells occurred fig 3d in the bsm assay a well crystallized passivation layer comprising aggregated disk like microstructures with a diameter of 1 μm covered the mineral surface fig 3e and an elevated content of k besides fe s and o fig s4 implies that it was composed mainly of k jarosite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 an fe iii oxysulphoxyhydroxide known to incorporate as savage et al 2005 zhang et al 2020 the surface of the arsenopyrite in the bsm sterile control remained intact after 10 days fig 3c and only a low quantity of oxidation products was formed on the mineral surface in the amd control system fig 3f the xrd results fig 4 show that the phase composition of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residue from the amd system was more complex compared to the residue from bsm compared to the arsenopyrite residue collected from the bsm biotic system shown in fig 4b a greater amount of s0 and a lower quantity of crystalline jarosite were detected on the surface of the amd arsenopyrite residue after 2 days of arsenopyrite bio oxidation interestingly a significant amount of as iii bearing precipitate i e tooeleite was also detected fig 4a on the amd residue surface tooeleite has previously been identified as a material potentially suitable for as iii immobilization morin et al 2003 the formation of tooeleite eq 6 is affected primarily by the fe as ratio ph and so4 2 aq chai et al 2016 nishimura and robins 2008 the low solution ph fig 1a and elevated concentrations of fe3 affecting the fe as ratio fig 1c and so4 2 fig 1e in amd facilitated the enhanced accumulation of tooeleite during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in this study this also explains the lower ast aq and as iii aq detected in the amd system compared to those in bsm in fig 1d after 10 days of bio oxidation in amd the arsenopyrite almost disappeared and the solid phase comprised mainly tooeleite and s0 with minor amounts of jarosites goethite α feooh and biotite kfemg2 alsi3o10 oh 2 fig 4a in contrast the solids collected from bsm after 10 days fig 4b were composed mainly of jarosites which are considered the main components of passivation layers on sulfide surfaces in ore bioleaching larsson et al 1990 s0 and minor amounts of tooeleite and arsenopyrite no significant changes were detected in the arsenopyrite in the sterile controls fig 4c besides a greater amount of s0 detected in the amd residue compared to the bsm one 6 6 f e 3 4 h 3 as o 3 s o 4 2 8 h 2 o f e 6 as o 3 4 s o 4 oh 4 4 h 2 o 16 h the mla analysis results fig s5 table s2 show that in the amd biotic assay the content of tooeleite reached 72 02 after 10 days of arsenopyrite bio oxidation which was much higher than the tooeleite content in the bsm biotic assay 18 58 while the contents of jarosites 6 39 and arsenopyrite 2 14 in the amd assay were much lower than those in bsm 62 44 and 10 56 respectively 3 3 speciation transformations of as fe and s during arsenopyrite bio oxidation to identify as species in oxidation layers the arsenopyrite residues from amd and bsm assays were examined by xps at different reaction times the spectra of as3d 5 2 are shown in fig 5 and corresponding fitting parameters are summarized in table s3 the as species on the surface of arsenopyrite during bio oxidation in both amd and bsm were mainly as i s 41 1 ev as 0 41 8 ev as i o 43 5 ev as iii o 44 35 ev and as v o 45 25 ev in comparison to the original arsenopyrite fig 5i the intensities of as i s and as 0 peaks decreased and those of as iii o and as v o increased due to arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 5a and d and these trends gradually continued as the bio oxidation process progressed fig 5b c e f in the amd system fig 5a c the peak of as i s for arsenopyrite disappeared after 10 days and as iii o became a dominant as species in the oxidation layer reaching 43 9 fig 5c corresponding to the accumulation of tooeleite fig 3 in the bsm assay the percentage of as v o 46 6 was greater than that of as iii o 34 9 likely due to an increased formation of as v bearing minerals such as amorphous ferric arsenate and scorodite these findings are consistent with the results of xanes analysis described below fig 6 the as k edge xanes analysis was performed to further evaluate as speciation during arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 6 the xanes spectra of as bearing references are shown in fig 6a linear combination fitting lcf plots of xanes spectra for the arsenopyrite residues bio oxidized in amd and bsm for 10 days are shown in fig 6b dotted lines closely corresponding to the measured xanes spectra of the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residues solid lines based on the edge energies as iii 11 871 3 ev dominated in the bio oxidized residue obtained from the amd system while as v 11 875 ev was dominant in the bio oxidized arsenopyrite residue in the bsm assay the lcf results show that as in the arsenopyrite residue collected from the bsm assay after 10 days of bio oxidation comprised of 48 4 amorphous fa 21 3 scorodite 15 6 tooeleite 8 9 disodium hydrogen arsenate na2haso4 and 5 8 arsenopyrite fig 6c in contrast the composition of the bio oxidized residue from the amd system was 70 1 tooeleite 17 5 amorphous fa and 12 4 na3aso3 while no arsenopyrite and scorodite were detected fig 6d due to its high stability scorodite is considered a suitable material for the immobilization and long term storage of arsenate vega hernandez et al 2019 the as released from arsenopyrite at the early stage of bio oxidation was mainly as iii which quickly reacted with fe3 and so4 2 in amd to form tooeleite these results demonstrate that fe3 cannot efficiently promote the oxidation of as iii to as v in amd even at the high concentrations indicating that the fate of as released from arsenopyrite in amd significantly differs from that of as mobilized in the bsm assay to investigate s speciation in the solid residues after arsenopyrite bio oxidation the s k edge xanes analysis and lcf were performed fig 7 a comparison with the spectra of s bearing references fig 7a showed that while a decrease in the intensity of the peak for arsenopyrite 2471 8 ev occurred the intensity of the peaks for s0 2472 6 ev and so4 2 2482 8 ev increased gradually during arsenopyrite bio oxidation in both amd and bsm systems fig 7b the lcf results fig 7c d show that the s species in the arsenopyrite residue after 2 days of bio oxidation in amd were composed of 40 3 arsenopyrite 27 s0 14 1 jarosites 9 4 schwertmannite and 9 2 tooeleite compared to 57 5 arsenopyrite 21 7 s0 15 6 jarosites and 5 2 schwertmannite in the bsm residue after 10 days of bio oxidation the s species were tooeleite 37 8 s0 30 6 schwertmannite 16 7 and jarosites 14 9 in the solids from amd and 48 2 jarosites 24 3 s0 11 9 arsenopyrite and minor amounts of schwertmannite 9 and tooeleite 6 6 in the bsm residue these results demonstrate that arsenopyrite bio oxidation was enhanced in the amd water simultaneously an increased formation of schwertmannite a poorly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxy sulfate mineral with a tunnel structure and strong binding affinity for metal loid s could facilitate partial immobilization of as under acidic conditions through adsorption or co precipitation reactions as described by burton et al 2009 a mechanism of arsenopyrite bio oxidation in amd is proposed fig 8 based on the above results fe3 present in amd attacks the surface of arsenopyrite the fe2 generated via fe3 reduction and arsenopyrite dissolution serves as an electron donor to chemolithotrophic bacteria and the extracellular polymeric substances epss that coat bacterial cells can serve as nucleation sites for precipitation of fe or as bearing products wang et al 2020 bond et al 2000 dissolution of arsenopyrite and efficient bio oxidation of fe2 and s result in elevated as iii aq fe3 aq and so4 2 in amd promoting the formation of amorphous as iii fe iii sulfate oxy hydroxide minerals e g tooeleite and schwertmannite the elevated formation of the above secondary minerals facilitate as immobilization particularly that of as iii via co precipitation and or adsorption egal et al 2009 duquesne et al 2003 in comparison to amd a greater proportion of as released through bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in the bsm remains in solution mainly as as iii importantly the formation of a dense passivation layer composed mainly of jarosites s0 amorphous fa and scorodite on the surface of arsenopyrite in the bsm can limit the attack of fe3 on the mineral surface and mitigate the release of fe2 that would support the growth of chemolithotrophs thus inhibiting the dissolution of arsenopyrite 3 4 evaluation of rm for in situ as immobilization 3 4 1 effects of rm on amd enriched with as mobilized via arsenopyrite bio oxidation as shown above elevated concentration of dissolved as predominantly as as iii were detected in amd due to arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 1c d which together with the low ph of amd 2 0 fig 1a presents a serious risk for the environment and human health to investigate the potential of rm to serve as an as adsorbent small amounts 4 and 8 g l of alkaline rm were added to the amd and bsm assays after 10 days of arsenopyrite bio oxidation fig 9 a illustrates that the additions of rm to the amd biotic systems resulted in a significant orp decrease and ph increase caused mainly by neutralization reactions and adsorption of fe3 onto solid surfaces four days after the addition of 4 and 8 g l rm i e on day 14 ph in the assays increased from 1 87 to 2 43 and 3 52 respectively and orp decreased from 578 mv to 445 and 315 mv respectively similar trends were observed in the bsm assay fig 9c fig 9b shows that the concentration of dissolved as significantly decreased in the amd systems four days after rm additions and the murky yellow color of both solutions with 4 and 8 g l rm cleared up after standing for 24 h interestingly the amount of fe precipitated similarly to as correlated with the amount of rm added fig 9b indicating that fe3 may play an important role in the as immobilization process meanwhile partial dissolution of rm caused by h and fe3 attack zhang et al 2022 resulted in the release of low amounts of al si ca and na into solution fig 9b the as iii aq decreased from 1 92 g l to 0 68 and 0 16 g l in the amd assays with 4 and 8 g l rm respectively fig 9b while in the bsm assay with 8 g l rm the as iii aq remained high 1 43 g l after 4 days of reaction fig 9d a slight increase in so4 2 in both amd and bsm was attributed to bio oxidation of s0 and or dissolution of jarosites as discussed below and shown in fig 14 in the abiotic assays an increase in ph and decrease in orp values occurred after 4 and 8 g l rm were added and no visible decrease in as aq and fe aq was observed fig s6 3 4 2 effects of rm on solid products of arsenopyrite bio oxidation the sem results show the morphology of the residue collected from the amd assay four days after the addition of 4 g l rm fig 10 a and b the morphology comprising structures of aggregated nano sized crystallites was similar to that of the arsenopyrite residue before rm addition shown in fig 3d but a low amount of gypsum caso4 2h2o was present fig 10a the predominance of as fe s and o fig 10c implies that the residue after rm addition was composed mainly of tooeleite which was also indicated by xrd results shown in fig 11 a when 8 g l rm was added to the amd bio oxidation assays more gypsum was formed and the solid precipitates together with bacterial cells accumulated as nanoscale spheroids diameter 100 300 nm fig 10d and e in contrast the main solid structures in the bsm after the addition of 8 g l rm were residual rm and undissolved arsenopyrite covered with a fine passivation layer fig s7 the xrd results fig 11 indicate that the residue collected from the amd system four days after the addition of 4 g l rm was composed of amorphous tooeleite s0 and gypsum with minor amounts of other phases such as ettringite ca6al2 so4 3 oh 12 26h2o jarosites and biotite kfemg2 alsi3o10 oh 2 fig 11a additionally the two broad peaks in the xrd pattern of the precipitate indicate that the analyzed solids contained substances with poor crystallinity interestingly a small amount of pharmacosiderite kfe4 aso4 3 oh 4 6 7h2o was detected in the assay with 4 g l rm pharmacosiderite has a similar composition to scorodite and its formation has been linked to as and fe redox reactions associated with microbial activity koo et al 2022 compared to the residue from the amd system with 4 g l rm the xrd pattern of the solid residue collected from the amd assay with 8 g l rm showed more prominent gypsum peaks while jarosite peaks became negligible fig 11b small amounts of muscovite kal2si3alo10 oh 2 and hematite fe2o3 were also detected in the residue the residue collected from bsm with 8 g l rm was composed of gypsum and s0 with minor amounts of tooeleite and arsenopyrite the intensity of the jarosite peaks decreased after the addition of rm fig s8 additionally the higher ph ph 4 fig 9c and lower fe3 aq fig 9d in the bsm assay compared to amd resulted in a greater abundance of rm components e g muscovite hematite kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 perovskite catio3 and diaspore β alo oh the results of the tem analysis fig 12 show that the surface of the residue from the amd assay before rm addition comprised an amorphous layer among needle like microstructures fig 12a four days after 8 g l rm were added the amorphous layer covering cell surfaces became denser and thicker with elevated distributions of as al si and o fig 12d compared to the element distribution before rm was added fig 12c the corresponding eds results fig s9 table s4 indicate that the oxidation layer formed on the cell surfaces before rm was added was comprised mainly of tooeleite in addition the decrease in the fe as ratio from 1 57 to 1 46 implies that dissolution recrystallization processes likely occurred after rm was added the dissolution and transformation of rm in fe3 rich amd resulted in a higher proportion of as immobilized in the precipitate the decrease in the content of s observed was likely primarily due to partial dissolution of tooeleite and or jarosites caused by the addition of alkaline rm and partially due to weak ion exchange reactions occurring between so4 2 and as iii during the as immobilization process fig s10 the xps analysis detected higher contents of o and si on the cell surfaces indicating a formation of a sio2 gel fig s11 table s5 which has been postulated favorable for the stabilization of as bearing precipitates adelman et al 2015 3 4 3 evaluation of as immobilization mechanism the above results indicate that rm greatly promoted the immobilization of dissolved as iii released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation based on the much lower as iii aq detected in amd compared to bsm there are two possible mechanisms for as iii immobilization i direct adsorption or co precipitation of as iii and ii initial oxidation of as iii to as v and subsequent formation of as v bearing precipitates to determine the mechanism the surface properties and the speciation of as and s of the precipitates after as iii immobilization were investigated using ft ir and as s k edge xanes the ft ir spectra of all solid samples after rm additions shown in fig s12 exhibited the bands ascribed to o h stretching 3000 3600 cm 1 and h o h bending 1627 cm 1 vibrations of adsorbed water the c o c band 1400 1500 cm 1 corresponding to calcite was not detected in the spectrum of the solid sample collected from the amd assay with 4 g l rm due to rm complete dissolution zhang et al 2022 as opposed to partial rm dissolution in assays with 8 g l rm an increase in the intensity of bands ascribed to ν 1 as o 3 3 770 cm 1 and ν 3 as o 3 3 the shoulder at 694 cm 1 indicate that more as iii was adsorbed onto the surface of the amd precipitate after a 8 g l rm addition compared to the bsm precipitate three so4 2 bands at 1 112 985 and 603 cm 1 corresponding to ν 3 so4 outer sphere bound ν 1 so4 and structural ν 4 so4 in tooeleite respectively chai et al 2016 were detected in all precipitates and the intensities of these peaks in the solids collected from the amd assays with rm were higher than in the precipitates from the bsm assay with rm the as k edge xanes spectra fig 13 a show that the intensity of the peak for as iii 11 871 3 ev increased significantly in the precipitates from the amd assays after rm additions while the peak for as v 11 875 ev remained almost unchanged a similar trend was observed in the precipitates from the bsm assay the lcf results fig 13b and c indicate that the as species in the precipitate obtained from the bsm assay with 8 g l rm were composed of 33 6 amorphous fa 28 8 tooeleite 23 2 na3aso3 and 14 4 scorodite in the solids from the amd assays tooeleite dominated with 70 4 and 73 1 in the assays with 4 and 8 g l rm respectively followed by na3aso3 18 8 and 20 6 respectively and 10 amorphous fa compared to the lcf results of the precipitates before rm additions the proportion of the as v bearing component i e amorphous fa decreased in the precipitates from both amd assays with 4 and 8 g l rm fig 13c based on the above results it can be concluded that no significant as oxidation occurred during rm dissolution and as iii immobilization the results of s k edge xanes show that compared to the spectrum of the residue from the bsm assay with 8 g l rm significantly lower intensities of the peak for s0 2472 6 ev and higher intensities of the peak for so4 2 2482 8 ev were observed in the spectra of the residues obtained from amd assays with both rm additions fig 14 a the lcf results fig 14b and table s6 show that the content of jarosites decreased in all assays after rm additions likely due to the increase in ph above the range within which jarosites are stable approx 1 2 5 and their subsequent transformation into schwertmannite bigham et al 1996 the dissolution of aluminosilicates e g kaolinite and katoite ca3al2 sio4 oh 8 following eqs 7 and 8 respectively and ca bearing phases e g calcite eq 9 releases al3 and ca2 into solution these cations can react with so4 2 generated via s bio oxidation forming insoluble crystalline al2 so4 3 and caso4 eqs 10 and 11 respectively as shown in table s6 the s compounds in the precipitate collected from the amd assay four days after the addition of 4 g l rm comprised 35 6 tooeleite 27 4 caso4 and 12 8 s0 with minor amounts of schwertmannite 9 2 al2 so4 3 8 9 and jarosites 6 1 the contents of s0 and jarosites decreased to 6 3 and 0 respectively when a higher amount of rm 8 g l was added while the contents of schwertmannite tooeleite and caso4 increased slightly table s6 fig s13 shows that rm alone promotes s0 oxidation only marginally these results demonstrate that rm promotes oxidation of s0 and transformations of the secondary sulfate minerals 7 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 6 h 2 a l 3 2 h 4 si o 4 h 2 o 8 c a 3 a l 2 si o 4 oh 8 12 h 3 c a 2 2 a l 3 h 4 si o 4 8 h 2 o 9 cac o 3 2 h c a 2 h 2 o c o 2 10 2 a l 3 3 s o 4 2 a l 2 s o 4 3 11 c a 2 s o 4 2 cas o 4 it can be concluded that rm can promote immobilization of as iii released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation under acidic conditions especially in amd through the regulation of fe3 aq ph and orp and transformations of secondary products no detectable oxidation of as iii to as v was observed during the immobilization process indicating that the compounds in rm do not mediate as oxidation we speculate that there are three ways by which rm promotes as iii immobilization 1 the increase in solution ph caused by rm dissolution leads to a reduced stability of secondary sulfate minerals e g jarosites and schwertmannite and the unstable so4 2 groups contribute to as iii immobilization via ligand exchange supported by figs 9 12 and table s4 2 rm provides nucleation sites for fe3 precipitation thus promoting co precipitation of as iii as as iii fe iii oxyhydroxides such as tooeleite shown in figs 13 and 14 mamtaz and bache 2001 meng et al 2001 3 the positively charged surface of rm that results from extensive fe3 and h adsorption promotes the adsorption of as iii 4 conclusions this study investigated the release and transport of as during bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in natural amd and compared the processes with those in bsm besides the effects of an industrial solid waste i e rm on the immobilization of as iii solubilized via arsenopyrite bio oxidation were studied the main findings are summarized below 1 the rate of bio oxidation of arsenopyrite in amd was higher than that in bsm due to high concentrations of fe3 and so4 2 in amd that enhanced arsenopyrite dissolution and as immobilization only 2 14 of arsenopyrite remained in the solid phase in the amd biotic assay after 10 days of bio oxidation which was much less than in the bsm assay 10 56 2 the attack of fe3 on arsenopyrite present in amd generated elevated amounts of fe2 which could serve as an electron donor promoting the growth of s thermosulfidooxidans meanwhile the bacterial cells served as nucleation sites for the precipitation of minerals in contrast to jarosites dominating in bsm solids tooeleite was the main secondary product in amd residues 3 the as released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation existed in solution as as iii importantly ast aq detected in amd was significantly lower than in bsm this was ascribed to the higher fe iii as iii ratio and so4 2 in amd favoring the formation of tooeleite and other secondary minerals such as schwertmannite which could significantly contribute to as immobilization 4 rm can effectively promote in situ immobilization of as iii released via arsenopyrite bio oxidation the as iii aq in the amd assay decreased from 1 92 to 0 16 g l after 4 days of reaction which was a much lower value than that detected in bsm 1 43 g l the mechanism of as iii immobilization using alkaline rm includes a ligand exchange with so4 2 in sulfate minerals affected by elevated ph co precipitation with fe iii on the rm surface and direct adsorption of as iii to the rm surface positively charged after fe3 adsorption no oxidation of as iii to as v was detected during as immobilization the results of this work provide a better understanding of the processes involved in bio oxidation of arsenopyrite on contact with amd and the fate of the immobilized as the findings may contribute to the development of cost effective technologies for the immobilization of as in mine wastes and mine impacted environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15559,dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitous in natural waters is known to inhibit the degradation of micropollutants in the advanced oxidation processes such as the uv peroxydisulfate process however the quantitative understanding of the inhibitory pathways is missing in this study guanosine aniline and catechol belonging to amines purines and phenols were first investigated due to their resistance to uv irradiation at 254 nm and similar reactivity with so4 and ho respectively the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 suwannee river nom srnom inhibited their degradation rates by 72 9 54 5 and 32 4 respectively despite their similar degradation rates in the absence of srnom the results highlight the importance of reverse reduction of oxidation intermediates to the parent compound by antioxidant moieties in srnom besides the inner filtering and radical scavenging effects the three inhibitory pathways were quantified for 34 common micropollutants in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom inner filtering effect was found to contribute less than 2 8 of the inhibitory percentages ip radical scavenging effects contribute between 10 7 and 38 9 and compounds having lower reactivity with so4 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 tended to be inhibited more strongly the ip of reverse reduction effects of srnom varied significantly from none up to 70 8 it was linearly related with a micropollutant s reduction

pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals are frequently detected in natural waters worldwide benotti et al 2009 wilkinson et al 2017 they usually resist conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation and filtration due to their relatively high polarity and biostability alexander et al 2012 ternes et al 2002 advanced oxidation processes aops have increasingly been applied in water treatment due to their effective removal of such micropollutants cheng et al 2019 2018 chuang and shi 2022 li et al 2020 among the aops sulfate

environments at concentrations of mgc l 1 and is often reported to inhibit the removal of micropollutants in aops wang et al 2020 xie et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 for example 1 0 mgc l 1 of suwannee river fulvic acid was found to suppressed the degradation of indomethacin by 38 5 in a uv peroxydisulfate pds process li et al 2018 the inhibition is mainly due to the inner filtering effects and scavenging effects of dom fig 1 dom has chromophores that can compete with oxidants like pds and micropollutants to absorb photons that inhibits direct photodegradation of micropollutants and also slows the generation rate of radicals luo et al 2019 xie et al 2015 as a scavenger dom significantly increases the rate at which radicals are consumed xie et al 2015 zhu et al 2021 the second order reaction rate constant of dom with ho is reported to be in the range of 1 21 6 50 108 mc 1 s 1 and with so4 0 64 3 68 107 mc 1 s 1 lei et al 2022 2021 westerhoff et al 2007 whereas the second order reaction rate constants between micropollutants and ho and so4 were in the range of 0 15 56 0 109 mc 1 s 1 and 0 001 9 2 109 mc 1 s 1 respectively xiao et al 2015 wols and hofman caris 2012 thus the presence of dom results in lower radical concentrations besides these two well known effects recent studies have found an additional pathway through which dom inhibits micropollutant degradation canonica and schonenberger 2019 cheng et al 2022 ji et al 2018 yang et al 2022 dom can reduce the reaction intermediates of micropollutants e g tc or tc h back to their parent compounds eq 1 and fig 1 1 t c tc h dom tc do m ox in the uv pds system the degradation of adenine was inhibited by 88 in the presence of 1 0 mgc l 1 of dom about half of the inhibition was attributed to reverse reduction process of adenine intermediates adn h cheng et al 2022 the quenching rate constants of adn h by dom were reported to be in the range of 0 39 1 18 107 mc 1 s 1 depending on the antioxidant properties of the dom cheng et al 2022 a previous study reported that the quenching rate constant of 4 dimethylamino benzonitrile radical cation by dom was in the range of 7 0 11 7 108 mc 1 s 1 leresche et al 2020 and tryptophan radical cation was also reported to be quenched by suwannee river fulvic acid with a rate constant of 1 3 108 mc 1 s 1 janssen et al 2014 such an inhibitory effect of quenching intermediate radicals is ascribed to antioxidant moieties e g phenolic components in dom cheng et al 2022 the phenolic components generally have reduction potentials of 0 4 0 8 v vs she whereas the reduction potentials of micropollutants containing aniline and purine groups are between 0 8 and 1 6 v vs she faraggi et al 1996 jonsson et al 1994 jovanovic and simic 1986 spataru et al 2002 redox

anilines and sulfonamides some phenols e g acetaminophen and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and some pharmaceuticals e g trimethoprim and propranolol have been reported in previous studies canonica and laubscher 2008 canonica and schonenberger 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2021 the extent of the inhibition depends on the difference in reduction potential between a micropollutant and the antioxidant phenolic moieties in the dom and also on the ph canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2021 nevertheless understanding of the inhibitory effects of dom is limited especially of the reverse reduction pathways with organic radicals micropollutants generally have complicated and diverse structures what kinds of micropollutants intermediates can be reduced back by dom is still not very clear meanwhile due to the multiple inhibition pathways involved i e inner filtering radical scavenging and reverse reduction quantitative understanding of the inhibition in aops is still insufficient this study was designed to examine quantitatively the inhibitory effects of dom on micropollutant degradation in uv pds treatment and to associate them with the micropollutant s properties a total of 34 target compounds tcs belonging to amines purines and phenols were chosen due to their prevalent structures in micropollutants and their wide range of reduction potentials from 0 46 to 1 50 v vs she table s1 in the supplementary material three representative tcs aniline guanosine and catechol were investigated first to explore the dependence of inhibition on suwannee river natural organic matter srnom concentration inhibitory due to inner filtering radical scavenging and the reverse pathway were then quantitively examined separately finally the degradation kinetics of the 34 tcs in uv pds treatment with and without srnom present were documented the correlation between tc s reduction potential and reverse pathway inhibition was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals a total

a quartz glass cover under a low pressure uv lamp with a quasi collimated 253 7 nm beam fig s1 the uv photon flux entering the solution was determined to be 2 06 10 7 es l 1 s 1 by using iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2003 the effective light path length l was 2 08 cm to initiate the reaction 290 µm pds was dosed to an 80 ml solution containing 1 0 µm target compound and srnom 0 4 0 mgc l 1 as required buffered at ph 7 0 using 5 0 mm phosphate buffer and the mixture was simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were extracted at pre set time intervals and immediately quenched with sodium sulfite the residual target compound concentration was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the control experiments were conducted under uv irradiation alone without pds and with pds alone in the dark using the same conditions 2 3 determination of the reaction rate constants of so4 and ho with the target compounds the second order reaction rate constants of so4 and ho

the transient spectra of the guanosine intermediate g h produced by reacting guanosine with so4 after deprotonation are well documented candeias and steenken 1989 morozova et al 2007 thapa et al 2019 the decay kinetics of g h in the presence of the srnom was monitored at 600 nm to avoid interference from the spectra of co existing intermediates the first order decay rate constant of g h increased with increasing srnom concentration and the slopes represented the second order quenching rate constant of g h by srnom the details are shown in text s3 2 5 analytical methods the tc concentrations were detected using a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc system equipped with a syncronis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm a diode array detector and a fluorescence detector the analytical details for each tc are listed in table s3 the dissolved organic carbon in the srnom was quantified using a shimadzu toc vcph total organic carbon analyzer 2 6 kinetic modelling of the inhibitory effects of dom to quantitatively examine the inhibitory effects of srnom the inhibition percentage ip was defined as the decreasing in k obs in the presence of srnom at a given concentration k obs srnom as a proportion of k obs with no srnom present k obs srnom 0 eq 5 5 ip k obs srnom 0 k obs srnom k obs srnom 0 the inhibition involves the several processes shown in fig 1 the total ip can be described as in eq 6 6 ip i p uv i p so 4 i p h o i p q ipuv accounts for the inhibitory effects of srnom s competition with tcs for photons which was calculated based on eq 7 ipso4 and ipho accounts for the inhibitory effects of srnom on the decreases in so4 and ho concentrations respectively srnom can decrease radicals concentrations by inhibiting pds photolysis and enhancing radicals consumption lee et al 2020 ipso4 and ipho were calculated using eqs 8 and 9 ipq accounts for the inhibitory effects of srnom s reverting tc s intermediates back to the parent compound cheng et al 2022 ipq was calculated using

with a global model fit of measured ip values at different srnom concentrations with originpro v 9 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the inhibitory effects of srnom on the degradation kinetics of three representative tcs guanosine aniline and catechol were used as a representative purine aniline and phenol respectively they do not degrade under either uv irradiation alone or pds treatment alone fig s2 those three tcs also have comparable second order reaction rate constants with so4 4 10 109 m 1 s 1 for guanosine 4 39 109 m 1 s 1 for aniline and 5 14 109 m 1 s 1 for catechol at ph 7 0 and also with ho 8 00 109 m 1 s 1 for guanosine 1 70 1010 m 1 s 1 for aniline and 1 10 1010 m 1 s 1 for catechol at ph 7 0 luo et al 2017 nist 2022 steenken 1989 their degradation kinetics in the uv pds process with and without 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom are presented in fig 2 in the absence of srnom the observed first order degradation rate constants k obs were close for the three tcs 5 09 0 20 10 3 s 1 for guanosine 5 25 0 31 10 3 s 1 for analine and 5 65 0 16 10 3 s 1 for catechol in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom the k obs values for the three tcs decreased interestingly the inhibitory effects of srnom on the degradation of the three tcs exhibit distinct phenomena the degradation rate constants were 1 38 0 16 10 3 s 1 for guanosine 2 39 0 11 10 3 s 1 for aniline and 3 82 0 06 10 3 s 1 for catechol which decreased by 72 9 54 5 and 32 4 respectively compared to those without srnom present fig 2a c the difference in the inhibitory effects was also evident at other srnom concentrations fig 2d as the srnom concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mgc l 1 the inhibition increased from 11 2 to 89 1 for guanosine from 17 0 to 75 8 for aniline and from 11 5 to 44 4 for catechol at even higher srnom concentration i e 4 0 mgc l 1 the difference in inhibition was not so great since the three tcs have similar second order reaction rate constants with so4 and ho and their inner filtering and radical scavenging by srnom are also similar table s4 the decreases in the k obs values should also be close if there is no additional inhibitory pathway the results in fig 2 clearly indicate that srnom plays an additional role in leading to the difference in k obs values 3 2 the quantitative examination of the inhibitory effects of srnom in the absence of srnom the decay rate constants k cal srnom 0 for guanosine aniline and catechol calculated using eq 11 are close to the k obs srnom 0 values fig s3 so4 oxidation contributed to over 90 of the degradation 11 k cal srnom 0 k so 4 tc so 4

the global model fit and sensitivity analysis fig s4 and table s5 the contribution of each inhibition pathway to the three tcs degradation is presented in fig 3 ipuv was zero for guanosine aniline and catechol as they suffer no uv photolysis at 254 nm the ipso4 and ipho values increased with increasing srnom concentration due to increasing inner filtering and radical scavenging effects of the srnom the ipso4 values were close for the three tcs as they have similar reactivity with so4 and the systems had similar so4 ss for example in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom the ipso4 of guanosine aniline and catechol were 12 9 12 5 and 12 1 respectively ipho values were also similar at about 5 0 in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom the ipq values however were different ipq was higher for guanosine and aniline than for catechol at a given srnom concentration fig 3 for example in the presence of 1 0 mgc l 1 of srnom the ipq of guanosine and aniline were 52 3 and 43 4 respectively but that of catechol was 12 0 the ipq values varied with increasing srnom concentration as the srnom concentration increased from about 0 1 to 1 0 mgc l 1 the ipq of guanosine increased greatly fig s5 reflecting a sharp decrease in the overall guanosine degradation fig 2d ipq then decreased at srnom concentrations above about 1 0 mgc l 1 due to reduced concentration of guanosine or aniline radicals in the system that was due to enhanced scavenging by the srnom eq 10 cheng et al 2022 the degradation rate in the presence of 1 0 mgc l 1 of srnom was used to compare the inhibition pathways guanosine s ipq 52 3 was much higher than the ipso4 23 2 and ipho 7 2 values fig 3a similarly the ipq of aniline 43 4 was higher than those of ipso4 22 4 and ipho 7 1 fig 3b catechol however showed the opposite relationship its ipq was 12 0 lower than ipso4 21 9 fig 3c clearly the reverse pathway is highly dependent on the properties of the particular micropollutant wenk s group has shown wenk et al 2021 that the inhibition in a triplet sensitized reaction system depends on the difference in reduction potential δered between the model antioxidant couple phenoxyl phenol in their work and the micropollutant couple their anilinyl aniline in this study guanosine has a reduction potential of 1 29 v vs she steenken and jovanovic 1997 which was higher than that of aniline 1 02 v vs she and catechol 0 74 v vs she jonsson et al 1994 slobodan et al 1991 table s1 their δered values with phenolic antioxidant follow the order of guanosine aniline catechol which is consistent with the ipq values 3 3 the quenching reaction rate constants of tc s intermediates by srnom laser flash photolysis experiments were performed to evaluate the reverse pathway by srnom here we chose guanosine g as

close to the quenching rate constant of g h the adenine radical has a reduction potential of 1 32 v vs she which is also close to the 1 29 v of g h in order to further understand the reverse pathway of srnom additional 31 tcs having a wide range of reduction potential were chosen with results discussed below 3 4 the inhibitory effects of srnom on the degradation kinetics of 34 tcs 3 4 1 the degradation kinetics of 34 tcs fourteen purines 9 amines and 11 phenols with reduction potentials between 0 46 and 1 50 v vs she table s1 were subjected to uv pds treatment fig 4 shows the observed first order rate constants of tcs in the absence k obs srnom 0 and the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 of srnom k obs srnom during uv pds treatment in the absence of srnom almost all of the compounds except purine and allopurinol had k obs srnom 0 values larger than 2 0 10 3 s 1 the first order decay rate constants of the purine compounds varied from 5 25 10 4 purine to 1 23 10 2 s 1 caffeine among the amine compounds k obs srnom 0 ranged from 2 73 10 3 mefenamic acid to 1 53 10 2 s 1 atenolol with an average of 8 34 10 3 s 1 atenolol and metoprolol exhibited the highest k obs srnom 0 values 1 45 10 2 s 1 because they react strongly with so4 1010 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2013 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 among the phenols resorcinol and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol had the highest k obs srnom 0 of 1 03 10 2 and 9 57 10 3 s 1 respectively the other tcs first order rate constants fell within a relatively narrow range of 2 45 5 64 10 3 s 1 the differences in their k obs srnom 0 values were due primarily to their different reactivity toward so4 table s1 in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 of srnom the k obs srnom values ranged from 3 42 10 4 to 1 13 10 2 s 1 with reduction of between 19 2 and 88 9 in the k obs srnom values observed compared to those in the absence of srnom fig 4 the ip values of the purines exceeded 47 except for xanthine 35 1 and purine 34 9 the k obs srnom of 9 methyladenine was reduced the most with an ip value of 88 9 the ip values of the amines varied over a wide range from 23 4 metoprolol to 76 4 trimethoprim the range for the phenols was much narrower from 19 2 to 38 1 except for 4 nitrophenol 59 6 the average ip values were purines 58 2 anilines 47 3 phenolics 32 9 following eqs 7 9 ipuv ipso4 and ipho were obtained ipq was calculated by subtracting ipuv ipso4 and ipho from ip eq 13 the inhibitory effects from diverse pathways were discussed separately in section 3 4 2 13 i p q ip i p uv i p so 4 i p h o 3 4 2 the quantitative examination of the three inhibitory pathways of srnom ipuv as mentioned earlier ipuv quantifies the decrease in direct photolysis as srnom competes with tc to absorb photons most of the tcs studied have a relatively low direct photodegradation rate 1 23 10 3 s 1 srnom at 0 5 mgc l 1 has low uv254 absorbance the ipuv values were less than 2 8 triclosan showed the highest direct photolysis rate constant of 1 23 0 10 10 3 s 1 the presence of srnom reduced it to 1 06 0 15 10 3 s 1 corresponding to an ipuv value of 2 8 it should be noted that the direct photolysis rate of 4 chloroaniline 2 92 0 02 10 3 s 1 in the presence of srnom was slightly higher than that without srnom 2 80 0 04 10 3 s 1 fig s7 that may be due to the production of excited triplet states of srnom and or other reactive oxygen species upon uv irradiation lester et al 2013 ipso4 and ipho srnom at 0 5 mgc l 1 decreased the rate of so4 formation by about 4 6 eq s16 as the quenching rate constant between srnom and so4 is reported to be 1 97 107 mc 1 s 1 lei et al 2022 the calculated so4 ss decreased by 9 2 22 8 eq s16 as a result the ipso4 values fell with in the narrow range of 7 1 20 0 fig 5 as fig s8a shows ipso4 decreased slightly with increasing kso4 tc values for example the kso4 tc of atenolol and allopurinol were 1 30 1010 m 1 s 1 and 3 88 108 m 1 s 1 respectively resulting in ipso4 values of 8 9 and 15 4 respectively the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 of srnom reduced ho ss by 44 7 78 9 due to the high reactivity between srnom and ho k 3 00 108 mc 1 s 1 xie et al 2015 the ipho values varied from 1 7 to 23 4 fig s8b shows that for tc with a low kso4 tc 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 ipho increased with decreasing kso4 tc this was due to the greater contribution of ho to these tcs degradation for example the kso4 tc of hypoxanthine was 9 90 108 m 1 s 1 and the ipho value was 18 0 for comparison the ipho value was 4 1 for triclosan kso4 tc 3 88 109 m 1 s 1 let ipradical represent the sum of tc s ipso4 and ipho values ipradical varied from 10 7 to 38 9 in these experiments for tcs with kso4 tc 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 the ipradical values varied little a range of 10 7 18 3 for tcs with kso4 tc less than that ipradical varied from 10 8 to 38 9 and was negatively correlated with kso4 tc fig s8c ipq the values of ipq differed significantly among the tcs tested it ranged from 0 for hydroquinone to 70 8 for 9 methyladenine among the three categories of tcs tested the average ipq values for the purines 33 9 and amines 32 9 were higher than that of the phenols 13 9 but the ipq values also showed significant variation within a tc category fig s9 the ipq values ranged from 5 1 to 70 8 for the purines from 11 4 to 61 8 for the anilines and from 0 to 30 7 for the phenols to discover the inherent reasons for the discrepancy in different tcs the reduction potential of tcs were collected table s1 and correlated with the ipq values as shown in fig 6 the ipq values correlated well with the tcs reduction potentials r2 0 86 p 0 01 tcs with a reduction potentials greater than 1 2 v vs she e g sulfamethoxazole of 1 20 v 4 aminobenzonitrile of 1 32 v theophylline of 1 24 v guanosine of 1 29 v adenosine of 1 42 v had ipq values over 40 tcs with a reduction potential of 1 0 v vs she mainly phenolic compounds had ipq values less than 15 the antioxidant moieties in dom mostly phenolics have been reported to play an important role in reducing tc tc h canonica and schonenberger 2019 cheng et al 2022 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 as tc or tc h of the purines and anilines generally had reduction potentials above about 1 0 v vs she they could be reduced by phenolic compounds in the srnom whose reduction potential was 0 8 v vs she slobodan et al 1991 wardman 1989 for phenolic tcs the reverse pathway was less significant however the polyphenolic or phenolic moieties with strong electron donating capacity in srnom could still exhibit strong reducing capacity towards phenolic tcs intermediates with relatively high reduction potential as is the case of 4 nitrophenol 1 23 v vs she ipq 30 7 canonica and laubscher 2008 lian et al 2021 as is shown in fig 5 the ipq values of the amines and purines were generally higher than their ipso4 and ipho values many micropollutants have purine and or amine functional groups e g antipyretic analgesics such as acetaminophen and diclofenac β blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol xanthines such as caffeine and xanthine and sulfonamides like sulfamethoxazoles and sulfanilamides lei et al 2019 the degradation of such compounds with high reduction potentials may be inhibited greatly by reverse pathways for example srnom at only 0 5 mgc l 1 decreased sulfamethoxazole s degradation by 44 2 considering only inner filtering and radical scavenging effects of dom may overestimate the degradation rates of micropollutants in uv pds treatment as such pretreatment processes such as activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration to reduce the dom concentration and peroxidation processes such as permanganate preoxidation to transform dom s antioxidant moieties can reduce the inhibitory effects of dom in so4 aops it should be noted that the behavior of tcs in so4 mediated processes may also give some hints in other one electron oxidizing radical mediated process such as carbonate radical co3 and dichlorine radical anions cl2 carena et al 2021 lei et al 2019 lian et al 2021 some recent studies have also reported that dom can inhibit the degradation rate of cyanotoxin aniline and sulfadiazine by reducing their oxidized intermediates produced by co3 carena et al 2021 hao et al 2020 lian et al 2021 further studies are suggested to improve the control of aops in real water applications 4 conclusions the inhibitory effects of srnom on tcs degradation in uv pds treatment include inner filtering radical scavenging and reverse reduction effects were examined by using steady state photochemical experiments laser transient spectroscopy and kinetic modelling in this work the calculation of the inhibition percentages via different pathways have indicated the following aspects 1 most of the micropollutants tested have relatively low direct photodegradation rate and inner filtering effect was 2 8 in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom 2 the radical scavenging effects of srnom varied from 10 7 to 38 9 for tcs with high kso4 tc e g 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 the inhibitory percentages varied little in the range of 10 7 18 3 for tcs with low kso4 tc e g 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 the inhibitory percentages varied from 10 8 to 38 9 and negatively correlated with kso4 tc 3 the reverse reduction effects of srnom varied significantly among the 34 tcs tested with the inhibition ranging from none to 70 8 it was positively correlated with a micropollutants s reduction potential degradation of purines and anilines with a reduction potential 1 2 v vs she was inhibited by over 40 via this pathway 4 inner filtering effect and radical scavenging effect increase continuously with the concentration of srnom however inhibition attributable to reverse reduction increases as srnom concentrations increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mgc l 1 and then decreases at srnom concentrations beyond 1 0 mgc l 1 reverse reduction is often more important than the sum of inner filtering and radical scavenging at low srnom concentrations supporting information the supporting

15559,dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitous in natural waters is known to inhibit the degradation of micropollutants in the advanced oxidation processes such as the uv peroxydisulfate process however the quantitative understanding of the inhibitory pathways is missing in this study guanosine aniline and catechol belonging to amines purines and phenols were first investigated due to their resistance to uv irradiation at 254 nm and similar reactivity with so4 and ho respectively the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 suwannee river nom srnom inhibited their degradation rates by 72 9 54 5 and 32 4 respectively despite their similar degradation rates in the absence of srnom the results highlight the importance of reverse reduction of oxidation intermediates to the parent compound by antioxidant moieties in srnom besides the inner filtering and radical scavenging effects the three inhibitory pathways were quantified for 34 common micropollutants in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom inner filtering effect was found to contribute less than 2 8 of the inhibitory percentages ip radical scavenging effects contribute between 10 7 and 38 9 and compounds having lower reactivity with so4 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 tended to be inhibited more strongly the ip of reverse reduction effects of srnom varied significantly from none up to 70 8 it was linearly related with a micropollutant s reduction

pharmaceuticals and personal care products and endocrine disrupting chemicals are frequently detected in natural waters worldwide benotti et al 2009 wilkinson et al 2017 they usually resist conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation and filtration due to their relatively high polarity and biostability alexander et al 2012 ternes et al 2002 advanced oxidation processes aops have increasingly been applied in water treatment due to their effective removal of such micropollutants cheng et al 2019 2018 chuang and shi 2022 li et al 2020 among the aops sulfate

environments at concentrations of mgc l 1 and is often reported to inhibit the removal of micropollutants in aops wang et al 2020 xie et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 for example 1 0 mgc l 1 of suwannee river fulvic acid was found to suppressed the degradation of indomethacin by 38 5 in a uv peroxydisulfate pds process li et al 2018 the inhibition is mainly due to the inner filtering effects and scavenging effects of dom fig 1 dom has chromophores that can compete with oxidants like pds and micropollutants to absorb photons that inhibits direct photodegradation of micropollutants and also slows the generation rate of radicals luo et al 2019 xie et al 2015 as a scavenger dom significantly increases the rate at which radicals are consumed xie et al 2015 zhu et al 2021 the second order reaction rate constant of dom with ho is reported to be in the range of 1 21 6 50 108 mc 1 s 1 and with so4 0 64 3 68 107 mc 1 s 1 lei et al 2022 2021 westerhoff et al 2007 whereas the second order reaction rate constants between micropollutants and ho and so4 were in the range of 0 15 56 0 109 mc 1 s 1 and 0 001 9 2 109 mc 1 s 1 respectively xiao et al 2015 wols and hofman caris 2012 thus the presence of dom results in lower radical concentrations besides these two well known effects recent studies have found an additional pathway through which dom inhibits micropollutant degradation

process of adenine intermediates adn h cheng et al 2022 the quenching rate constants of adn h by dom were reported to be in the range of 0 39 1 18 107 mc 1 s 1 depending on the antioxidant properties of the dom cheng et al 2022 a previous study reported that the quenching rate constant of 4 dimethylamino benzonitrile radical cation by dom was in the range of 7 0 11 7 108 mc 1 s 1 leresche et al 2020 and tryptophan radical cation was also reported to be quenched by suwannee river fulvic acid with a rate constant of 1 3 108 mc 1 s 1 janssen et al 2014 such an inhibitory effect of quenching intermediate radicals is ascribed to antioxidant moieties e g phenolic components in dom cheng et al 2022 the phenolic components generally have reduction potentials of 0 4 0 8 v vs she whereas the reduction potentials of micropollutants containing aniline and purine groups are between 0 8 and 1 6 v vs she faraggi et al 1996 jonsson et al 1994 jovanovic and simic 1986 spataru et al 2002 redox

anilines and sulfonamides some phenols e g acetaminophen and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and some pharmaceuticals e g trimethoprim and propranolol have been reported in previous studies canonica and laubscher 2008 canonica and schonenberger 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2021 the extent of the inhibition depends on the difference in reduction potential between a micropollutant and the antioxidant phenolic moieties in the dom and also on the ph canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2021 nevertheless understanding of the inhibitory effects of dom is limited especially of the reverse reduction pathways with organic radicals micropollutants generally have complicated and diverse structures what kinds of micropollutants intermediates can be reduced back by dom is still not very clear meanwhile due to the multiple inhibition pathways involved i e inner filtering radical scavenging and reverse reduction quantitative understanding of the inhibition in aops is still insufficient this study was designed to examine quantitatively the inhibitory effects of dom on micropollutant degradation in uv pds treatment and to associate them with the micropollutant s properties a total of 34 target compounds tcs belonging to amines purines and phenols were chosen due to their prevalent structures in micropollutants and their wide range of reduction potentials from 0 46 to 1 50 v vs she table s1 in the supplementary material three representative tcs aniline guanosine and catechol were investigated first to explore the dependence of inhibition on suwannee river natural organic matter srnom concentration inhibitory due to inner filtering radical scavenging and the reverse pathway were then quantitively examined separately finally the degradation kinetics of the 34 tcs in uv pds treatment with and without srnom present were documented the correlation between tc s reduction potential and reverse pathway inhibition was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals a total

a quartz glass cover under a low pressure uv lamp with a quasi collimated 253 7 nm beam fig s1 the uv photon flux entering the solution was determined to be 2 06 10 7 es l 1 s 1 by using iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2003 the effective light path length l was 2 08 cm to initiate the reaction 290 µm pds was dosed to an 80 ml solution containing 1 0 µm target compound and srnom 0 4 0 mgc l 1 as required buffered at ph 7 0 using 5 0 mm phosphate buffer and the mixture was simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were extracted at pre set time intervals and immediately quenched with sodium sulfite the residual target compound concentration was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc the control experiments were conducted under uv irradiation alone without pds and with pds alone in the dark using the same conditions 2 3 determination of the reaction rate constants of so4 and ho with the target compounds the second order reaction rate constants of so4 and ho

the transient spectra of the guanosine intermediate g h produced by reacting guanosine with so4 after deprotonation are well documented candeias and steenken 1989 morozova et al 2007 thapa et al 2019 the decay kinetics of g h in the presence of the srnom was monitored at 600 nm to avoid interference from the spectra of co existing intermediates the first order decay rate constant of g h increased with increasing srnom concentration and the slopes represented the second order quenching rate constant of g h by srnom the details are shown in text s3 2 5 analytical methods the tc concentrations were detected using a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc system equipped with a syncronis c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm a diode array detector and a fluorescence detector the analytical details for each tc are listed in table s3 the dissolved organic carbon in the srnom was quantified using a shimadzu toc vcph total organic carbon analyzer 2 6 kinetic modelling of the inhibitory effects of dom to quantitatively examine the inhibitory effects of srnom the inhibition percentage ip was defined as the decreasing in k obs in the presence of srnom at a given concentration k obs srnom as a proportion

ipso4 and ipho were calculated using eqs 8 and 9 ipq accounts for the inhibitory effects of srnom s reverting tc s intermediates back to the parent compound cheng et al 2022 ipq was calculated using

with a global model fit of measured ip values at different srnom concentrations with originpro v 9 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the inhibitory effects of srnom on the degradation kinetics of three representative tcs guanosine aniline and catechol were used as a representative purine aniline and phenol respectively they do not degrade under either uv irradiation alone or pds treatment alone fig s2 those three tcs also have comparable second order reaction rate constants with so4 4 10 109 m 1 s 1 for guanosine 4 39 109 m 1 s 1 for aniline and 5 14 109 m 1 s 1 for catechol at ph 7 0 and also with ho 8 00 109 m 1 s 1 for guanosine 1 70 1010 m 1 s 1 for aniline and 1 10 1010 m 1 s 1 for catechol at ph 7 0 luo et al 2017 nist 2022 steenken 1989 their degradation kinetics in the uv pds process with and without 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom are presented in fig 2 in the absence of srnom the observed first order degradation rate constants k obs were close for the three tcs 5 09 0 20 10 3 s 1 for guanosine 5 25 0 31 10 3 s 1 for analine and 5 65 0 16 10 3 s 1 for catechol in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom the k obs values for the three tcs decreased interestingly the inhibitory effects of srnom on the degradation of the three tcs exhibit distinct phenomena the degradation rate constants were 1 38 0 16 10 3 s 1 for guanosine 2 39 0 11 10 3 s 1 for aniline and 3 82 0 06 10 3 s 1 for catechol which decreased by 72 9 54 5 and 32 4 respectively compared to those without srnom present fig 2a c the difference in the inhibitory effects was also evident at other srnom concentrations fig 2d as the srnom concentration increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mgc l 1 the inhibition increased from 11 2 to 89 1 for guanosine from 17 0 to 75 8 for aniline and from 11 5 to 44 4 for catechol at even higher srnom concentration i e 4 0 mgc l 1 the difference in inhibition was not so great since the three tcs have similar second order reaction rate constants with so4 and ho and their inner filtering and radical scavenging by srnom are also similar table s4 the decreases in the k obs values should also be close if there is no additional inhibitory pathway the results in fig 2 clearly indicate that srnom plays an additional role in leading to the difference in k obs values 3 2 the quantitative examination of the inhibitory effects of srnom in the absence of srnom the decay rate constants k cal srnom 0 for guanosine aniline and catechol calculated using eq 11 are close to the k obs srnom 0 values fig s3 so4 oxidation contributed to over 90 of the degradation 11 k cal srnom 0 k so 4 tc so 4

the global model fit and sensitivity analysis fig s4 and table s5 the contribution of each inhibition pathway to the three tcs degradation is presented in fig 3 ipuv was zero for guanosine aniline and catechol as they suffer no uv photolysis at 254 nm the ipso4 and ipho values increased with increasing srnom concentration due to increasing inner filtering and radical scavenging effects of the srnom the ipso4 values were close for the three tcs as they have similar reactivity with so4 and the systems had similar so4 ss for example in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom the ipso4 of guanosine aniline and catechol were 12 9 12 5 and 12 1 respectively ipho values were also similar at about 5 0 in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom the ipq values however were different ipq was higher for guanosine and aniline than for catechol at a given srnom concentration fig 3 for example in the presence of 1 0 mgc l 1 of srnom the ipq of guanosine and aniline were 52 3 and 43 4 respectively but that of catechol was 12 0 the ipq values varied with increasing srnom concentration as the srnom concentration increased from about 0 1 to 1 0 mgc l 1 the ipq of guanosine increased greatly fig s5 reflecting a sharp decrease in the overall guanosine degradation fig 2d ipq then decreased at srnom concentrations above about 1 0 mgc l 1 due to reduced concentration of guanosine or aniline radicals in the system that was due to enhanced scavenging by the srnom eq 10 cheng et al 2022 the degradation rate in the presence of 1 0 mgc l 1 of srnom was used to compare the inhibition pathways guanosine s ipq 52 3 was much higher than the ipso4 23 2 and ipho 7 2 values fig 3a similarly the ipq of aniline 43 4 was higher than those of ipso4 22 4 and ipho 7 1 fig 3b catechol however showed the opposite relationship its ipq was 12 0 lower than ipso4 21 9 fig 3c clearly the reverse pathway is highly dependent on the properties of the particular micropollutant wenk s group has shown wenk et al 2021 that the inhibition in a triplet sensitized reaction system depends on the difference in reduction potential δered between the model antioxidant couple phenoxyl phenol in their work and the micropollutant couple their anilinyl aniline in this study guanosine has a reduction potential of 1 29 v vs she steenken and jovanovic 1997 which was higher than that of aniline 1 02 v vs she and catechol 0 74 v vs she jonsson et al 1994 slobodan et al 1991 table s1 their δered values with phenolic antioxidant follow the order of guanosine aniline catechol which is consistent with the ipq values 3 3 the quenching reaction rate constants of tc s intermediates by srnom laser flash photolysis experiments were performed to evaluate the reverse pathway by srnom here we chose guanosine g as an example as the intermediate of g is well studied in uv pds treatment so4 can oxidize guanosine to produce cation radical g which deprotonates to neutral radical g h at ph 7 pka 3 9 candeias and steenken 1989 morozova et al 2007 thapa et al 2019 g h has a reduction potential of 1 29 v vs she for the couple of g g h steenken and jovanovic 1997 and may be reduced by the antioxidant moieties e g phenolic groups in srnom due to their low reduction potential e g 0 8 v vs she remke et al 2022 slobodan et al 1991 time resolved laser spectroscopy was applied to track the evolution of g h spectra at 600 nm at different srnom concentrations fig s6 the second order quenching rate constant of g h by srnom was determined to be 7 45 0 54 106 mc 1 s 1 eq 12 12 g h srnom h 2 o g srno m ox h o k tc h srnom q 7 45 0 54 10 6 m c 1 s 1 those results constitute direct evidence of the existence of the reverse pathway unfortunately due to the absorption overlap of aniline s and catechol s intermediate radicals with so4 k tc h srnom q values for them could not be experimentally observed the literature reports a k tc h srnom q for adenine radical of 5 28 0 75 106 mc 1 s 1 cheng et al 2022 which is close to the quenching rate constant of g h the adenine radical has a reduction potential of 1 32 v vs she which is also close to the 1 29 v of g h in order to further understand the reverse pathway of srnom additional 31 tcs having a wide range of reduction potential were chosen with results discussed below 3 4 the inhibitory effects of srnom on the degradation kinetics of 34 tcs 3 4 1 the degradation kinetics of 34 tcs fourteen purines 9 amines and 11 phenols with reduction potentials between 0 46 and 1 50 v vs she table s1 were subjected to uv pds treatment fig 4 shows the observed first order rate constants of tcs in the absence k obs srnom 0 and the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 of srnom k obs srnom during uv pds treatment in the absence of srnom almost all of the compounds except purine and allopurinol had k obs srnom 0 values larger than 2 0 10 3 s 1 the first order decay rate constants of the purine compounds varied from 5 25 10 4 purine to 1 23 10 2 s 1 caffeine among the amine compounds k obs srnom 0 ranged from 2 73 10 3 mefenamic acid to 1 53 10 2 s 1 atenolol with an average of 8 34 10 3 s 1 atenolol and metoprolol exhibited the highest k obs srnom 0 values 1 45 10 2 s 1 because they react strongly with so4 1010 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2013 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 among the phenols resorcinol and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol had the highest k obs srnom 0 of 1 03 10 2 and 9 57 10 3 s 1 respectively the other tcs first order rate constants fell within a relatively narrow range of 2 45 5 64 10 3 s 1 the differences in their k obs srnom 0 values were due primarily to their different reactivity toward so4 table s1 in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 of srnom the k obs srnom values ranged from 3 42 10 4 to 1 13 10 2 s 1 with reduction of between 19 2 and 88 9 in the k obs srnom values observed compared to those in the absence of srnom fig 4 the ip values of the purines exceeded 47 except for xanthine 35 1 and purine 34 9 the k obs srnom of 9 methyladenine was reduced the most with an ip value of 88 9 the ip values of the amines varied over a wide range from 23 4 metoprolol to 76 4 trimethoprim the range for the phenols was much narrower from 19 2 to 38 1 except for 4 nitrophenol 59 6 the average ip values were purines 58 2 anilines 47 3 phenolics 32 9 following eqs 7 9 ipuv ipso4 and ipho were obtained ipq was calculated by subtracting ipuv ipso4 and ipho from ip eq 13 the inhibitory effects from diverse pathways were discussed separately in section 3 4 2 13 i p q ip i p uv i p so 4 i p h o 3 4 2 the quantitative examination of the three inhibitory pathways of srnom ipuv as mentioned earlier ipuv quantifies the decrease in direct photolysis as srnom competes with tc to absorb photons most of the tcs studied have a relatively low direct photodegradation rate 1 23 10 3 s 1 srnom at 0 5 mgc l 1 has low uv254 absorbance the ipuv values were less than 2 8 triclosan showed the highest direct photolysis rate constant of 1 23 0 10 10 3 s 1 the presence of srnom reduced it to 1 06 0 15 10 3 s 1 corresponding to an ipuv value of 2 8 it should be noted that the direct photolysis rate of 4 chloroaniline 2 92 0 02 10 3 s 1 in the presence of srnom was slightly higher than that without srnom 2 80 0 04 10 3 s 1 fig s7 that may be due to the production of excited triplet states of srnom and or other reactive oxygen species upon uv irradiation lester et al 2013 ipso4 and ipho srnom at 0 5 mgc l 1 decreased the rate of so4 formation by about 4 6 eq s16 as the quenching rate constant between srnom and so4 is reported to be 1 97 107 mc 1 s 1 lei et al 2022 the calculated so4 ss decreased by 9 2 22 8 eq s16 as a result the ipso4 values fell with in the narrow range of 7 1 20 0 fig 5 as fig s8a shows ipso4 decreased slightly with increasing kso4 tc values for example the kso4 tc of atenolol and allopurinol were 1 30 1010 m 1 s 1 and 3 88 108 m 1 s 1 respectively resulting in ipso4 values of 8 9 and 15 4 respectively the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 of srnom reduced ho ss by 44 7 78 9 due to the high reactivity between srnom and ho k 3 00 108 mc 1 s 1 xie et al 2015 the ipho values varied from 1 7 to 23 4 fig s8b shows that for tc with a low kso4 tc 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 ipho increased with decreasing kso4 tc this was due to the greater contribution of ho to these tcs degradation for example the kso4 tc of hypoxanthine was 9 90 108 m 1 s 1 and the ipho value was 18 0 for comparison the ipho value was 4 1 for triclosan kso4 tc 3 88 109 m 1 s 1 let ipradical represent the sum of tc s ipso4 and ipho values ipradical varied from 10 7 to 38 9 in these experiments for tcs with kso4 tc 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 the ipradical values varied little a range of 10 7 18 3 for tcs with kso4 tc less than that ipradical varied from 10 8 to 38 9 and was negatively correlated with kso4 tc fig s8c ipq the values of ipq differed significantly among the tcs tested it ranged from 0 for hydroquinone to 70 8 for 9 methyladenine among the three categories of tcs tested the average ipq values for the purines 33 9 and amines 32 9 were higher than that of the phenols 13 9 but the ipq values also showed significant variation within a tc category fig s9 the ipq values ranged from 5 1 to 70 8 for the purines from 11 4 to 61 8 for the anilines and from 0 to 30 7 for the phenols to discover the inherent reasons for the discrepancy in different tcs the reduction potential of tcs were collected table s1 and correlated with the ipq values as shown in fig 6 the ipq values correlated well with the tcs reduction potentials r2 0 86 p 0 01 tcs with a reduction potentials greater than 1 2 v vs she e g sulfamethoxazole of 1 20 v 4 aminobenzonitrile of 1 32 v theophylline of 1 24 v guanosine of 1 29 v adenosine of 1 42 v had ipq values over 40 tcs with a reduction potential of 1 0 v vs she mainly phenolic compounds had ipq values less than 15 the antioxidant moieties in dom mostly phenolics have been reported to play an important role in reducing tc tc h canonica and schonenberger 2019 cheng et al 2022 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 as tc or tc h of the purines and anilines generally had reduction potentials above about 1 0 v vs she they could be reduced by phenolic compounds in the srnom whose reduction potential was 0 8 v vs she slobodan et al 1991 wardman 1989 for phenolic tcs the reverse pathway was less significant however the polyphenolic or phenolic moieties with strong electron donating capacity in srnom could still exhibit strong reducing capacity towards phenolic tcs intermediates with relatively high reduction potential as is the case of 4 nitrophenol 1 23 v vs she ipq 30 7 canonica and laubscher 2008 lian et al 2021 as is shown in fig 5 the ipq values of the amines and purines were generally higher than their ipso4 and ipho values many micropollutants have purine and or amine functional groups e g antipyretic analgesics such as acetaminophen and diclofenac β blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol xanthines such as caffeine and xanthine and sulfonamides like sulfamethoxazoles and sulfanilamides lei et al 2019 the degradation of such compounds with high reduction potentials may be inhibited greatly by reverse pathways for example srnom at only 0 5 mgc l 1 decreased sulfamethoxazole s degradation by 44 2 considering only inner filtering and radical scavenging effects of dom may overestimate the degradation rates of micropollutants in uv pds treatment as such pretreatment processes such as activated carbon adsorption and membrane filtration to reduce the dom concentration and peroxidation processes such as permanganate preoxidation to transform dom s antioxidant moieties can reduce the inhibitory effects of dom in so4 aops it should be noted that the behavior of tcs in so4 mediated processes may also give some hints in other one electron oxidizing radical mediated process such as carbonate radical co3 and dichlorine radical anions cl2 carena et al 2021 lei et al 2019 lian et al 2021 some recent studies have also reported that dom can inhibit the degradation rate of cyanotoxin aniline and sulfadiazine by reducing their oxidized intermediates produced by co3 carena et al 2021 hao et al 2020 lian et al 2021 further studies are suggested to improve the control of aops in real water applications 4 conclusions the inhibitory effects of srnom on tcs degradation in uv pds treatment include inner filtering radical scavenging and reverse reduction effects were examined by using steady state photochemical experiments laser transient spectroscopy and kinetic modelling in this work the calculation of the inhibition percentages via different pathways have indicated the following aspects 1 most of the micropollutants tested have relatively low direct photodegradation rate and inner filtering effect was 2 8 in the presence of 0 5 mgc l 1 srnom 2 the radical scavenging effects of srnom varied from 10 7 to 38 9 for tcs with high kso4 tc e g 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 the inhibitory percentages varied little in the range of 10 7 18 3 for tcs with low kso4 tc e g 4 0 109 m 1 s 1 the inhibitory percentages varied from 10 8 to 38 9 and negatively correlated with kso4 tc 3 the reverse reduction effects of srnom varied significantly among the 34 tcs tested with the inhibition ranging from none to 70 8 it was positively correlated with a micropollutants s reduction potential degradation of purines and anilines with a reduction potential 1 2 v vs she was inhibited by over 40 via this pathway 4 inner filtering effect and radical scavenging effect increase continuously with the concentration of srnom however inhibition attributable to reverse reduction increases as srnom concentrations increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mgc l 1 and then decreases at srnom concentrations beyond 1 0 mgc l 1 reverse reduction is often more important than the sum of inner filtering and radical scavenging at low srnom concentrations supporting information the supporting
