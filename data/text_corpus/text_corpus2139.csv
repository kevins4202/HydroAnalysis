10695,since reckonable understanding of yield response under long term 16 year conservation management practices is the key to improve the productivity and physico chemical indicators of rice wheat rotation impact of long term tillage and irrigation levels on productivity yield trend soil organic carbon soc fractions carbon pools and sequestration under rice wheat rotation on sandy clay loam soil of the mid himalaya were quantified a field experiment started from 2001 through 2016 to assess the effect of tillage alterations conventional tillage ct and zero tillage zt and four irrigation levels i1 pre sowing ps i2 ps crown root initiation cri i3 ps cri panicle initiation pi ﬂowering fl and i4 ps cri pi fl grain ﬁlling gf applied at the critical growth stages to rice wheat rotation results confirmed that irrigation management had a significant p 0 001 positive impact on grain yield of rice wheat and system yield after 16 year continuous cropping we also recoded that plot with four irrigation i4 had 28 40 and 35 higher grain yield of rice wheat as compared to single irrigation or i1 2 04 2 99 and 5 05 mg ha 1 respectively rice yield declined significantly r 0 68 p 0 003 by 70 kg ha 1 year 1 under zt plots than ct plots 52 kg ha 1 year 1 decreasing trend of rice yield ranged from 42 kg ha 1 year 1 in four irrigations i4 to 75 kg ha 1 year 1 single irrigation i1 whereas wheat yield increased 58 kg ha 1 year 1 non significantly over the years under zt plots whereas under ct plots 13 6 kg ha 1 year 1 it had declining trend with time unlike rice yield impact of irrigation on wheat yield had positive trends or increasing trends with time plots under long term zt along with irrigation practice significantly increased total porosity and decreased ph and bulk density bd mainly in surface layer different pools of soc were also significantly increased under zt as compared to ct only in surface layer 0 15 cm we conclude that zt system increased yield of wheat and diminished rice yield after 16 years of experimentation but apart from yield zt also improved physico chemical indicators of soil and enhanced carbon sequestration the wue of rice and wheat 4 20 and 11 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 had slightly higher under zt as compared to ct it is suggested that zt is more desirable for efficient water utilization in such conditions frequent irrigation i4 was more desirable for maintaining optimum moisture condition for sustainable crop production keywords long term zero tillage carbon sequestration water use rice wheat yields 1 introduction rice wheat system is the main production systems of south asia it is the source of livelihood employment and income for hundreds of millions of rural and urban poor s the rice wheat rotation occupies approximately 26 m ha area in asia mainly with 13 5 m ha in the indo gangetic plains igps covering approximately 32 of the total rice area and about 42 of the total wheat area in four igp countries viz india pakistan bangladesh and nepal saharawat et al 2012 jat et al 2014 rice and wheat together contribute 70 of total cereals production in india with production of approximately 105 and 94 mt in about 44 and 30 m ha area respectively agricultural statistics at a glance 2016 thus the rice wheat rotation is the keystone of india s food self sufficiency the conventional growing practices of rice wheat rotation has aggravated soil degradation and decline productivity which ultimately are threats to sustainability and proﬁtability in cultivated regions and raise an immense question on system sustainability besides yield stagnation busari et al 2015 the soil and water are main components for conservation in indian himalayan regions ihr where steep sloped land cause higher runoff losses during south west monsoon june september which have abundant rainfall and rest of months suffers from water scarcity panday et al 2018 the adoption of conservation management practices cmps will help in achieving sustainable and productive agricultural systems along with preservation of nutrient and moisture in the soil this is particularly true for the himalayan soils that are highly prone to water erosion cmps are important agronomic practices which are concerned about agricultural sustainability and has progressively augmented globally to cover 11 of the globe s 158 m ha cultivable land choudhary et al 2016 2018 the conservation agriculture based cmps have been found effective for increasing crop productivity and soil sustainability however along with cmps sustainable use of irrigation water is also needed in the context of currently shrinking water resources consequently irrigation management practices imps are important to understand soil water dynamics throughout the profile and these help to increase the productivity with per drop more crop cmps such as zero tillage zt system retain higher moisture content for longer time and are important for enhanced wue than conventional tillage ct system preservation of soc is important to sustain long term soil sustainability sapkota et al 2017 and ecosystem functionality however potential of soc storage or carbon sequestration or accumulation under different cropping systems may be changed or influenced by several agricultural practices like zt ct irrigation farm yard manure fym fertilization crop residues and mulching the advantage of preserving soc for sustainable agriculture ecosystem is well recognized and its accumulation has been measured as a possible solution to mitigate climate change in which atmospheric carbon is converted into soil carbon that is long lived minasny et al 2017 consequently adoption of such cmps which improve storage of atmospheric carbon powlson et al 2016 samal et al 2017 may help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change chen et al 2015 lal 2015 as well as improving soil structure quality lal 2016 and fertility dignac et al 2017 many studies provided evidence on the rice wheat production as exaggerated by tillage and irrigation in himalayan ecosystem after 4 and 9 years of cultivation by panday et al 2008 and bhattacharyya et al 2013 respectively however precise information on the long term 16 year effects of tillage and irrigation on productivity yields trend physico chemical indicators of soil soil organic carbon soc pools and carbon sequestration under rice wheat system of the region is lacking in the context of deteriorating soil quality stagnation of yield in rice wheat system has been recorded across indo gangetic plains igp and indian himalayan regions ihr busari et al 2015 a long term field experiment was initiated during 2001 through 2016 with following objectives i to determine the effects of tillage and irrigation on crop water productivity and trends of yield under rice wheat system ii to know the response of physico chemical indicators of soil under long term tillage and irrigation practices and iii to study the impact of tillage and irrigation on soc pools and requisitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a ﬁeld experiment was conducted for 16 years 2001 2016 at the experimental farm of the icar vivekananda parvatiya krishi anusandhan sansthan hawalbagh 29 36 n 79 40 e at 1250 m above msl of almora india on a sandy clay loam soil the region is characterized by a sub temperate climate with a dry summer march june wet monsoon season june september and a cool dry winter october february mean annual maximum and minimum air temperature during study period were 26⁰c and 10⁰c respectively average annual rainfall was 921 mm during study period 2001 2016 of which 73 was received during the monsoon season the surface soil 0 15 cm of the experimental field had sandy clay loam type soil having bulk density bd of 1 34 mg m 3 soil organic carbon 6 6 g kg 1 0 5 m nahco3 extractable phosphorus 11 5 kg ha 1 and 1 n ch3coonh4 extractable potassium 127 kg ha 1 the sub surface soil 15 30 cm had bd of 1 36 mg m 3 and soil organic carbon 6 15 g kg 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment was laid out in permanent plots in split plot design with tillage zt in the form of no disturbance of the soil and ct in the form of two diggings with a spade to 15 cm layer to pass with rotary tiller for seed bed preparation for both rice and wheat as main plot treatments and four levels of irrigation as sub plots with four replications table 1 irrigations i1 pre sowing ps i2 ps active tillering at crown root initiation cri i3 ps at cri panicle initiation pi ﬂowering fl and i4 ps at cri pi fl grain ﬁlling gf were applied at critical growth stages of both the crops 2 3 crop management rice was sown seed rate 100 kg ha 1 manually direct seeding rice dsr in the first to third week of june and wheat was sown 100 kg ha 1 in last week of october to first week of november during different year of experimentation in rice crop full dose of phosphorus as di ammonium phosphate and potassium as muriate of potash were applied at the time of field preparation by broadcasting before seeding nitrogen as urea was applied half as a basal dose at field preparation and remaining half in two equal splits at the tillering and panicle initiation stages of crop growth the fertilizer source for npk in wheat was the same as that of rice 2 4 soil sampling and analysis soil sampling was done after harvesting of wheat crop in 2016 2017 soil samples were collected from each plot from 0 to 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers using a core sampler immediately after sampling visible root fragments and stones were manually removed and the soil sample was divided into two parts method of estimation for different soil carbon and its fractions are given in table 2 2 5 soil organic carbon fractionation and sequestration calculations the soc concentration was distributed into different fractions determined by the modified walkley black method as described by chan et al 2001 using 5 10 and 20 ml of 36 n h2so4 that resulted in 12 18 and 24 n h2so4 and by added 1 n dichromate solution and back titration with fas using diphenylamine indicator the three acid solution ratios allow the separation of soc into the following four fractions p according to decreasing oxidizability lability p1 very labile fraction organic carbon oxidizable under 12 n h2so4 p2 labile fraction difference in oxidizable organic carbon extracted between 18 n and 12 n h2so4 18 12 n h2so4 p3 less labile fraction difference in oxidizable organic carbon extracted between 24 n and 18 n h2so4 24 18

anova gomez and gomez 1984 was performed to determine the effects of treatments using the ibm spss statistical package 20 spss inc chicago il usa to quantify and evaluate source of variation all parameters were analysed as a split plot model tillage as main effect irrigation as split plot effect to test the hypothesis on yield and wue trends a simple linear regression analysis of grain yields and wue slopes and the p values over the years was done to determine a time trend variable y a b t where y grain yield kg ha 1 or wue kg ha 1 mm 1 a the constant t year and b slope or magnitude of the yield or wue trend yield or wue changes per year 3 results 3 1 rice wheat and rice wheat system productivity and yield trend the tillage system had non significant impact on mean grain yield of rice wheat and system yield after 16 year of continuous cropping plots under ct recorded slightly greater mean yield of rice than zt plots table 3 the wheat crop performed better under zt and had slightly higher yield than ct rice wheat system yield was slightly higher under ct plots than zt unlike tillage irrigation management had a significant p 0 001 impact on grain yield of rice wheat and system plot under i4 had nearly 28 40 and 35 higher grain yield of rice wheat and system as compared to i1 plots 2 04 2 99 and 5 05 mg ha 1 respectively a significant interaction effect between tillage and irrigation was observed for rice wheat and system yield linear regression analysis of rice grain yield revealed that declining trends in tillage and irrigation treatments after 16 years of experimentation rice yield declined significantly r 0 68 p 0 003 by 70 kg ha 1 year 1 under zt plots and 52 kg ha 1 year 1 in ct plots fig 1 a b like tillage in the irrigation plots also significantly negative rice yield trends was observed over the years rice yield trends over the years declined more ranging from 42 to 75 kg ha 1 year 1 under different irrigation levels fig 1c and the decrement rate was the highest in i1 75 kg ha 1 year 1 plots followed by i2 and i3 and the lowest under i4 plot 42 kg ha 1 year 1 wheat yield increased 58 kg ha 1 year 1 over the years under zt plots however it had declining trends under ct plots 13 6 kg ha 1 year 1 fig 2 a b unlike rice yield impact of irrigation on wheat yield had increasing yield trends over time fig 2c the wheat yield increment over the years was the highest under i4 plot 27 kg ha 1 year 1 and lowest under i2 19 kg ha 1 year 1 the rwcs had positive yield trends over the years under zt while ct and irrigation treatments had negative trends the system yield decreased by 61 kg ha 1 year 1 under ct whereas in zt system yield increased by 2 2 kg ha 1 year 1 fig 3 a b the system yield decrement over the years was the highest under i1 plots 40 kg ha 1 year 1 and lowest under i4 plots 12 kg ha 1 year 1 fig 3c 3 2 effect of tillage and irrigation on the physico chemical indicators of soils the ph of soil under zt plots had significantly p 0 001 lower than ct plots in 0 15 cm soil layer while in 15 30 cm soil layer both zt and ct had similar effect on soil ph table 4 in the surface layer 0 15 cm the ph of soil after harvest of wheat was lower under i1 than i4 i3 and i2 however impact of irrigation was not statistically significant on soil ph under sub surface 15 30 cm soil and both soil layers had following order of soil ph i1 i2 i3 i4 soil ph increased with depth under both zt and ct plots the soil under ct plots was more compacted than zt plots in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers after wheat harvest table 4 bulk density under ct plots had greater values than zt plots at both surface and subsurface soil layers tillage had significant impact on the bd at surface layer while similar effect at sub surface layer in the soil layers 0 15 and 15 30 cm layer bd after wheat harvest was lower under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 bd gradually increased with depth regardless of the tillage and irrigation system imposed total porosity was significantly p 0 05 higher under zt plots 52 64 than ct plots 51 47 in surface layer whereas in sub surface layer the increase was non significant table 4 higher total porosity was also estimated after harvest of wheat in i4 plots as compared to i3 i2 and i1 in both the soil layers 3 3 soil organic carbon soc and its fractions 3 3 1 soil organic carbon soc results in table 5 showed that total soc concentration was significantly affected by tillage and irrigation practices in the both the soil layers plots under zt had 11 and 9 greater total soc concentration than ct 11 76 and 10 13 g kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively plots under i4 had 18 and 16 higher total soc concentration than i1 plots in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively the soc concentration was higher in surface layer than sub surface layer in both tillage as well as irrigation systems the tillage and irrigation interaction effect was only significant p 0 04 for soc only in the surface soil layer 3 3 2 dissolve organic carbon doc doc comprised a very small proportion 0 15 0 35 of soc and was significantly inﬂuenced by tillage and irrigation practices table 5 plots under zt had significantly 14 and 10 higher doc than ct plots 35 and 20 mg kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layer respectively like tillage irrigation had a significant impact on doc in both the soil layers table 5 i4 plots had 28 and 22 higher doc as compared to i1 plots 34 and 19 mg kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively depth wise distribution of doc decreased from surface to sub surface layer the interaction effect between tillage and irrigation was non significant for surface layer but it was significant p 0 045 for sub surface layer 3 3 3 microbial biomass carbon mbc the mbc of the soil under different tillage and irrigation regimes varied significantly p 0 05 in both the soil layers data shown in table 5 revealed that plots under zt had significantly 23 and 12 5 greater mbc than ct 0 26 and 0 21 g kg 1 plots in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively plots under i4 had significantly 27 and 25 higher mbc than plot under i1 0 26 and 0 20 g kg 1 and 14 and 13 higher mbc than plot under i2 0 29 and 0 22 g kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively it was observed that the distribution of mbc content declined with depth a significant p 0 05 interaction effect was observed between tillage and irrigation only for surface layer 3 3 4 permanganate oxidizable carbon kmno4 c the kmno4 c concentration of the soil was significantly affected by tillage and irrigation practices in both the soil layers table 5 in the zt plots the kmno4 c concentration was 10 and 6 higher compared to the ct plots 0 72 and 0 49 g kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm layers respectively meanwhile plots under i4 had 20 and 12 greater kmno4 c concentration than plots under i1 0 69 and 0 48 g kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm layers 3 3 5 particulate organic carbon poc the poc concentration of soil was significantly affected by tillage and irrigation in both soil layers plots under zt had significant by 13 and 3 higher poc concentration than ct plots 2 36 and 1 97 g kg 1 in the surface soil layer and subsurface soil layer respectively table 5 plots under i4 had 16 and 15 higher poc concentration than i1 2 32 and 1 87 g kg 1 and 12 and 11 higher poc concentration than i2 plots 2 41 and 1 93 g kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively a perusal of results revealed that poc concentration decreased with depth a significant p 0 05 interaction was observed between tillage and irrigation in the surface layer in the present study 3 3 6 walkley black carbon wbc plots under zt had significantly p 0 05 greater accumulation of wbc concentration 8 84 and 7 54 g kg 1 as compared to plots under ct 7 86 and 7 22 g kg 1 in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 5 it was 12 and 4 greater in zt than ct plots in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively plots under i4 had 13 and 14 higher wbc concentration in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layer compared to i1 plots 7 70 and 6 91 g kg 1 respectively similarly plots under i3 had 8 and 5 higher wbc concentration in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers as compared to i2 plots 8 15 and 7 18 g kg 1 respectively irrespective to treatments wbc concentration diminished with increasing soil depth in the surface soil layer wbc concentration was more pronounced under zt than ct plots and it was 17 higher than sub surface layer while in ct plots wbc was about 9 higher in surface layer than the sub surface layer there was a significant p 0 035 interactive effects of tillage and irrigation on wbc concentration only in surface soil layer 3 3 7 cumulative co2 c mineralizable carbon cumulative co2 c varied significantly p 0 05 under different tillage systems from 638 to 730 mg co2 c mg kg 1 and 440 522 mg co2 c kg 1 soil in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively after 28 days of incubation table 5 fig 4 a d plots under zt evolved significantly p 0 05 15 and 18 higher cumulative co2 c than ct 638 and 440 mg co2 c kg 1 in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively irrigation had significant impact on co2 evolution plots under i4 and i3 evolved nearly 35 and 23 greater cumulative co2 than i1 586 mg co2 c kg 1 in the 0 15 cm soil layer in the 15 30 cm soil layer i4 and i3 evolved about 38 and 22 greater co2 than i1 408 mg co2 c kg 1 respectively higher cumulative carbon mineralization was recorded under surface soil as compared to sub surface layer under different tillage and irrigation treatments 3 4 carbon pools the ct plots had significantly p 0 05 lower very labile pool p1 than zt plots in both soil layers table 6 plots under zt also had nearly 15 and 3 greater labile pool p2 than ct plots 2 27 and 2 18 g c kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layer respectively no significant impact of tillage on labile pool p2 was noticed in 15 30 cm soil layer in zt plots the less labile pool p3 10 and 4 higher as compared to ct plots 2 15 and 2 07 in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively similar to labile pool p2 the less labile pool p3 also changed non significantly with tillage in 15 30 cm soil layer non labile pool p4 of soc varied significantly p 0 05 under different tillage and irrigation levels in both the soil layers in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers plots under zt had nearly 8 70 and 18 greater non labile soc than ct plots 3 90 and 3 15 g c kg 1 apart from labile pool p2 and less labile pool p3 plots under i4 had greater soc concentration of very labile p1 and non labile pool p4 than i3 in both the soil layers irrespective of tillage and irrigation treatments layer wise distribution of soc concentration in pool was higher in the 0 15 cm layer as compared to 15 30 cm soil layer the tillage and irrigation interaction effect was significant p 0 002 for the very labile pool and that for surface layer only non labile pool p4 constituted the highest 32 17 34 32 across the tillage and irrigation levels as compared to rest of the pools the very labile pool p1 constituted a higher proportion 29 24 33 80 and 27 72 29 37 of total soc concentration than p2 and p3 across the treatments in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively fig 5 a b the percentage carbon concentration distribution of different pools to total soc was in the order p4 p1 p2 p3 in 0 15 cm soil layer whereas p2 and p3 were more or less similar in 15 30 cm soil layer 3 5 carbon sequestration cs and carbon sequestration rate csr the tillage and irrigation had significant p 0 05 impact on carbon sequestration cs in the surface and subsurface layers plots under zt had 9 and 6 higher carbon sequestration as compared to ct plots 22 68 and 20 50 mg ha 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 7 irrespective of tillage cs was found higher under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively data shown in table 7 revealed that csr varied significantly p 0 05 under tillage and irrigation treatments the csr was higher under zt plots 459 and 333 kg c ha 1 year 1 as compared to ct plots 339 and 259 kg c ha 1 year 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively the csr also varied significantly p 0 05 under contrast irrigation regimes from 297 to 464 kg c ha 1 year 1 in the 0 15 cm layer and 237 408 kg c ha 1 year 1 in the 15 30 cm soil layer apart from treatments layer wise distribution of cs and csr was also higher in the 0 15 cm layer as compared to15 30 cm soil layer irrespective of tillage cs was found higher under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively 3 6 water use efficiency wue and its trend the plots under zt showed numerically a higher wue value in rice and wheat table 8 as compared to ct as there were no statistically yield differences between zt and ct in both crops so wue values were also similar wue values of rice in the plots under different irrigation treatments were not statistically different but in wheat there were statistically different even though there were signiﬁcant yield differences in irrigation treatments in both the crops results revealed that wue values were found higher under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots in the both crops after analyzed of 16 year data of wue disclosed that negative wue trend over the years ranging from 112 to 150 kg ha 1 mm 1 year 1 in tillage and 121 to 170 kg ha 1 mm 1 year 1 in irrigation treatments in rice whereas in wheat it was positive under zt and i4 treatments and negative trends in ct as well as all three irrigation treatments figs 6 and 7 3 7 correlation among different physico chemical indicators soc fractions with rice and wheat yield significant correlation was observed of soil rice and wheat yield in the surface layer of soil while non significant in the sub surface layer both soil ph and total porosity had positive correlation with rice yield r 0 38 p 0 031 and r 0 43 p 0 014 while a significant negative correlation r 0 43 p 0 014 wheat yield had significant positive correlation with total porosity r 0 43 p 0 012 while significant negative correlation with bulk density r 0 44 p 0 012 different fractions and pools of soc were significantly correlated with rice and wheat yield except p2 and p3 in 0 15 and p3 and p4 in 15 30 cm soil layers cs had significant positive correlation with rice r 0 43 p 0 014 and r 0 48 p 0 005 and wheat yield r 0 47 p 0 007 and r 0 49 p 0 004 under 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 9 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage and irrigation on grain yield and yield trends consequently the rice yield reduced under both the zt and ct system in zt surface layer had light crop residue and no disturbance stanley et al 2018 along with high weed infestation during season as compared to season gathala et al 2016 this was the another cause of more rice yield reductions in zt as compared to ct however wheat yield to a certain extent sustained and increased under zt but declined slightly under ct plots after long term cultivation gathala et al 2011 no significant difference was reported in the yields of rice and wheat under zt and ct system after 9 bhattacharyya et al 2013 and 16 years in the present study of experimentation linear regression analysis revealed a downward trend in rice grain yield both in the tillage and irrigation treatments after 16 years of crop cultivation this might be due to the long term cultivation of rice wheat leading to the degradation of soil quality and health as well as tropical humid climates leading to weeds pests or disease pressure proportionately which are largely contributing to yield declines pittelkow et al 2015 recommended dose of fertilizers were not enough to sustain long term crop production under cereal cereal cropping system similar results tuned with singh et al 2015 and kim et al 2016 in the present study for wheat plots under zt had positive yield trends over the years as compared to ct our results are accorded with others findings such as song et al 2016 singh et al 2016 and jat et al 2014 application of four irrigations i4 increased moisture content in soil profile and speed up of exchange of nutrient process and availability of nutrients improved in soil overall yield of rice and wheat increased as compared to limited irrigations i1 or i2 or i3 4 2 effect of tillage and irrigation on physico chemical indicators of soils significantly lower than ct in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 4 tillage increased bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils as compared to no or minimum tillage no significant change in was also reported by bhattacharyya et al 2013 frequent irrigation under i4 treatment had lower bulk density value as compared to few irrigation i2 and i1 might be due to adequate soil moisture condition had better root growth and increased air permeability of soil total porosity was higher under i4 plots which might be due to improved soil aggregation coupled with more root and stubble biomass 4 3 effect of tillage and irrigation on soil organic carbon soc and its fractions in addition to the minimizing breakdown of macro aggregates gathala et al 2011 in the frequently irrigated plots i4 the effects of higher root and stubble biomass might have contributed to increased soc concentration jat et al 2014 sapkota et al 2017 according to meena et al 2015 zt resulted in a net increase of 16 27 in soil carbon concentration over ct under maize based cropping systems prasad et al 2016 stated that after 10 years the soc concentration in 0 20 cm soil layer with minimum tillage mt was 11 higher than with ct in rainfed finger millet pigeonpea cropping system similar findings also in tune with song et al 2016 souza et al 2016 and liu et al 2014 doc is the primary energy source for soil micro organisms and is an indicator of the carbon availability to soil micro organisms stevenson 1994 the results showed that doc concentration was higher under zt plots as compared to ct it might be due to the preservation of easily available carbon from oxidation doc is potentially mobile in soils so the proportion of doc may be an indicator of translation or turnover rates of whole size of soc generally in both soil layers doc was greater in the i4 plots over i3 i2 and i1 plots the significant tillage and irrigation interaction effect suggested that these dependent variables responded differently to tillage treatments within the four irrigation treatments under sub surface layer studied naresh et al 2016 reported that furrow irrigated raised bed firb and zt enhanced the doc as compared to ct the highest doc concentrations were measured in 0 15 cm soil layer and decreased with soil depth hao et al 2013 liu et al 2014 the cmps such as zt have higher mbc concentration than ct and this parameter was negatively affected when the soil was disturbed figueiredo et al 2013 and souza et al 2016 a repeated tillage operation break down soil aggregates and exposes protected organic matter to microbial decomposition and increase the loss of carbon from ct plots as compared to zt plots similar findings were also reported by heidari et al 2016 liu et al 2014 and liu et al 2010 water regimes had significant effect on mbc in both the soil layer and this might be due to the reason that optimum moisture content caused favorable microclimate for proliferation of soil microorganism and their activity was increased in soil quanying et al 2014 souza et al 2016 the higher concentration of kmno4 c in i4 plots may be due to the decomposition of root biomass and higher accumulation of kmno4 c from non labile pools p4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots our findings are in tune with chen et al 2009 bhattacharyya et al 2013 and liu et al 2014 higher poc recorded in i4 might be due to the higher moisture content that led to formation of stable macroaggregates finally leading to greater poc than dryer conditions or i3 i2 and i1 plots the higher wbc concentration in the plots under zt than ct plots might be attributed in part to less disruption of the soil structure aggregates and due to less soil residue interaction with zt and another side was higher decomposition rates and carbon redistribution with ct plots du et al 2010 the effects of higher root and stubble biomass might have contributed to increased wbc concentration along with higher levels of moisture content in i4 and i3 than i2 and i1 carbon mineralization process represents decomposition of organic matter in soil and is reflected as an indicator of microbial activity probably largely governed by the higher root biomass and crop residue addition available for microorganism growth and higher soil respiration as compared to dried conditions 4 4 effect of tillage and irrigation on carbon pools and carbon sequestration cs results shown in table 7 indicated that higher cs and csr under zt plots may be due to i higher soil surface residue retention leading to greater carbon inputs or ii preservation of soc without disturbance of soil and decomposition chen et al 2009 reported that reduced tillage rt contained 7 3 more soc stocks than plough tillage pt in the 0 20 cm layer cs increased in topsoil of double rice cropping systems with increases in experimental duration chen et al 2014 4 5 effect of tillage and irrigation on water use efficiency wue the mean of 16 years wue for both rice and wheat in the plots under tillage were not statistically different with each other but higher numerical values were observed under zt as compared to ct results indicated that zt may be more needed than ct in terms of water budget and efficiency frequent irrigation i4 was also supportive for maintaining optimum moisture condition for higher yield production as compared to small number of irrigation similar results were observed by jat et al 2009 and parihar et al 2017 4 6 relationship between physico chemical indicators soc rice and wheat yield these results revealed a decline of these soc and its fractions with increased soil depths different fractions and pools of soc were signiﬁcant and positively correlated with rice and wheat yield such correlations suggested that soc as a core parameter to the soil fertility and play an important role in the improvement of soil quality similarly depletion in different soc fractions and pools could also give an early indication for decline of soil fertility chen et al 2009 5 conclusions our results from a 16 year old experiment confirmed that plots under zt increased wheat yield and reduced rice yield while the rice yield was increased and wheat yield was decreased in ct system irrigation had also negative rice yield trends and positive trends of wheat yield over the years these findings indicate that zt may be more desirable than ct for wheat cultivation physico chemical indicators of soil and carbon sequestration significantly improved under zt system along with frequent irrigation i4 or i3 than ct system and small number of irrigation i1 or i2 adoption of zt is the better management option for soil carbon improvement than ct whereas ct may be more productive in case of rice cultivation according to current scenario a minimum of four irrigations in both the crops is necessary for maintaining sustainable production along with improvement of physico chemical indicators of soil the wue of rice and wheat had higher under zt as compared to ct it is suggested that zt is more desirable for efficient water utilization in such conditions frequent irrigation i4 was more desirable for maintaining optimum moisture

10695,since reckonable understanding of yield response under long term 16 year conservation management practices is the key to improve the productivity and physico chemical indicators of rice wheat rotation impact of long term tillage and irrigation levels on productivity yield trend soil organic carbon soc fractions carbon pools and sequestration under rice wheat rotation on sandy clay loam soil of the mid himalaya were quantified a field experiment started from 2001 through 2016 to assess the effect of tillage alterations conventional tillage ct and zero tillage zt and four irrigation levels i1 pre sowing ps i2 ps crown root initiation cri i3 ps cri panicle initiation pi ﬂowering fl and i4 ps cri pi fl grain ﬁlling gf applied at the critical growth stages to rice wheat rotation results confirmed that irrigation management had a significant p 0 001 positive impact on grain yield of rice wheat and system yield after 16 year continuous cropping we also recoded that plot with four irrigation i4 had 28 40 and 35 higher grain yield of rice wheat as compared to single irrigation or i1 2 04 2 99 and 5 05 mg ha 1 respectively rice yield declined significantly r 0 68 p 0 003 by 70 kg ha 1 year 1 under zt plots than ct plots 52 kg ha 1 year 1 decreasing trend of rice yield ranged from 42 kg ha 1 year 1 in four irrigations i4 to 75 kg ha 1 year 1 single irrigation i1 whereas wheat yield increased 58 kg ha 1 year 1 non significantly over the years under zt plots whereas under ct plots 13 6 kg ha 1 year 1 it had declining trend with time unlike rice yield impact of irrigation on wheat yield had positive trends or increasing trends with time plots under long term zt along with irrigation practice significantly increased total porosity and decreased ph and bulk density bd mainly in surface layer different pools of soc were also significantly increased under zt as compared to ct only in surface layer 0 15 cm we conclude that zt system increased yield of wheat and diminished rice yield after 16 years of experimentation but apart from yield zt also improved physico chemical indicators of soil and enhanced carbon sequestration the wue of rice and wheat 4 20 and 11 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 had slightly higher under zt as compared to ct it is suggested that zt is more desirable for efficient water utilization in such conditions frequent irrigation i4 was more desirable for maintaining optimum moisture condition for sustainable crop production keywords long term zero tillage carbon sequestration water use rice wheat yields 1 introduction rice wheat system is the main production systems of south asia it is the source of livelihood employment and income for hundreds of millions of rural and urban poor s the rice wheat rotation occupies approximately 26 m ha area in asia mainly with 13 5 m ha in the indo gangetic plains igps covering approximately 32 of the total rice area and about 42 of the total wheat area in four igp countries viz india pakistan bangladesh and nepal saharawat et al 2012 jat et al 2014 rice and wheat together contribute 70 of total cereals production in india with production of approximately 105 and 94 mt in about 44 and 30 m ha area respectively agricultural statistics at a glance 2016 thus the rice wheat rotation is the keystone of india s food self sufficiency the conventional growing practices of rice wheat rotation has aggravated soil degradation and decline productivity which ultimately are threats to sustainability and proﬁtability in cultivated regions and raise an immense question on system sustainability besides yield stagnation busari et al 2015 the soil and water are main components for conservation in indian himalayan regions ihr where steep sloped land cause higher runoff losses during south west monsoon june september which have abundant rainfall and rest of months suffers from water scarcity panday et al 2018 the adoption of conservation management practices cmps will help in achieving sustainable and productive agricultural systems along with preservation of nutrient and moisture in the soil this is particularly true for the himalayan soils that are highly prone to water erosion cmps are important agronomic practices which are concerned about agricultural sustainability and has progressively augmented globally to cover 11 of the globe s 158 m ha cultivable land choudhary et al 2016 2018 the conservation agriculture based cmps have been found effective for increasing crop productivity and soil sustainability however along with cmps sustainable use of irrigation water is also needed in the context of currently shrinking water resources consequently irrigation management practices imps are important to understand soil water dynamics throughout the profile and these help to increase the productivity with per drop more crop cmps such as zero tillage zt system retain higher moisture content for longer time and are important for enhanced wue than conventional tillage ct system preservation of soc is important to sustain long term soil sustainability sapkota et al 2017 and ecosystem functionality however potential of soc storage or carbon sequestration or accumulation under different cropping systems may be changed or influenced by several agricultural practices like zt ct irrigation farm yard manure fym fertilization crop residues and mulching the advantage of preserving soc for sustainable agriculture ecosystem is well recognized and its accumulation has been measured as a possible solution to mitigate climate change in which atmospheric carbon is converted into soil carbon that is long lived minasny et al 2017 consequently adoption of such cmps which improve storage of atmospheric carbon powlson et al 2016 samal et al 2017 may help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change chen et al 2015 lal 2015 as well as improving soil structure quality lal 2016 and fertility dignac et al 2017 many studies provided evidence on the rice wheat production as exaggerated by tillage and irrigation in himalayan ecosystem after 4 and 9 years of cultivation by panday et al 2008 and bhattacharyya et al 2013 respectively however precise information on the long term 16 year effects of tillage and irrigation on productivity yields trend physico chemical indicators of soil soil organic carbon soc pools and carbon sequestration under rice wheat system of the region is lacking in the context of deteriorating soil quality stagnation of yield in rice wheat system has been recorded across indo gangetic plains igp and indian himalayan regions ihr busari et al 2015 a long term field experiment was initiated during 2001 through 2016 with following objectives i to determine the effects of tillage and irrigation on crop water productivity and trends of yield under rice wheat system ii to know the response of physico chemical indicators of soil under long term tillage and irrigation practices and iii to study the impact of tillage and irrigation on soc pools and requisitioning 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a ﬁeld experiment was conducted for 16 years 2001 2016 at the experimental farm of the icar vivekananda parvatiya krishi anusandhan sansthan hawalbagh 29 36 n 79 40 e at 1250 m above msl of almora india on a sandy clay loam soil the region is characterized by a sub temperate climate

form of no disturbance of the soil and ct in the form of two diggings with a spade to 15 cm layer to pass with rotary tiller for seed bed preparation for both rice and wheat as main plot treatments and four levels of irrigation as sub plots with four replications table 1 irrigations i1 pre sowing ps i2 ps active tillering at crown root initiation cri i3 ps at cri panicle initiation pi ﬂowering fl and i4 ps at cri pi fl grain ﬁlling gf were applied at critical growth stages of both the crops 2 3 crop management rice was sown seed rate 100 kg ha 1 manually direct seeding rice dsr in the first

phosphate and potassium as muriate of potash were applied at the time of field preparation by broadcasting before seeding nitrogen as urea was applied half as a basal dose at field preparation and remaining half in two equal splits at the tillering and panicle initiation stages of crop growth the fertilizer source for npk in wheat was the same as that of rice 2 4 soil sampling and analysis soil sampling was done after harvesting of wheat crop in 2016 2017 soil samples were collected from each plot from 0 to 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers using a core sampler immediately after sampling visible root fragments and stones were manually removed and the soil sample was divided into two parts method of estimation for different soil carbon and its fractions are given in table 2 2 5 soil organic carbon fractionation and sequestration calculations the soc concentration was distributed into different fractions determined by the modified walkley black method as described by chan et al 2001 using 5 10 and 20 ml of 36 n h2so4 that resulted in 12 18 and 24 n h2so4 and by added 1 n dichromate solution and back titration with fas using diphenylamine indicator the three acid solution ratios allow the separation of soc into the following four fractions p according to decreasing oxidizability lability p1 very labile fraction organic carbon oxidizable under 12 n h2so4 p2 labile fraction

anova gomez and gomez 1984 was performed to determine the effects of treatments using the ibm spss statistical package 20 spss inc chicago il usa to quantify and evaluate source of variation all parameters were analysed as a split plot model tillage as main effect irrigation as split plot effect to test the hypothesis on yield and wue trends a simple linear regression analysis of grain yields

kg 1 in the surface soil layer and subsurface soil layer respectively table 5 plots under i4 had 16 and 15 higher poc concentration than i1 2 32 and 1 87 g kg 1 and 12 and 11 higher poc concentration than i2 plots 2 41 and 1 93 g kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively a perusal of results revealed that poc concentration decreased with depth a significant p 0 05 interaction was observed between tillage and irrigation in the surface layer in the present study 3 3 6 walkley black carbon wbc plots under zt had significantly p 0 05 greater accumulation of wbc concentration 8 84 and 7 54 g kg 1 as compared to plots under ct 7 86 and 7 22 g kg 1 in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 5 it was 12 and 4 greater in zt than ct plots in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively plots under i4 had 13 and 14 higher wbc concentration in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layer compared to i1 plots 7 70 and 6 91 g kg 1 respectively similarly plots under i3 had 8 and 5 higher wbc concentration in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers as compared to i2 plots 8 15 and 7 18 g kg 1 respectively irrespective to treatments wbc concentration diminished with increasing soil depth in the surface soil layer wbc concentration was more pronounced under zt than ct plots and it was 17 higher than sub surface layer while in ct plots wbc was about 9 higher in surface layer than the sub surface layer there was a significant p 0 035 interactive effects of tillage and irrigation on wbc concentration only in surface soil layer 3 3 7 cumulative co2 c mineralizable carbon cumulative co2 c varied significantly p 0 05 under different tillage systems from 638 to 730 mg co2 c mg kg 1 and 440 522 mg co2 c kg 1 soil in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively after 28 days of incubation table 5 fig 4 a d plots under zt evolved significantly p 0 05 15 and 18 higher cumulative co2 c than ct 638 and 440 mg co2 c kg 1 in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively irrigation

evolved about 38 and 22 greater co2 than i1 408 mg co2 c kg 1 respectively higher cumulative carbon mineralization was recorded under surface soil as compared to sub surface layer under different tillage and irrigation treatments 3 4 carbon pools the ct plots had significantly p 0 05 lower very labile pool p1 than zt plots in both soil layers table 6 plots under zt also had nearly 15 and 3 greater labile pool p2 than ct plots 2 27 and 2 18 g c kg 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layer respectively no significant impact of tillage on labile pool p2 was noticed in 15 30 cm soil layer in zt plots the less labile pool p3 10 and 4 higher as compared to ct plots 2 15 and 2 07 in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively similar to labile pool p2 the less labile pool p3 also changed non significantly with tillage in 15 30 cm soil layer non labile pool p4 of soc varied significantly p 0 05 under different tillage and irrigation levels in both the soil layers in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers plots under zt had nearly 8 70 and 18 greater non labile soc than ct plots 3 90 and 3 15 g c kg 1 apart from labile pool p2 and less labile pool p3 plots under i4 had greater soc concentration of very labile p1 and non labile pool p4 than i3 in both the soil layers irrespective of tillage and irrigation treatments layer wise distribution of soc concentration in pool was higher in the 0 15 cm layer as compared to 15 30 cm soil layer the tillage and irrigation interaction effect was significant p 0 002 for the very labile pool and that for surface layer only non labile pool p4 constituted the highest 32 17 34 32 across the tillage and irrigation levels as compared to rest of the pools the very labile pool p1 constituted a higher proportion 29 24 33 80 and 27 72 29 37 of total soc concentration than p2 and p3 across the treatments in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively fig 5 a b the percentage carbon concentration distribution of different pools to total soc was in the order p4 p1 p2 p3 in 0 15 cm soil layer whereas p2 and p3 were more or less similar in 15 30 cm soil layer 3 5 carbon sequestration cs and carbon sequestration rate csr the tillage and irrigation had significant p 0 05 impact on carbon sequestration cs in the surface and subsurface layers plots under zt had 9 and 6 higher carbon sequestration as compared to ct plots 22 68 and 20 50 mg ha 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 7 irrespective of tillage cs was found higher under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively data shown in table 7 revealed that csr varied significantly p 0 05 under tillage and irrigation treatments the csr was higher under zt plots 459 and 333 kg c ha 1 year 1 as compared to ct plots 339 and 259 kg c ha 1 year 1 in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively the csr also varied significantly p 0 05 under contrast irrigation regimes from 297 to 464 kg c ha 1 year 1 in the 0 15 cm layer and 237 408 kg c ha 1 year 1 in the 15 30 cm soil layer apart from treatments layer wise distribution of cs and csr was also higher in the 0 15 cm layer as compared to15 30 cm soil layer irrespective of tillage cs was found higher under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively 3 6 water use efficiency wue and its trend the plots under zt showed numerically a higher wue value in rice and wheat table 8 as compared to ct as there were no statistically yield differences between zt and ct in both crops so wue values were also similar wue values of rice in the plots under different irrigation treatments were not statistically different but in wheat there were statistically different even though there were signiﬁcant yield differences in irrigation treatments in both the crops results revealed that wue values were found higher under i4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots in the both crops after analyzed of 16 year data of wue disclosed that negative wue trend over the years ranging from 112 to 150 kg ha 1 mm 1 year 1 in tillage and 121 to 170 kg ha 1 mm 1 year 1 in irrigation treatments in rice whereas in wheat it was positive under zt and i4 treatments and negative trends in ct as well as all three irrigation treatments figs 6 and 7 3 7 correlation among different physico chemical indicators soc fractions with rice and wheat yield significant correlation was observed of soil rice and wheat yield in the surface layer of soil while non significant in the sub surface layer both soil ph and total porosity had positive correlation with rice yield r 0 38 p 0 031 and r 0 43 p 0 014 while a significant negative correlation r 0 43 p 0 014 wheat yield had significant positive correlation with total porosity r 0 43 p 0 012 while significant negative correlation with bulk density r 0 44 p 0 012 different fractions and pools of soc were significantly correlated with rice and wheat yield except p2 and p3 in 0 15 and p3 and p4 in 15 30 cm soil layers cs had significant positive correlation with rice r 0 43 p 0 014 and r 0 48 p 0 005 and wheat yield r 0 47 p 0 007 and r 0 49 p 0 004 under 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 9 4 discussion 4 1 effect of tillage and irrigation on grain yield and yield trends consequently the rice yield reduced under both the zt and ct system in zt surface layer had light crop residue and no disturbance stanley et al 2018 along with high weed infestation during season as compared to season gathala et al 2016 this was the another cause of more rice yield reductions in zt as compared to ct however wheat yield to a certain extent sustained and increased under zt but declined slightly under ct plots after long term cultivation gathala et al 2011 no significant difference was reported in the yields of rice and wheat under zt and ct system after 9 bhattacharyya et al 2013 and 16 years in the present study of experimentation linear regression analysis revealed a downward trend in rice grain yield both in the tillage and irrigation treatments after 16 years of crop cultivation this might be due to the long term cultivation of rice wheat leading to the degradation of soil quality and health as well as tropical humid climates leading to weeds pests or disease pressure proportionately which are largely contributing to yield declines pittelkow et al 2015 recommended dose of fertilizers were not enough to sustain long term crop production under cereal cereal cropping system similar results tuned with singh et al 2015 and kim et al 2016 in the present study for wheat plots under zt had positive yield trends over the years as compared to ct our results are accorded with others findings such as song et al 2016 singh et al 2016 and jat et al 2014 application of four irrigations i4 increased moisture content in soil profile and speed up of exchange of nutrient process and availability of nutrients improved in soil overall yield of rice and wheat increased as compared to limited irrigations i1 or i2 or i3 4 2 effect of tillage and irrigation on physico chemical indicators of soils significantly lower than ct in 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil layers respectively table 4 tillage increased bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils as compared to no or minimum tillage no significant change in was also reported by bhattacharyya et al 2013 frequent irrigation under i4 treatment had lower bulk density value as compared to few irrigation i2 and i1 might be due to adequate soil moisture condition had better root growth and increased air permeability of soil total porosity was higher under i4 plots which might be due to improved soil aggregation coupled with more root and stubble biomass 4 3 effect of tillage and irrigation on soil organic carbon soc and its fractions in addition to the minimizing breakdown of macro aggregates gathala et al 2011 in the frequently irrigated plots i4 the effects of higher root and stubble biomass might have contributed to increased soc concentration jat et al 2014 sapkota et al 2017 according to meena et al 2015 zt resulted in a net increase of 16 27 in soil carbon concentration over ct under maize based cropping systems prasad et al 2016 stated that after 10 years the soc concentration in 0 20 cm soil layer with minimum tillage mt was 11 higher than with ct in rainfed finger millet pigeonpea cropping system similar findings also in tune with song et al 2016 souza et al 2016 and liu et al 2014 doc is the primary energy source for soil micro organisms and is an indicator of the carbon availability to soil micro organisms stevenson 1994 the results showed that doc concentration was higher under zt plots as compared to ct it might be due to the preservation of easily available carbon from oxidation doc is potentially mobile in soils so the proportion of doc may be an indicator of translation or turnover rates of whole size of soc generally in both soil layers doc was greater in the i4 plots over i3 i2 and i1 plots the significant tillage and irrigation interaction effect suggested that these dependent variables responded differently to tillage treatments within the four irrigation treatments under sub surface layer studied naresh et al 2016 reported that furrow irrigated raised bed firb and zt enhanced the doc as compared to ct the highest doc concentrations were measured in 0 15 cm soil layer and decreased with soil depth hao et al 2013 liu et al 2014 the cmps such as zt have higher mbc concentration than ct and this parameter was negatively affected when the soil was disturbed figueiredo et al 2013 and souza et al 2016 a repeated tillage operation break down soil aggregates and exposes protected organic matter to microbial decomposition and increase the loss of carbon from ct plots as compared to zt plots similar findings were also reported by heidari et al 2016 liu et al 2014 and liu et al 2010 water regimes had significant effect on mbc in both the soil layer and this might be due to the reason that optimum moisture content caused favorable microclimate for proliferation of soil microorganism and their activity was increased in soil quanying et al 2014 souza et al 2016 the higher concentration of kmno4 c in i4 plots may be due to the decomposition of root biomass and higher accumulation of kmno4 c from non labile pools p4 than i3 i2 and i1 plots our findings are in tune with chen et al 2009 bhattacharyya et al 2013 and liu et al 2014 higher poc recorded in i4 might be due to the higher moisture content that led to formation of stable macroaggregates finally leading to greater poc than dryer conditions or i3 i2 and i1 plots the higher wbc concentration in the plots under zt than ct plots might be attributed in part to less disruption of the soil structure aggregates and due to less soil residue interaction with zt and another side was higher decomposition rates and carbon redistribution with ct plots du et al 2010 the effects of higher root and stubble biomass might have contributed to increased wbc concentration along with higher levels of moisture content in i4 and i3 than i2 and i1 carbon mineralization process represents decomposition of organic matter in soil and is reflected as an indicator of microbial activity probably largely governed by the higher root biomass and crop residue addition available for microorganism growth and higher soil respiration as compared to dried conditions 4 4 effect of tillage and irrigation on carbon pools and carbon sequestration cs results shown in table 7 indicated that higher cs and csr under zt plots may be due to i higher soil surface residue retention leading to greater carbon inputs or ii preservation of soc without disturbance of soil and decomposition chen et al 2009 reported that reduced tillage rt contained 7 3 more soc stocks than plough tillage pt in the 0 20 cm layer cs increased in topsoil of double rice cropping systems with increases in experimental duration chen et al 2014 4 5 effect of tillage and irrigation on water use efficiency wue the mean of 16 years wue for both rice and wheat in the plots under tillage were not statistically different with each other but higher numerical values were observed under zt as compared to ct results indicated that zt may be more needed than ct in terms of water budget and efficiency frequent irrigation i4 was also supportive for maintaining optimum moisture condition for higher yield production as compared to small number of irrigation similar results were observed by jat et al 2009 and parihar et al 2017 4 6 relationship between physico chemical indicators soc rice and wheat yield these results revealed a decline of these soc and its fractions with increased soil depths different fractions and pools of soc were signiﬁcant and positively correlated with rice and wheat yield such correlations suggested that soc as a core parameter to the soil fertility and play an important role in the improvement of soil quality similarly depletion in different soc fractions and pools could also give an early indication for decline of soil fertility chen et al 2009 5 conclusions our results from a 16 year old experiment confirmed that plots under zt increased wheat yield and reduced rice yield while the rice yield was increased and wheat yield was decreased in ct system irrigation had also negative rice yield trends and positive trends of wheat yield over the years these findings indicate that zt may be more desirable than ct for wheat cultivation physico chemical indicators of soil and carbon sequestration significantly improved under zt system along with frequent irrigation i4 or i3 than ct system and small number of irrigation i1 or i2 adoption of zt is the better management option for soil carbon improvement than ct whereas ct may be more productive in case of rice cultivation according to current scenario a minimum of four irrigations in both the crops is necessary for maintaining sustainable production along with improvement of physico chemical indicators of soil the wue of rice and wheat had higher under zt as compared to ct it is suggested that zt is more desirable for efficient water utilization in such conditions frequent irrigation i4 was more desirable for maintaining optimum moisture

10696,plant height is an important trait that influences the yield and sustainability of wheat productions it is also an important objective for agronomic breeding and a critical indicator to represent the status of crop growth and nitrogen absorption in the vegetative stage wheat is the main crop in arid regions however there is insufficient understanding of wheat plant height response to soil water stress in this study we tried to explore a new algorithm for simulating dynamics of winter wheat height under different scenarios of soil water stress based on soil column and field experiments conducted under rainout shelters between 2012 and 2016 at yangling shaanxi province china first we established a temperature response function of wheat plant height based on four cardinal temperatures i e base temperature lower optimal temperature higher optimal temperature and ceiling temperature and we also constructed a water stress response function of wheat plant height using relative soil water availability aw as water stress index then these two functions were used as multipliers to modify the first order derivative of six distinct growth functions i e gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibull to represent the elongation rate of wheat plant height under soil water stresses consequently six modified simulation models for wheat plant height were established and identified as mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von and mod wei respectively among which an optimal simulation model was selected for winter wheat growth under soil water stresses based on experimental data of 2014 2015 used for model calibration it was found that when aw was greater than 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height was not influenced by soil water content when aw was between 0 3 and 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height gradually reduced following an exponential function driven by water stress when aw was less than 0 30 elongation rate of wheat height rapidly and linearly reduced driven by water stress until aw was close to 0 at which the elongation stopped after that the data of soil column experiment of 2014 2015 growing season were used to assess the parameters of the six newly established models the results of model calibration showed that the mean value of the willmott index of agreement wia between measured and simulated wheat heights of the six cultivars were all less than 0 90 for all treatments in the experiment except for the mod log model 0 95 the data of soil column experiment in 2015 2016 seasons were used to validate the six calibrated new models the results of model validation with mean value of wia 0 93 which were even better than model calibration finally the data of two growing seasons 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 of field experiments conducted under a giant rainout shelter were used for further verification of the six new models under field conditions among the six different plant height simulation model mod log model obtained the best values of rmse and wia keywords winter wheat water stress growth function plant height crop modeling 1 introduction plant height as an important index to reflect crop growth and nitrogen absorption in vegetative stage is an important character affecting yield of wheat and other crops it is also an important trait of crop breeding yao et al 2011 besides plant height is one of the major driving factors in modeling yield loss due to lodging berry et al 2003 sterling et al 2003 baker et al 1998 simulated wheat lodging and found that the variation of gravity center of wheat height influence wheat lodging risk plant height simulation is also important for the three dimensional construction of crop canopy structure burgess et al 2015 additionally crop plant height is an indispensable variable for simulating crop intercropping systems as it is one of the main factors that affect the ability of the crop light interception guénaëlle et al 2009 however models simulating crop plant heights were rarely developed and used in the last decades some widely used models such as the ceres family models ritchie et al 1988 ignored plant height simulations since they considered canopy as a monolayer when simulating the light interception confalonieri et al 2011 recently the importance of plant height in modeling canopy micrometeorology was gradually recognized by researchers fang et al 2014 fang et al 2014 coupled a plant height model with the revised rz shaw model and improved the accuracy of simulations of evapotranspiration and energy balance in a wheat maize cropping system furthermore some simple methods have been proposed to simulate plant height lizaso et al 2005 described the corn plant height as the final function driven by maximum plant height and development stage kotera and nawata 2007 presented a plant height simulation method in a rice model driven by average daily temperature plant height of the day before and maximum plant height another method based on lai was implemented in cropsyst model bechini and stöckle 2007 among these crop plant height simulation models the lizaso et al 2005 model used maximum plant height and phenology to drive plant height elongation kotera and nawata 2007 only considered temperature as driving variable however soil water stress was insufficiently considered to crop plant height simulation growth function is generally used to denote an analytical function that connect dry weight to time thornley and france 2007 at present common growth functions used to study biological ontogeny and mainly include gompertz gompertz 1825 logistic verhulst 1838 mischerlich mitscherlich 1928 richards richard 1959 von bertalanffy von bertalanffy 1957 and weibull weibull 1951 von bertalanffy function was proposed by von bertalanffy 1957 and later was used to simulate the height of trees oyamakin and chukwu 2014 richards function evolved from the von bertalanffy function richard 1959 and evolved into three functions such as logistic gompertz and mischerlich xing et al 1998 zwietering et al 1990 most of these growth functions were utilized to simulate the development of animals and trees in recent years a small number of studies have applied them to the ontogeny of field crops setiyono et al 2008 wu et al 2015 winter wheat is the main staple food in arid and semi arid areas of northern china where drought is the principal limiting factor to wheat production studies have shown that severe soil water stress can lead to a reduction in wheat canopy height ali et al 2007 sun et al 2014 xiangxiang et al 2014 therefore understanding and modeling the response of plant height to water stress are of great importance in this study modeling of plant height under different levels of soil water stress was investigated the objectives of this study were 1 to establish a temperature response function f t and a soil water stress response function f w to quantify the response of plant height of winter wheat to temperature and soil water stress based on controlled field experiments 2 to create and evaluate new plant height models of winter wheat that took into account soil water stress through modifications of six common growth functions of gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibul and 3 to compare the different new wheat plant height models and identify the optimal one for future simulations of plant height of winter wheat in arid and semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments of soil water stresses at different growth stages of winter wheat 2 1 1 experiments in plexiglass columns under rainout shelter the first batch of experiments of soil water stresses at different growth stages of winter wheat were conducted in the key laboratory for agricultural soil and water engineering in arid area of ministry of education northwest a f university 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m in china wheat crops were planted in plexiglass columns placed under a rainout shelter for two consecutive growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the data of 2014 2015 was used for developing and parameterizing new simulation models of plant height the data of 2015 2016 was used to evaluate the established the newly plant height models the height inner and outer diameter of plexiglass columns were 60 cm 38 cm and 40 cm respectively there were several small pores and a 1 2 cm interlayer at the bottom of each column a column of four small pores 2 cm were reserved on the side of each column for installations of soil water sensors at 15 25 35 and 45 cm from the top edge the installed soil water sensors ec 5 decagon company u s a and weighing sensors mh1124 250 kg mhsensor company germany measured soil water content and evapotranspiration et at a daily step respectively a data logger cr3000 campbell company u s a was used to record data once an hour automatically two early ripening cultivars pumai 9 and xiong 979 two middle ripening cultivars xiaoyan 22 and xigao 2 and two late ripening cultivars xinmai 23 and zhengmai 7698 of winter wheat were planted the columns were refilled with mixed local soil luo soil layer by layer with a layer depth of 50 cm and a bulk density of 1 2 g cm 3 the field capacity and permanent wilting point of top soil were 0 280 and 0 131 cm3 cm 3 in the 2014 2015 growing season and 0 291 and 0 142 cm3 cm 3 in the 2015 2016 growing season respectively for fertilizer management a mixture of 0 347 g urea and 0 2 g kh2po4 per kg dry soil was applied as basal fertilizer the top surface of each column was split into six equal sectors ten wheat seeds of each cultivar were placed in a corresponding sector which amounted to a planting density of 529 plant m 2 the planting dates were october 21st in 2014 and october 19th in 215 the harvest dates were may 27th in 2015 and june 1st in 2016 the experimental design included two factors of water stress period and irrigation depth table 1 the water stress period included four levels i e water stress at winter stage d1 greening stage d2 jointing stage d3 and grain filling stage d4 the irrigation depth included two levels of i1 45 mm and i2 90 mm based on the average water requirements of winter wheat in this region additionally a treatment with 90 mm irrigations at all four different stages ck and another treatment without any irrigation at any stage d were designed for comparisons hence there were a total of sixty different treatments involved there were three replicates for each treatment which led to a total of 30 plexiglass columns an irrigation of 90 mm was applied to each column two weeks before planting to guarantee the water requirements for emergence and juvenile growth of winter wheat more details about the experiment could be found in the study by liu et al 2016 2 1 2 experiments in open field under rainout shelter the second batch of experiments of soil water stresses at different growth stages of winter wheat were conducted in open fields under a giant rainout shelter in two consecutive growth seasons of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the experiment site was same as the previous experiments the data of these experiments were mainly used to verify the newly developed plant height simulation model of winter wheat under field conditions for weather conditions the daily temperatures and solar radiation in 2012 2016 at the experimental site were shown in fig 1 the soil type of the experimental site was also local lou soil with a ph of 8 14 total organic carbon of 8 20 g kg 1 and total nitrogen of 0 62 g kg 1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer the area of each plot was about 8 0 m2 adjacent plots were separated by polyethylene plastic films buried 1 5 m below soil surface to prevent subsurface water flow the winter wheat cultivar tested was xiaoyan 22 a very popular cultivar planted in the guanzhong plain where the experimental site is located the planting dates were october 15th both in 2012 and 2013 dry wheat seeds were sown in drill with a planting depth of 5 6 cm row spacing of 25 cm and planting density of 400 plant m 2 the harvest dates were june 1 st in 2013 and june 7th in 2014 respectively the fertilizer application rate was the same for all treatments with a base fertilizer of 140 kg n ha 1 and 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 but without top dressing the experimental factors also included irrigation levels and water stress periods table 2 based on the average water requirements of winter wheat in this region two irrigation levels of i 1 40 mm and i 2 80 mm were involved however unlike the plexiglass columns experiments the whole life cycle of winter wheat was divided into five different development stages in the open field experiments i e wintering greening jointing heading and grain filling soil water stress occurred at a single growth stage might have relatively limited influences but water stress occurred at two adjacent stages might cause more serious influences on wheat growth in this case each water stress period included two adjacent growth stages i e wintering greening d 1 greening jointing d 2 jointing heading d 3 and heading grain filling d 4 thus there was consequently a total of eight treatments with three replicates for each treatment table 2 a total of 24 plots followed a split plot experimental design and were arranged under a giant movable rainout shelter to exclude the influences of natural precipitation a representative quadrat of 1 m2 was randomly selected and marked in each plot to determine the final yield and plant height which must not be disturbed during the whole growing season regular soil and plant sampling were conducted at a random place covered by crop plants but outside the quadrat during the experiments a meter ruler was used to measure the heights of representative winter wheat plants between 11 30 a m and 13 30 p m in the quadrat the frequency of plant height measurement was twice a week before jointing and once a week after jointing more experimental details and results could be found in the research by yao et al 2015 2 2 development of plant height simulation models of winter wheat 2 2 1 growth functions the richards function eq 4 is evolved from the generalized von bertalanffy function eq 5 the other growth functions evolved from the richards function includes gompertz eq 1 logistic eq 2 and mischerlich eq 3 three functions weibull function eq 6 was developed by weibull 1951 1 h g a g e b g exp c g x 2 h l a l 1 b l exp c l x 3 h m a m 1 b m exp c m x 4 h r

height elongation of winter wheat based on the assumption that temperature and soil water content directly affect plant height elongation rate rather than state variables of plant height the first derivatives of six growth functions i e gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibull which were modified by temperature response function f t eq 14 and soil water stress response function f w eq 17 were used to quantify the influences of temperature and soil water stress on plant height elongation eqs 8 13 we denoted these simulation models of winter wheat plant height under water stress as mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von and mod wei respectively additionally it was assumed that winter wheat reached its maximum height at flowering stage in this study 8 δ h g n e t

o t 2 is the upper optimum temperature c t is the ceiling temperature in this study the relative soil water availability a w eq 15 16 was used as the index of soil water stress of soil water stress response function hanks 1974 kang et al 2000 liu et al 2016 since the root growth was not observed the average relative soil water availability of 0 60 cm soil layer was adopted during the whole growing season in plexiglass columns experiments for the field experiments under rainout shelter since soil water contents were only discretely sampled during the whole growing season the simulated soil water contents by using the dssat ceres wheat model were used to calculate a w instead 15 a w i θ a i θ w p i θ f i θ w p i 16 a w i 1 n a w i n where θ a i is the actual volumetric soil water content at the i th soil layer cm3 cm 3 θ f i is the field capacity at the i th soil layer cm3 cm 3 θ w p i is the permanent wilting point in the i th soil layer cm3 cm 3 and a w i is the relative soil water availability at the i th soil layer and n is the number of soil layer consequently a soil water response function of plant height of winter wheat was established eq 17 in this study we compared the observed and the simulated plant heights and found that when the values of a w was greater than 0 65 the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat was not influenced by soil water stress when the a w was between 0 3 and 0 65 soil water stress exponentially affected the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat when a w was lower than 0 3 soil water stress linearly inhibited the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat until a w approached 0 where wheat plant height no longer elongated 17 f w 1 a w 0 65 exp a w 0 65 0 3 a w 0 65 a w 0 2 0 a w 0 3 0 a w 0 where a w is the relative effective soil water content 2 2 3 estimation of model parameters experiment of plexiglass columns under rainout shelter in 2014 2015 growing season was used to estimated model parameters the parameters of the six modified models were estimated based on comparisons between the observed and simulated of plant heights and through the solver add in in the ms excel table 3 since the control ck treatment were fully irrigated its observed plant height at emergence about 2 cm was taken as the best estimation of parameter h 0 and its maximum plant height was used as the best estimation of parameter a the remaining parameters were estimated using the least square method finally a set of parameter values was obtained for each wheat cultivar which could satisfactorily meet the simulation precision requirements for all treatments table 3 then the differences between the observed and simulated wheat plant heights were compared 2 3 model evaluation model evaluation was based on experiment of plexiglass columns under rainout shelter in 2015 2016 growing season the statistic of root mean square error rmse eq 18 and willmott index of agreement wia eq 19 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the newly established model for plant height simulation through comparisons between model simulations and field observations of plant height the point where with the highest growth rate is defined as inflection point of ontogeny curve thornley and france 2007 therefore another index of model evaluation was the simulation accuracy of inflection point of plant height 18 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 19 wia 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o s i o 2 where n is the sample size s i is the simulation o i is the observation and o is the averaged observation 3 results 3 1 simulating wheat height dynamics in 2014 2015 growing season according to the results of soil water stress experiment it was found that wheat height elongation rate was negatively influenced by water stress the stem elongation rate of treatment d no irrigation was close to zero when water stress occurred at greening and jointing stages d2 and d3 stem elongation slowed down significantly fig 2 c f each new model was able to satisfactorily simulate the dynamics of winter wheat plant height under different treatments when soil water stress occurred at the greening and jointing stages d2 and d3 however all of the six new models failed to catch the inflection point of the plant height elongation fig 2c f which was probably the main source of simulation error among the six new models plant height elongation rates of the mod mis and mod von models were higher than those of the other models at the emergence stage which was not consistent with the physiological characteristics of wheat in addition simulated wheat plant heights by the mod mis model were higher than the observations before the inflection point but lower than observations after the inflection point the simulated wheat plant heights by the mod wei model were close to observations before the inflection point but lower than observations after the inflection point however the plant height dynamic of winter wheat simulated by mod log and mod ric were more consistent with dynamic observations than other models 3 2 model calibration and validation according to the rmse of wheat height simulations for the calibration dataset fig 3 a it was found that the general average rmse of six different plant height models i e mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von mod wei were 5 74 5 47 7 40 5 62 5 62 and 5 43 cm fig 3a and the general average wia were 0 88 0 95 0 82 0 89 0 88 0 89 and 0 89 fig 3b respectively both statistical indicators indicated that mod log and mod wei models obtained the highest simulation accuracy among the six models in addition model performance in wheat plant height simulation varied among different wheat cultivars the early ripening cultivar pumai9 and xinong979 had higher averaged wia in plant height simulations in the 2014 2015 fig 3b with an averaged wia of 0 90 and 2015 2016 fig 4 b with an averaged wia of 0 94 growing season respectively when compared to middle ripening and end ripening cultivars this was probably due to the different responses of various ripening wheats to soil water stress however the differences in plant height simulation accuracy were generally small among different cultivars furthermore within different irrigation treatments model simulation accuracies were also different both statistical indicators indicated that i1d1 i1d4 i2d1 and i2d4 showed better estimation than i1d2 i1d3 i2d2 and i2d3 by all the six wheat height models tables in fig 3 a b overall the plant heights of i2 related treatments were better simulated with averaged rmse and wia of 5 88 cm and 0 95 than i1 related treatments with averaged rmse and wia of 5 98 cm and 0 92 by all of the six models unfortunately since some of the soil moisture sensors in i1 related treatments were damaged in 2016 only the experimental data of the ck d and i2 related treatments i2d1 i2d2 i2d3 and i2d4 table 1 were complete and used for model validation in model validation rmse values indicated that the mod log model obtained the highest simulation accuracy among the six models however wia of the mod geo model was the highest among the six models in wheat height simulation generally based on the results of both calibration and validation with the soil column experiment data the mod log model was able to obtain higher accuracy than the other simulation models under all of the soil water stress scenarios tables in figs 3 and 4 the averaged wia of model calibration and validation were 0 86 and 0 93 figs 3b and 4 b averaged by ck i2d4 i2d3 i2d2 i2d1 and d treatments which means the results of model validation were slightly better than model calibration 3 3 model verification with the open field experiment data based on the independent data of field experiments conducted under a giant rain shelter in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the newly established plant height simulation models of winter wheat were further evaluated generally the mod mis mod von and mod wei models had bigger simulation errors before the inflection point fig 5 which was the same as model calibration and validation with the soil column experiment data moreover after the inflection point plant heights simulated by the mod mis model was lower than the observations fig 5 however plant heights simulated by the mod geo mod log and mod ric models were close to the observation when compared with the mod mis mod von and mod wei models the averaged rmse values of six new models i e mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von mod wei were 7 03 6 63 14 41 6 69 6 88 and 9 58 cm in 2012 2013 growing season fig 6 a respectively and the averaged wia values of six new models were 0 98 0 98 0 88 0 98 0 98 and 0 96 in 2012 2013 growing season fig 6c respectively compared with the 2012 2013 model verification results all of the six new models obtained higher accuracies in the 2013 2014 verification with averaged rmse values of 4 64 4 98 7 83 5 12 4 82 and 4 06 cm fig 6b and averaged wia values of six new models were 0 99 0 99 0 95 0 98 0 99 and 0 99 fig 6d respectively the averaged simulation wia of irrigation levels i2 and i1 were 0 96 0 96 0 96 and 0 97 in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively fig 6 contrast to the model calibration and calibration in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 based on soil column experiment data fig 2 irrigation level had little impact on the accuracies of plant height simulations in the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 evaluation based on field experiment data this was probably because a w of 0 100 cm soil layer in each treatment was greater than 0 65 before the heading period in 2013 2014 fig 5 and 2012 2013 growing season when a w was greater than 0 65 the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat was not affected by soil water content in general the results of double verifications based on the soil column and open field experiments showed that the first derivative of the growth functions of gompertz logistic and richards which were modified by the function of f w were able to accurately quantify the dynamic response of plant height elongation rate of winter wheat to soil water stress compared with the other models in the four growing seasons of winter wheat the mod log model had relatively lower error averaged rmse and wia of 5 26 cm and 0 95 in simulating plant height of winter wheat and the accuracy variation was also the smallest standard deviation of rmse and wia of 1 58 cm and 0 05 fig 7 4 discussions plant height is an important trait in wheat breeding as it is a key parameter affecting lodging and thus grain yield and grain quality wurschum et al 2015 both genes and environment affect wheat plant height elongation kato et al 1999 in northwest of china the plant height of winter wheat is at most 20 cm shorter for plants suffering severe water stress than the fully irrigated ones sun et al 2014 thus it is important to understand the influences of soil water stress on plant height of winter wheat in this study the first derivative of six common growth functions were modified by a water stress response function f w and a temperature response function f t established in this study to quantify the dynamic response of elongation rate of winter wheat plant height to soil water stress the growth function with more flexible inflection point usually had better plasticity which makes the growth function better fit the biological ontogeny paine et al 2012 the inflection point flexibility depends on the form of the growth function the number of parameters and the parameter values zeide 1993 generally logistic von bertalanffy and richard functions contain three or more than three parameters while gompertz and mischerlich functions contain only one parameter tsoularis and wallace 2002 zeide 1993 what s more the inflection points of gompertz and logistic functions were fixed while the inflection points of richards and von bertalanffy functions were floating tsoularis and wallace 2002 zeide 1993 both the numerator and denominator of the first derivative of logistic and richards had exponential functions which lead to more symmetrical curve richard 1959 suggested that the plasticity of the weibull growth function was worse than that of gompertz logistic and richards in general mod log and mod ric could more reasonably and accurately simulate the plant height of winter wheat xing et al 1998 winter wheat grows slowly during the wintering stage and the rapid stem elongation appears in the jointing stage milthorpe and moorby 1975 however the plant height elongation rates simulated by the mod mis and mod von models were rapid after emergence figs 2 and 5 which contradicted the actual growth of winter wheat song et al 2016 suggested that richards function were more suitable for describing the growth process of organisms the richards function has four parameters but the shape parameter of m may have high uncertainty in parameter estimation paine et al 2012 xing et al 1998 thus the mod log model obtained the best values of rmse and wia among the six different plant height simulation models the maximum plant height of representative winter wheat cultivars was 60 90 cm in rainfed dryland in shaanxi province in the 2010s sun et al 2014 in this study wheat growth was affected by soil water stress the range of maximum observed plant height was 20 70 cm compared with other five models the mod log model obtained the best general values of rmse fig 7a 5 26 cm and wia fig 7b 0 95 between simulated and observed plant height of winter wheat under different water stress scenarios in the four growing seasons generally logistic function can obtain higher accuracy in height simulation weiss et al 2009 coupled logistic function with the cropsyst model to simulate plant height of winter wheat with genetic information in nebraska there was a good agreement between the height measurements and simulations plant height and leaf area index are two indicators of wheat extensibility growth in the ceres wheat and stics models in the ceres wheat and stics models brisson et al 2003 the effects of water stress on wheat extensibility growth were quantified by the ratio of potential root water uptake and potential transpiration turfac turgor factor turfac equals to 1 0 when there was no water and decreases once potential water uptake are less than 1 5 times of potential transpiration then the extensible growth of wheat will decrease linearly guénaëlle et al 2009 he et al 2013 jonesa et al 2003 in this study based on the experimental data it was found that when a w was greater than 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height was not influenced by soil water content when a w was between 0 3 and 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height gradually reduced following an exponential function driven by water stress when a w was less than 0 30 elongation rate of wheat height rapidly and linearly reduced driven by water stress until a w was close to 0 where the elongation stopped compared with the results of model calibration and validation with the soil column experiment data the soil water stress a w of eight treatments in the open field was greater than 0 65 before the flowering stage and thus the plant height of winter wheat was less affected by soil water stress ali et al 2007 also suggested that the plant height of winter wheat was less affected by lighter soil water stress in open fields however different soil textures have different water holding capacities dexter 2004 generally crops growth in soils with higher water holding capacity are less likely to be influenced by soil water stress and vice versa wang et al 2017 thus soil texture may have an influence on the threshold of the water stress response function in this study which needs further research 5 conclusions in this study we modified the first derivatives of six different common growth functions i e gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibull by a soil water stress response function f w and a temperature response function f t to quantify the influences of soil water stress and temperature on the elongation rate of winter wheat plant height consequently six new plant height simulation models were established then all of six new models were calibrated and evaluated based on data obtained from the soil column and open field experiments conducted under rainout shelter some main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the elongation rate of plant height responded linearly and non linearly to soil water stress during the linear response stage the thresholds of relative soil water availability in the water stress response function were 0 0 and 0 30 and during the non linear response stage the thresholds of relative soil water availability were 0 3 0 65 when relative soil water availability was greater than 0 65 or close to 0 elongation rate of wheat plant height was not affected by soil water content or was close to 0 2 compared with the other five models i e mod geo mod log mod mis mod von and mod wei the mod log or modified logistic model was able to more accurately simulate the elongation rate and dynamics of winter wheat plant height under different scenarios of soil water stress with less accuracy variation in the 2012 2016 growing seasons furthermore the simulated elongation rate and plant height by the mod log model were more consistent with the actual physiological growth of winter wheat stem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

10696,plant height is an important trait that influences the yield and sustainability of wheat productions it is also an important objective for agronomic breeding and a critical indicator to represent the status of crop growth and nitrogen absorption in the vegetative stage wheat is the main crop in arid regions however there is insufficient understanding of wheat plant height response to soil water stress in this study we tried to explore a new algorithm for simulating dynamics of winter wheat height under different scenarios of soil water stress based on soil column and field experiments conducted under rainout shelters between 2012 and 2016 at yangling shaanxi province china first we established a temperature response function of wheat plant height based on four cardinal temperatures i e base temperature lower optimal temperature higher optimal temperature and ceiling temperature and we also constructed a water stress response function of wheat plant height using relative soil water availability aw as water stress index then these two functions were used as multipliers to modify the first order derivative of six distinct growth functions i e gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibull to represent the elongation rate of wheat plant height under soil water stresses consequently six modified simulation models for wheat plant height were established and identified as mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von and mod wei respectively among which an optimal simulation model was selected for winter wheat growth under soil water stresses based on experimental data of 2014 2015 used for model calibration it was found that when aw was greater than 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height was not influenced by soil water content when aw was between 0 3 and 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height gradually reduced following an exponential function driven by water stress when aw was less than 0 30 elongation rate of wheat height rapidly and linearly reduced driven by water stress until aw was close to 0 at which the elongation stopped after that the data of soil column experiment of 2014 2015 growing season were used to assess the parameters of the six newly established models the results of model calibration showed that the mean value of the willmott index of agreement wia between measured and simulated wheat heights of the six cultivars were all less than 0 90 for all treatments in the experiment except for the mod log model 0 95 the data of soil column experiment in 2015 2016 seasons were used to validate the six calibrated new models the results of model validation with mean value of wia 0 93 which were even better than model calibration finally the data of two growing seasons 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 of field experiments conducted under a giant rainout shelter were used for further verification of the six new models under field conditions among the six different plant height simulation model mod log model obtained the best values of rmse and wia keywords winter wheat water stress growth function plant height crop modeling 1 introduction plant height as an important index to reflect crop growth and nitrogen absorption in vegetative stage is an important character affecting yield of wheat and other crops it is also an important trait of crop breeding yao et al 2011 besides plant height is one of the major driving factors in modeling yield loss due to lodging berry et al 2003 sterling et al 2003 baker et al 1998 simulated wheat lodging and found that the variation of gravity center of wheat height influence wheat lodging risk plant height simulation is also important for the three dimensional construction of crop canopy structure burgess et al 2015 additionally crop plant height is an indispensable variable for simulating crop intercropping systems as it is one of the main factors that affect the ability of the crop light interception guénaëlle et al 2009 however models simulating crop plant heights were rarely developed and used in the last decades some widely used models such as the ceres family models ritchie et al 1988 ignored plant height simulations since they considered canopy as a monolayer when simulating the light interception confalonieri et al 2011 recently the importance of plant height in modeling canopy micrometeorology was gradually recognized by researchers fang et al 2014 fang et al 2014 coupled a plant height model with the revised rz shaw model and improved the accuracy of simulations of evapotranspiration and energy balance in a wheat maize cropping system furthermore some simple methods have been proposed to simulate plant height lizaso et al 2005 described the corn plant height as the final function driven by maximum plant height and development stage kotera and nawata 2007 presented a plant height simulation method in a rice model driven by average daily temperature plant height of the day before and maximum plant height another method based on lai was implemented in cropsyst model bechini and stöckle 2007 among these crop plant height simulation models the lizaso et al 2005 model used maximum plant height and phenology to drive plant height elongation kotera and nawata 2007 only considered temperature as driving variable however soil water stress was insufficiently considered to crop plant height simulation growth function is generally used to denote an analytical function that connect dry weight to time thornley and france 2007 at present common growth functions used to study biological ontogeny and mainly include gompertz gompertz 1825 logistic verhulst 1838 mischerlich mitscherlich 1928 richards richard 1959 von bertalanffy von bertalanffy 1957 and weibull weibull 1951 von bertalanffy function was proposed by von bertalanffy 1957 and later was used to simulate the height of trees oyamakin and chukwu 2014 richards function evolved from the von bertalanffy function richard 1959 and evolved into three functions such as logistic gompertz and mischerlich xing et al 1998 zwietering et al 1990 most of these growth functions were utilized to simulate the development of animals and trees in recent years a small number of studies have applied them to the ontogeny of field crops setiyono et al 2008 wu et al 2015 winter wheat is the main staple food in arid and semi arid areas of northern china where drought is the principal limiting factor to wheat production studies have shown that severe soil water stress can lead to a reduction in wheat canopy height ali et al 2007 sun et al 2014 xiangxiang et al 2014 therefore understanding and modeling the response of plant height to water stress are of great importance in this study modeling of plant height under different levels of soil water stress was investigated the objectives of this study were 1 to establish a temperature response function f t and a soil water stress response function f w to quantify the response of plant height of winter wheat to temperature and soil water stress based on controlled field experiments 2 to create and evaluate new plant height models of winter wheat that took into account soil water stress through modifications of six common growth functions of gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibul and 3 to compare the different new wheat plant height models and identify the optimal one for future simulations of plant height of winter wheat in arid and semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments of soil water stresses at different growth stages of winter wheat 2 1 1 experiments in plexiglass columns under rainout shelter the first batch of experiments of soil water stresses at different growth stages of winter wheat were conducted in the key laboratory for agricultural soil and water engineering in arid area of ministry of education northwest a f university 34 17 n 108 04 e 506 m in china wheat crops were planted in plexiglass columns placed under a rainout shelter for two consecutive growing seasons of 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the data of 2014 2015 was used for developing and parameterizing new simulation models of plant height the data of 2015 2016 was used to evaluate the established the newly plant height models the height inner and outer diameter of plexiglass columns were 60 cm 38 cm and 40 cm respectively there were several small pores and a 1 2 cm interlayer at the bottom of each column a column of four small pores 2 cm were reserved on the side of each column for installations of soil water sensors at 15 25 35 and 45 cm from the top edge the installed soil water sensors ec 5 decagon company u s a and weighing sensors mh1124 250 kg mhsensor company germany measured soil water content and evapotranspiration et at a daily step respectively a data logger cr3000 campbell company u s a was used to record data once an hour automatically two early ripening cultivars pumai 9 and xiong 979 two middle ripening cultivars xiaoyan 22 and xigao 2 and two late ripening cultivars xinmai 23 and zhengmai 7698 of winter wheat were planted the columns were refilled with mixed local soil luo soil layer by layer with a layer depth of 50 cm and a bulk density of 1 2 g cm 3 the field capacity and permanent wilting point of top soil were 0 280 and 0 131 cm3 cm 3 in the 2014 2015 growing season and 0 291 and 0 142 cm3 cm 3 in the 2015 2016 growing season respectively for fertilizer management a mixture of 0 347 g urea and 0 2 g kh2po4 per kg dry soil was applied as basal fertilizer the top surface of each column was split into six equal sectors ten wheat seeds of each cultivar were placed in a corresponding sector which amounted to a planting density of 529 plant m 2 the planting dates were october 21st in 2014 and october 19th in 215 the harvest dates were may 27th in 2015 and june 1st in 2016 the experimental design included two factors of water stress period and irrigation depth table 1 the water stress period included four levels i e water stress at winter stage d1 greening stage d2 jointing stage d3 and grain filling stage d4 the irrigation depth included two levels of i1 45 mm and i2 90 mm based on the average water requirements of winter wheat in this region additionally a treatment with 90 mm irrigations at all four different stages ck and another treatment without any irrigation at any stage d were designed for comparisons hence there were a total of sixty different treatments involved there were three replicates for each treatment which led to a total of 30 plexiglass columns an irrigation of 90 mm was applied to each column two weeks before planting to guarantee the water requirements for emergence and juvenile growth of winter wheat more details about the experiment could be found in the study by liu et al 2016 2 1 2 experiments in open field under rainout shelter the second batch of experiments of soil water stresses at different growth stages of winter wheat were conducted in open fields under a giant rainout shelter in two consecutive growth seasons of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the experiment site was same as the previous experiments the data of these experiments were mainly used to verify the newly developed plant height simulation model of winter wheat under field conditions for weather conditions the daily temperatures and solar radiation in 2012 2016 at the experimental site were shown in fig 1 the soil type of the experimental site was also local lou soil with a ph of 8 14 total organic carbon of 8 20 g kg 1 and total nitrogen of 0 62 g kg 1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer the area of each plot was about 8 0 m2 adjacent plots were separated by polyethylene plastic films buried 1 5 m below soil surface to prevent subsurface water flow the winter wheat cultivar tested was xiaoyan 22 a very popular cultivar planted in the guanzhong plain where the experimental site is located the planting dates were october 15th both in 2012 and 2013 dry wheat seeds were sown in drill with a planting depth of 5 6 cm row spacing of 25 cm and planting density of 400 plant m 2 the harvest dates were june 1 st in 2013 and june 7th in 2014 respectively the fertilizer application rate was the same for all treatments with a base fertilizer of 140 kg n ha 1 and 50 kg p2o5 ha 1 but without top dressing the experimental factors also included irrigation levels and water stress periods table 2 based on the average water requirements of winter wheat in this region two irrigation levels of i 1 40 mm and i 2 80 mm were involved however unlike the plexiglass columns experiments the whole life cycle of winter wheat was divided into five different development stages in the open field experiments i e wintering greening jointing heading and grain filling soil water stress occurred at a single growth stage might have relatively limited influences but water stress occurred at two adjacent stages might cause more serious influences on wheat growth in this case each water stress period included two adjacent growth stages i e wintering greening d 1 greening jointing d 2 jointing heading d 3 and heading grain filling d 4 thus there was consequently a total of eight treatments with three replicates for each treatment table 2 a total of 24 plots followed a split plot experimental design and were arranged under a giant movable rainout shelter to exclude the influences of natural precipitation a representative quadrat of 1 m2 was randomly selected and marked in each plot to determine the final yield and plant height which must not be disturbed during the whole growing season regular soil and plant sampling were conducted at a random place covered by crop plants but outside the quadrat during the experiments a meter ruler was used to measure the heights of representative winter wheat plants between 11 30 a m and 13 30 p m in the quadrat the frequency of plant height measurement was twice a week before jointing and once a week after jointing more experimental details and results could be found in the research by yao et al 2015 2 2 development of plant height simulation models of winter wheat 2 2 1 growth functions the richards function eq 4 is evolved from the generalized von bertalanffy function eq 5 the other growth functions evolved from the richards function includes

height elongation of winter wheat based on the assumption that temperature and soil water content directly affect plant height elongation rate rather than state variables of plant height the first derivatives of six growth functions i e gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibull which were modified by temperature response function f t eq 14 and soil water stress response function f w eq 17 were used to quantify the influences of temperature and soil water stress on plant height elongation eqs 8 13 we denoted these simulation models of winter wheat plant height under water stress as mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von and mod wei respectively additionally it was assumed that winter wheat reached its maximum height at flowering stage in this study 8 δ h g n e t

response function hanks 1974 kang et al 2000 liu et al 2016 since the root growth was not observed the average relative soil water availability of 0 60 cm soil layer was adopted during the whole growing season in plexiglass columns experiments for the field experiments under rainout shelter since soil water contents were only discretely sampled during the whole growing season the simulated soil water contents by using the dssat ceres wheat model were used to calculate a w instead 15 a w i θ a i θ w p i θ f i θ w p i 16 a w i 1 n a w i n where θ a i is the actual volumetric soil water content at the i th soil layer cm3 cm 3 θ f i is the field capacity at the i th soil layer cm3 cm 3 θ w p i is the permanent wilting point in the i th soil layer cm3 cm 3 and a w i is the relative soil water availability at the i th soil layer and n is the number of soil layer consequently a soil water response function of plant height of winter wheat was established eq 17 in this study we compared the observed and the simulated plant heights and found that when the values of a w was greater than 0 65 the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat was not influenced by soil water stress when the a w was between 0 3 and 0 65 soil water stress exponentially affected the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat when a w was lower than 0 3 soil water stress linearly inhibited the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat until a w approached 0 where wheat plant height no longer elongated 17 f w 1 a w 0 65 exp a w 0 65 0 3 a w 0 65 a w 0 2 0 a w 0 3 0 a w 0 where a w is the relative effective soil water content 2 2 3 estimation of model parameters experiment of plexiglass columns under rainout shelter in 2014 2015 growing season was used to estimated model parameters the parameters of the six modified models were estimated based on comparisons between the observed and simulated of plant heights and through the solver add in in the ms excel table 3 since the control ck treatment were fully irrigated its observed plant height at emergence about 2 cm was taken as the best estimation of parameter h 0 and its maximum plant height was used as the best estimation of parameter a the remaining parameters were estimated using the least square method finally a set of parameter values was obtained for each wheat cultivar which could satisfactorily meet the simulation precision requirements for all treatments table 3 then the differences between the observed and simulated wheat plant heights were compared 2 3 model evaluation model evaluation was based on experiment of plexiglass columns under rainout shelter in 2015 2016 growing season the statistic of root mean square error rmse eq 18 and willmott index of agreement wia eq 19 were used to evaluate the accuracy of the newly established model for plant height simulation through comparisons between model simulations and field observations of plant height the point where with the highest growth rate is defined as inflection point of ontogeny curve thornley and france 2007 therefore another index of model evaluation was the simulation accuracy of inflection point of plant height 18 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 19 wia 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o s i o 2 where n is the sample size s i is the simulation o i is the observation and o is the averaged observation 3 results 3 1 simulating wheat height dynamics in 2014 2015 growing season according to the results of soil water stress experiment it was found that wheat height elongation rate was negatively influenced by water stress the stem elongation rate of treatment d no irrigation was close to zero when water stress occurred at greening and jointing stages d2 and d3 stem elongation slowed down significantly fig 2 c f each new model was able to satisfactorily simulate the dynamics of winter wheat plant height under different treatments when soil water stress occurred at the greening and jointing stages d2 and d3 however all of the six new models failed to catch the inflection point of the plant height elongation fig 2c f which was probably the main source of simulation error among the six new models plant height elongation rates of the mod mis and mod von models were higher than those of the other models at the emergence stage which was not consistent with the physiological characteristics of wheat in addition simulated wheat plant heights by the mod mis model were higher than the observations before the inflection point but lower than observations after the inflection point the simulated wheat plant heights by the mod wei model were close to observations before the inflection point but lower than observations after the inflection point however the plant height dynamic of winter wheat simulated by mod log and mod ric were more consistent with dynamic observations than other models 3 2 model calibration and validation according to the rmse of wheat height simulations for the calibration dataset fig 3 a it was found that the general average rmse of six different plant height models i e mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von mod wei were 5 74 5 47 7 40 5 62 5 62 and 5 43 cm fig 3a and the general average wia were 0 88 0 95 0 82 0 89 0 88 0 89 and 0 89 fig 3b respectively both statistical indicators indicated that mod log and mod wei models obtained the highest simulation accuracy among the six models in addition model performance in wheat plant height simulation varied among different wheat cultivars the early ripening cultivar pumai9 and xinong979 had higher averaged wia in plant height simulations in the 2014 2015 fig 3b with an averaged wia of 0 90 and 2015 2016 fig 4 b with an averaged wia of 0 94 growing season respectively when compared to middle ripening and end ripening cultivars this was probably due to the different responses of various ripening wheats to soil water stress however the differences in plant height simulation accuracy were generally small among different cultivars furthermore within different irrigation treatments model simulation accuracies were also different both statistical indicators indicated that i1d1 i1d4 i2d1 and i2d4 showed better estimation than i1d2 i1d3 i2d2 and i2d3 by all the six wheat height models tables in fig 3 a b overall the plant heights of i2 related treatments were better simulated with averaged rmse and wia of 5 88 cm and 0 95 than i1 related treatments with averaged rmse and wia of 5 98 cm and 0 92 by all of the six models unfortunately since some of the soil moisture sensors in i1 related treatments were damaged in 2016 only the experimental data of the ck d and i2 related treatments i2d1 i2d2 i2d3 and i2d4 table 1 were complete and used for model validation in model validation rmse values indicated that the mod log model obtained the highest simulation accuracy among the six models however wia of the mod geo model was the highest among the six models in wheat height simulation generally based on the results of both calibration and validation with the soil column experiment data the mod log model was able to obtain higher accuracy than the other simulation models under all of the soil water stress scenarios tables in figs 3 and 4 the averaged wia of model calibration and validation were 0 86 and 0 93 figs 3b and 4 b averaged by ck i2d4 i2d3 i2d2 i2d1 and d treatments which means the results of model validation were slightly better than model calibration 3 3 model verification with the open field experiment data based on the independent data of field experiments conducted under a giant rain shelter in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the newly established plant height simulation models of winter wheat were further evaluated generally the mod mis mod von and mod wei models had bigger simulation errors before the inflection point fig 5 which was the same as model calibration and validation with the soil column experiment data moreover after the inflection point plant heights simulated by the mod mis model was lower than the observations fig 5 however plant heights simulated by the mod geo mod log and mod ric models were close to the observation when compared with the mod mis mod von and mod wei models the averaged rmse values of six new models i e mod geo mod log mod mis mod ric mod von mod wei were 7 03 6 63 14 41 6 69 6 88 and 9 58 cm in 2012 2013 growing season fig 6 a respectively and the averaged wia values of six new models were 0 98 0 98 0 88 0 98 0 98 and 0 96 in 2012 2013 growing season fig 6c respectively compared with the 2012 2013 model verification results all of the six new models obtained higher accuracies in the 2013 2014 verification with averaged rmse values of 4 64 4 98 7 83 5 12 4 82 and 4 06 cm fig 6b and averaged wia values of six new models were 0 99 0 99 0 95 0 98 0 99 and 0 99 fig 6d respectively the averaged simulation wia of irrigation levels i2 and i1 were 0 96 0 96 0 96 and 0 97 in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively fig 6 contrast to the model calibration and calibration in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 based on soil column experiment data fig 2 irrigation level had little impact on the accuracies of plant height simulations in the 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 evaluation based on field experiment data this was probably because a w of 0 100 cm soil layer in each treatment was greater than 0 65 before the heading period in 2013 2014 fig 5 and 2012 2013 growing season when a w was greater than 0 65 the plant height elongation rate of winter wheat was not affected by soil water content in general the results of double verifications based on the soil column and open field experiments showed that the first derivative of the growth functions of gompertz logistic and richards which were modified by the function of f w were able to accurately quantify the dynamic response of plant height elongation rate of winter wheat to soil water stress compared with the other models in the four growing seasons of winter wheat the mod log model had relatively lower error averaged rmse and wia of 5 26 cm and 0 95 in simulating plant height of winter wheat and the accuracy variation was also the smallest standard deviation of rmse and wia of 1 58 cm and 0 05 fig 7 4 discussions plant height is an important trait in wheat breeding as it is a key parameter affecting lodging and thus grain yield and grain quality wurschum et al 2015 both genes and environment affect wheat plant height elongation kato et al 1999 in northwest of china the plant height of winter wheat is at most 20 cm shorter for plants suffering severe water stress than the fully irrigated ones sun et al 2014 thus it is important to understand the influences of soil water stress on plant height of winter wheat in this study the first derivative of six common growth functions were modified by a water stress response function f w and a temperature response function f t established in this study to quantify the dynamic response of elongation rate of winter wheat plant height to soil water stress the growth function with more flexible inflection point usually had better plasticity which makes the growth function better fit the biological ontogeny paine et al 2012 the inflection point flexibility depends on the form of the growth function the number of parameters and the parameter values zeide 1993 generally logistic von bertalanffy and richard functions contain three or more than three parameters while gompertz and mischerlich functions contain only one parameter tsoularis and wallace 2002 zeide 1993 what s more the inflection points of gompertz and logistic functions were fixed while the inflection points of richards and von bertalanffy functions were floating tsoularis and wallace 2002 zeide 1993 both the numerator and denominator of the first derivative of logistic and richards had exponential functions which lead to more symmetrical curve richard 1959 suggested that the plasticity of the weibull growth function was worse than that of gompertz logistic and richards in general mod log and mod ric could more reasonably and accurately simulate the plant height of winter wheat xing et al 1998 winter wheat grows slowly during the wintering stage and the rapid stem elongation appears in the jointing stage milthorpe and moorby 1975 however the plant height elongation rates simulated by the mod mis and mod von models were rapid after emergence figs 2 and 5 which contradicted the actual growth of winter wheat song et al 2016 suggested that richards function were more suitable for describing the growth process of organisms the richards function has four parameters but the shape parameter of m may have high uncertainty in parameter estimation paine et al 2012 xing et al 1998 thus the mod log model obtained the best values of rmse and wia among the six different plant height simulation models the maximum plant height of representative winter wheat cultivars was 60 90 cm in rainfed dryland in shaanxi province in the 2010s sun et al 2014 in this study wheat growth was affected by soil water stress the range of maximum observed plant height was 20 70 cm compared with other five models the mod log model obtained the best general values of rmse fig 7a 5 26 cm and wia fig 7b 0 95 between simulated and observed plant height of winter wheat under different water stress scenarios in the four growing seasons generally logistic function can obtain higher accuracy in height simulation weiss et al 2009 coupled logistic function with the cropsyst model to simulate plant height of winter wheat with genetic information in nebraska there was a good agreement between the height measurements and simulations plant height and leaf area index are two indicators of wheat extensibility growth in the ceres wheat and stics models in the ceres wheat and stics models brisson et al 2003 the effects of water stress on wheat extensibility growth were quantified by the ratio of potential root water uptake and potential transpiration turfac turgor factor turfac equals to 1 0 when there was no water and decreases once potential water uptake are less than 1 5 times of potential transpiration then the extensible growth of wheat will decrease linearly guénaëlle et al 2009 he et al 2013 jonesa et al 2003 in this study based on the experimental data it was found that when a w was greater than 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height was not influenced by soil water content when a w was between 0 3 and 0 65 elongation rate of wheat height gradually reduced following an exponential function driven by water stress when a w was less than 0 30 elongation rate of wheat height rapidly and linearly reduced driven by water stress until a w was close to 0 where the elongation stopped compared with the results of model calibration and validation with the soil column experiment data the soil water stress a w of eight treatments in the open field was greater than 0 65 before the flowering stage and thus the plant height of winter wheat was less affected by soil water stress ali et al 2007 also suggested that the plant height of winter wheat was less affected by lighter soil water stress in open fields however different soil textures have different water holding capacities dexter 2004 generally crops growth in soils with higher water holding capacity are less likely to be influenced by soil water stress and vice versa wang et al 2017 thus soil texture may have an influence on the threshold of the water stress response function in this study which needs further research 5 conclusions in this study we modified the first derivatives of six different common growth functions i e gompertz logistic mischerlich richards von bertalanffy and weibull by a soil water stress response function f w and a temperature response function f t to quantify the influences of soil water stress and temperature on the elongation rate of winter wheat plant height consequently six new plant height simulation models were established then all of six new models were calibrated and evaluated based on data obtained from the soil column and open field experiments conducted under rainout shelter some main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the elongation rate of plant height responded linearly and non linearly to soil water stress during the linear response stage the thresholds of relative soil water availability in the water stress response function were 0 0 and 0 30 and during the non linear response stage the thresholds of relative soil water availability were 0 3 0 65 when relative soil water availability was greater than 0 65 or close to 0 elongation rate of wheat plant height was not affected by soil water content or was close to 0 2 compared with the other five models i e mod geo mod log mod mis mod von and mod wei the mod log or modified logistic model was able to more accurately simulate the elongation rate and dynamics of winter wheat plant height under different scenarios of soil water stress with less accuracy variation in the 2012 2016 growing seasons furthermore the simulated elongation rate and plant height by the mod log model were more consistent with the actual physiological growth of winter wheat stem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

10697,land degradation with water logging and salinity is global problem especially in arid and semiarid regions as an alternative for capital intensive engineering approaches plantation forestry has been advocated as an eco friendly option to offset hydrological imbalances bio drainage mainly for dryland salinity conditions with robust monitoring world over reforestation mainly with fast growing versatile eucalyptus species have emerged as the most water profligate these lower the water table by extracting soil water throughout the year and even from deeper soil and phreatic zones the annual evapo transpiration of plantations vary from about 0 2 to 0 8 times ope open pan evaporation under dryland conditions and can equal or even exceed ope under irrigated conditions the factors like soil and climatic conditions groundwater depth and its quality growth rates of tree species their stocking patterns and the geometries and fraction of area under plantations define their effectiveness for water table draw down and salinity control nevertheless the emerging arguments against bio management include long time lag high land requirements and decline in their efficiency with salinity build up underneath plantations to overcome these constraints shifting plantations in between discharge and recharge areas reforestation with salt tolerant species integrating these with cropping systems and even with engineering measures in saline discharge areas are the alternate options the gainful employment of bio drainage demands the diagnosis of typical areas to be reforested in catchments using gis remote sensing tools the development of decision support systems dss for appropriate designing of reforestation strategies and their amalgamation with existing farming systems benefits of plantations beyond on and off site salinity control should aim at enhanced farm incomes restoring biodiversity and particularly carbon trading when global interests are now targeting climate mitigation keywords bio drainage water logging control tree water use salinity mitigation plantation forestry groundwater balance 1 introduction land degradation with salinity is a widespread problem of arid and semi arid regions especially where seepage from irrigation systems induces rise in water table and consequently build up of excessive salts in soils to impair crop production ghassemi et al 1995 hydrological disturbances like extensive forest clearance for agricultural purposes also results in large portions of rainfall to flow through soils to cumulate at recharge sites and thus leading to dryland salinity problems rengasamy 2006 mcfarlane et al 2016 about 19 5 of globally irrigated 45 million ha and 2 1 of dryland 32 million ha agricultural lands across about 100 countries are afflicted by salinity with extensive and undesirable impacts on economy and environment fao 2015 the salinity is an adjunct of irrigated agriculture particularly where internal drainage is impeded and water conveying canals distributaries are at a higher elevation than the adjoining land and when pumping of groundwater is lower than the incoming seepage singh 1994 the typical regions where large scale landscapes are afflicted by salinity problems include parts of several river basins like amu and syr darya in central asia euphrates in western asia indo gangetic plains and indus basin in south asia murray darling basin in australia yellow river in china and the san joaquin valley usa qadir et al 2014 the secondary salinity is projected to amplify with global warming the prevalence of faulty irrigation practices and other anthropogenic activities minhas and obi reddy 2017 rehabilitating the saline and waterlogged lands involves salt leaching through downward flux of water and maintenance of water table at depth that creates congenial conditions for appropriate root proliferation aeration and trafficability the engineering techniques like surface and sub surface drainage groundwater pumping are quite effective for control of water logging and salinity kamra 2015 specifically the design and management of subsurface drainage systems have evolved tremendously in the past few decades ayars and evans 2015 nevertheless these are constrained by high capital outlays in addition to their operation and maintenance problems ritzema et al 2008 moreover the safe disposal of drainage water continues to be a major environmental issue therefore forestry plantations with deep rooted trees i e bio drainage was proposed especially for dryland salinity control morris and benyon 2005 marcar 2009 mcfarlane et al 2016 minhas and dagar 2016a trees help in controlling water fluxes to recharge sites and directly access groundwater for their transpiration and thereby restore hydrological balances ellis and vandijk 2009 in irrigated areas tree plantations further help in halting seepage occurring from canals manjunatha et al 2005 several ancillary benefits include a broad range of products like fuel wood fodder timber etc carbon sequestration improvement insoil s physico chemical properties and the ecological benefits of restoring biodiversity minhas and dagar 2016b however the arguments against their effective use for salinity control or bio drainage include long time lags for salinity improvement harper et al 2017 lack of realistic estimate of evapo transpiration of plantations morris and benyon 2005 and salinity accumulation in deeper soils after water uptake by tree roots which may affect their later growth vis à vis sustainability moreover a number of location specific features like nature of soils annual precipitation salinity tolerance and the patterns of water use by forestry trees the supplies of irrigation water ground water table depth etc control the overall complexities of salinity dynamics in soils marcar 2009 all these factors may affect the effectiveness of tree plantations to control water logging and salinity the viability of plantation forestry options have been discussed at large for dryland salinity control especially under continental climate of australia marcar 2016 mcfarlane et al 2016 harper et al 2017 however soil climatic and canopy conditions of plantations vary a lot world over both spatially and temporally and these reflect in water and salt dynamics in the catchments therefore for general guidelines on the use of plantations for salinity control site specific conditions should be duly considered to update our knowledge this attempt is to present current state of the science and to generate discussion on soil climate and other agro ecosystem conditions where possibilities of success with plantations are emerging the chief objectives of this compilation include i analysis of the role of plantation based systems considering eco hydrological and other factual information on their evapo transpiration and catchment water yields ii evaluation of current designs and practices for defining their effectiveness under specific soil and climatic conditions groundwater depth and its quality growth rates of species planted their stocking patterns and the geometries etc and iii viable alternatives for improvement in their performance especially the possibilities of their integration for halting or reversing the salinity and water logging problems we hope this would improve scientific basis for policy decisions making so as to have effective and integrated controls on waterlogging and salinity problems 2 water use by forestry plantations the native vegetation of any area has critical role in maintaining hydrological balance through rainfall interception and the utilization of its component that infiltrates into and is stored in soils in addition to inherent factors species genotype which define tree canopies in terms of their structure density leaf area index lai age sap flow area rooting depth etc the evapotranspiration et from plantations also depends upon the climatic demand and the soil water availability morris and benyon 2005 nevertheless it is usually anticipated that et from forestry plantations is more than the smaller agricultural crops pastures and shrubs albert et al 2007 this is because of their height resulting in higher aerodynamic roughness and clothesline effect in tree rows rougher and denser canopy to cause higher rain interception and its loss better soil structure causing more rainfall to infiltrate and be stored for transpiration at a later stage deeper roots of trees provide access to soil water and sometimes groundwater at greater depth where soils permit and so can sustain greater transpiration rates through dry periods 2 1 micro meteorological water balance methods due to complexities involved in direct monitoring of tree water use several reliable but indirect methods like ventilated chambers micro meteorological methods using bowen ratio and eddy correlation water balance isotopes deuterium water and of late the sap flow heat flux sensors have been employed for its calculation greenwood et al 1985 monitored et of some of the promising eucalyptus species and the pastures using ventilated chambers the annual et from best eucalyptus species was almost 6 times 2500 mm that was discharged by pastures crops 400 mm this was attributed to larger duration of leaf area evergreen rainfall interception 19 34 with an average of about 25 and the capacity of their phreatophyte roots to draw water from deeper soil horizons et monitored for 5 years using water balance approach for a catchment under e marginata and e calophylla was reported to be 1 15 and 0 35 times open pan evaporation ope for october march summer and april september cool winter respectively by sharma 1984 the annual transpiration by e grandis hybrid plantations in aracruz site in brazil annual rainfall 1147 mm was estimated to range between 635 1092 mm with an average of 883 mm almeida et al 2007 similarly potential evapo transpiration pet was computed to be about 1095 mm 3 mm d 1 for eucalyptus plantations in rwanda and this was about 10 below the annual rainfall mugunga et al 2015 in a semi arid area of north western india where 31 tree species were under saline irrigation for initial 3 years of planting annual average rainfall and irrigation 532 and 324 mm the carried over soil water storage was 17 277 mm tomar et al 2003 the water used during the 4 years following recession of irrigation by some of the faster growing species like acacia nilotica a indica e tereticornis etc ranged between 1 8 3 7 mm d 1 in an arid part of western india under ignp indra gandhi nahar priyojna command ope 2971 mm the annual losses from a plantation having mixture of eucalyptus and acacia trees was computed be 3446 mm kapoor and denecke 2001 based on recharge occurring during 18 years of eucalyptus plantation as calculated on the basis of chloride accumulations and accounting for effective rainfall the annual et was estimated to average 1302 mm minhas and dagar 2016a using meteorological approach kallarackal and somen 1997 reported that transpiration rates of e tereticornis varied between 0 2 0 8 and 3 1 4 0 mm d 1 during pre and post monsoons respectively stand density vis à vis lai also affected transpiration rates which reached 2 0 4 9 and 3 5 7 7 mm d 1 at locations with stocking of 1090 lai 0 6 and 1800 stems ha 1 lai 2 17 respectively roberts et al 1992 also reported the rates less than 1 0 mm during pre monsoon and up to 6 0 mm d 1 during post monsoon periods respectively 2 2 sap flow sensors several reports have also come up where the sap flow heat sensors have been used which are now being considered to be the most precise for measurements of transpiration by trees table 1 the transpiration rates were monitored to range between 1 4 2 8 mm d 1 in plantation of e nitens mixed with a albata sap flux in e camaldulensis lai 2 07 was up to 10 and over 30 l d 1 during winter and summer respectively morris and collopy 1999 when averaged the overall water use was quite low 0 9 1 0 mm d 1 the cause being limited by soil water availability dye 1996 also demonstrated that et 700 900 mm of the indigenous scrub or grassland vegetation increased considerably 1050 1300 mm when reforested with eucalyptus and pinus and more so with the former the transpiration rates of e urophylla 3 4 year old established on a sandy soil at hetou averaged 1 53 mm d 1 while it was 1 49 mm d 1 on a clay loam soils at jijia in leizhou peninsula of china morris et al 2004 in degraded land of the khorezm region in uzbekistan the annual stand transpiration amounted to 1830 1470 and 730 mm for elaeagnus angustifolia l ulmus pumila and populus euphratica respectively khamzina et al 2006 in australia et of grasslands is generally lower 650 mm per annum while in reforested areas the values even exceed 1300 mm vertessy 1999 cornish and vertessy 2001 better growth and higher rainfall interception resulted in higher evapo transpiration as monitored in 19 catchments having higher proportions of forest cover in grasslands of victoria fig 1 vertessy 1999 later zhang et al 2001 also predicted difference between et from grass cover and fully forested eucalyptus catchments 40 250 mm increased with annual rainfall 600 1800 mm per annum amongst the 21 plantation sites monitored by benyon et al 2006 the annual transpiration by pinus and eucalyptus at eight sites with permeable soil with shallower water table 6 m and lesser saline 3 1 ds m 1 averaged 1090 mm range 847 1343 mm compared with 623 mm range 540 795 mm at sites with deeper water table or soil layers restricting the root growth the most of above mentioned reports from australia including those by cramer et al 1999 morris and collopy 1999 substantiate that transpiration of eucalyptus trees are usually less than half the ope values when the groundwater salinity is about 8 ds m 1 eucalyptus may transpire only one half as much water as they do under non saline conditions oster et al 1999 nevertheless much higher rates 1248 mm on a severely saline site and 2225 mm on a moderately saline site were monitored in pakistan and the tree species like acacia nilotica had similar water use to that of eucalyptus khanzada et al 1998 mahmood et al 2001 2 3 irrigated plantations in irrigated plantations improved soil water regimes promote growth of trees vis à vis their transpirations rates myers et al 1996 1998 the transpiration rates for three and five years of irrigated e grandis plantation reached 4 3 and 8 mm d 1 its annual transpiration 1400 mm yr 1 almost equaled the potential et 1480 mm once the canopy closes stand water use is largely a function of water availability up to a maximum imposed by the prevailing climate morris and benyon 2005 the annual transpiration t mm was linearly related t 0 87 ws 153 96 r2 0 94 to the water supply ws mm that included supplemental irrigation rainfall and groundwater contribution theiveyanathan et al 2001 monitored annual evapo transpiration of irrigated e maculata to be 1300 mm at a site having shallow water table 950 mm in case of irrigated e grandis which extracted little water from groundwater and it was only 400 600 mm under rainfed conditions the plantation e grandis x urophylla water use under rainfed and irrigated conditions at aracruz in brazil was reported to be 1394 and 1779 mm yr 1 hubbard et al 2010 similarly with increase in sapwood area and canopy cover from 2 to 6 years after planting of e tereticornis in north india fig 2 the annual transpiration increased from 530 to 1060 mm and thereafter evened out at 1400 20 mm minhas et al 2015 the planting at high density 4 times further increased transpiration but only by about 11 percent the soil conditions and groundwater also control water extractions by trees for example the annual transpiration rates of eucalyptus plantations were almost double 767 mm at sites where these could draw ground water compared with those 358 mm which did not use groundwater benyon et al 2006 tanji and karajeh 1993 also reported the actual et of eucalyptus trees irrigated with high salinity water ec 10 ds m 1 to be 0 83 times pet which was considerably lower than the projected et 1 1 1 2 times pet the above eco hydrological studies establish that transpiration by tree plantations would be controlled by their characteristics like canopy cover stand age and tree spacing these are further modified by the local conditions like soil conditions and annual rainfall defining soil water storage and its extraction depth to water table defining the reach of tree roots to water and its salinity and the climatic demands the general conclusions can be that when the edaphic conditions are optimal i e soils are deep and allow for substantial root proliferation water table is shallow and of good quality for easier approach of roots and atmospheric demand is low e g cooler climate the water use by fast growing trees can equal or even be more than pet however under unfavorable edaphic conditions soils are shallow or with root restricting layers water table is deep and saline atmosphere is harsh i e hot and dry summer the water use by trees gets restricted and is usually 0 2 0 5 times the pet nevertheless the plantations have been pushed forward as alternatives for control of water logging and check the saline seeps because of their capacity to sustain the year around water extraction from soils recharged with rainfall and also their ability to with draw water from shallow water tables 3 water table drawdown and stream flows under plantations 3 1 checking stream flows since a large scale clearing of forest lands for agricultural development increased stream salinity and resulted in rise in water table at discharge sites several reforestation sites were established in australia for evaluating their role in halting recharge schofield and bari 1991 it became evident that the factors like growth rates of planted trees canopy cover and soil depth controlled the magnitude of decrease in stream flow bari et al 1996 vertessy 2001 the water yield of catchments usually declined after 2 3 years of re establishing plantations the reductions in water yield even exceeded 250 mm in 6 years of planting where stocking density vis à vis basal area was the highest cornish and vertessy 2001 while van lill et al 1980 earlier reported the stream flows to cease after 6 12 years of establishing eucalyptus and pinus plantations in grasslands to minimize the effects of reduced water yield and stream salinity on the downstream users stirzeker et al 2002 suggested to concentrate the establishment of planted forests in lower rainfall zones 800 mm spread these across the landscape mosaics and keep them 20 of any catchment and follow a phased planting to ensure a spread of age classes when groundwater in aquifers of high transmissivity is accessible to tree roots plantations can be net groundwater users and their annual et can exceed annual rainfall benyon et al 2006 3 2 water table draw down and location of plantations for tree plantations to be effective in draw down of water table their water use must be more than the seeping in with lateral flows from the adjoining discharge sites the proper location of plantations and their spatial arrangement within the catchments have a major influence on stream flow generation marcar 2009 for maximizing the benefits from reforestation a number of strategies were tested in western australia raper 1998 smetten and harper 2009 these included i planting in the lower slopes and discharge sites ii the most of deforested area through wider spaced trees iii strategically located strips alleys or blocks on a part of the area and iv high density plantations covering more than half the deforested area on the whole the reforestation did help in water table draw downs compared to grassland after 3 4 years of planting the magnitude depended upon the proportion of area planted and the crown cover in the first strategy the second strategy of planting on lesser proportion of land i e strips smaller blocks showed little impacts and could not be recommended for location where annual rainfall was 600 900 mm however water table draw down to the extent of 5 m could be achieved in 9 years with high density plantations that covered large areas 50 of land area while analyzing the overall impacts at 47 plantations in discharge sites george et al 1999 concluded that the majority of sites showed a decline in water table which ranged between 1 2 5 m especially those where salinity of water was low and there was predominance of local flows to cause perched water table condition with impairment of growth of trees at sites with salinity above 5 10 ds m 1 these became less effective their effects were confined only up to 10 30 m away from the reforested areas in argentina the depression in water table underneath a eucalyptus plantation averaged 0 38 m as compared with the surrounding grassland jobbagy and jackson 2004 while it was 0 5 m underneath a plantation that transpired water between 70 130 cm per year engel et al 2005 3 3 intercepting seepage along irrigation canals the tree belts are usually established along the irrigation canals with the aim of halting their lateral seepage under indian conditions such plantations consisting of different tree species were evaluated for a saline vertisol site falling under tbp tung bhadra project command manjunatha et al 2005 the average water table depth was 0 6 1 4 m lower under plantations than the outside area the plantations of a nilotica dalbergia sissoo casuarina equisetifolia intercepted 72 90 of the seepage occurring from canal while the interception was 50 by hardiwickia binata and a indica similarly consistent draw down of 0 8 1 08 m in water table was recorded fig 3 in the adjoining areas of a eucalyptus plantation to a distance of 0 73 km both towards the canal side contributing lateral flows and even in the opposite direction jeet ram et al 2007 however the drawdown was lesser during monsoon rains e g water table averaged 0 84 0 92 m deeper than at distance of 0 5 km from plantation respectively in july august when the trees extracted more water from rain recharged soil profiles it averaged 1 19 1 25 m in september october when growth rate of trees was high and also during summer e g 1 25 m in april when atmospheric demand was high and tree roots extracted more water from the capillarity zone above water table the impacts are expected to further increase in areas with lower rainfall and higher evaporative demands e g the water table declined by 15 7 m in about 6 years under a eucalyptus plantation mixed with a nilotica along the main canal of ignp phase ii in arid rajasthan kapoor and denecke 2001 3 4 lateral extent of water table draw down the overall patterns of groundwater bring out that it is possible to utilize forestry plantations for water table draw down at catchment scale when their water use exceeds the rainwater recharge and lateral seepage from adjoining areas in addition to water table draw downs the effectiveness of tree species is also inferred from its lateral extent the latter is also strongly influenced by soil depth and its texture that controls the hydraulic properties vis à vis capillarity zone availability and lateral movement of water is important barrett lennard et al 1999 with lower hydraulic conductivity of clay soils the slower upward and lateral water flows will delay the recoupment of water taken up by tree roots and thus the fall in water table is expected to be faster however the same factor also curbs the movement of water to tree roots and thereby lowering their extraction rates as compared to sandy soils moreover clayey soils are prone to hypoxic low oxygen conditions that may limit root proliferation which is essential to extract water from lower depths vertessy et al 2000 the overall impacts are reduced lateral extent of water table draw down for example the lateral extent draw down of water table by a eucalyptus plantation on a medium textured duplex soil was reported to a distance of 50 m into the adjoining pasture heuperman et al 2002 little drawdown by irrigated strip plantations were observed in light and permeable soils whereas these were distinct up to 5 10 m in adjoining pastures raised on heavier and less permeable soils fig 3 however the influxes of water from the surrounding irrigated crops and a canal were unable to compensate the water use by an 18 year old eucalyptus plantation on a sandy loam soils and therefore the water table drawdown extended to a distance of 0 7 km even during the monsoon season jeet ram et al 2007 similarly kapoor and denecke 2001 monitored a drawdown of 8 m in six years to a distance of 0 5 km with eucalyptus plantation on a loamy sand soil in an arid region while chaudhary et al 2000 reported lowering of water table by 0 35 0 46 m compared with the adjoining area extending up to 66 130 m in a sandy loam soil 4 salinity build up under plantations and its impact when the tree roots extract water from the capillary zone of soils underlain with saline water tables or irrigated with saline water the salts are expected to concentrate as only the pure water is skimmed distilled off and almost all the salts are excluded at the root surface during extraction the concentrations of salts are still more 1 2 1 4 times within 5 mm near to root surface than the bulk soil singh et al 1996 more salts are also expected to flow towards surface soils with the pull created by root water uptake and the lateral flows compensating for water table several evidences of salt build up in reforested soils were earlier presented which raised the doubts about long term sustainability of tree growth vis à vis their effectiveness for groundwater control minhas and dagar 2016a morris and collopy 1999 noticed the water table to move deeper and become saline with tree water use and this constrained further utilization depending upon salt tolerance of trees and pattern of their root growth vertessy et al 2000 observed a zone of high salts to exist at about 6 8 m in soils under e grandis plantation near kyabram fig 4 this was ascribed to presence of high density and active roots in capillary fringe though finer roots were also abundant in surface soil horizons similarly salinity build up occurred in soil at depth below 1 m underneath an 18 years old eucalyptus plantation but continued to be within the tolerance limits of trees jeet ram et al 2007 these studies indicate that the tree plantations are expected to draw water from shallow and saline water table and continue to grow at least for their one rotation length of 14 17 years for solid wood production several such instances of tree plantations were cited by marcar and morris 2005 these included continued growth of e grandis slightly salt tolerant e occidentalis highly salt tolerant and melaleuca helmaturorum extremely salt tolerant over a shallow water table near kyabram a moderate to high saline water table near stanhope and highly saline swamp in southeast of south australia respectively soil texture and annual and episodic events of rainfall also affect the salt dynamics in soils minhas 2012 the accumulated salts are likely to be displaced deeper in lighter textured soils especially where annual rainfall is high 600 mm since plants are also known to exercise control over root growth and adjust to meet water requirements consistent with water availability vis à vis salinity distribution in different soil zones the established tree plantations may show little impacts of salinity 5 plantation area for effectiveness the other issue in achieving water table draw downs is with respect to area to be covered for reforestation this of course would depend upon the objective of planting and the site specific conditions i e whether it is for checking later seepage from canals or to recharge sites from upper reaches or irrigated areas schofield 1992 reported the water table lowering beneath plantations to depend upon canopy cover in 700 mm annual rainfall regions of western australia the area to be reforested for lowering about 2 m water table under normal rainfall conditions was predicted to be 52 per cent of the cleared area while no reduction in water table occurred when the area planted was less than 15 percent similar computations based upon the indian reports minhas and dagar 2016a show that 10 25 of land should be covered under eucalyptus plantations for halting water table rise in the afflicted areas water table and salinity data from 24 sites with forestry plantations covering 5 90 of area at varying combinations of block strip belts and other configurations were analyzed by bennet and george 2008 it was concluded that 70 98 of the catchments must be planted for significant draw down of water tables 2 6 m in 20 years thus the overall conclusions are that at least 5 10 times the salinity afflicted area must be put under plantation forestry i e the scale which may not be cost effective considering the other commercial land uses otherwise the long time lags 20 40 years are likely to occur in measurable responses in water balances vis à vis ground water and salinity control harper et al 2017 the estimated on site response of plantations in southern australia commonly varied between 10 30 years ridley and pannell 2005 rapid on site responses were in soils with lower conductivity their off site responses being less effective and vice versa 6 possible ways to integrate forestry the most common criterion for reforestation is to select tree species which can adapt well to the prevalent agro climatic conditions and also have multiple economic uses when the plantations are undertaken to minimize salinity and water logging the patterns of their planting should aim at maximizing the water use and minimum salinity in soil zones with higher root activity a number of other factors like soil type its depth and water transmission properties topography annual rainfall quantities and quality of irrigation water table water are also important for getting best solutions under a given site typically the blocks of densities of 1000 1200 and 500 600 tree ha 1 have been recommended for checking seepage from adjoining area canals in high rainfall lesser saline zones and low rainfall high salinity zones respectively ellis and vandijk 2009 the high transpiring species of eucalyptus especially the fast growing clones seem to be the best the tree water use was not hampered under low salinity 4 ds m 1 conditions heuperman et al 2002 water use by different tree species may also not vary much when these can access better quality groundwater nevertheless under the conditions when the accumulated salts inhibit their growth the speculations are that the time taken for groundwater responses may be long or this may not occur at all archibald et al 2006 for salinity afflicted discharge sites several tolerant eucalyptus species like e camaldulensis e loxophleba e occidentalis e sargentii and e spathulata have been identified which are able to lower even the water table with salinity to the level of 30 ds m 1 lefroy and scott 1994 marcar 2016 the plantations of tamarix prosopis acacia etc also show high tolerance to both saline and water logged conditions tomar and minhas 1998 marcar 2016 unfortunately these trees usually have low foliage and sluggish growing habit therefore these can better be utilized to stabilize the degraded saline lands due to their halophytic character rather than restoring catchment water balances to obviate the salinity impacts a concept of walking shifting plantations was also advocated here short rotation trees are planted and these are harvested and replaced with agricultural crops while the new plantations are established at adjacent sites for checking seepage heuperman et al 2002 the aim of these systems also termed as phase farming is to rapidly deplete excess water through deep rooted fast growing and high density plantations for example e globules and e occidentalis planted at 4000 trees ha 1 depleted soil water to depths of 8 0 m within three years of their establishment harper et al 2014 rows strips of tree alleys on the field boundaries not only create hydraulic gradients towards these rows help in rapid drying of soils providing for buffers to undertake timely sowing of winter crops roy chowdhury et al 2011 dagar et al 2016 and also the niches of salt accumulation which do not harm associated crops jeet ram et al 2011 others have also suggested their integration with engineering drainage input for achieving favorable salt balance by disposing off the accumulated salts beneath these plantations which would ensure their long term sustainability mcfarlane et al 2016 for this workable solutions are required on regional scale for best exploitation of synergies of drainage measures and tree plantations complementarities of engineering and plantation based systems will not only control water table rise and secondary salinity but would further have environmental and socio economic benefits nevertheless the solutions would have to be site specific as these may not be extrapolated to other sites with different agro climatic and soil conditions 7 economics and other ecosystem services use of perennials for partial restoration of water balances and control salinity has been invariably established in australia and other salinity afflicted regions of the world for widespread adaptation the recommended perennial species are sufficiently attractive for their provisioning services in terms of fodder timber and fuel wood production nonetheless the lands spared for permanent vegetation are invariably marginal and afflicted with salinity to levels where the agricultural activities are either not feasible or economical depending upon the level of degradation the growth of tree plantations also get constrained with edaphic stresses on these harsh sites that is why the economic analysis of most of the reforestation programs implemented for salinity control also point out that these either lead to only small financial gains or are cost neutral minhas and dagar 2016b as a consequence there has been a decline in interest in reforestation programs for dryland salinity control especially in areas with annual rainfall of 300 600 mm harper et al 2017 of course these socio economic estimates usually ignored the off site and other ecosystem benefits such as microclimate modifications carbon mitigation both via carbon sequestration and bio fuels soil erosion protection biodiversity restoration and adaptations to climate change thus a realistic economic assessment of the ecosystem benefits is fundamental to integrate and justify suitable investment and supportive policies for their reforestation amongst these the major spin off of such reforestation for salinity control programs can be carbon forestry particularly when global interests are in using the land sector to meet climate mitigation targets such as those associated with second round of kyoto protocol and pledges made at paris cop 21 meeting the soils under biosaline forestry could store additional 25 9 99 3 mg co2 e ha 1 in surface 0 3 m soil as monitored after 5 10 years and in some cases for up to 20 years of their establishment in north west parts of india gupta et al 2016 however in a meta analysis of 74 publications guo and gifford 2002 concluded that soil organic carbon soc stocks declined by 10 following a change in land use from pasture to plantation but increased by 18 following a change from cropland to plantation in a later report by harper et al 2012 the organic carbon storage in surface 0 3 m soils 33 to 55 mg c ha 1 did not differ after 26 year old reforestation with four eucalyptus species e cladocalyx var nana e occidentalis e sargentii and e wandoo with the adjacent agricultural fields nevertheless there was additional carbon storage in the tree biomass 23 60 mg c ha 1 and ground floor litter 19 34 mg c ha 1 carbon sequestration rates after 10 year period ranged from 2 5 7 7 co2 e mg ha 1 yr 1 with e sargentil 6 5 co2 e mg ha 1 yr 1 and e occidentlis 7 7 co2 e mg ha 1 yr 1 being promising harper et al 2017 thus the major benefits from reforestation can emerge from their potential for carbon credits which now include carbon sequestered in living and dead biomass and in the soil the other benefit of reforestation is increased biodiversity by enhancing numerous ecological and production functions anyhow the reforestation strategies usually involve monoculture or mixtures of few fast growing and salt tolerant tree species biodiversity and other ecological functions may not be achieved as noticed with forest regeneration with naturally occurring multiple species 8 conclusions extensive experiences gained world over bring out the role the tree plantations play in controlling water vis à vis salt balances both at the farm and regional levels their viable utilization for maximization of benefits should include not only greening the degraded soils but also resource conservation in terms of water table draw downs and other economic and environmental benefits in fact deep rooted and profligate water user species like eucalyptus provide for viable and productive alternatives for restoring hydrological balances and managing water logging problems however their effectiveness for bio drainage purposes is defined by factors like soil and climatic conditions groundwater depth and its quality fraction of area reforested growth rates of species planted their stocking patterns and the geometries on the whole the reforestation options seem viable under the situations i the planted trees can tolerate the saline and waterlogged conditions and their root system are able to extract water from phreatic zones ii water table vis à vis capillary fringe water is of lesser salinity preferably 6 ds m 1 and exist at shallower depth about 2 6 m deep for easier approach and extraction by the tree roots iii soils allow for deeper proliferation of tree roots and rapidly transmit water to meet tree demands with lesser transmissivity of water the effectiveness gets reduced in heavy textured soils iv tree water use to annual rainfall ratio is higher and the effectiveness usually decreases with rainfall above 400 600 mm v strategies for reforestation include high density configuration at recharge sites for perched water tables or creation of seepage interception sites with high density strips boundary plantations etc and vi extensive areas 30 50 of the catchment are covered under reforestation plans nevertheless with current lacunas of long time lags for groundwater response and high scales of planting the impetus for reforestation can be generated only with additional benefits beyond on and off site salinity mitigation these include trading carbon credits diversification of farm income and employment generation the tools and approaches which can further improve the viability of reforestation programmes include i identification of hot spot locations for prioritizing reforestation using gis and remotes sensing techniques ii predictions of secondary salinity with the help of process based models and building scenarios for testing of different reforestation designs and how best these can be integrated with other agronomic engineering management techniques to minimize the salinity impacts and iii identification development of other economically productive and salinity tolerant tree species and devising means of their integration into existing farming systems all these necessitate the development of strategic frameworks for amalgamating reforestation that can ensure sustainable and inclusive growth of agriculture on these harsh agro ecologies afflicted by salinity

10697,land degradation with water logging and salinity is global problem especially in arid and semiarid regions as an alternative for capital intensive engineering approaches plantation forestry has been advocated as an eco friendly option to offset hydrological imbalances bio drainage mainly for dryland salinity conditions with robust monitoring world over reforestation mainly with fast growing versatile eucalyptus species have emerged as the most water profligate these lower the water table by extracting soil water throughout the year and even from deeper soil and phreatic zones the annual evapo transpiration of plantations vary from about 0 2 to 0 8 times ope open pan evaporation under dryland conditions and can equal or even exceed ope under irrigated conditions the factors like soil and climatic conditions groundwater depth and its quality growth rates of tree species their stocking patterns and the geometries and fraction of area under plantations define their effectiveness for water table draw down and salinity control nevertheless the emerging arguments against bio management include long time lag high land requirements and decline in their efficiency with salinity build up underneath plantations to overcome these constraints shifting plantations in between discharge and recharge areas reforestation with salt tolerant species integrating these with cropping systems and even with engineering measures in saline discharge areas are the alternate options the gainful employment of bio drainage demands the diagnosis of typical areas to be reforested in catchments using gis remote sensing tools the development of decision support systems dss for appropriate designing of reforestation strategies and their amalgamation with existing farming systems benefits of plantations beyond on and off site salinity control should aim at enhanced farm incomes restoring biodiversity and particularly carbon trading when global interests are now targeting climate mitigation keywords bio drainage water logging control tree water use salinity mitigation plantation forestry groundwater balance 1 introduction land degradation with salinity is a widespread problem of arid and semi arid regions especially where seepage from irrigation systems induces rise in water table and consequently build up of excessive salts in soils to impair crop production ghassemi et al 1995 hydrological disturbances like extensive forest clearance for agricultural purposes also results in large portions of rainfall to flow through soils to cumulate at recharge sites and thus leading to dryland salinity problems rengasamy 2006 mcfarlane et al 2016 about 19 5 of globally irrigated 45 million ha and 2 1 of dryland 32 million ha agricultural lands across about 100 countries are afflicted by salinity with extensive and undesirable impacts on economy and environment fao 2015 the salinity is an adjunct of irrigated agriculture particularly where internal drainage is impeded and water conveying canals distributaries are at a higher elevation than the adjoining land and when pumping of groundwater is lower than the incoming seepage singh 1994 the typical regions where large scale landscapes are afflicted by salinity problems include parts of several river basins like amu and syr darya in central asia euphrates in western asia indo gangetic plains and indus basin in south asia murray darling basin in australia yellow river in china and the san joaquin valley usa qadir et al 2014 the secondary salinity is projected to amplify with global warming the prevalence of faulty irrigation practices and other anthropogenic activities minhas and obi reddy 2017 rehabilitating the saline and waterlogged lands involves salt leaching through downward flux of water and maintenance of water table at depth that creates congenial conditions for appropriate root proliferation aeration and trafficability the engineering techniques like surface and sub surface drainage groundwater pumping are quite effective for control of water logging and salinity kamra 2015 specifically the design and management of subsurface drainage systems have evolved tremendously in the past few decades ayars and evans 2015 nevertheless these are constrained by high capital outlays in addition to their operation and maintenance problems ritzema et al 2008 moreover the safe disposal of drainage water continues to be a major environmental issue therefore forestry plantations with deep rooted trees i e bio drainage was proposed especially for dryland salinity control morris and benyon 2005 marcar 2009 mcfarlane et al 2016 minhas and dagar 2016a trees help in controlling water fluxes to recharge sites and directly access groundwater for their transpiration and thereby restore hydrological balances ellis and vandijk 2009 in irrigated areas tree plantations further help in halting seepage occurring from canals manjunatha et al 2005 several ancillary benefits include a broad range of products like fuel wood fodder timber etc carbon sequestration improvement insoil s physico chemical properties and the ecological benefits of restoring biodiversity minhas and dagar 2016b however the arguments against their effective use for salinity control or bio drainage include long time lags for salinity improvement harper et al 2017 lack of realistic estimate of evapo transpiration of plantations morris and benyon 2005 and salinity accumulation in deeper soils after water uptake by tree roots which may affect their later growth vis à vis sustainability moreover a number of location specific features like nature of soils annual precipitation salinity tolerance and the patterns of water use by forestry trees the supplies of irrigation water ground water table depth etc control the overall complexities of salinity dynamics in soils marcar 2009 all these factors may affect the effectiveness of tree plantations to control water logging and salinity the viability of plantation forestry options have been discussed at large for dryland salinity control especially under continental climate of australia marcar 2016 mcfarlane et al 2016 harper et al 2017 however soil climatic and canopy conditions of plantations vary a lot world over both spatially and temporally and these reflect in water and salt dynamics in the catchments therefore for general guidelines on the use of plantations for salinity control site specific conditions should be duly considered to update our knowledge this attempt is to present current state of the science and to generate discussion on soil climate and other agro ecosystem conditions where possibilities of success with plantations are emerging the chief objectives of this compilation include i analysis of the role of plantation based systems considering eco hydrological and other factual information on their evapo transpiration and catchment water yields ii evaluation of current designs and practices for defining their effectiveness under specific soil and climatic conditions groundwater depth and its quality growth rates of species planted their stocking patterns and the geometries etc and iii viable alternatives for improvement in their performance especially the possibilities of their integration for halting or reversing the salinity and water logging problems we hope this would improve scientific basis for policy decisions making so as to have effective and integrated controls on waterlogging and salinity problems 2 water use by forestry plantations the native vegetation of any area has critical role in maintaining hydrological balance through rainfall interception and the utilization of its component that infiltrates into and is stored in soils in addition to inherent factors species genotype which define tree canopies in terms of their structure density leaf area index lai age sap flow area rooting depth etc the evapotranspiration et from plantations also depends upon the climatic demand and the soil water availability morris and benyon 2005 nevertheless it is usually anticipated that et from forestry plantations is more than the smaller agricultural crops pastures and shrubs albert et al 2007 this is because of their height resulting in higher aerodynamic roughness and clothesline effect in tree rows rougher and denser canopy to cause higher rain interception and its loss better soil structure causing more rainfall to infiltrate and be stored for transpiration at a later stage deeper roots of trees provide access to soil water and sometimes groundwater at greater depth where soils permit and so can sustain greater transpiration rates through dry periods 2 1 micro meteorological water balance methods due to complexities involved in direct monitoring of tree water use several reliable but indirect methods like ventilated chambers micro meteorological methods using bowen ratio and eddy correlation water balance isotopes deuterium water and of late the sap flow heat flux sensors have been employed for its calculation greenwood et al 1985 monitored et of some of the promising eucalyptus species and the pastures using ventilated chambers the annual et from best eucalyptus species was almost 6 times 2500 mm that was discharged by pastures crops 400 mm this was attributed to larger duration of leaf area evergreen rainfall interception 19 34 with an average of about 25 and the capacity of their phreatophyte roots to draw water from deeper soil horizons et monitored for 5 years using water balance approach for a catchment under e marginata and e calophylla was reported to be 1 15 and 0 35 times open pan evaporation ope for october march summer and april september cool winter respectively by sharma 1984 the annual transpiration by e grandis hybrid plantations in aracruz site in brazil annual rainfall 1147 mm was estimated to range between 635 1092 mm with an average of 883 mm almeida et al 2007 similarly potential evapo transpiration pet was computed to be about 1095 mm 3 mm d 1 for eucalyptus plantations in rwanda and this was about 10 below the annual rainfall mugunga et al 2015 in a semi arid area of north western india where 31 tree species were under saline irrigation for initial 3 years of planting annual average rainfall and irrigation 532 and 324 mm the carried over soil water storage was 17 277 mm tomar et al 2003 the water used during the 4 years following recession of irrigation by some of the faster growing species like acacia nilotica a indica e tereticornis etc ranged between 1 8 3 7 mm d 1 in an arid part of western india under ignp indra gandhi nahar priyojna command ope 2971 mm the annual losses from a plantation having mixture of eucalyptus and acacia trees was computed be 3446 mm kapoor and denecke 2001 based on recharge occurring during 18 years of eucalyptus plantation as calculated on the basis of chloride accumulations and accounting for effective rainfall the annual et was estimated to average 1302 mm minhas and dagar 2016a using meteorological approach kallarackal and somen 1997 reported that transpiration rates of e tereticornis varied between 0 2 0 8 and 3 1 4 0 mm d 1 during pre and post monsoons respectively stand density vis à vis lai also affected transpiration rates which reached 2 0 4 9 and 3 5 7 7 mm d 1 at locations with stocking of 1090 lai 0 6 and 1800 stems ha 1 lai 2 17 respectively roberts et al 1992 also reported the rates less than 1 0 mm during pre monsoon and up to 6 0 mm d 1 during post monsoon periods respectively 2 2 sap flow sensors several reports have also come up where the sap flow heat sensors have been used which are now being considered to be the most precise for measurements of transpiration by trees table 1 the transpiration rates were monitored to range between 1 4 2 8 mm d 1 in plantation of e nitens mixed with a albata sap flux in e camaldulensis lai 2 07 was up to 10 and over 30 l d 1 during winter and summer respectively morris and collopy 1999 when averaged the overall water use was quite low 0 9 1 0 mm d 1 the cause being limited by soil water availability dye 1996 also demonstrated that et 700 900 mm of the indigenous scrub or grassland vegetation increased considerably 1050 1300 mm when reforested with eucalyptus and pinus and more so with the former the transpiration rates of e urophylla 3 4 year old established on a sandy soil at hetou averaged 1 53 mm d 1 while it was 1 49 mm d 1 on a clay loam soils at jijia in leizhou peninsula of china morris et al 2004 in degraded land of the khorezm region in uzbekistan the annual stand transpiration amounted to 1830 1470 and 730 mm for elaeagnus angustifolia l ulmus pumila and populus euphratica respectively khamzina et al 2006 in australia et of grasslands is generally lower 650 mm per annum while in reforested areas the values even exceed 1300 mm vertessy 1999 cornish and vertessy 2001 better growth and higher rainfall interception resulted in higher evapo transpiration as monitored in 19 catchments having higher proportions of forest cover in grasslands of victoria fig 1 vertessy 1999 later zhang et al 2001 also predicted difference between et from grass cover and fully forested eucalyptus catchments 40 250 mm increased with annual rainfall 600 1800 mm per annum amongst the 21 plantation sites monitored by benyon et al 2006 the annual transpiration by pinus and eucalyptus at eight sites with permeable soil with shallower water table 6 m and lesser saline 3 1 ds m 1 averaged 1090 mm range 847 1343 mm compared with 623 mm range 540 795 mm at sites with deeper water table or soil layers restricting the root growth the most of above mentioned reports from australia including those by cramer et al 1999 morris and collopy 1999 substantiate that transpiration of eucalyptus trees are usually less than half the ope values when the groundwater salinity is about 8 ds m 1 eucalyptus may transpire only one half as much water as they do under non saline conditions oster et al 1999 nevertheless much higher rates 1248 mm on a severely saline site and 2225 mm on a moderately saline site were monitored in pakistan and the tree species like acacia nilotica had similar water use to that of eucalyptus khanzada et al 1998 mahmood et al 2001 2 3 irrigated plantations in irrigated plantations improved soil water regimes promote growth of trees vis à vis their transpirations rates myers et al 1996 1998 the transpiration rates for three and five years of irrigated e grandis plantation reached 4 3 and 8 mm d 1 its annual transpiration 1400 mm yr 1 almost equaled the potential et 1480 mm once the canopy closes stand water use is largely a function of water availability up to a maximum imposed by the prevailing climate morris and benyon 2005 the annual transpiration t mm was linearly related t 0 87 ws 153 96 r2 0 94 to the water supply ws mm that included supplemental irrigation rainfall and groundwater contribution theiveyanathan et al 2001 monitored annual evapo transpiration of irrigated e maculata to be 1300 mm at a site having shallow water table 950 mm in case of irrigated e grandis which extracted little water from groundwater and it was only 400 600 mm under rainfed conditions the plantation e grandis x urophylla water use under rainfed and irrigated conditions at aracruz in brazil was reported to be 1394 and 1779 mm yr 1 hubbard et al 2010 similarly with increase in sapwood area and canopy cover from 2 to 6 years after planting of e tereticornis in north india fig 2 the annual transpiration increased from 530 to 1060 mm and thereafter evened out at 1400 20 mm minhas et al 2015 the planting at high density 4 times further increased transpiration but only by about 11 percent the soil conditions and groundwater also control water extractions by trees for example the annual transpiration rates of eucalyptus plantations were almost double 767 mm at sites where these could draw ground water compared with those 358 mm which did not use groundwater benyon et al 2006 tanji and karajeh 1993 also reported the actual et of eucalyptus trees irrigated with high salinity water ec 10 ds m 1 to be 0 83 times pet which was considerably lower than the projected et 1 1 1 2 times pet the above eco hydrological studies establish that transpiration by tree plantations would be controlled by their characteristics like canopy cover stand age and tree spacing these are further modified by the local conditions like soil conditions and annual rainfall defining soil water storage and its extraction depth to water table defining the reach of tree roots to water and its salinity and the climatic demands the general conclusions can be that when the edaphic conditions are optimal i e soils are deep and allow for substantial root proliferation water table is shallow and of good quality for easier approach of roots and atmospheric demand is low e g cooler climate the water use by fast growing trees can equal or even be more than pet however under unfavorable edaphic conditions soils are shallow or with root restricting layers water table is deep and saline atmosphere is harsh i e hot and dry summer the water use by trees gets restricted and is usually 0 2 0 5 times the pet nevertheless the plantations have been pushed forward as alternatives for control of water logging and check the saline seeps because of their capacity to sustain the year around water extraction from soils recharged with rainfall and also their ability to with draw water from shallow water tables 3 water table drawdown and stream flows under plantations 3 1 checking stream flows since a large scale clearing of forest lands for agricultural development increased stream salinity and resulted in rise in water table at discharge sites several reforestation sites were established in australia for evaluating their role in halting recharge schofield and bari 1991 it became evident that the factors like growth rates of planted trees canopy cover and soil depth controlled the magnitude of decrease in stream flow bari et al 1996 vertessy 2001 the water yield of catchments usually declined after 2 3 years of re establishing plantations the reductions in water yield even exceeded 250 mm in 6 years of planting where stocking density vis à vis basal area was the highest cornish and vertessy 2001 while van lill et al 1980 earlier reported the stream flows to cease after 6 12 years of establishing eucalyptus and pinus plantations in grasslands to minimize the effects of reduced water yield and stream salinity on the downstream users stirzeker et al 2002 suggested to concentrate the establishment of planted forests in lower rainfall zones 800 mm spread these across the landscape mosaics and keep them 20 of any catchment and follow a phased planting to ensure a spread of age classes when groundwater in aquifers of high transmissivity is accessible to tree roots plantations can be net groundwater users and their annual et can exceed annual rainfall benyon et al 2006 3 2 water table draw down and location of plantations for tree plantations to be effective in draw down of water table their water use must be more than the seeping in with lateral flows from the adjoining discharge sites the proper location of plantations and their spatial arrangement within the catchments have a major influence on stream flow generation marcar 2009 for maximizing the benefits from reforestation a number of strategies were tested in western australia raper 1998 smetten and harper 2009 these included i planting in the lower slopes and discharge sites ii the most of deforested area through wider spaced trees iii strategically located strips alleys or blocks on a part of the area and iv high density plantations covering more than half the deforested area on the whole the reforestation did help in water table draw downs compared to grassland after 3 4 years of planting the magnitude depended upon the proportion of area planted and the crown cover in the first strategy the second strategy of planting on lesser proportion of land i e strips smaller blocks showed little impacts and could not be recommended for location where annual rainfall was 600 900 mm however water table draw down to the extent of 5 m could be achieved in 9 years with high density plantations that covered large areas 50 of land area while analyzing the overall impacts at 47 plantations in discharge sites george et al 1999 concluded that the majority of sites showed a decline in water table which ranged between 1 2 5 m especially those where salinity of water was low and there was predominance of local flows to cause perched water table condition with impairment of growth of trees at sites with salinity above 5 10 ds m 1 these became less effective their effects were confined only up to 10 30 m away from the reforested areas in argentina the depression in water table underneath a eucalyptus plantation averaged 0 38 m as compared with the surrounding grassland jobbagy and jackson 2004 while it was 0 5 m underneath a plantation that transpired water between 70 130 cm per year engel et al 2005 3 3 intercepting seepage along irrigation canals the tree belts are usually established along the irrigation canals with the aim of halting their lateral seepage under indian conditions such plantations consisting of different tree species were evaluated for a saline vertisol site falling under tbp tung bhadra project command manjunatha et al 2005 the average water table depth was 0 6 1 4 m lower under plantations than the outside area the plantations of a nilotica dalbergia sissoo casuarina equisetifolia intercepted 72 90 of the seepage occurring from canal while the interception was 50 by hardiwickia binata and a indica similarly consistent draw down of 0 8 1 08 m in water table was recorded fig 3 in the adjoining areas of a eucalyptus plantation to a distance of 0 73 km both towards the canal side contributing lateral flows and even in the opposite direction jeet ram et al 2007 however the drawdown was lesser during monsoon rains e g water table averaged 0 84 0 92 m deeper than at distance of 0 5 km from plantation respectively in july august when the trees extracted more water from rain recharged soil profiles it averaged 1 19 1 25 m in september october when growth rate of trees was high and also during summer e g 1 25 m in april when atmospheric demand was high and tree roots extracted more water from the capillarity zone above water table the impacts are expected to further increase in areas with lower rainfall and higher evaporative demands e g the water table declined by 15 7 m in about 6 years under a eucalyptus plantation mixed with a nilotica along the main canal of ignp phase ii in arid rajasthan kapoor and denecke 2001 3 4 lateral extent of water table draw down the overall patterns of groundwater bring out that it is possible to utilize forestry plantations for water table draw down at catchment scale when their water use exceeds the rainwater recharge and lateral seepage from adjoining areas in addition to water table draw downs the effectiveness of tree species is also inferred from its lateral extent the latter is also strongly influenced by soil depth and its texture that controls the hydraulic properties vis à vis capillarity zone availability and lateral movement of water is important barrett lennard et al 1999 with lower hydraulic conductivity of clay soils the slower upward and lateral water flows will delay the recoupment of water taken up by tree roots and thus the fall in water table is expected to be faster however the same factor also curbs the movement of water to tree roots and thereby lowering their extraction rates as compared to sandy soils moreover clayey soils are prone to hypoxic low oxygen conditions that may limit root proliferation which is essential to extract water from lower depths vertessy et al 2000 the overall impacts are reduced lateral extent of water table draw down for example the lateral extent draw down of water table by a eucalyptus plantation on a medium textured duplex soil was reported to a distance of 50 m into the adjoining pasture heuperman et al 2002 little drawdown by irrigated strip plantations were observed in light and permeable soils whereas these were distinct up to 5 10 m in adjoining pastures raised on heavier and less permeable soils fig 3 however the influxes of water from the surrounding irrigated crops and a canal were unable to compensate the water use by an 18 year old eucalyptus plantation on a sandy loam soils and therefore the water table drawdown extended to a distance of 0 7 km even during the monsoon season jeet ram et al 2007 similarly kapoor and denecke 2001 monitored a drawdown of 8 m in six years to a distance of 0 5 km with eucalyptus plantation on a loamy sand soil in an arid region while chaudhary et al 2000 reported lowering of water table by 0 35 0 46 m compared with the adjoining area extending up to 66 130 m in a sandy loam soil 4 salinity build up under plantations and its impact when the tree roots extract water from the capillary zone of soils underlain with saline water tables or irrigated with saline water the salts are expected to concentrate as only the pure water is skimmed distilled off and almost all the salts are excluded at the root surface during extraction the concentrations of salts are still more 1 2 1 4 times within 5 mm near to root surface than the bulk soil singh et al 1996 more salts are also expected to flow towards surface soils with the pull created by root water uptake and the lateral flows compensating for water table several evidences of salt build up in reforested soils were earlier presented which raised the doubts about long term sustainability of tree growth vis à vis their effectiveness for groundwater control minhas and dagar 2016a morris and collopy 1999 noticed the water table to move deeper and become saline with tree water use and this constrained further utilization depending upon salt tolerance of trees and pattern of their root growth vertessy et al 2000 observed a zone of high salts to exist at about 6 8 m in soils under e grandis plantation near kyabram fig 4 this was ascribed to presence of high density and active roots in capillary fringe though finer roots were also abundant in surface soil horizons similarly salinity build up occurred in soil at depth below 1 m underneath an 18 years old eucalyptus plantation but continued to be within the tolerance limits of trees jeet ram et al 2007 these studies indicate that the tree plantations are expected to draw water from shallow and saline water table and continue to grow at least for their one rotation length of 14 17 years for solid wood production several such instances of tree plantations were cited by marcar and morris 2005 these included continued growth of e grandis slightly salt tolerant e occidentalis highly salt tolerant and melaleuca helmaturorum extremely salt tolerant over a shallow water table near kyabram a moderate to high saline water table near stanhope and highly saline swamp in southeast of south australia respectively soil texture and annual and episodic events of rainfall also affect the salt dynamics in soils minhas 2012 the accumulated salts are likely to be displaced deeper in lighter textured soils especially where annual rainfall is high 600 mm since plants are also known to exercise control over root growth and adjust to meet water requirements consistent with water availability vis à vis salinity distribution in different soil zones the established tree plantations may show little impacts of salinity 5 plantation area for effectiveness the other issue in achieving water table draw downs is with respect to area to be covered for reforestation this of course would depend upon the objective of planting and the site specific conditions i e whether it is for checking later seepage from canals or to recharge sites from upper reaches or irrigated areas schofield 1992 reported the water table lowering beneath plantations to depend upon canopy cover in 700 mm annual rainfall regions of western australia the area to be reforested for lowering about 2 m water table under normal rainfall conditions was predicted to be 52 per cent of the cleared area while no reduction in water table occurred when the area planted was less than 15 percent similar computations based upon the indian reports minhas and dagar 2016a show that 10 25 of land should be covered under eucalyptus plantations for halting water table rise in the afflicted areas water table and salinity data from 24 sites with forestry plantations covering 5 90 of area at varying combinations of block strip belts and other configurations were analyzed by bennet and george 2008 it was concluded that 70 98 of the catchments must be planted for significant draw down of water tables 2 6 m in 20 years thus the overall conclusions are that at least 5 10 times the salinity afflicted area must be put under plantation forestry i e the scale which may not be cost effective considering the other commercial land uses otherwise the long time lags 20 40 years are likely to occur in measurable responses in water balances vis à vis ground water and salinity control harper et al 2017 the estimated on site response of plantations in southern australia commonly varied between 10 30 years ridley and pannell 2005 rapid on site responses were in soils with lower conductivity their off site responses being less effective and vice versa 6 possible ways to integrate forestry the most common criterion for reforestation is to select tree species which can adapt well to the prevalent agro climatic conditions and also have multiple economic uses when the plantations are undertaken to minimize salinity and water logging the patterns of their planting should aim at maximizing the water use and minimum salinity in soil zones with higher root activity a number of other factors like soil type its depth and water transmission properties topography annual rainfall quantities and quality of irrigation water table water are also important for getting best solutions under a given site typically the blocks of densities of 1000 1200 and 500 600 tree ha 1 have been recommended for checking seepage from adjoining area canals in high rainfall lesser saline zones and low rainfall high salinity zones respectively ellis and vandijk 2009 the high transpiring species of eucalyptus especially the fast growing clones seem to be the best the tree water use was not hampered under low salinity 4 ds m 1 conditions heuperman et al 2002 water use by different tree species may also not vary much when these can access better quality groundwater nevertheless under the conditions when the accumulated salts inhibit their growth the speculations are that the time taken for groundwater responses may be long or this may not occur at all archibald et al 2006 for salinity afflicted discharge sites several tolerant eucalyptus species like e camaldulensis e loxophleba e occidentalis e sargentii and e spathulata have been identified which are able to lower even the water table with salinity to the level of 30 ds m 1 lefroy and scott 1994 marcar 2016 the plantations of tamarix prosopis acacia etc also show high tolerance to both saline and water logged conditions tomar and minhas 1998 marcar 2016 unfortunately these trees usually have low foliage and sluggish growing habit therefore these can better be utilized to stabilize the degraded saline lands due to their halophytic character rather than restoring catchment water balances to obviate the salinity impacts a concept of walking shifting plantations was also advocated here short rotation trees are planted and these are harvested and replaced with agricultural crops while the new plantations are established at adjacent sites for checking seepage heuperman et al 2002 the aim of these systems also termed as phase farming is to rapidly deplete excess water through deep rooted fast growing and high density plantations for example e globules and e occidentalis planted at 4000 trees ha 1 depleted soil water to depths of 8 0 m within three years of their establishment harper et al 2014 rows strips of tree alleys on the field boundaries not only create hydraulic gradients towards these rows help in rapid drying of soils providing for buffers to undertake timely sowing of winter crops roy chowdhury et al 2011 dagar et al 2016 and also the niches of salt accumulation which do not harm associated crops jeet ram et al 2011 others have also suggested their integration with engineering drainage input for achieving favorable salt balance by disposing off the accumulated salts beneath these plantations which would ensure their long term sustainability mcfarlane et al 2016 for this workable solutions are required on regional scale for best exploitation of synergies of drainage measures and tree plantations complementarities of engineering and plantation based systems will not only control water table rise and secondary salinity but would further have environmental and socio economic benefits nevertheless the solutions would have to be site specific as these may not be extrapolated to other sites with different agro climatic and soil conditions 7 economics and other ecosystem services use of perennials for partial restoration of water balances and control salinity has been invariably established in australia and other salinity afflicted regions of the world for widespread adaptation the recommended perennial species are sufficiently attractive for their provisioning services in terms of fodder timber and fuel wood production nonetheless the lands spared for permanent vegetation are invariably marginal and afflicted with salinity to levels where the agricultural activities are either not feasible or economical depending upon the level of degradation the growth of tree plantations also get constrained with edaphic stresses on these harsh sites that is why the economic analysis of most of the reforestation programs implemented for salinity control also point out that these either lead to only small financial gains or are cost neutral minhas and dagar 2016b as a consequence there has been a decline in interest in reforestation programs for dryland salinity control especially in areas with annual rainfall of 300 600 mm harper et al 2017 of course these socio economic estimates usually ignored the off site and other ecosystem benefits such as microclimate modifications carbon mitigation both via carbon sequestration and bio fuels soil erosion protection biodiversity restoration and adaptations to climate change thus a realistic economic assessment of the ecosystem benefits is fundamental to integrate and justify suitable investment and supportive policies for their reforestation amongst these the major spin off of such reforestation for salinity control programs can be carbon forestry particularly when global interests are in using the land sector to meet climate mitigation targets such as those associated with second round of kyoto protocol and pledges made at paris cop 21 meeting the soils under biosaline forestry could store additional 25 9 99 3 mg co2 e ha 1 in surface 0 3 m soil as monitored after 5 10 years and in some cases for up to 20 years of their establishment in north west parts of india gupta et al 2016 however in a meta analysis of 74 publications guo and gifford 2002 concluded that soil organic carbon soc stocks declined by 10 following a change in land use from pasture to plantation but increased by 18 following a change from cropland to plantation in a later report by harper et al 2012 the organic carbon storage in surface 0 3 m soils 33 to 55 mg c ha 1 did not differ after 26 year old reforestation with four eucalyptus species e cladocalyx var nana e occidentalis e sargentii and e wandoo with the adjacent agricultural fields nevertheless there was additional carbon storage in the tree biomass 23 60 mg c ha 1 and ground floor litter 19 34 mg c ha 1 carbon sequestration rates after 10 year period ranged from 2 5 7 7 co2 e mg ha 1 yr 1 with e sargentil 6 5 co2 e mg ha 1 yr 1 and e occidentlis 7 7 co2 e mg ha 1 yr 1 being promising harper et al 2017 thus the major benefits from reforestation can emerge from their potential for carbon credits which now include carbon sequestered in living and dead biomass and in the soil the other benefit of reforestation is increased biodiversity by enhancing numerous ecological and production functions anyhow the reforestation strategies usually involve monoculture or mixtures of few fast growing and salt tolerant tree species biodiversity and other ecological functions may not be achieved as noticed with forest regeneration with naturally occurring multiple species 8 conclusions extensive experiences gained world over bring out the role the tree plantations play in controlling water vis à vis salt balances both at the farm and regional levels their viable utilization for maximization of benefits should include not only greening the degraded soils but also resource conservation in terms of water table draw downs and other economic and environmental benefits in fact deep rooted and profligate water user species like eucalyptus provide for viable and productive alternatives for restoring hydrological balances and managing water logging problems however their effectiveness for bio drainage purposes is defined by factors like soil and climatic conditions groundwater depth and its quality fraction of area reforested growth rates of species planted their stocking patterns and the geometries on the whole the reforestation options seem viable under the situations i the planted trees can tolerate the saline and waterlogged conditions and their root system are able to extract water from phreatic zones ii water table vis à vis capillary fringe water is of lesser salinity preferably 6 ds m 1 and exist at shallower depth about 2 6 m deep for easier approach and extraction by the tree roots iii soils allow for deeper proliferation of tree roots and rapidly transmit water to meet tree demands with lesser transmissivity of water the effectiveness gets reduced in heavy textured soils iv tree water use to annual rainfall ratio is higher and the effectiveness usually decreases with rainfall above 400 600 mm v strategies for reforestation include high density configuration at recharge sites for perched water tables or creation of seepage interception sites with high density strips boundary plantations etc and vi extensive areas 30 50 of the catchment are covered under reforestation plans nevertheless with current lacunas of long time lags for groundwater response and high scales of planting the impetus for reforestation can be generated only with additional benefits beyond on and off site salinity mitigation these include trading carbon credits diversification of farm income and employment generation the tools and approaches which can further improve the viability of reforestation programmes include i identification of hot spot locations for prioritizing reforestation using gis and remotes sensing techniques ii predictions of secondary salinity with the help of process based models and building scenarios for testing of different reforestation designs and how best these can be integrated with other agronomic engineering management techniques to minimize the salinity impacts and iii identification development of other economically productive and salinity tolerant tree species and devising means of their integration into existing farming systems all these necessitate the development of strategic frameworks for amalgamating reforestation that can ensure sustainable and inclusive growth of agriculture on these harsh agro ecologies afflicted by salinity

10698,although deficit irrigation di may have the potential to optimize crop yields in water limited environments the success of such strategies may depend on the ability to manage variability in profile stored soil water during periods of drought understanding variability in stored soil water and crop rooting depth is an important component of successfully managing a deficit irrigation strategy traditionally di is applied at a fraction of the full irrigation fi requirement but managed deficit irrigation mdi may optimize yield and irrigation by coordinating irrigation timing with the crop s reproductive stages through the management of soil water depletion and water stress the depth of the soil water use by grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench was evaluated in the high plains of texas usa under fi di and mdi strategies during the 2010 2012 growing seasons crop water use during critical growth stages was year specific due to variable precipitation and antecedent soil moisture

emergence under all treatments and soil water contents remained 50 ppaw at half bloom for fi and mdi soil water contents were 50 ppaw at half bloom for both di and mdi in 2011 and 2012 in 2011 water contents only remained 50 ppaw under fi from 0 to 0 6 m through the growing season due to variability in the depth of the stored soil water irrigation scheduling based on managed allowed depletion below ppaw may need to be modified to account for greater sparse root densities deeper in the profile keywords grain sorghum crop water use irrigation soil water management 1 introduction development and evaluation of sustainable and efficient irrigation strategies is a priority for producers faced with water shortages resulting from aquifer depletion reduced base flows in streams and rivers and reallocation of water to non agricultural sectors because irrigation can be used to mitigate year to year variability of precipitation in semi arid production systems it is necessary to promote sound management strategies to improve irrigation efficiency and conserve water resources globally agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of water use fao 2016 gurian sherman 2012 calzadilla et al 2010 on the texas high plains irrigation water is principally pumped from the ogallala aquifer while the ogallala aquifer is the largest aquifer in the united states underlying 450 000 km2 of the western side of the great plains stretching from south dakota to texas groundwater withdrawals in texas primarily due to irrigation greatly exceed recharge which has been estimated to range from 0 02 111 0 mm yr 1 across the high plains region although recharge is much lower across the central and southern high plains ranging from 0 02 54 1 mm yr 1 gurdak and roe 2009 to conserve water for future use regional water districts are imposing restrictions on the amount of water that can be pumped accordingly producers are considering irrigation strategies to optimize water use and crop productivity while maintaining acceptable production risks associated with reduced pumping under limited pumping scenarios producers may not be able to achieve maximum crop yield if precipitation is not timely on all formerly irrigated lands however implementation of management strategies that maximize water use efficiencies wue of irrigation water stored soil water and precipitation may potentially minimize production risks associated with limited irrigation while sustaining a water supply for future irrigated production and other uses where irrigation capacities are declining producers often opt to concentrate irrigation on reduced acreage deficit irrigation also commonly referred to as regulated deficit irrigation is defined as irrigating below the full crop water requirement to optimize production including stage based irrigation chai et al 2016 stage based irrigation utilized by comas et al 2019 is the strategic management of irrigation that coordinates the use of irrigation resources with specific critical growth periods to stress during periods of greatest yield loss staged based irrigation can also be defined as managed deficit irrigation mdi because the deficit irrigation is managed around critical growth stages rather than applied at a fraction of the full irrigation requirement incorporation of a mdi strategy coupled with drought tolerant crops enables the strategic allocation of available water with precipitation for yield maximization and optimal water use under water limited conditions drought tolerant crops such as grain sorghum have the potential to minimize production risks due to inherent physiological adaptations such as osmotic adjustment which allow the crop to withstand short term water deficits therefore under limited water the greatest yield may be achieved through management of the temporal patterns of water use howell and hiler 1975 concluded that the yield response of grain sorghum to irrigation was not correlated to seasonal et rather yield responses were dependent on the timing of the et deficit a companion paper by bell et al 2018 addressed the effects of managed deficit irrigation on the yield and yield components of grain sorghum using mdi bell et al 2018 found that yield was increased over a traditional deficit irrigation strategy when concentrating irrigation between the critical growth stages of point differentiation and half bloom the objective of this study was to compare the influence of irrigation strategies on seasonal water use at the specific growth stages and the depth of the soil water depletion it was hypothesized that 1 less frequent irrigation amounts would stimulate greater root elongation and greater uptake of soil water deeper in the profile and 2 increasing irrigation amounts from growing point differentiation to half bloom at expense of less water during vegetative stage would improve wue 2 materials and methods this research was conducted in the southern great plains at

season grain sorghum cultivar dekalb dks44 20 was evaluated under four irrigation treatments full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di managed deficit irrigation mdi and non irrigated ni with three replicates per treatment soil water contents were determined from 0 1 to 2 3 m depth in 0 2 m increments at weekly intervals throughout the growing season at two locations in each of the 12 experimental plots using a neutron moisture gage model 503dr instrotek inc raleigh nc the evaluated root zone was defined as the upper 1 6 m for all treatments and years maximum variations in water contents from 1 6 to 2 2 m depths were 0 026 m3 m 3 from emergence to physiological maturity and the associated changes in storage were not significantly different from zero in all three years p 0 210 consequently negligible changes in storage from 1 6 to 2 2 m and the lack of drainage below 2 2 m therefore suggests that rooting depth and soil water use were restricted to the upper 1 6 m of the

fluctuated over the course of this three year study above average precipitation throughout most of 2010 was followed by abnormally low seasonal precipitation in 2011 and 2012 within the study period the late fall of 2010 through 2012 was marked by a record drought and above average growing season temperatures cumulative in season precipitation during the growing season of the 2011 and 2012 experimental years was below the 73 year seasonal mean of 249 mm fig 1 in addition to below normal growing season precipitation in 2011 and 2012 winter and spring precipitation was inadequate to refill soil profiles consequently irrigation water was the primary component of et in 2011 and 2012 table 1 in all study years the maximum daily temperatures throughout the growing season exceeded the 73 year mean maximum daily temperature 31 6 c for more than 50 of the growing days 64 in 2010 83 in 2011 and 77 in 2012 bell et al 2018 in 2011 there were 46 days during the growing season that had daily maximum temperatures exceeding 38 c with 22 of those days occurring between growing point differentiation and half bloom extreme environmental conditions in 2011 resulted in the growing season cumulative et o being more than 200 mm greater in 2011 854 mm compared with 2010 and 2012 which totaled 624 and 638 mm respectively as reported by bell et al 2018 3 2 grain yield water use and leaf

strongly correlated to cumulative crop evapotranspiration et r2 0 95 to 0 97 however et during the critical growth stage from growing point differentiation to half bloom exhibited distinct characteristics for each of the three years between mdi and di treatments fig 2 in 2010 there was no difference in water use from growing point differentiation to half bloom however there was a significant grain yield advantage to mdi as a result of timely irrigation and in season precipitation in 2011 grain yield did not significantly differ between mdi and di although there was greater water use between growing point differentiation to half bloom in the mdi treatment the additional irrigation received by mdi in 2011 compensated for the reduced irrigation during this critical period as well as lack of precipitation in 2011 fig 1 in 2012 there was greater water use and a significant increase in yield in mdi compared to di bell et al 2018 reported that in 2011 and 2012 increased seeds per panicle in mdi over di treatments stabilized yields under extreme water stress crop et under mdi and di from half bloom to hard dough was less than or equal to et from growing point differentiation to half bloom et in 2011 under all treatments was greater from growing point differentiation to half bloom due to greater crop water demands compared with 2010 and 2012 fig 2 the magnitude and temporal variation of lai also varied among irrigation treatments and years fig 3 in 2010 there were no differences p 0 159 in lai among irrigation treatments until after half bloom however maximum lai of fi and both deficit irrigated treatments were attained at different development stages maximum lai for deficit irrigated treatments was achieved at half bloom day 222 while maximum lai for fi was achieved at soft dough as the crop began to senesce during grain fill significant differences in lai between irrigation treatments p 0 001 were realized leaf senescence during grain fill will decrease the assimilation of photosynthate to the grain and thereby reduce grain yield hsiao and acevedo 1974 in 2011 and 2012 lai was significantly different p 0 001 among the fi treatment and both deficit irrigation treatments throughout the growing season except at boot on day 205 in 2012 fig 3 at this stage there were no differences among 2012 irrigation treatments p 0 138 however lai of the di treatment dropped below that of mdi during the critical reproductive period likely because of the greater water deficit under di in contrast to 2010 and 2011 lai senesced following boot in 2012 day 205 under all irrigation treatments fig 3 which is suggestive of some degree of water stress at all irrigation levels 3 3 root zone plant available water in 2010 and 2012

and paw greater than 50 ppaw throughout the growing season cumulative et and grain yield were both lower under fi in 2012 compared with 2010 despite these two growing seasons having similar irrigation demands et o bell et al 2018 3 4 seasonal changes in soil water storage and rooting depth change in soil water storage at the 1 4 to 1 8 m and 1 8 to 2 2 m depth increments in all years from emergence to half bloom was not significantly different from zero for all irrigation treatments figs 5 7 following half bloom mean water contents at the 1 4 1 8 depth increment began to decline under both deficit irrigation strategies in 2010 and 2012 fig 5 and 7 which is indicative of plant uptake as drainage was found to be insignificant however changes in soil water contents from half bloom to physiological maturity at the 1 4 1 8 m depth averaged 5 mm and were not significantly different from zero p 0 146 decline in soil water contents from half bloom to physiological maturity at 1 0 1 4 m was similar between all treatments and reflective of water uptake at this depth increment in 2010 and 2012 the mean change in water contents was 12 and 11 mm in 2010 and 2012 respectively in 2011 there were not any significant changes in soil water below 0 6 m for all irrigation treatments from half bloom to maturity throughout the growing season which reflected a lack of roots below 0 6 m p 0 153 table 4 fig 6 while soil water extraction at deeper depths is limited by root densities the point where the plant reaches permanent wilting point varies between soils tolk and evett 2012 described the lower limits of water use for three soils with distinct textural classes the authors defined the lower limits of water use for sandy loam and silt loam soils as 0 118 and 0 131 m3 m 3 respectively in comparison the lower limit of water use for a pullman clay loam the soil of the present study was 0 215 m3 m 3 tolk and evett 2012 non significant changes in soil water below 0 6 m may also be the result of the soil approaching the lower limit of water use for the same soil maximum rooting depths evaluated from soil cores at growing point differentiation and physiological maturity table 4 were significantly influenced by cropping year p 0 001 maximum rooting depth was greater in 2010 compared with 2011 likely because of limited plant available water below 0 6 m during 2011 in 2010 and 2012 there were no significant irrigation treatment effects on maximum rooting depth at all growth stages p 0 181 however in 2011 the rooting depth under fi was significantly greater than the rooting depth of mdi at growing point differentiation but there was no significant difference between fi and di at growing point differentiation p 0 034 differences in rooting depth were not significant at physiological maturity p 0 065 during 2011 fully irrigated plots tended to have the greatest rooting depths table 4 an equal or greater rooting depth under fi was unanticipated as it was hypothesized that rooting depth would be greater under water deficit treatments to compensate for reduced soil water contents near the surface however the differences were not significant which suggests that root elongation was not influenced by soil water deficits in this study 3 5 soil water contents by depth in relation to plant available water soil water contents by depth in relation to soil water contents at field capacity permanent wilting point and 50 of potential plant available water with depth ppaw z are plotted for all years and irrigation treatments figs 8 10 under full irrigation in 2012 water contents were greater than 50 ppaw z until half bloom within the entire profile 0 1 6 m fig 10 at half bloom mean water contents fell below 50 ppaw z to 0 25 m3 m 3 in the upper profile 0 to 0 8 m however mean water contents at depths from 0 8 to 1 6 m were 0 28 m3 m 3 and greater than 50 ppaw z at half bloom fig 10 which resulted in the depth averaged ppaw mean water content for the root zone to be maintained at the 50 ppaw 0 265 m3 m 3 level or greater fig 4 despite the availability of water deeper in the profile in 2012 only 15 mm was utilized from half bloom to hard dough by the fully irrigated crop below a depth of 0 6 m in contrast water contents above 0 6 m were maintained above 50 ppaw z under full irrigation from emergence to hard dough in 2011 in 2010 water contents were maintained above 50 ppaw z under fi throughout the growing season above 1 2 m there was evidence of root extension to deeper depths under full irrigation figs 7 and 10 in 2012 however from half bloom to physiological maturity a relatively low et compared with fi in 2010 and 2011 and a rapidly declining lai fig 3 suggest that the crop was water stressed and not utilizing soil water these observations suggest that water deeper in the profile was not available to the degree it was nearer the surface in 2012 although there was evidence of root uptake to 1 4 m under fi in 2012 figs 4 and 7 root density at these depths were likely insufficient to access plant available water from the entire soil volume e g moroke et al 2005 consequently based on the concepts of radial water flow to roots introduced by gardner 1964 water contents surrounding the roots deeper the profile would be lower than water contents measured by the neutron moisture gage in this respect neutron moisture gages may not give an accurate representation of water contents near the root the corresponding water stress experienced by the crop and hence irrigation requirements when root length density is sparse these results are contrary to current concepts that root extension continues at low water potentials in order to utilize water at deeper depths assefa et al 2010 ober and sharp 2007 plant responses at low soil water potentials are a reaction to the production of the plant hormone abscisic acid which induces stomatal closure in the leaves and increased root growth evaluation of root growth in corn has revealed that mutated cultivars deficient in abscisic acid continue shoot growth in lieu of root growth which magnifies water stress because the plant cannot sustain soil water uptake under drought chávez et al 2003 sharp et al 1994 because sorghum is a drought tolerant crop capable of deeper rooting depths blum and arkin 1984 wright and smith 1983 it is plausible that rooting activity and consequential root water uptake in this study was hybrid dependent and not necessarily reflective of sorghum potential research is needed to discern differences among hybrids in 2010 soil water contents within the rooting zone 0 1 6 m were 50 ppaw z at emergence under the deficit irrigation treatments fig 8 however in 2012 soil water contents were 50 ppaw below 1 2 m at planting fig 10 in 2010 soil water contents fell below 50 ppaw z under di at half bloom in the 0 to 0 8 m increment while in 2012 soil water contents in the entire root zone 0 1 6 m were 50 ppaw soil water contents for both fi and mdi remained above 50 ppaw z at half bloom in 2010 as a result of increased irrigation frequency during the critical growth period figs 4 and 8 by hard dough soil water contents were 50 ppaw at all depth increments under di and mdi in 2010 and 2012 figs 8 and 10 despite initial water contents averaging 42 of ppaw in 2011 at the 0 6 to 1 0 m depth increment under all irrigation treatments water contents in this zone did not significantly change throughout the entire season suggesting that nearly all of the root water uptake was confined to above 0 6 m fig 6 sub optimal yields under fi were likely not realized in 2011 because irrigation and precipitation were able to meet nearly all of the crop water requirement table 1 in 2011 ppaw rarely dropped below the mad for the fi treatment in comparison irrigation and precipitation were not able to meet the mad goal of 50 ppaw for di and mdi treatments fig 4 wues were relatively low in 2011 because of the high seasonal et o and corresponding greater water use root extension and subsequent water uptake deeper in the profile may require soil water contents to be greater than approximately 50 ppaw under conditions when the sorghum can access near surface soil water at relatively low potentials blum and arkin 1984 reported that near surface root activity was promoted by irrigation although distribution was also skewed by irrigation in this study reduced irrigation and corresponding greater water potentials near the surface under deficit strategies was insufficient to generate compensatory uptake deeper in the horizon in 2011 some evidence of uptake was observed in 2010 and 2012 as detected by the decline in water content within the 1 0 to 1 4 m depth increment under di and mdi 13 1 12 5 mm respectively figs 5 and 7 at this depth increment the changes occurred under conditions where paw was largely greater than 50 ppaw z 0 265 m3 m 3 at half bloom because the soil water content was above the lower limit of water uptake for this soil pullam clay loam however water uptake deeper in the profile was small in magnitude 5 7 mm at 1 4 1 8 m depth from growing point differentiation to hard dough in 2010 and 2012 and insufficient to significantly influence grain yield this suggested that there was no evidence of compensatory uptake under deficit irrigation strategies 2010 and 2012 at depths greater than 1 4 m 4 summary water use during critical growth stages was year specific due to variable precipitation and antecedent soil moisture even though irrigation strategies were maintained as planned in all years in 2010 soil water contents under fi were greater than 50 ppaw z from emergence through hard dough from 0 to 1 2 m in 2011 water contents were also above 50 ppaw z under fi throughout the growing season but this was only from 0 to 0 6 m while soil water contents at all depths were 50 ppaw z at emergence in 2012 water contents above 0 8 m were 50 ppaw z at half bloom canopy development and lai varied between years as a result of varying environmental conditions and water stress levels maximum lai was attained during boot stage in 2012 whereas it was attained during soft dough in 2010 and 2011 in 2012 the crop began to senesce during grain fill which likely resulted in decreased assimilation of photosynthates for transfer into grain and thus decreased yield rapid development and earlier senescence in 2012 were likely the result of water and heat stress it is likely that the suboptimal yields in 2012 under all irrigation treatments resulted from greater water stress as implied by lower lai after half bloom compared with the other years borrell et al 2000 reported that post anthesis drought reduce grain yield for sensitive hybrids due to a reduction in stem reserves and stem mass maximum rooting depth also varied among cropping year and irrigation strategy as also reported by blum and arkin 1984 in 2010 and 2012 maximum rooting depth was not influenced by irrigation strategy however in 2011 maximum rooting depth was greatest under fi at growing point differentiation which indicated that imposed water deficits during vegetative stages did not result in compensatory root growth conversely pabuayon et al 2019 reported that sorghum roots extended to deeper depths in response to deficit irrigation as did blum and ritchie 1984 there was no difference in rooting depth at physiological maturity rooting depth was deeper in 2012 compared with 2011 and 2010 as inferred from changes in soil water contents but confirmation of this was not completed with final rooting depth measurements although stored soil water was available deeper in the profile in 2012 50 ppaw z the rooting densities were likely insufficient to fully access this water when root length density is sparse water contents near roots would be expected to be lower compared with large scale volume average water contents assessed by the neutron moisture gage consequently ppaw z assessed using the neutron moisture gage at these deeper depths in 2012 may not reflect soil water contents near the roots and hence the water status of the crop as a result irrigation applied based on 50 ppaw in the root zone was likely insufficient to obtain maximum yield therefore irrigation scheduling based on managed allowed depletion may need to be modified by weighting available water in the depth of greatest root densities near the surface more heavily to account for sparser root densities deeper in the profile 5 conclusions evaluation of mdi under other growing conditions soils and irrigation levels may be necessary to determine if this irrigation strategy has the potential for widespread application additionally evaluation of management at greater fractions of full irrigation than those evaluated in this study is warranted bell et al 2018 reported that the maximum water use efficiency for mdi strategies might be attained between 75 and 100 of full irrigation while grain yield under fi was significantly greater each year compared with deficit irrigation strategies the grain yield of mdi was significantly greater than that of di in 2010 and 2012 increased irrigation in 2011 mitigated significant differences between di and mdi in that year on fine textured soils with considerable soil water storage utilization of mdi provides the ability to concentrate irrigation water at the critical growth stages this research confirmed that this strategy can potentially optimize water use and production under limited water however alternative cropping scenarios and management regimes such as planting fewer irrigated acres and maintaining a fi crop may prove to be the most economical depending on seasonal precipitation and stored soil water

10698,although deficit irrigation di may have the potential to optimize crop yields in water limited environments the success of such strategies may depend on the ability to manage variability in profile stored soil water during periods of drought understanding variability in stored soil water and crop rooting depth is an important component of successfully managing a deficit irrigation strategy traditionally di is applied at a fraction of the full irrigation fi requirement but managed deficit irrigation mdi may optimize yield and irrigation by coordinating irrigation timing with the crop s reproductive stages through the management of soil water depletion and water stress the depth of the soil water use by grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench was evaluated in the high plains of texas usa under fi di and mdi strategies during the 2010 2012 growing seasons crop water use during critical growth stages was year specific due to variable precipitation and antecedent soil moisture even though irrigation strategies were maintained as planned in all years in 2010 soil water contents within the rooting zone 0 1 6 m were 50 of the potential plant available water ppaw in the soil at emergence under all treatments and soil water contents remained 50 ppaw at half bloom for fi and mdi soil water contents were 50 ppaw at half bloom for both di and mdi in 2011 and 2012 in 2011 water contents only remained 50 ppaw under fi from 0 to 0 6 m through the growing season due to variability in the depth of the stored soil water irrigation scheduling based on managed allowed depletion below ppaw may need to be modified to account for greater sparse root densities deeper in the profile keywords grain sorghum crop water use irrigation soil water management 1 introduction development and evaluation of sustainable and efficient irrigation strategies is a priority for producers faced with water shortages resulting from aquifer depletion reduced base flows in streams and rivers and reallocation of water to non agricultural sectors because irrigation can be used to mitigate year to year variability of precipitation in semi arid production systems it is necessary to promote sound management strategies to improve irrigation efficiency and conserve water resources globally agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of water use fao 2016 gurian sherman 2012 calzadilla et al 2010 on the texas high plains irrigation water is principally pumped from the ogallala aquifer while the ogallala aquifer is the largest aquifer in the united states underlying 450 000 km2 of the western side of the great plains stretching from south dakota to texas groundwater withdrawals in texas primarily due to irrigation greatly exceed recharge which has been estimated to range from 0 02 111 0 mm yr 1 across the high plains region although recharge is much lower across the central and southern high plains ranging from 0 02 54 1 mm yr 1 gurdak and roe 2009 to conserve water for future use regional water districts are imposing restrictions on the amount of water that can be pumped accordingly producers are considering irrigation strategies to optimize water use and crop productivity while maintaining acceptable production risks associated with reduced pumping under limited pumping scenarios producers may not be able to achieve maximum crop yield if precipitation is not timely on all formerly irrigated lands however implementation of management strategies that maximize water use efficiencies wue of irrigation water stored soil water and precipitation may potentially minimize production risks associated with limited irrigation while sustaining a water supply for future irrigated production and other uses where irrigation capacities are declining producers often opt to concentrate irrigation on reduced acreage deficit irrigation also commonly referred to as regulated deficit irrigation is defined as irrigating below the full crop water requirement to optimize production including stage based irrigation chai et al 2016 stage based irrigation utilized by comas et al 2019 is the strategic management of irrigation that coordinates the use of irrigation resources with specific critical growth periods to stress during periods of greatest yield loss staged based irrigation can also be defined as managed deficit irrigation mdi because the deficit irrigation is managed around critical growth stages rather than applied at a fraction of the full irrigation requirement incorporation of a mdi strategy coupled with drought tolerant crops enables the strategic allocation of available water with precipitation for yield maximization and optimal water use under water limited conditions drought tolerant crops such as grain sorghum have the potential to minimize production risks due to inherent physiological adaptations such as osmotic adjustment which allow the crop to withstand short term water deficits therefore under limited water the greatest yield may be achieved through management of the temporal patterns of water use howell and hiler 1975 concluded that the yield response of grain sorghum to irrigation was not correlated to seasonal et rather yield responses were dependent on the timing of the et deficit a companion paper by bell et al 2018 addressed the effects of managed deficit irrigation on the yield and yield components of grain sorghum using mdi bell et al 2018 found that yield was increased over a traditional deficit irrigation strategy when concentrating irrigation between the critical growth stages of point differentiation and half bloom the objective of this study was to compare the influence of irrigation strategies on seasonal water use at the specific growth stages and the depth of the soil water depletion it was hypothesized that 1 less frequent irrigation amounts would stimulate greater root elongation and greater uptake of soil water deeper in the profile and 2 increasing irrigation amounts from growing point differentiation to half bloom at expense of less water during vegetative stage would improve wue 2 materials and methods this research was conducted in the southern great plains at

experimental plots using a neutron moisture gage model 503dr instrotek inc raleigh nc the evaluated root zone was defined as the upper 1 6 m for all treatments and years maximum variations in water contents from 1 6 to 2 2 m depths were 0 026 m3 m 3 from emergence to physiological maturity and the associated changes in storage were not significantly different from zero in all three years p 0 210 consequently negligible changes in storage from 1 6 to 2 2 m and the lack of drainage below 2 2 m therefore suggests that rooting depth and soil water use were restricted to the upper 1 6 m of the

fluctuated over the course of this three year study above average precipitation throughout most of 2010 was followed by abnormally low seasonal precipitation in 2011 and 2012 within the study period the late fall of 2010 through 2012 was marked by a record drought and above average growing season temperatures cumulative in season precipitation during the growing season of the 2011 and 2012 experimental years was below the 73 year seasonal mean of 249 mm fig 1 in addition to below normal growing season precipitation in 2011 and 2012 winter and spring precipitation was inadequate to refill soil profiles consequently irrigation water was the primary component of et in 2011 and 2012 table 1 in all study years the maximum daily temperatures throughout the growing season exceeded the 73 year mean maximum daily temperature 31 6 c for more than 50 of the growing days 64 in 2010 83 in 2011 and 77 in 2012 bell et al 2018 in 2011 there were 46 days during the growing season that had daily maximum temperatures exceeding 38 c with 22 of those days occurring between growing point differentiation and half bloom extreme environmental conditions in 2011 resulted in the growing season cumulative et o being more than 200 mm greater in 2011 854 mm compared with 2010 and 2012 which totaled 624 and 638 mm respectively as reported by bell et al 2018 3 2 grain yield water use and leaf area index mean grain yields from fi treatments were significantly greater than yields from mdi and di treatments in all three years p 0 001 table 2 bell et al 2018 mean grain yields of mdi were greater than the yields of di in all years although yields were only significantly greater p 0 001 in two of the three years 2010 and 2012 grain yields from all irrigation treatments and years were strongly correlated to cumulative crop evapotranspiration et r2 0 95 to 0 97 however et during the critical growth stage from growing point differentiation to half bloom exhibited distinct characteristics for each of the three years between mdi and di treatments fig 2 in 2010 there was no difference in water use from growing point differentiation to half bloom however there was a significant grain yield advantage to mdi as a result of timely irrigation and in season precipitation in 2011 grain yield did not significantly differ between mdi and di although there was greater water use between growing point differentiation to half bloom in the mdi treatment the additional irrigation received by mdi in 2011 compensated for the reduced irrigation during this critical period as well as lack of precipitation in 2011 fig 1 in 2012 there was greater water use and a significant increase in yield in mdi compared to di bell et al 2018 reported that in 2011 and 2012 increased seeds per panicle in mdi over di treatments stabilized yields under extreme water stress crop et under mdi and di from half bloom to hard dough was less than or equal to et from growing point differentiation to half bloom et in 2011 under all treatments was greater from growing point differentiation to half bloom due to greater crop water demands compared with 2010 and 2012 fig 2 the magnitude and temporal variation of lai also varied among irrigation treatments and years fig 3 in 2010 there were no differences p 0 159 in lai among irrigation treatments until after half bloom however maximum lai of fi and both deficit irrigated treatments were attained at different development stages maximum lai for deficit irrigated treatments was achieved at half bloom day 222 while maximum lai for fi was achieved at soft dough as the crop began to senesce during grain fill significant differences in lai between irrigation treatments p 0 001 were realized leaf senescence during grain fill will decrease the assimilation of photosynthate to the grain and thereby reduce grain yield hsiao and acevedo 1974 in 2011 and 2012 lai was significantly different p 0 001 among the fi treatment and both deficit irrigation treatments throughout the growing season except at boot on day 205 in 2012 fig 3 at this stage there were no differences among 2012 irrigation treatments p 0 138 however lai of the di treatment dropped below that of mdi during the critical reproductive period likely because of the greater water deficit under di in contrast to 2010 and 2011 lai senesced following boot in 2012 day 205 under all irrigation treatments fig 3 which is suggestive of some degree of water stress at all irrigation levels 3 3 root zone plant available water in 2010 and 2012 the field plant available water paw under fi exceeded or equaled 50 ppaw 105 mm the mad threshold except for a short duration just prior to physiological maturity in 2012 fig 4 in 2011 paw declined to as low as 89 mm 17 s d 43 ppaw under fi during half bloom during this period maintenance of paw at or above 50 ppaw through irrigation was difficult due to extremely high crop et and low pre plant soil water contents under full irrigation mean paw at emergence was greatest in 2012 191 mm compared with 2010 and 2011 146 and 96 mm greater than 2010 table 3 despite having an initial water content and paw greater than 50 ppaw throughout the growing season cumulative et and grain yield were both lower under fi in 2012 compared with 2010 despite these two growing seasons having similar irrigation demands et o bell et al 2018 3 4 seasonal changes in soil water storage and rooting depth change in soil water storage at the 1 4 to 1 8 m and 1 8 to 2 2 m depth increments in all years from emergence to half bloom was not significantly different from zero for all irrigation treatments figs 5 7 following half bloom mean water contents at the 1 4 1 8 depth increment began to decline under both deficit irrigation strategies in 2010 and 2012 fig 5 and 7 which is indicative of plant uptake as drainage was found to be insignificant however changes in soil water contents from half bloom to physiological maturity at the 1 4 1 8 m depth averaged 5 mm and were not significantly different from zero p 0 146 decline in soil water contents from half bloom to physiological maturity at 1 0 1 4 m was similar between all treatments and reflective of water uptake at this depth increment in 2010 and 2012 the mean change in water contents was 12 and 11 mm in 2010 and 2012 respectively in 2011 there were not any significant changes in soil water below 0 6 m for all irrigation treatments from half bloom to maturity throughout the growing season which reflected a lack of roots below 0 6 m p 0 153 table 4 fig 6 while soil water extraction at deeper depths is limited by root densities the point where the plant reaches permanent wilting point varies between soils tolk and evett 2012 described the lower limits of water use for three soils with distinct textural classes the authors defined the lower limits of water use for sandy loam and silt loam soils as 0 118 and 0 131 m3 m 3 respectively in comparison the lower limit of water use for a pullman clay loam the soil of the present study was 0 215 m3 m 3 tolk and evett 2012 non significant changes in soil water below 0 6 m may also be the result of the soil approaching the lower limit of water use for the same soil maximum rooting depths evaluated from soil cores at growing point differentiation and physiological maturity table 4 were significantly influenced by cropping year p 0 001 maximum rooting depth was greater in 2010 compared with 2011 likely because of limited plant available water below 0 6 m during 2011 in 2010 and 2012 there were no significant irrigation treatment effects on maximum rooting depth at all growth stages p 0 181 however in 2011 the rooting depth under fi was significantly greater than the rooting depth of mdi at growing point differentiation but there was no significant difference between fi and di at growing point differentiation p 0 034 differences in rooting depth were not significant at physiological maturity p 0 065 during 2011 fully irrigated plots tended to have the greatest rooting depths table 4 an equal or greater rooting depth under fi was unanticipated as it was hypothesized that rooting depth would be greater under water deficit treatments to compensate for reduced soil water contents near the surface however the differences were not significant which suggests that root elongation was not influenced by soil water deficits in this study 3 5 soil water contents by depth in relation to plant available water soil water contents by depth in relation to soil water contents at field capacity permanent wilting point and 50 of potential plant available water with depth ppaw z are plotted for all years and irrigation treatments figs 8 10 under full irrigation in 2012 water contents were greater than 50 ppaw z until half bloom within the entire profile 0 1 6 m fig 10 at half bloom mean water contents fell below 50 ppaw z to 0 25 m3 m 3 in the upper profile 0 to 0 8 m however mean water contents at depths from 0 8 to 1 6 m were 0 28 m3 m 3 and greater than 50 ppaw z at half bloom fig 10 which resulted in the depth averaged ppaw mean water content for the root zone to be maintained at the 50 ppaw 0 265 m3 m 3 level or greater fig 4 despite the availability of water deeper in the profile in 2012 only 15 mm was utilized from half bloom to hard dough by the fully irrigated crop below a depth of 0 6 m in contrast water contents above 0 6 m were maintained above 50 ppaw z under full irrigation from emergence to hard dough in 2011 in 2010 water contents were maintained above 50 ppaw z under fi throughout the growing season above 1 2 m there was evidence of root extension to deeper depths under full irrigation figs 7 and 10 in 2012 however from half bloom to physiological maturity a relatively low et compared with fi in 2010 and 2011 and a rapidly declining lai fig 3 suggest that the crop was water stressed and not utilizing soil water these observations suggest that water deeper in the profile was not available to the degree it was nearer the surface in 2012 although there was evidence of root uptake to 1 4 m under fi in 2012 figs 4 and 7 root density at these depths were likely insufficient to access plant available water from the entire soil volume e g moroke et al 2005 consequently based on the concepts of radial water flow to roots introduced by gardner 1964 water contents surrounding the roots deeper the profile would be lower than water contents measured by the neutron moisture gage in this respect neutron moisture gages may not give an accurate representation of water contents near the root the corresponding water stress experienced by the crop and hence irrigation requirements when root length density is sparse these results are contrary to current concepts that root extension continues at low water potentials in order to utilize water at deeper depths assefa et al 2010 ober and sharp 2007 plant responses at low soil water potentials are a reaction to the production of the plant hormone abscisic acid which induces stomatal closure in the leaves and increased root growth evaluation of root growth in corn has revealed that mutated cultivars deficient in abscisic acid continue shoot growth in lieu of root growth which magnifies water stress because the plant cannot sustain soil water uptake under drought chávez et al 2003 sharp et al 1994 because sorghum is a drought tolerant crop capable of deeper rooting depths blum and arkin 1984 wright and smith 1983 it is plausible that rooting activity and consequential root water uptake in this study was hybrid dependent and not necessarily reflective of sorghum potential research is needed to discern differences among hybrids in 2010 soil water contents within the rooting zone 0 1 6 m were 50 ppaw z at emergence under the deficit irrigation treatments fig 8 however in 2012 soil water contents were 50 ppaw below 1 2 m at planting fig 10 in 2010 soil water contents fell below 50 ppaw z under di at half bloom in the 0 to 0 8 m increment while in 2012 soil water contents in the entire root zone 0 1 6 m were 50 ppaw soil water contents for both fi and mdi remained above 50 ppaw z at half bloom in 2010 as a result of increased irrigation frequency during the critical growth period figs 4 and 8 by hard dough soil water contents were 50 ppaw at all depth increments under di and mdi in 2010 and 2012 figs 8 and 10 despite initial water contents averaging 42 of ppaw in 2011 at the 0 6 to 1 0 m depth increment under all irrigation treatments water contents in this zone did not significantly change throughout the entire season suggesting that nearly all of the root water uptake was confined to above 0 6 m fig 6 sub optimal yields under fi were likely not realized in 2011 because irrigation and precipitation were able to meet nearly all of the crop water requirement table 1 in 2011 ppaw rarely dropped below the mad for the fi treatment in comparison irrigation and precipitation were not able to meet the mad goal of 50 ppaw for di and mdi treatments fig 4 wues were relatively low in 2011 because of the high seasonal et o and corresponding greater water use root extension and subsequent water uptake deeper in the profile may require soil water contents to be greater than approximately 50 ppaw under conditions when the sorghum can access near surface soil water at relatively low potentials blum and arkin 1984 reported that near surface root activity was promoted by irrigation although distribution was also skewed by irrigation in this study reduced irrigation and corresponding greater water potentials near the surface under deficit strategies was insufficient to generate compensatory uptake deeper in the horizon in 2011 some evidence of uptake was observed in 2010 and 2012 as detected by the decline in water content within the 1 0 to 1 4 m depth increment under di and mdi 13 1 12 5 mm respectively figs 5 and 7 at this depth increment the changes occurred under conditions where paw was largely greater than 50 ppaw z 0 265 m3 m 3 at half bloom because the soil water content was above the lower limit of water uptake for this soil pullam clay loam however water uptake deeper in the profile was small in magnitude 5 7 mm at 1 4 1 8 m depth from growing point differentiation to hard dough in 2010 and 2012 and insufficient to significantly influence grain yield this suggested that there was no evidence of compensatory uptake under deficit irrigation strategies 2010 and 2012 at depths greater than 1 4 m 4 summary water use during critical growth stages was year specific due to variable precipitation and antecedent soil moisture even though irrigation strategies were maintained as planned in all years in 2010 soil water contents under fi were greater than 50 ppaw z from emergence through hard dough from 0 to 1 2 m in 2011 water contents were also above 50 ppaw z under fi throughout the growing season but this was only from 0 to 0 6 m while soil water contents at all depths were 50 ppaw z at emergence in 2012 water contents above 0 8 m were 50 ppaw z at half bloom canopy development and lai varied between years as a result of varying environmental conditions and water stress levels maximum lai was attained during boot stage in 2012 whereas it was attained during soft dough in 2010 and 2011 in 2012 the crop began to senesce during grain fill which likely resulted in decreased assimilation of photosynthates for transfer into grain and thus decreased yield rapid development and earlier senescence in 2012 were likely the result of water and heat stress it is likely that the suboptimal yields in 2012 under all irrigation treatments resulted from greater water stress as implied by lower lai after half bloom compared with the other years borrell et al 2000 reported that post anthesis drought reduce grain yield for sensitive hybrids due to a reduction in stem reserves and stem mass maximum rooting depth also varied among cropping year and irrigation strategy as also reported by blum and arkin 1984 in 2010 and 2012 maximum rooting depth was not influenced by irrigation strategy however in 2011 maximum rooting depth was greatest under fi at growing point differentiation which indicated that imposed water deficits during vegetative stages did not result in compensatory root growth conversely pabuayon et al 2019 reported that sorghum roots extended to deeper depths in response to deficit irrigation as did blum and ritchie 1984 there was no difference in rooting depth at physiological maturity rooting depth was deeper in 2012 compared with 2011 and 2010 as inferred from changes in soil water contents but confirmation of this was not completed with final rooting depth measurements although stored soil water was available deeper in the profile in 2012 50 ppaw z the rooting densities were likely insufficient to fully access this water when root length density is sparse water contents near roots would be expected to be lower compared with large scale volume average water contents assessed by the neutron moisture gage consequently ppaw z assessed using the neutron moisture gage at these deeper depths in 2012 may not reflect soil water contents near the roots and hence the water status of the crop as a result irrigation applied based on 50 ppaw in the root zone was likely insufficient to obtain maximum yield therefore irrigation scheduling based on managed allowed depletion may need to be modified by weighting available water in the depth of greatest root densities near the surface more heavily to account for sparser root densities deeper in the profile 5 conclusions evaluation of mdi under other growing conditions soils and irrigation levels may be necessary to determine if this irrigation strategy has the potential for widespread application additionally evaluation of management at greater fractions of full irrigation than those evaluated in this study is warranted bell et al 2018 reported that the maximum water use efficiency for mdi strategies might be attained between 75 and 100 of full irrigation while grain yield under fi was significantly greater each year compared with deficit irrigation strategies the grain yield of mdi was significantly greater than that of di in 2010 and 2012 increased irrigation in 2011 mitigated significant differences between di and mdi in that year on fine textured soils with considerable soil water storage utilization of mdi provides the ability to concentrate irrigation water at the critical growth stages this research confirmed that this strategy can potentially optimize water use and production under limited water however alternative cropping scenarios and management regimes such as planting fewer irrigated acres and maintaining a fi crop may prove to be the most economical depending on seasonal precipitation and stored soil water

10699,the assessment of hydrologic ecosystem services associated with flood irrigation in the western united states is particularly limited by a lack of data about return flows return flows the portion of applied water that returns to adjacent surface and groundwater hydrologic systems during flood irrigation may provide wildlife habitat recharge aquifers and supplement late season baseflows to improve understanding about variability in the timing and volume of return flows to improve management and policy decisions associated with different irrigation management techniques our study used an agricultural water balance that combined hydrologic geophysical and meteorological tools we directly measure key components of the water balance and quantify error and uncertainty on a 100 ha portion of the bear creek watershed in the upper wind river basin of wyoming over the course of a single irrigation season with average precipitation we found that of the 1 133 000 m3 of water applied to irrigated lands 328 000 m3 29 of applied water returned to bear creek and 487 000 m3 43 of applied water was consumptively used by vegetation our data also suggest that 59 000 m3 18 of total return flows occurred more than two weeks after irrigation had ceased the percent of return flow for this study site is slightly lower than the median of 43 for all reviewed studies and the percent of delayed return flow return flow after irrigation has ceased is slightly higher than the median finding of 14 across available studies we found that return flows from flood irrigation at this site are lower than generalized regional estimates and those found by other studies thus our study indicates that the amount and timing of return flows are not necessarily coupled i e lower overall volume did not correspond to lowered late season contribution at this site in addition we found that these return flows support hydrologic ecosystem services including riparian vegetation wildlife habitat groundwater storage and late season baseflows keywords return flows irrigation efficiency scintillometer agricultural water 1 introduction as the largest consumer of freshwater withdrawals in the western united states us irrigation dependent agriculture is under pressure to adapt to declining regional water supplies marris 2008 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 one widely recognized way to reduce agricultural water use is to convert from flood irrigation to more water efficient irrigation methods narayanamoorthy 2004 transitioning from less efficient flood irrigation is assumed to support a number of benefits at the watershed and basin scale including enhanced upfront water conservation for downstream delivery to users skaggs 2001 and improved on farm productivity related to more efficient water delivery to crops postel et al 2001 however research suggests that there may be substantial tradeoffs associated with conversion from flood to more efficient irrigation ward et al 2014 flood irrigation is directly linked to return flows the portion of applied water that returns to adjacent water bodies and in some cases may reflect more than half of the local water balance dewandel et al 2008 particularly in semi arid parts of the western us studies have linked these return flows to a wide range of ecosystem services that may provide public benefit including aquifer recharge fleming et al 2014 jiménez martínez et al 2009 wetstein et al 1989 supplementation of late season baseflow wetstein et al 1989 and creation of wetland habitat peck and lovvorn 2001 because of the tensions between enhanced water conservation benefits and impacts to return flows and ecosystem services at both the local and watershed scale decisions regarding irrigation management in semi arid systems are complex grafton et al 2018 growing downstream populations and increased water demands throughout the western us viviroli et al 2007 mean that questions about how to most efficiently manage irrigation systems are likely to persist into the future lecina et al 2011 the assessment and selection of the most beneficial irrigation system for water users and the environment requires data about the fate of applied irrigation water within a range of ecosystems grafton et al 2018 although research has addressed the benefits and drawbacks of drip irrigation çetin et al 2004 playán and mateos 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 the tradeoffs associated with flood irrigation and return flows remain less understood largely because there is little data about the timing and volume of return flows grafton et al 2018 claes et al 2019 the limited availability of return flow data is in part because measuring return flow requires a combination of extensive data and flow modeling dewandel et al 2008 grafton et al 2018 in many areas return flows are still estimated using generalized estimates mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 a more significant body of research exists related to the quantification of return flows from rice paddy fields ito et al 1980 kim et al 2009 liu et al 2004 zulu et al 1996 zulu et al 1996 calculated return flow over three years in japan finding that return flow varied from 79 to 83 the study also found that return flows were reduced when a greater portion of drainage water was reused for irrigation zulu et al 1996 using a water balance approach to quantify flows in to and out of rice paddy fields in the gicheon watershed in south korea kim et al 2009 estimated average annual return flows of 25 7 from 1998 to 2001 the study found approximately 14 1 of the total return flow was attributed to quick return flow and 11 6 was attributed to delayed return flow despite recognition of the importance of return flows and the ecosystem services they can support in the semi arid western united states peck and lovvorn 2001 fleming et al 2014 grafton et al 2018 there are few studies focused on the quantification of return flows in this region lecina et al 2011 wetstein et al 1989 reported average annual return flow of 70 over a 4 year period in an alluvial basin in the upper green river basin in wyoming where approximately 90 of return flows were found to re enter the stream system in spring and summer with the remaining 10 re entering the system in low flow winter months boldt et al 1999 found that 44 of applied irrigation water returned to the underlying aquifer in a furrow irrigated system in the central platte valley of nebraska more recently lecina et al 2011 quantified 28 return flow from bear river basin in utah previous studies of return flows provide a good foundation however many relied on calculated or modeled values of evapotranspiration et and change in subsurface water storage e g wetstein et al 1989 boldt et al 1999 recent advances in instrumentation make it possible to directly measure both parameters specifically large aperture scintillometers las are capable of measuring evapotranspiration for long range applications and have been compared against eddy covariance flux towers and remote sensing methods for accuracy beyrich et al 2012 kleissl et al 2009 2008 ward et al 2014 zeweldi et al 2010 zhang and zhang 2015 and geophysical instrumentation referred to as surface nuclear magnetic resonance nmr facilitates the direct measurement of subsurface storage and groundwater hertrich 2008 the objective of this study is to use interdisciplinary tools to 1 increase our ability to quantify return flow and 2 provide information to assist water managers and policymakers in evaluating the potential impacts tradeoffs associated with irrigation management decision making in diverse systems a common assumption in western water management is that return flow can be approximated for large and diverse regions using generalized estimates which can in turn be used to predict hydrologic ecosystem services and inform decisions about changes in irrigation management we hypothesize that by incorporating interdisciplinary tools and explicit measurements of et and subsurface storage into the study of return flows at a representative site and comparing results with other available studies an estimate of the potential range in return flows in the western us can be established with a higher degree of confidence we also hypothesize that site specific factors including soils vegetation and climate control return flow amount and timing in a way that cannot be fully captured using generalized estimates to investigate these hypotheses we quantify the timing and amount of return flows to a stream using a water balance based approach we then examine our results relative to other regional return flow studies including wetstein et al 1989 boldt et al 1999 and lecina et al 2011 focusing specifically on key differences and similarities in geophysical hydrologic and ecological factors lastly we discuss these findings in the larger context of their potential implications for hydrologic ecosystem services generally assumed to be associated with flood irrigation 2 study site description 2 1 study site characterization this study was conducted on a 100 ha portion of the bear creek watershed northeast of dubois wyoming in the upper wind river basin fig 1 the climate is continental and semi arid and averages 0 29 m of annual precipitation wrcc 2019 historic monthly streamflow indicates a seasonal trend with snowmelt dominating the hydrograph during the late spring and early summer followed by a return to baseflow by winter fontaine et al 2002 irrigated meadows are managed by wyoming game and fish department and the typical practice is to flood irrigate specific sections of the agricultural fields over a 16 24 hour period using a gravity fed system with gated pipe although specific details of flood irrigation management can vary between individuals in general the management practiced at the study site is typical of other regional flood irrigation practices where flood irrigation remains the dominant form of irrigation vore and lowry 2000 irrigated meadows are dominated by timothy grass phleum pratense while riparian zones contain a mix of shrubs cottonwood populus deltoids and a mix of conifers throughout the site riparian areas were topographically disconnected from the irrigated fields and were typically separated by 0 5 1 5 m drop offs comprised of exposed dirt and rock the study site is assumed to represent higher altitude portions of the western cordillera ecological region which also includes parts of western british colombia western montana central utah colorado idaho washington oregon new mexico and california usepa 2018 for more information about the study site we refer to claes et al 2019 analysis of the site using the soil survey geographic database ssurgo indicated that the site is a predominantly loam with a small portion of samples in the uppermost corners characterized as sandy loam soil survey staff 2019 soil samples collected in seven locations distributed throughout the site corroborated ssurgo database results the geological profile of the site consists of terraced unconsolidated alluvial sediment near the surface green and drouillard 1994 while the channel substrate within bear creek is primarily course sands and gravel with medium to large cobbles below the alluvial deposits on either side of the monitored reach is the wind river formation consisting of variegated red and white claystone and siltstone love and christiansen 1985 based on the local geological description and seismic profiles of the irrigated fields showing a soil profile that varies between 1 5 and 9 m depth that exhibits a slightly sloped layer cake type geology with observations indicating the depth of the soil profile thins significantly in the adjacent riparian areas where it ranges from 1 to 2 m see supplemental information si fig 1 for seismic profiles of the site and si fig 2 for a geological diagram of the site 2 2 study site delineation and area calculations for water balance for the purposes of this study accurate area estimations were required for all agricultural fields and adjacent riparian areas and we mapped the extent of agricultural fields and all points of diversion from bear creek agricultural fields were delineated using a handheld global positioning system gps device trimble geoexplorer6000 usa during the height of growing season prior to any cuttings the boundary of the agricultural fields was identified using a combination of knowledge from the wyoming game and fish department and the visual observation of change in vegetation from timothy grass phleum pratense to riparian vegetation or upland vegetation areas adjacent to the stream but separated from irrigation areas by topography and vegetation were mapped as adjacent riparian areas the resulting gps layers were analyzed in arcgis in combination with national agricultural imagery project naip 2015 data to determine the total area of each of the agricultural fields and the total area of adjacent riparian vegetation gps derived area calculations summarized in table 1 were used to determine area weighted contributions in soil water storage calculations at the site 3 methods we used a field scale volumetric water balance similar to the approaches of wetstein et al 1989 sakthivadivel et al 1999 perry 2007 2011 and lecina et al 2011 to quantify return flow in this study using eq 1 1 p qirr etb etnb δs qrt σ where p is precipitation m3 measured by a tipping bucket qirr is irrigation water applied to the field m3 and measured continuously in the ditch etb is beneficial evapotranspiration from the desired crops m3 measured by a large aperture scintillometer etnb is non beneficial evapotranspiration from adjacent riparian areas m3 calculated using penman monteith δs is change in storage m3 and potential winter return flows measured by nuclear magnetic resonance qrt is return flow m3 calculated by subtracting qin from qout and σ is uncertainty m3 a schematic of the water balance can be found in si si fig 3 in the sections below we describe the methods used to quantify each water balance component in the order of eq 1 3 1 precipitation p and irrigation qirr on site precipitation was recorded using a tipping bucket rain gauge rain collector ii davis instruments usa although there were two points of diversion from the study reach labeled fr3 and td1 in fig 1 only water diverted at fd3 was delivered to the study fields water diverted at td1 did not provide water to any of the study fields and was thus excluded from the calculation of qirr but was instead included as qloss and is further discussed in section 3 4 below water in focher ditch was diverted directly from bear creek just upstream of fd3 and ended with an earthen dam near the middle of field 1 see fig 1 which was 2500 m below the point of diversion fd3 all diverted water was thus contained within focher ditch less any seepage water in focher ditch was delivered to the irrigation fields as described in section 2 1 during haying operations water was delivered to other fields e g while field 1 was being cut water was still delivered to fields 2 and 3 no water remained in focher ditch at the end of the season the irrigation infrastructure also included 2 runoff catch ditches located in fields 1 and 2 that moved any excess surface water from the irrigation fields and adjacent riparian areas to calculate qirr in focher ditch three stilling wells were sited and installed following the united states geological survey usgs guidelines rantz 1982 see fig 1 for all stilling well locations flow in the ditches was uniform and stilling wells were located in areas with low uniform velocity e g 150 m downstream from the point of diversion to minimize potential for velocity effects replogle 1997 wells were constructed with 2 inch diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride pipe which were instrumented with a pressure transducer level troll 500 data logger in situ usa which recorded flow depth and temperature at 15 min intervals permanent cross sections were established at each well to ensure consistency in manual discharge measurements obtained via velocity area gauging which were conducted throughout the season using an electromagnetic current meter mf pro ott hydromet usa ten to thirteen such measurements were conducted in each irrigation ditch and consisted of 25 points each discharge was then calculated using developed stage discharge relationships at each site to approximate seepage field technicians conducted simultaneous discharge measurements with electromagnetic current meters at the inlet midway through and near the end of focher ditch discharge measurements obtained in this exercise were compared to determine the extent of seepage this was strengthened by comparison of discharge estimates obtained from rated sections i e fd3 fd2 and fd1 as well as geophysical and soil observations indicating high clay content in focher ditch 3 2 evapotranspiration etb etnb we calculated evapotranspiration following the work of lecina et al 2011 to include contribution from agriculturally productive areas and adjacent riparian areas using the formula presented in lecina et al 2011 for combining beneficial et and non beneficial et we determined net evapotranspiration from the site to be 2 etnet etb etnb where etb is beneficial evapotranspiration measured by a scintillometer from agricultural areas m per 99 ha and etnb is the non beneficial evapotranspiration calculated using penman monteith from adjacent riparian areas m per 99 ha a large aperture scintillometer las las mkii kipp zonen nld was set up over a 664 m path bisecting the largest of the four study area fields field 1 in fig 1 in early june 2015 the las directly measures changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere cn2 caused by fluctuations in pressure temperature and humidity related to vegetation hemakumara et al 2003 liu et al 2011 meijninger et al 2002 by quantifying the intensity of these fluctuations in the refractive index of air scintillations and combining those measurements with on site meteorological data the las can be used to measure sensible heat flux meijninger et al 2002 inputting this measured value for sensible heat flux into the surface energy balance the amount of evapotranspiration et can then be quantified liu et al 2011 the total elevation difference between the minimum elevation and maximum elevation along the measurement transect was less than 4 m the path of the las beam was oriented north transmitter to south receiver and the aperture of both instruments was 0 150 m the beam was assumed to be parallel to the ground allowing for effective beam height to be determined as 3 2 m the receiver recorded the five minute average for both cn 2 and signal strength mv wilson et al 2013 recommend that all data be collected with a signal strength greater than 25 mv and no data were below this threshold and the seasonal average signal strength was 477 mv standard deviation for both parameters was also recorded two digital time lapse cameras were installed between the meteorological station and las transmitter to capture crop growth among other observations crop height at the same location between the las transmitter and receiver was manually measured using the line point intercept method see heady and gibbens 1959 throughout the season and validated against images from both cameras a site specific growth curve was developed based on observed crop height during the growing season to ensure accurate calculation of roughness length and zero plane displacement to validate extrapolation from the site of meteorological and scintillometer measurements to all irrigated fields vegetation transect data were collected and a basic fetch analysis was performed on the other field sites a footprint analysis based on hsieh et al 2000 was also conducted to verify that the area of influence measured by the las was reflective of agricultural crops for more information on scintillation theory and measurement see the supplemental information si a meteorological tower was installed in the middle of field 1 midway between the las transmitter and receiver fig 1 to obtain data that could be scaled up to represent conditions for the entire study area the station recorded the following parameters at five minute intervals wind speed m s 1 and direction at 2 56 m temperature c and relative humidity at 2 56 m and 0 50 m pressure mbar net radiation w m2 soil heat flux w m2 at 0 08 m below the soil surface and ground surface temperature c there was a data gap in august which was filled using a linear interpolation equation in matlab matlab and statistics toolbox release 2015 the mathworks inc usa etnb from adjacent riparian areas was estimated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao form of penman monteith for reference et proposed by allen et al 1998 all inputs into the reference et equation were measured with the on site meteorological tower the calculated reference et was then modified by a crop coefficient calculated using leaf area index lai which was obtained from nagler et al 2005 due to the widespread acceptance of this method we do not include more detail on this methodology more information on these calculations can be found in si si penman monteith calculations 3 3 storage changes in groundwater storage from may to october in the agricultural fields were explicitly measured using surface nuclear magnetic resonance nmr vista clara usa soundings on the three agricultural fields using the principles outlined by hertrich 2008 nmr is directly sensitive to the subsurface distribution of hydrogen protons and when hydrogen protons from water molecules are excited within a background magnetic field the signal generated by their return from a perturbed state is measured and used to quantify water content in the subsurface hertrich 2008 legchenko et al 2002 we conducted two surface nmr soundings on each study field before the initial application of irrigation water in may of 2015 and after the cessation of the irrigation season in october of 2015 to measure changes in groundwater storage up to 15 m in depth the measured change in volumetric water content from the nmr divided by the depth of observation across the area of each irrigated meadow to reflect the total change in storage for each field to calculate water content at depth we used the framework laid out by robinson 2009 for the measurement and estimation of soil water content captured in eq 3 below 3 δsn δqn dn where δsn is the change in the average water storage in the soil profile over the course of the irrigation season m δqn is the average change in volumetric water content of the soil profile based on nmr measurement at a given site m3 m 3 and dn is the average thickness of soil profile measured m for the agricultural fields dn was determined based on the nmr measurement and for the riparian area dn was assumed to be 1 m based on the subsurface geological description and geophysical measurements at the site see si fig 1 we used a simple areal interpolation approach adapted from flowerdew and green 1993 based on the size of the agricultural fields and riparian areas to determine relative contributions as described in eq 4 below 4 δs a1 δs1 a2 δs2 a3 δs3 ar δsr where δs is the total change in the average depth of groundwater storage across the entire bear creek study site m a1 is area of field 1 m2 see table 1 for detail and δs1 is the change in the average depth of water in the soil profile for field 1 from eq 3 m a2 a3 and ar are the areas of fields 2 3 and the riparian area m2 and δs2 δs3 δs3 are the changes in average depth of water in the soil profile from field 2 field 3 and the riparian area respectively following the method used for field 1 because we could not conduct a third sounding after october due to snow cover the calculated change in storage captured both change in storage and winter return flows e g return flows occurring after october 25th 3 4 return flow qrt return flows were calculated using data from eight gauging stations installed along the monitored portion of bear creek gauged stations were installed at the point of inflow into the reach located above the irrigated study fields labeled br8 inflow in fig 1 and the first point of diversion from bear creek labeled fd3 in fig 1 an additional gauging station was installed 200 m below the lowest irrigation field labeled br1 outflow in fig 1 the length of the study reach between the inflow and outflow sections was 3 05 km and the remaining gauging stations were strategically located along the reach to capture return flow from each of the adjacent agricultural meadows labeled br2 7 in fig 1 rating curves stage discharge relationships were developed for each gauging station using the same methodology described for irrigation ditches in section 3 1 with the exception of high flow measurements in early june when flow was too high for field technicians to safely enter the stream to conduct velocity area measurements an acoustic doppler current profiler streampro teledyne rd instruments poway ca was used for discharge measurements more information on rating curves is available in si si rating curves and hydrographs once stage discharge relationships were developed for each stilling well gauging station along bear creek and continuous depths were converted to discharge the resulting data were quality controlled using aquarius aquarius aquarius informatics ca and three sigma limits were applied to quantify good data as adapted from hampel 1985 were rejected this led to the removal of 13 total points all during peakflow which were then filled using a linear interpolation equation in matlab matlab and statistics toolbox release 2015 the mathworks inc usa to approximate gross seasonal losses the average daily loss from the point of inflow br8 in fig 1 to the point of outflow br1 in fig 1 was calculated prior to beginning of the irrigation season in april 2015 the proportion of return flow was then quantified as a ratio of qrt to the total of qirr and p return flows were calculated over a daily and seasonal timestep using eq 5 below which is adapted from wetstein et al 1989 5 qrt qoutflow qinflow qirr qloss where qrt is the volume of return flows m3 qoutflow is volume of outflow m3 at br1 the lowest gauging station qinflow is volume of inflow at br8 m3 the uppermost gauging station qirr is the volume of irrigation water in focher ditch m3 and qloss is estimated volume of loss m3 between br8 and br1 which is assumed to represent the background loss within the system and the volume of water in thunderhead ditch m3 which the volume of water diverted at td1 that was not applied to any of the study fields 3 5 uncertainty we calculated uncertainty associated with each of the individual water balance components using a combination of statistical analyses and published values uncertainty for precipitation measurements was derived from lanza and vuerich 2009 for stream flow published values from sikorska et al 2013 and statistical analysis of rating curves were used to quantify error and uncertainty uncertainty in evapotranspiration measurements was derived from a combination of sensitivity analysis and solignac et al 2009 uncertainty for nmr was determined by incorporation of a bootstrapping procedure in the inversion process parsekian et al 2015 which incorporated 1000 resampled datasets all uncertainty estimates were quantified as a percentage and then incorporated into each component of the water balance by translating the percent to a depth of water in mm which was then subtracted or added from the seasonal total for all water balance components we then summed all total uncertainties to provide a range of uncertainty for the water balance closure although this approach does not fully account for the propagation of uncertainty it sufficiently quantifies both individual and collective uncertainty for both management and policy purposes 4 results 4 1 precipitation p and irrigation qirr fig 2 shows precipitation and irrigation inputs and evaporation losses from the system over the irrigation season total onsite precipitation was 0 151 m 149 000 m3 from april to october which was close to the reported average annual precipitation of 0 163 m 162 000 m3 for the site during the same period western regional climate centerwrcc 2010 precipitation was 0 036 m for the site 35 000 m3 during the period of analysis the total irrigation water applied during the period of monitoring was determined to be 1 11 m per 99 ha or 1 098 000 m3 based on the irrigation rating curves and synoptic measurements conducted in the main irrigation ditch no seepage was hydrologically detectable and was thus excluded from further consideration 4 2 evapotranspiration etb etnb the calculated etnet from june 17th to october 25th was 0 49 m per 99 ha 487 000 m3 based on eq 2 of the total 0 49 m of total etnet 0 27 m per 99 ha or 262 000 m3 54 is attributed to etb from the irrigated meadows and the remaining 0 23 m per 99 ha or 225 000 m3 46 went to etnb from adjacent riparian areas examining the dynamics in seasonal etb etnb and etnet fig 2 etnb tracks etb from june into august and then in the latter portion of the season when agricultural crops senesce exceeds etb etb etnb and etn all are highest during growing season in june and july although the peak is less pronounced for etnb the period from august 19 to september 8 was impacted by instrument error and no data were recorded 4 3 storage total change in subsurface water storage over the irrigation season was determined to be 200 000 m3 using eq 4 nmr soundings from the beginning and end of the irrigation season indicated an average seasonal net change in water content of 0 11 m3 m 3 to a depth of 10 m at field 1 30 35 ha fig 3 with significant uncertainty above 3 m and below 9 m given this uncertainty see fig 3 dn was determined to be 6 m or the depth where water storage was observed without any overlap in the standard deviation before and after irrigation which was obtained from bootstrapping analysis as fig 3 indicates the distribution of water in the soil profile is largely concentrated between 5 and 8 m which is likely related to the clay and siltstone layer around 9 ms surface nmr measurements conducted on fields 2 and 3 did not show any change in water content before and after the season combined with an indicated topsoil thickness ranging from 1 to 3 m above the functionally impermeable tertiary formation these measurements supported our conclusion of minimal soil water storage at fields 2 and 3 over the course of the season 4 4 return flow using the calculated discharge for each stream gauge see si rating curves and hydrographs for all rating curve information study reach of bear creek was a gross losing stream based on analysis of streamflow data channel profiles and channel substrate observations this finding was consistent with other higher elevation streams in the intermountain covino and mcglynn 2007 result from a site with similar elevation geology site and study reach length in southwestern montana conducted by covino and mcglynn 2007 suggest that although high altitude streams may experience both losing and gaining dynamics over the course of the year gross stream losses were 23 of streamflow in the transition zone mountain to valley and remained significant albeit lower in the valley bottom the average daily loss from bear 8 to bear 1 was 6 000 m3 which equated to approximately 5 of streamflow at br8 table 2 over the course of the irrigation season return flows were determined to account for 328 000 m3 29 of the total water applied 1 098 000 m3 of irrigation water and 35 000 m3 of precipitation fig 4 the return flow hydrograph indicates that return flows at the site quickly responded to any input water for instance as the amount of applied water declines in late june because of haying operations when the water was shut off return flows correspondingly decrease in a period of days when irrigation increases briefly on july 8 the return flow hydrograph registers a corresponding increase around july 10th as the application of water declines in august compared to june the rate of return flow also diminishes the quick response is accompanied by limited yet sustained contributions to baseflow from return flows after irrigation ends of the total 328 000 m3 of return flow 59 000 m3 or 18 was determined to return between october 1st and october 25th suggesting sustained supplementation of base flow from flood irrigation to bear creek fig 4 fig 5 a d presents the return flow hydrographs observed between individual gaging stations along gauging stations across all sites the most return flow occurs between br7 and br8 and at the beginning of the season when precipitation and irrigation are both at a maximum the peaks and troughs in fig 5a b and d in the month of june may represent return flows related to increases in irrigation water and precipitation or may be related to uncertainties in streamflow measurements during peak flow the hydrographs in fig 5 a d also capture variability in the timing of return flows throughout the system for instance the peak of applied water irrigation and precipitation occurs between may 19 22 the hydrographs higher in the reach e g br6 br7 and br4 br6 register a corresponding increase in return flow between may 30th and 31st according to fig 5a and b hydrographs between stilling wells located lower in the reach e g br2 br4 and br1 br2 register return flows relatively later between june 4 10th and june 2 3rd respectively according to fig 5c and d later in the season after the cessation of irrigation in september three of the four sites consistently registered some amount of return flow following the end of the irrigation season supporting the overall conclusion of late season baseflow supplementation from return flows 4 5 water balance solving eq 1 with the above measured values we accounted for 1 015 000 m3 of the 1 133 000 m3 of total inflows from precipitation and irrigation 90 closure for the 2015 irrigation season water balance fig 6 qrt accounted for 328 000 m3 29 of applied water returned to the bear creek system with etnb accounting for 225 000 m3 20 of applied water etb accounting for 262 000 m3 23 of applied water and δs accounting for 200 000 m3 18 of applied water if precipitation was excluded qrt accounted for 30 of the total 1 098 000 m3 from irrigation water only and etb accounted for 24 of irrigation water only 4 6 uncertainty we quantified uncertainty for each of the individual components of the water balance table 3 and calculated adjusted values to reflect these uncertainty estimates it should be noted that in the determination of percent closure no attempt was made to reconcile the interaction of uncertainty or error between the different measurements while this kind of statistical analysis was outside the immediate scope of our study we acknowledge that this propagation analysis could be useful in the future 5 discussion we theorized that by incorporating interdisciplinary tools and explicit measurements of et and subsurface storage we could enhance water balance closure and in turn provide more explicit boundaries of the range of return flows we achieved a high degree of closure 90 9 using nmr to explicitly measure subsurface storage and a las to measure et from agricultural crops we successfully quantified the amount and timing of return flows finding that 328 000 m3 of the total 1 133 000 m3 applied to the three study fields 29 water returned to bear creek before october 25th and that 59 000 m3 of the 328 000 m3 of return flows 18 returned in the month of october two or more weeks after the cessation of irrigation these results indicate that return flows were substantially lower in this system than those suggested by wyoming statute which recommends the assumption of 50 wy 41 3 110 and other regional studies suggesting return flows of 70 wetstein et al 1989 these findings emphasize the need for more fully considering the hydrogeological characteristics of a site before assuming the validity of regional and or generalized return flow estimates we also found that 18 of total return flows occurred later in the season when baseflow supplementation may be of particular benefit for downstream users and the environment fleming et al 2014 which is higher than the finding of 10 by wetstein et al 1989 while we successfully quantified return flow and closed the seasonal water balance there are several caveats to these findings the first relates to uncertainty in several measurements first our determination of etnb indicated that 225 000 m3 of the 1 133 000 m3 of input water to the agricultural fields 20 went to supporting cottonwoods populus deltoids willows conifers and other riparian vegetation because this type of vegetation mix is understood to have a relatively higher demand from evapotranspiration gribovszki et al 2008 and covers approximately one third of the study site 27 4 of 99 ha the calculated values appear to be reasonable the measurement and uncertainty estimate of the etnb component of the water balance due to the lack of direct measurements could be improved with direct measurement techniques including sap flux sensors schaeffer et al 2000 nagler et al 2007 or eddy covariance towers nagler et al 2005 our results also indicate that 200 000 m3 of the 1 133 000 m3 of applied water 18 went to storage under agricultural fields uncertainty calculations for storage were the highest of any measurement conducted in this study confidence in this measurement would have been increased by measurements of changes in the groundwater table using piezometers however because of repeated failure to drill wells past 1 5 m the high closure in our water balance would not have been achieved without nmr measurements without these subsurface geophysical measurements water balance closure would have been approximately 72 the ability to measure change and quantify measurement uncertainty in volumetric water content over the course of the 2015 season thus emerged as an important component in our water balance and we are hopeful this methodology can be improved upon in the future it is also possible that some portion of this water returned to bear creek after streamflow monitoring ceased in late october meaning that some portion of the calculated change in storage could also have been delayed return flows the other source of measurement uncertainty is in the estimation of peak flows during the month of june due to the high flows from snow melt runoff during this period safety concerns prohibited direct flow measurements in the stream and although we used an acoustic doppler current profiler the flow in bear creek was turbulent and thus we acknowledge a higher degree of uncertainty in those measurements than in mid range flows when conditions allowed for reliable measurement tarrab et al 2012 challenges in measurement also existed at low flow e g 0 3 m s 1 and it was difficult to constrain developed rating curves at extremely low flows for both extremes we assume a greater degree of uncertainty exists in our measurements the second caveat is that we did not differentiate between the possible pathways for return flows travelling back to bear creek e g surface runoff versus subsurface flow nor did we address potential contributions to the stream from other sources of water outside irrigation and precipitation significant contributions from outside sources of water are unlikely in this study area based on the upstream topography of the watershed narrow steep and rocky and the lack of any upstream points of diversion or agriculture however the partitioning among surface and subsurface flow paths in this system could further explain the amount and timing of the observed return flow isotopic samples collected throughout the field season and electronic conductivity meters u24 series conductivity data loggers hobo usa installed throughout the system were unsuccessful in providing data that would support determination of water source due to the site location in the upper watershed and the lack of applied fertilizers neither the isotopic signature nor the salinity readings differentiated between irrigation water and instream flow creative ways to avoid these constraints in similar systems could allow for a better understanding of return flow timing in high altitude systems for instance claes et al 2019 used geophysical instrumentation to investigate irrigation return flow pathways at the bear creek site other caveats included limitations with respect to the length of this study which included only a season of data and the homogeneity of the agricultural crops planted in the study fields with respect to the length of the study as previously mentioned the representativeness of on site precipitation increased confidence in the generalizability of our findings for other years additionally fd3 is the first diversion on bear creek and as such is unlikely to be limited by irrigation water curtailments related to priority in water rights in drought years the homogeneity of the cropping at the site was representative of high altitude mountain meadows in western wyoming which primarily grow forage however more work to understand the role vegetation plays in determining return flow amount and timing is needed to place this study in the context of other return flow studies facilitate more direct comparisons and provide policymakers and water managers with a summary of our findings we compare the results of our study and several of the other studies e g boldt et al 1999 lecina et al 2011 wetstein et al 1989 drawn from the literature table 4 when possible we provide the study area climate classification and soil and crop type to facilitate comparison of results that may highlight areas where further study could focus table 4 highlights the variability in return flow findings from similar regions of western north america taken together these studies indicate that the amount of return flow varies between 28 70 of applied irrigation water based on our review the results of our study reflected average findings for return flow amount and higher findings for delayed return flow the average return flow across all studies is 43 of applied water with a standard deviation of 20 the only study outside one standard deviation of the average is the wetstein et al 1989 study which found 70 of applied water returned to the system although fewer studies were available to evaluate delayed return flows our study reflects the highest percentage of post irrigation return flows with an average of 14 across two studies although we could not compare actual volumes of return flow these results indicate that at least in a relative sense lower seasonal volume of return flow does not necessarily correlate to lower delayed or late season return flow contributions in the case of wetstein et al 1989 the finding of higher than average seasonal return flows also corresponded to a lower than average delayed return flow in the case of this study the finding of lower than average seasonal return flows corresponded to a finding of higher than average delayed return flows while we are wary of generalization based on two examples the observation of these different relationships does suggest that the seasonal volume of return flows is not necessarily indicative of late season baseflow contributions from return flow and vice versa there are also several high level relationships that emerge from the comparison for example the amount of return flow does appear to be linked to climate our study s measurement of return flows 29 in a semi arid continental climate is similar to findings by lecina et al 2011 who reported return flows of 28 in a warm summer continental climate the outlier in this continental climate group is wetstein et al 1989 who reported return flows of 70 soils data are not provided at the spatial resolution necessary to investigate linkages with return flow timing and amount however both the lecina et al 2011 study and this study which found comparable return flow percentages 28 and 29 respectively were conducted in study sites dominated by loam and sandy loam soils wetstein et al 1989 conducted their study in an area dominated by very coarse alluvial soils with very little fines under a shallow sandy loam which can explain the high percent of return flow in this system limited data were available for comparison of deeper subsurface geology across all the reported studies and is another area where further study and more complete site characterization has the potential to reveal important linkages our study contributes to larger questions about the hydrologic ecosystem services provided by return flows we found that 25 of applied water went to supporting riparian vegetation which in turn provides habitat for wildlife including ungulates bears beavers and birds an additional 30 of applied water returned to the stream to support aquatic habitat and 17 of that supplemented late season base flows which may be beneficial to aquatic habitats and downstream water users at the same time diversion of water for irrigation at the site diminished instream flows to 0 3 m3 s 1 which is below the recommended minimal ecological flow for local aquatic populations according to the wyoming game and fish robertson and dey 2009 in this system determining whether the potential costs in the form of maintaining instream flows outweigh the potential benefits from return flows depends on management aims for instance if the provisioning of wildlife habitat is a primary objective the loss of return flows through conversion to sprinkler irrigation would be a serious consideration to balance water conservation with hydrologic ecosystem services water managers and policymakers need to be able to better anticipate the amount and timing of return flows although more data from a greater range of systems is necessary we believe this work provides a foundation from which other studies can build to better and more quantitatively describe the role general site characteristics e g climate soils crops subsurface geology etc play in governing the amount and potentially even the timing of return flows in a diversity of systems going forward the question of where and when alteration of irrigation management whether in the form of fallowing or conversion to sprinkler irrigation represents a potential impact to hydrologic ecosystem services supported by return flows is critical as an example many of the pilot projects undertaken in the upper colorado river basin between 2015 2018 as part of the system conservation pilot program upper colorado river commission 2018 participating irrigators in exchange for compensation turned off water early or employed partial fallowing although the future of this program remains uncertain there is a need to understand how these potential alterations to irrigation management and by extension hydrologic ecosystem services dependent on return flows may or may not impact different parts of the upper colorado river basin through better data and enhanced predictive capabilities one promising approach to improve prediction of return flows is to combine the rigorous interdisciplinary framework for return flow measurement and site characterization presented in this study with a hierarchical clustering analyses as discussed in mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 standardizing information provided about site characteristics and management practices for future return flow studies would allow for an expanded range of predictive variables in this type of analysis enhancing predictive capabilities would further benefit managers and policymakers in better constraining estimation of return flows based on geology soils crop cover and riparian vegetation 6 conclusions historically the measurement of return flows has been limited by the complexity of field experimentation and model based approaches as we demonstrated in this study the emergence of new technology such as nmr for soil water measurement and large aperture scintillometers for et estimation and a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration provides new ways to quantify return flows identifying where interdisciplinary approaches can improve return flow estimates can a provide a framework for other scientists and managers interested in measuring return flow b contribute valuable data about return flows that can be used to improve forecasting and predictive capabilities and c expand our understanding of the feedbacks between hydrologic ecosystem services and irrigation management the conversion from flood irrigation in this type of system may indirectly reduce the amount of water available for riparian vegetation and by extension wildlife and fish habitat as such enhancing water accounting and return flow measurements helps policymakers assess the range of potential return flows and where and when changes in irrigation management may pose a risk to valuable ecosystem services linked to return flows and where they may not declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any potential conflicts of interest to declare the authors have no conflicts of interest to declare

10699,the assessment of hydrologic ecosystem services associated with flood irrigation in the western united states is particularly limited by a lack of data about return flows return flows the portion of applied water that returns to adjacent surface and groundwater hydrologic systems during flood irrigation may provide wildlife habitat recharge aquifers and supplement late season baseflows to improve understanding about variability in the timing and volume of return flows to improve management and policy decisions associated with different irrigation management techniques our study used an agricultural water balance that combined hydrologic geophysical and meteorological tools we directly measure key components of the water balance and quantify error and uncertainty on a 100 ha portion of the bear creek watershed in the upper wind river basin of wyoming over the course of a single irrigation season with average precipitation we found that of the 1 133 000 m3 of water applied to irrigated lands 328 000 m3 29 of applied water returned to bear creek and 487 000 m3 43 of applied water was consumptively used by vegetation our data also suggest that 59 000 m3 18 of total return flows occurred more than two weeks after irrigation had ceased the percent of return flow for this study site is slightly lower than the median of 43 for all reviewed studies and the percent of delayed return flow return flow after irrigation has ceased is slightly higher than the median finding of 14 across available studies we found that return flows from flood irrigation at this site are lower than generalized regional estimates and those found by other studies thus our study indicates that the amount and timing of return flows are not necessarily coupled i e lower overall volume did not correspond to lowered late season contribution at this site in addition we found that these return flows support hydrologic ecosystem services including riparian vegetation wildlife habitat groundwater storage and late season baseflows keywords return flows irrigation efficiency scintillometer agricultural water 1 introduction as the largest consumer of freshwater withdrawals in the western united states us irrigation dependent agriculture is under pressure to adapt to declining regional water supplies marris 2008 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 one widely recognized way to reduce agricultural water use is to convert from flood irrigation to more water efficient irrigation methods narayanamoorthy 2004 transitioning from less efficient flood irrigation is assumed to support a number of benefits at the watershed and basin scale including enhanced upfront water conservation for downstream delivery to users skaggs 2001 and improved on farm productivity related to more efficient water delivery to crops postel et al 2001 however research suggests that there may be substantial tradeoffs associated with conversion from flood to more efficient irrigation ward et al 2014 flood irrigation is directly linked to return flows the portion of applied water that returns to adjacent water bodies and in some cases may reflect more than half of the local water balance dewandel et al 2008 particularly in semi arid parts of the western us studies have linked these return flows to a wide range of ecosystem services that may provide public benefit including aquifer recharge

tensions between enhanced water conservation benefits and impacts to return flows and ecosystem services at both the local and watershed scale decisions regarding irrigation management in semi arid systems are complex grafton et al 2018 growing downstream populations and increased water demands throughout the western us viviroli et al 2007 mean that questions about how to most efficiently manage irrigation systems are likely to persist into the future lecina et al 2011 the assessment and selection of the most beneficial irrigation system for water users and the environment requires data about the fate of applied irrigation water within a range of ecosystems grafton et al 2018 although research has addressed the benefits and drawbacks of drip irrigation çetin et al 2004 playán and mateos 2006 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 the tradeoffs associated with flood irrigation and return flows remain less understood largely because there is little data about the timing and volume of return flows grafton et al 2018 claes et al 2019 the limited availability of return flow data is in part because measuring return flow requires a combination of extensive data and flow modeling dewandel et al 2008 grafton et al 2018 in many areas return flows are still estimated using generalized estimates mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 a more significant body of research exists related to the quantification of return flows from rice paddy fields ito et al 1980 kim et al 2009 liu et al 2004 zulu et al 1996 zulu et al 1996 calculated return flow over three years in japan finding that return flow varied from 79 to 83 the study also found that return flows were reduced when a greater portion of drainage water was reused for irrigation zulu et al 1996 using a water balance approach to quantify flows in to and out of rice paddy fields in the gicheon watershed in south korea kim et al 2009 estimated average annual return flows of 25 7 from 1998 to 2001 the study found approximately 14 1 of the total return flow was attributed to quick return flow and 11 6 was attributed to delayed return flow despite recognition of the importance of return flows and the ecosystem services they can support in the semi arid western united states peck and lovvorn 2001 fleming et al 2014 grafton et al 2018 there are few studies focused on the quantification of return flows in this region lecina et al 2011 wetstein et al 1989 reported average annual return flow of 70 over a 4 year period in an alluvial basin in the upper green river basin in wyoming where approximately 90 of return flows were found to re enter the stream system in spring and summer with the remaining 10 re entering the system in low flow winter months boldt et al 1999 found that 44 of applied irrigation water returned to the underlying aquifer in a furrow irrigated system in the central platte valley of nebraska more recently lecina et al 2011 quantified 28 return flow from bear river basin in utah previous studies of return flows provide a good foundation however many relied on calculated or modeled values of evapotranspiration et and change in subsurface water storage e g wetstein et al 1989 boldt et al 1999 recent advances in instrumentation make it possible to directly measure both parameters specifically large aperture scintillometers las are capable of measuring evapotranspiration for long range applications and have been compared against eddy covariance flux towers and remote sensing methods for accuracy beyrich et al 2012 kleissl et al 2009 2008 ward et al 2014 zeweldi et al 2010 zhang and zhang 2015 and geophysical instrumentation referred to as surface nuclear magnetic resonance nmr facilitates the direct measurement of subsurface storage and groundwater hertrich 2008 the objective of this study is to use interdisciplinary tools to 1 increase our ability to quantify return flow and 2 provide information to assist water managers and policymakers in evaluating the potential impacts tradeoffs associated with irrigation management decision making in diverse systems a common assumption in western water management is that return flow can be approximated for large and diverse regions using generalized estimates which can in turn be used to predict hydrologic ecosystem services and inform decisions about changes in irrigation management we hypothesize that by incorporating interdisciplinary tools and explicit measurements of et and subsurface storage into the study of return flows at a representative site and comparing results with other available studies an estimate of the potential range in return flows in the western us can be established with a higher degree of confidence we also hypothesize that site specific factors including soils vegetation and climate control return flow amount and timing in a way that cannot be fully captured using generalized estimates to investigate these hypotheses we quantify the timing and amount of return flows to a stream using a water balance based approach we then examine our results relative to other regional return flow studies including wetstein et al 1989 boldt et al 1999 and lecina et al 2011 focusing specifically on key differences and similarities in geophysical hydrologic and ecological factors lastly we discuss these findings in the larger context of their potential implications for hydrologic ecosystem services generally assumed to be associated with flood irrigation 2 study site description 2 1 study site characterization this study was conducted on a 100 ha portion of the bear creek watershed northeast of dubois wyoming in the upper wind river basin fig 1 the climate is continental and semi arid and averages 0 29 m of annual precipitation wrcc 2019 historic monthly streamflow indicates a seasonal trend with snowmelt dominating the hydrograph during the late spring and early summer followed by a return to baseflow by winter fontaine et al 2002 irrigated meadows are managed by wyoming game and fish department and the typical practice is to flood irrigate specific sections of the agricultural fields over a 16 24 hour period using a gravity fed system with gated pipe although specific details of flood irrigation management can vary between individuals in general the management practiced at the study site is typical of other regional flood irrigation practices where flood irrigation remains the dominant form of irrigation vore and lowry 2000 irrigated meadows are dominated by timothy grass phleum pratense while riparian zones contain a mix of shrubs cottonwood populus deltoids and a mix of conifers throughout the site riparian areas were topographically disconnected from the irrigated fields and were typically separated by 0 5 1 5 m drop offs comprised of exposed dirt and rock the study site is assumed to represent higher altitude portions of the western cordillera ecological region which also includes parts of western british colombia western montana central utah colorado idaho washington oregon new mexico and california usepa 2018 for more information about the study site we refer to claes et al 2019 analysis of the site using the soil survey geographic database ssurgo indicated that the site is a predominantly loam with a small portion of samples in the uppermost corners characterized as sandy loam soil survey staff 2019 soil samples collected in seven locations distributed throughout the site corroborated ssurgo database results the geological profile of the site consists of terraced unconsolidated alluvial sediment near the surface green and drouillard 1994 while the channel substrate within bear creek is primarily course sands and gravel with medium to large cobbles below the alluvial deposits on either side of the monitored reach is the wind river formation consisting of variegated red and white claystone and siltstone love and christiansen 1985 based on the local geological description and seismic profiles of the irrigated fields showing a soil profile that varies between 1 5 and 9 m depth that exhibits a slightly sloped layer cake type geology with observations indicating the depth of the soil profile thins significantly in the adjacent riparian areas where it ranges from 1 to 2 m see supplemental information si fig 1 for seismic profiles of the site and si fig 2 for a geological diagram of the site 2 2 study site delineation and area calculations for water balance for the purposes of this study accurate area estimations were required for all agricultural fields and adjacent riparian areas and we mapped the extent of agricultural fields and all points of diversion from bear creek agricultural fields were delineated using a handheld global positioning system gps device trimble geoexplorer6000 usa during the height of growing season prior to any cuttings the boundary of the agricultural fields was identified using a combination of knowledge from the wyoming game and fish department and the visual observation of change in vegetation from timothy grass phleum pratense to riparian vegetation or upland vegetation areas adjacent to the stream but separated from irrigation areas by topography and vegetation were mapped as adjacent riparian areas the resulting gps layers were analyzed in arcgis in combination with national agricultural imagery project naip 2015 data to determine the total area of each of the agricultural fields and the total area of adjacent riparian vegetation gps derived area calculations summarized in table 1 were used to determine area weighted contributions in soil water storage calculations at the site 3 methods we used a field scale volumetric water balance similar to the approaches of wetstein et al 1989 sakthivadivel et al 1999 perry 2007 2011 and lecina et al 2011 to quantify return flow in this study using eq 1 1 p qirr etb etnb δs qrt σ where p is precipitation m3 measured by a tipping bucket qirr is irrigation water applied to the field m3 and measured continuously in the ditch etb is beneficial evapotranspiration from the desired crops m3 measured by a large aperture scintillometer etnb is non beneficial evapotranspiration from adjacent riparian areas m3 calculated using penman monteith δs is change in storage m3 and potential winter return flows measured by nuclear magnetic resonance qrt is return flow m3 calculated by subtracting qin from qout and σ is uncertainty m3 a schematic of the water balance can be found in si si fig 3 in the sections below we describe the methods used to quantify each water balance component in the order of eq 1 3 1 precipitation p and irrigation qirr on site precipitation was recorded using a tipping bucket rain gauge rain collector ii davis instruments usa although there were two points of diversion from the study reach labeled fr3 and td1 in fig 1 only water diverted at fd3 was delivered to the study fields water diverted at td1 did not provide water to any of the study fields and was thus excluded from the calculation of qirr but was instead included as qloss and is further discussed in section 3 4 below water in focher ditch was diverted directly from bear creek just upstream of fd3 and ended with an earthen dam near the middle of field 1 see fig 1 which was 2500 m below the point of diversion fd3 all diverted water was thus contained within focher ditch less any seepage water in focher ditch was delivered to the irrigation fields as described in section 2 1 during haying operations water was delivered to other fields e g while field 1 was being cut water was still delivered to fields 2 and 3 no water remained in focher ditch at the end of the season the irrigation infrastructure also included 2 runoff catch ditches located in fields 1 and 2 that moved any excess surface water from the irrigation fields and adjacent riparian areas to calculate qirr in focher ditch three stilling wells were sited and installed following the united states geological survey usgs guidelines rantz 1982 see fig 1 for all stilling well locations flow in the ditches was uniform and stilling wells were located in areas with low uniform velocity e g 150 m downstream from the point of diversion to minimize potential for velocity effects replogle 1997 wells were constructed with 2 inch diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride pipe which were instrumented with a pressure transducer level troll 500 data logger in situ usa which recorded flow depth and temperature at 15 min intervals permanent cross sections were established at each well to ensure consistency in manual discharge measurements obtained via velocity area gauging which were conducted throughout the season using an electromagnetic current meter mf pro ott hydromet usa ten to thirteen such measurements were conducted in each irrigation ditch and consisted of 25 points each discharge was then calculated using developed stage discharge relationships at each site to approximate seepage field technicians conducted simultaneous discharge measurements with electromagnetic current meters at the inlet midway through and near the end of focher ditch discharge measurements obtained in this exercise were compared to determine the extent of seepage this was strengthened by comparison of discharge estimates obtained from rated sections i e fd3 fd2 and fd1 as well as geophysical and soil observations indicating high clay content in focher ditch 3 2 evapotranspiration etb etnb we calculated evapotranspiration following the work of lecina et al 2011 to include contribution from agriculturally productive areas and adjacent riparian areas using the formula presented in lecina et al 2011 for combining beneficial et and non beneficial et we determined net evapotranspiration from the site to be 2 etnet etb etnb where etb is beneficial evapotranspiration measured by a scintillometer from agricultural areas m per 99 ha and etnb is the non beneficial evapotranspiration calculated using penman monteith from adjacent riparian areas m per 99 ha a large aperture scintillometer las las mkii kipp zonen nld was set up over a 664 m path bisecting the largest of the four study area fields field 1 in fig 1 in early june 2015 the las directly measures changes in the refractive index of the atmosphere cn2 caused by fluctuations in pressure temperature and humidity related to vegetation hemakumara et al 2003 liu et al 2011 meijninger et al 2002 by quantifying the intensity of these fluctuations in the refractive index of air scintillations and combining those measurements with on site meteorological data the las can be used to measure sensible heat flux meijninger et al 2002 inputting this measured value for sensible heat flux into the surface energy balance the amount of evapotranspiration et can then be quantified liu et al 2011 the total elevation difference between the minimum elevation and maximum elevation along the measurement transect was less than 4 m the path of the las beam was oriented north transmitter to south receiver and the aperture of both instruments was 0 150 m the beam was assumed to be parallel to the ground allowing for effective beam height to be determined as 3 2 m the receiver recorded the five minute average for both cn 2 and signal strength mv wilson et al 2013 recommend that all data be collected with a signal strength greater than 25 mv and no data were below this threshold and the seasonal average signal strength was 477 mv standard deviation for both parameters was also recorded two digital time lapse cameras were installed between the meteorological station and las transmitter to capture crop growth among other observations crop height at the same location between the las transmitter and receiver was manually measured using the line point intercept method see heady and gibbens 1959 throughout the season and validated against images from both cameras a site specific growth curve was developed based on observed crop height during the growing season to ensure accurate calculation of roughness length and zero plane displacement to validate extrapolation from the site of meteorological and scintillometer measurements to all irrigated fields vegetation transect data were collected and a basic fetch analysis was performed on the other field sites a footprint analysis based on hsieh et al 2000 was also conducted to verify that the area of influence measured by the las was reflective of agricultural crops for more information on scintillation theory and measurement see the supplemental information si a meteorological tower was installed in the middle of field 1 midway between the las transmitter and receiver fig 1 to obtain data that could be scaled up to represent conditions for the entire study area the station recorded the following parameters at five minute intervals wind speed m s 1 and direction at 2 56 m temperature c and relative humidity at 2 56 m and 0 50 m pressure mbar net radiation w m2 soil heat flux w m2 at 0 08 m below the soil surface and ground surface temperature c there was a data gap in august which was filled using a linear interpolation equation in matlab matlab and statistics toolbox release 2015 the mathworks inc usa etnb from adjacent riparian areas was estimated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao form of penman monteith for reference et proposed by allen et al 1998 all inputs into the reference et equation were measured with the on site meteorological tower the calculated reference et was then modified by a crop coefficient calculated using leaf area index lai which was obtained from nagler et al 2005 due to the widespread acceptance of this method we do not include more detail on this methodology more information on these calculations can be found in si si penman monteith calculations 3 3 storage changes in groundwater storage from may to october in the agricultural fields were explicitly measured using surface nuclear magnetic resonance nmr vista clara usa soundings on the three agricultural fields using the principles outlined by hertrich 2008 nmr is directly sensitive to the subsurface distribution of hydrogen protons and when hydrogen protons from water molecules are excited within a background magnetic field the signal generated by their return from a perturbed state is measured and used to quantify water content in the subsurface hertrich 2008 legchenko et al 2002 we conducted two surface nmr soundings on each study field before the initial application of irrigation water in may of 2015 and after the cessation of the irrigation season in october of 2015 to measure changes in groundwater storage up to 15 m in depth the measured change in volumetric water content from the nmr divided by the depth of observation across the area of each irrigated meadow to reflect the total change in storage for each field to calculate water content at depth we used the framework laid out by robinson 2009 for the measurement and estimation of soil water content captured in eq 3 below 3 δsn δqn dn where δsn is the change in the average water storage in the soil profile over the course of the irrigation season m δqn is the average change in volumetric water content of the soil profile based on nmr measurement at a given site m3 m 3 and dn is the average thickness of soil profile measured m for the agricultural fields dn was determined based on the nmr measurement and for the riparian area dn was assumed to be 1 m based on the subsurface geological description and geophysical measurements at the site see si fig 1 we used a simple areal interpolation approach adapted from flowerdew and green 1993 based on the size of the agricultural fields and riparian areas to determine relative contributions as described in eq 4 below 4 δs a1 δs1 a2 δs2 a3 δs3 ar δsr where δs is the total change in the average depth of groundwater storage across the entire bear creek study site m a1 is area of field 1 m2 see table 1 for detail and δs1 is the change in the average depth of water in the soil profile for field 1 from eq 3 m a2 a3 and ar are the areas of fields 2 3 and the riparian area m2 and δs2 δs3 δs3 are the changes in average depth of water in the soil profile from field 2 field 3 and the riparian area respectively following the method used for field 1 because we could not conduct a third sounding after october due to snow cover the calculated change in storage captured both change in storage and winter return flows e g return flows occurring after october 25th 3 4 return flow qrt return flows were calculated using data from eight gauging stations installed along the monitored portion of bear creek gauged stations were installed at the point of inflow into the reach located above the irrigated study fields labeled br8 inflow in fig 1 and the first point of diversion from bear creek labeled fd3 in fig 1 an additional gauging station was installed 200 m below the lowest irrigation field labeled br1 outflow in fig 1 the length of the study reach between the inflow and outflow sections was 3 05 km and the remaining gauging stations were strategically located along the reach to capture return flow from each of the adjacent agricultural meadows labeled br2 7 in fig 1 rating curves stage discharge relationships were developed for each gauging station using the same methodology described for irrigation ditches in section 3 1 with the exception of high flow measurements in early june when flow was too high for field technicians to safely enter the stream to conduct velocity area measurements an acoustic doppler current profiler streampro teledyne rd instruments poway ca was used for discharge measurements more information on rating curves is available in si si rating curves and hydrographs once stage discharge relationships were developed for each stilling well gauging station along bear creek and continuous depths were converted to discharge the resulting data were quality controlled using aquarius aquarius aquarius informatics ca and three sigma limits were applied to quantify good data as adapted from hampel 1985 were rejected this led to the removal of 13 total points all during peakflow which were then filled using a linear interpolation equation in matlab matlab and statistics toolbox release 2015 the mathworks inc usa to approximate gross seasonal losses the average daily loss from the point of inflow br8 in fig 1 to the point of outflow br1 in fig 1 was calculated prior to beginning of the irrigation season in april 2015 the proportion of return flow was then quantified as a ratio of qrt to the total of qirr and p return flows were calculated over a daily and seasonal timestep using eq 5 below which is adapted from wetstein et al 1989 5 qrt qoutflow qinflow qirr qloss where qrt is the volume of return flows m3 qoutflow is volume of outflow m3 at br1 the lowest gauging station qinflow is volume of inflow at br8 m3 the uppermost gauging station qirr is the volume of irrigation water in focher ditch m3 and qloss is estimated volume of loss m3 between br8 and br1 which is assumed to represent the background loss within the system and the volume of water in thunderhead ditch m3 which the volume of water diverted at td1 that was not applied to any of the study fields 3 5 uncertainty we calculated uncertainty associated with each of the individual water balance components using a combination of statistical analyses and published values uncertainty for precipitation measurements was derived from lanza and vuerich 2009 for stream flow published values from sikorska et al 2013 and statistical analysis of rating curves were used to quantify error and uncertainty uncertainty in evapotranspiration measurements was derived from a combination of sensitivity analysis and solignac et al 2009 uncertainty for nmr was determined by incorporation of a bootstrapping procedure in the inversion process parsekian et al 2015 which incorporated 1000 resampled datasets all uncertainty estimates were quantified as a percentage and then incorporated into each component of the water balance by translating the percent to a depth of water in mm which was then subtracted or added from the seasonal total for all water balance components we then summed all total uncertainties to provide a range of uncertainty for the water balance closure although this approach does not fully account for the propagation of uncertainty it sufficiently quantifies both individual and collective uncertainty for both management and policy purposes 4 results 4 1 precipitation p and irrigation qirr fig 2 shows precipitation and irrigation inputs and evaporation losses from the system over the irrigation season total onsite precipitation was 0 151 m 149 000 m3 from april to october which was close to the reported average annual precipitation of 0 163 m 162 000 m3 for the site during the same period western regional climate centerwrcc 2010 precipitation was 0 036 m for the site 35 000 m3 during the period of analysis the total irrigation water applied during the period of monitoring was determined to be 1 11 m per 99 ha or 1 098 000 m3 based on the irrigation rating curves and synoptic measurements conducted in the main irrigation ditch no seepage was hydrologically detectable and was thus excluded from further consideration 4 2 evapotranspiration etb etnb the calculated etnet from june 17th to october 25th was 0 49 m per 99 ha 487 000 m3 based on eq 2 of the total 0 49 m of total etnet 0 27 m per 99 ha or 262 000 m3 54 is attributed to etb from the irrigated meadows and the remaining 0 23 m per 99 ha or 225 000 m3 46 went to etnb from adjacent riparian areas examining the dynamics in seasonal etb etnb and etnet fig 2 etnb tracks etb from june into august and then in the latter portion of the season when agricultural crops senesce exceeds etb etb etnb and etn all are highest during growing season in june and july although the peak is less pronounced for etnb the period from august 19 to september 8 was impacted by instrument error and no data were recorded 4 3 storage total change in subsurface water storage over the irrigation season was determined to be 200 000 m3 using eq 4 nmr soundings from the beginning and end of the irrigation season indicated an average seasonal net change in water content of 0 11 m3 m 3 to a depth of 10 m at field 1 30 35 ha fig 3 with significant uncertainty above 3 m and below 9 m given this uncertainty see fig 3 dn was determined to be 6 m or the depth where water storage was observed without any overlap in the standard deviation before and after irrigation which was obtained from bootstrapping analysis as fig 3 indicates the distribution of water in the soil profile is largely concentrated between 5 and 8 m which is likely related to the clay and siltstone layer around 9 ms surface nmr measurements conducted on fields 2 and 3 did not show any change in water content before and after the season combined with an indicated topsoil thickness ranging from 1 to 3 m above the functionally impermeable tertiary formation these measurements supported our conclusion of minimal soil water storage at fields 2 and 3 over the course of the season 4 4 return flow using the calculated discharge for each stream gauge see si rating curves and hydrographs for all rating curve information study reach of bear creek was a gross losing stream based on analysis of streamflow data channel profiles and channel substrate observations this finding was consistent with other higher elevation streams in the intermountain covino and mcglynn 2007 result from a site with similar elevation geology site and study reach length in southwestern montana conducted by covino and mcglynn 2007 suggest that although high altitude streams may experience both losing and gaining dynamics over the course of the year gross stream losses were 23 of streamflow in the transition zone mountain to valley and remained significant albeit lower in the valley bottom the average daily loss from bear 8 to bear 1 was 6 000 m3 which equated to approximately 5 of streamflow at br8 table 2 over the course of the irrigation season return flows were determined to account for 328 000 m3 29 of the total water applied 1 098 000 m3 of irrigation water and 35 000 m3 of precipitation fig 4 the return flow hydrograph indicates that return flows at the site quickly responded to any input water for instance as the amount of applied water declines in late june because of haying operations when the water was shut off return flows correspondingly decrease in a period of days when irrigation increases briefly on july 8 the return flow hydrograph registers a corresponding increase around july 10th as the application of water declines in august compared to june the rate of return flow also diminishes the quick response is accompanied by limited yet sustained contributions to baseflow from return flows after irrigation ends of the total 328 000 m3 of return flow 59 000 m3 or 18 was determined to return between october 1st and october 25th suggesting sustained supplementation of base flow from flood irrigation to bear creek fig 4 fig 5 a d presents the return flow hydrographs observed between individual gaging stations along gauging stations across all sites the most return flow occurs between br7 and br8 and at the beginning of the season when precipitation and irrigation are both at a maximum the peaks and troughs in fig 5a b and d in the month of june may represent return flows related to increases in irrigation water and precipitation or may be related to uncertainties in streamflow measurements during peak flow the hydrographs in fig 5 a d also capture variability in the timing of return flows throughout the system for instance the peak of applied water irrigation and precipitation occurs between may 19 22 the hydrographs higher in the reach e g br6 br7 and br4 br6 register a corresponding increase in return flow between may 30th and 31st according to fig 5a and b hydrographs between stilling wells located lower in the reach e g br2 br4 and br1 br2 register return flows relatively later between june 4 10th and june 2 3rd respectively according to fig 5c and d later in the season after the cessation of irrigation in september three of the four sites consistently registered some amount of return flow following the end of the irrigation season supporting the overall conclusion of late season baseflow supplementation from return flows 4 5 water balance solving eq 1 with the above measured values we accounted for 1 015 000 m3 of the 1 133 000 m3 of total inflows from precipitation and irrigation 90 closure for the 2015 irrigation season water balance fig 6 qrt accounted for 328 000 m3 29 of applied water returned to the bear creek system with etnb accounting for 225 000 m3 20 of applied water etb accounting for 262 000 m3 23 of applied water and δs accounting for 200 000 m3 18 of applied water if precipitation was excluded qrt accounted for 30 of the total 1 098 000 m3 from irrigation water only and etb accounted for 24 of irrigation water only 4 6 uncertainty we quantified uncertainty for each of the individual components of the water balance table 3 and calculated adjusted values to reflect these uncertainty estimates it should be noted that in the determination of percent closure no attempt was made to reconcile the interaction of uncertainty or error between the different measurements while this kind of statistical analysis was outside the immediate scope of our study we acknowledge that this propagation analysis could be useful in the future 5 discussion we theorized that by incorporating interdisciplinary tools and explicit measurements of et and subsurface storage we could enhance water balance closure and in turn provide more explicit boundaries of the range of return flows we achieved a high degree of closure 90 9 using nmr to explicitly measure subsurface storage and a las to measure et from agricultural crops we successfully quantified the amount and timing of return flows finding that 328 000 m3 of the total 1 133 000 m3 applied to the three study fields 29 water returned to bear creek before october 25th and that 59 000 m3 of the 328 000 m3 of return flows 18 returned in the month of october two or more weeks after the cessation of irrigation these results indicate that return flows were substantially lower in this system than those suggested by wyoming statute which recommends the assumption of 50 wy 41 3 110 and other regional studies suggesting return flows of 70 wetstein et al 1989 these findings emphasize the need for more fully considering the hydrogeological characteristics of a site before assuming the validity of regional and or generalized return flow estimates we also found that 18 of total return flows occurred later in the season when baseflow supplementation may be of particular benefit for downstream users and the environment fleming et al 2014 which is higher than the finding of 10 by wetstein et al 1989 while we successfully quantified return flow and closed the seasonal water balance there are several caveats to these findings the first relates to uncertainty in several measurements first our determination of etnb indicated that 225 000 m3 of the 1 133 000 m3 of input water to the agricultural fields 20 went to supporting cottonwoods populus deltoids willows conifers and other riparian vegetation because this type of vegetation mix is understood to have a relatively higher demand from evapotranspiration gribovszki et al 2008 and covers approximately one third of the study site 27 4 of 99 ha the calculated values appear to be reasonable the measurement and uncertainty estimate of the etnb component of the water balance due to the lack of direct measurements could be improved with direct measurement techniques including sap flux sensors schaeffer et al 2000 nagler et al 2007 or eddy covariance towers nagler et al 2005 our results also indicate that 200 000 m3 of the 1 133 000 m3 of applied water 18 went to storage under agricultural fields uncertainty calculations for storage were the highest of any measurement conducted in this study confidence in this measurement would have been increased by measurements of changes in the groundwater table using piezometers however because of repeated failure to drill wells past 1 5 m the high closure in our water balance would not have been achieved without nmr measurements without these subsurface geophysical measurements water balance closure would have been approximately 72 the ability to measure change and quantify measurement uncertainty in volumetric water content over the course of the 2015 season thus emerged as an important component in our water balance and we are hopeful this methodology can be improved upon in the future it is also possible that some portion of this water returned to bear creek after streamflow monitoring ceased in late october meaning that some portion of the calculated change in storage could also have been delayed return flows the other source of measurement uncertainty is in the estimation of peak flows during the month of june due to the high flows from snow melt runoff during this period safety concerns prohibited direct flow measurements in the stream and although we used an acoustic doppler current profiler the flow in bear creek was turbulent and thus we acknowledge a higher degree of uncertainty in those measurements than in mid range flows when conditions allowed for reliable measurement tarrab et al 2012 challenges in measurement also existed at low flow e g 0 3 m s 1 and it was difficult to constrain developed rating curves at extremely low flows for both extremes we assume a greater degree of uncertainty exists in our measurements the second caveat is that we did not differentiate between the possible pathways for return flows travelling back to bear creek e g surface runoff versus subsurface flow nor did we address potential contributions to the stream from other sources of water outside irrigation and precipitation significant contributions from outside sources of water are unlikely in this study area based on the upstream topography of the watershed narrow steep and rocky and the lack of any upstream points of diversion or agriculture however the partitioning among surface and subsurface flow paths in this system could further explain the amount and timing of the observed return flow isotopic samples collected throughout the field season and electronic conductivity meters u24 series conductivity data loggers hobo usa installed throughout the system were unsuccessful in providing data that would support determination of water source due to the site location in the upper watershed and the lack of applied fertilizers neither the isotopic signature nor the salinity readings differentiated between irrigation water and instream flow creative ways to avoid these constraints in similar systems could allow for a better understanding of return flow timing in high altitude systems for instance claes et al 2019 used geophysical instrumentation to investigate irrigation return flow pathways at the bear creek site other caveats included limitations with respect to the length of this study which included only a season of data and the homogeneity of the agricultural crops planted in the study fields with respect to the length of the study as previously mentioned the representativeness of on site precipitation increased confidence in the generalizability of our findings for other years additionally fd3 is the first diversion on bear creek and as such is unlikely to be limited by irrigation water curtailments related to priority in water rights in drought years the homogeneity of the cropping at the site was representative of high altitude mountain meadows in western wyoming which primarily grow forage however more work to understand the role vegetation plays in determining return flow amount and timing is needed to place this study in the context of other return flow studies facilitate more direct comparisons and provide policymakers and water managers with a summary of our findings we compare the results of our study and several of the other studies e g boldt et al 1999 lecina et al 2011 wetstein et al 1989 drawn from the literature table 4 when possible we provide the study area climate classification and soil and crop type to facilitate comparison of results that may highlight areas where further study could focus table 4 highlights the variability in return flow findings from similar regions of western north america taken together these studies indicate that the amount of return flow varies between 28 70 of applied irrigation water based on our review the results of our study reflected average findings for return flow amount and higher findings for delayed return flow the average return flow across all studies is 43 of applied water with a standard deviation of 20 the only study outside one standard deviation of the average is the wetstein et al 1989 study which found 70 of applied water returned to the system although fewer studies were available to evaluate delayed return flows our study reflects the highest percentage of post irrigation return flows with an average of 14 across two studies although we could not compare actual volumes of return flow these results indicate that at least in a relative sense lower seasonal volume of return flow does not necessarily correlate to lower delayed or late season return flow contributions in the case of wetstein et al 1989 the finding of higher than average seasonal return flows also corresponded to a lower than average delayed return flow in the case of this study the finding of lower than average seasonal return flows corresponded to a finding of higher than average delayed return flows while we are wary of generalization based on two examples the observation of these different relationships does suggest that the seasonal volume of return flows is not necessarily indicative of late season baseflow contributions from return flow and vice versa there are also several high level relationships that emerge from the comparison for example the amount of return flow does appear to be linked to climate our study s measurement of return flows 29 in a semi arid continental climate is similar to findings by lecina et al 2011 who reported return flows of 28 in a warm summer continental climate the outlier in this continental climate group is wetstein et al 1989 who reported return flows of 70 soils data are not provided at the spatial resolution necessary to investigate linkages with return flow timing and amount however both the lecina et al 2011 study and this study which found comparable return flow percentages 28 and 29 respectively were conducted in study sites dominated by loam and sandy loam soils wetstein et al 1989 conducted their study in an area dominated by very coarse alluvial soils with very little fines under a shallow sandy loam which can explain the high percent of return flow in this system limited data were available for comparison of deeper subsurface geology across all the reported studies and is another area where further study and more complete site characterization has the potential to reveal important linkages our study contributes to larger questions about the hydrologic ecosystem services provided by return flows we found that 25 of applied water went to supporting riparian vegetation which in turn provides habitat for wildlife including ungulates bears beavers and birds an additional 30 of applied water returned to the stream to support aquatic habitat and 17 of that supplemented late season base flows which may be beneficial to aquatic habitats and downstream water users at the same time diversion of water for irrigation at the site diminished instream flows to 0 3 m3 s 1 which is below the recommended minimal ecological flow for local aquatic populations according to the wyoming game and fish robertson and dey 2009 in this system determining whether the potential costs in the form of maintaining instream flows outweigh the potential benefits from return flows depends on management aims for instance if the provisioning of wildlife habitat is a primary objective the loss of return flows through conversion to sprinkler irrigation would be a serious consideration to balance water conservation with hydrologic ecosystem services water managers and policymakers need to be able to better anticipate the amount and timing of return flows although more data from a greater range of systems is necessary we believe this work provides a foundation from which other studies can build to better and more quantitatively describe the role general site characteristics e g climate soils crops subsurface geology etc play in governing the amount and potentially even the timing of return flows in a diversity of systems going forward the question of where and when alteration of irrigation management whether in the form of fallowing or conversion to sprinkler irrigation represents a potential impact to hydrologic ecosystem services supported by return flows is critical as an example many of the pilot projects undertaken in the upper colorado river basin between 2015 2018 as part of the system conservation pilot program upper colorado river commission 2018 participating irrigators in exchange for compensation turned off water early or employed partial fallowing although the future of this program remains uncertain there is a need to understand how these potential alterations to irrigation management and by extension hydrologic ecosystem services dependent on return flows may or may not impact different parts of the upper colorado river basin through better data and enhanced predictive capabilities one promising approach to improve prediction of return flows is to combine the rigorous interdisciplinary framework for return flow measurement and site characterization presented in this study with a hierarchical clustering analyses as discussed in mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 standardizing information provided about site characteristics and management practices for future return flow studies would allow for an expanded range of predictive variables in this type of analysis enhancing predictive capabilities would further benefit managers and policymakers in better constraining estimation of return flows based on geology soils crop cover and riparian vegetation 6 conclusions historically the measurement of return flows has been limited by the complexity of field experimentation and model based approaches as we demonstrated in this study the emergence of new technology such as nmr for soil water measurement and large aperture scintillometers for et estimation and a growing emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration provides new ways to quantify return flows identifying where interdisciplinary approaches can improve return flow estimates can a provide a framework for other scientists and managers interested in measuring return flow b contribute valuable data about return flows that can be used to improve forecasting and predictive capabilities and c expand our understanding of the feedbacks between hydrologic ecosystem services and irrigation management the conversion from flood irrigation in this type of system may indirectly reduce the amount of water available for riparian vegetation and by extension wildlife and fish habitat as such enhancing water accounting and return flow measurements helps policymakers assess the range of potential return flows and where and when changes in irrigation management may pose a risk to valuable ecosystem services linked to return flows and where they may not declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any potential conflicts of interest to declare the authors have no conflicts of interest to declare
