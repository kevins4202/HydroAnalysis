10005,climate change led to increased temperature and variable rainfall which may pose great threats to both agricultural productions and environmental impacts in this study we aim to explore how changing climate and its extremes in the 20th and 21st century influence system water use efficiency swue of a corn soybean cropping rotation in a humid sub tropic environment and how much can cover crops mitigate these impacts different from the traditional yield focused water use efficiency wue swue addresses both production and environmental quality goals by considering grain yields and all major system water losses evapotranspiration runoff and drainage a calibrated crop simulation model root zone water quality model version 2 rzwqm2 was applied to simulate grain yields and all major system water losses the model was forced by daily climate data from in situ observations during 1956 2015 and 10 downscaled and bias corrected general circulation model gcms projections under the representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios during 2020 2079 the results showed that under the historical baseline and the future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios due to the growth of cover crops the swue for corn were improved by 1 7 2 6 and 2 3 respectively p value 0 001 and for soybean by 0 7 p 0 06 1 0 p value 0 001 and 0 9 p value 0 001 soil evaporation as the largest source of water loss from the cropping system was significantly decreased by 1 7 2 6 and 2 3 during the corn growing season and by 0 7 1 0 and 0 9 during the soybean growing season the annual drainage was decreased by 38 mm 53 mm and 67 mm under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively with the incorporation of wheat cover crops the correlations of temperature or precipitation extremes with grain yields and major water losses were mostly decreased suggesting that growing cover crop is an effective means to mitigate the impact of climate extremes on swue of a corn soybean cropping keywords cover crop system water use efficiency climate change climate extremes crop simulation model 1 introduction global climate change posed great threats to agricultural systems while climate change is a globe scale issue increased temperature and associated changes of rainfall patterns can be differed by locations landscapes and current environmental conditions white et al 2011 to mitigate the negative effects of climate change conservation management practices can be potentially adopted to improve water use efficiency enhance soil water storage and reduce runoff and subsurface drainage kaspar and singer 2011 benefits of growing cover crops as a conservation management practice has been documented in recent literatures e g kaye and quemada 2017 basche et al 2016a 2016b daigh et al 2014a 2014b qi et al 2011 tribouillois et al 2018 blanco canqui et al 2015 dabney et al 2007 in particularly basche et al 2016b demonstrated that soil water storage can be improved by the long term use of a winter rye cover crop without sacrificing main crop growth daigh et al 2014b and qi et al 2011 found that cover crops can significantly reduce cumulative drainage studies also found that cover crops may help to mitigate the negative impact of climate change by decreasing co2 released from cropping systems tribouillois et al 2018 and reduce diurnal temperature range of day and night soil temperature blanco canqui et al 2015 dabney et al 2007 given these identified effects over the historical period there is a potential to incorporate cover crops into agricultural mitigation and adaption strategies under future climate conditions system water use efficiency swue which is defined as crop yield per unit of water losses by means of evapotranspiration deep drainage and runoff during its growing season provided rounded analysis of the effects of water use inefficiency on decreasing productivity under drought conditions and detrimental environmental quality under abundant moisture conditions dietzel et al 2016 this novel definition firstly introduced by dietzel et al 2016 is different from the traditional water use efficiency wue the ratio of grain yield to water used for evapotranspiration which is yield focused without considering the environmental quality impacts due to water leaving the cropping system in such forms as runoff and drainage mo et al 2009 swue provides a simple systems level method to address both yield production and environmental quality by introducing all major system water losses variables i e evapotranspiration runoff and drainage when a cropping system fails to take advantage of available water during wet conditions while wue is yield focused which considers crop water use i e evapotranspiration but not the environmental quality impacts due to water leaving the cropping system in such forms as runoff and drainage previous studies have shown that crop yields and soil water dynamics were significantly affected by the increasing carbon dioxide concentration warming and changes in rainfall jeong et al 2019 the increase in co2 contributed to plant growth and significantly improved water use efficiency wue however higher temperatures would downsize these positive impacts during crop growth cycle hatfield et al 2011 liu et al 2017a found that the effect of crop residue on crop yield and swue varied greatly across semiarid sites under climate change in spite of these recent findings it is still not known how future climate and its extremes influence swue in corn soybean systems and how much we can mitigate these effects in the humid environment by growing cover crops crop simulation models simulate daily crop growth development and yield and their interactions with weather soil crop properties and agronomic management it provides a viable alternative to overcome limitations of field studies and gaining insights into the relationship between crop production water use environmental performance and climate change at the system level chen et al 2010 hou et al 2012 the rzwqm model ma et al 2000 which includes detailed crop growth soil water and soil nutrient modules ma et al 2007 has been widely used to simulate hydrologic transport effects of manage practices and crop yields malone et al 2004 schwartz and shuman 2005 the second verision of rzwqm rzwqm2 has been combined with dssat crop growth model jones et al 2003 and was used to simulate crop yields evapotranspiration et drainage and runoff in different cropping systems ma et al 2017 2012 tribouillois et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in the previous studies rzwqm2 was used to assess potential impacts of climate change and elevated co2 on crop yields and water demands especially under arid and semiarid lands and climate conditions anapalli et al 2016 chen et al 2019 islam et al 2012 the rzwqm2 model has recently been calibrated and validated for evaluating long term effects of a winter cover crop on annual et and surface drainage of a corn soybean rotation cropping system in humid subtropic environments tribouillois et al 2018 yang et al 2019 abazi et al 2013 to address the production and environmental quality goals in a changing climate it provides an ideal tool to analyze the effects of cover crops on system water use efficiency that integrates crop yields and all major system water losses due to evapotranspiration drainage and runoff under historical and future climate conditions general circulation models gcms are commonly used to simulate future climate at the global scale wright et al 2015 however gcms projections are at the coarse resolution and highly uncertain which include biases in projected temperature and rainfall patterns cammarano et al 2013 araya et al 2015 statistical downscaling and bias correction of multi model gcms ensembles such as gcms from coupled model intercomparison project cmip taylor et al 2012 wuebbles et al 2014 are required for reliable climate change impact assessments rosenzweig et al 2013 ruane et al 2013 tebaldi and knutti 2007 in this study we aim to explore how changing climate and its extremes in the 20th and 21st century influence swue of a corn soybean rotation system in a humid sub tropic environment and how much can cover crops mitigate these impacts a systematic comprehensive evaluation of cover crop effects on simulated crop yields and soil water balance components will be provided under historical baseline and future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from 10 statistically downscaled and bias corrected gcms this study will provide an insight on the use of cover crops as an adaption strategy to enhance system water use efficiency and improve the resilience of corn soybean cropping system to climate change 2 materials and methods

treatments in the study area yang et al 2019 we used the calibrated and validated rzwqm2 model from yang et al 2019 to simulate corn and soybean yields and soil water dynamics with two treatments wheat cover crops and no cover crops under historical climate conditions 1956 2015 and future projected rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios 2020 2079 corn cultivar dekalb 63 84 vt3 and soybean cultivar asgrow4632 were planted on april 15th and may 15th and harvested on september 10th and october 8th respectively wheat cover crop cultivar terral 8861 was planted on october 10th and terminated on april 9th nitrogen at 190 kg n ha 1 was applied to corn on may 10th no n fertilizer was applied to soybean the system water use efficiency swue dietzel et al 2016 was calculated using rzwqm2 simulated grain yield actual evapotranspiration runoff and drainage 1 swue grain yield actual evapotranspiration runoff drainage the swue considers crop water use evapotranspiration but also all major water losses from a cropping system evaporation transpiration drainage and runoff which are important to both production and environmental quality we studied the effects of cover crops on swue and its components for each crop under corn soybean rotations 3 results 3 1 changes in rainfall and temperature we compared the daily average precipitation and temperature over the 10 gcms during the historical baseline 1956 2015 and the future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios 2020 2079 future temperature and precipitation in the study region was projected to be significantly increased under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 p value 0 01 fig 2 on average air temperature and precipitation would be increased by 4 7 c and 5 9 c and by 120 mm 8 6 and 117 mm 8 3 respectively under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios compared to the historical baseline during crop growth season may september daily temperature from the 10 gcms was projected to be 24 4 c 26 5 0 7 c and 27 2 1 c avg 1 std dev same hereafter under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively daily precipitation during the main crop growth season was projected to be 525 591 40 and 597 80 mm yr 1 under baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively which was 37 7 39 0 39 5 of accounted annual total precipitation of each scenario 1393 1513 75 and 1510 106 mm while rainfall was projected to be more abundant the timing of most abundant rainfall was not matching with the period of greatest crop growth needs fig 2 consistent with the average conditions climate extreme indices under different scenarios showed heavier rainfall and temperature during summer growing season for both corn and soybean the details are shown in figs s1 and s2 in the supplemental material the accumulated growing degree days and total precipitation during each main crop growth stage under different scenarios are shown in table s2 in the supplemental material during the corn vegetative stage from emergence to flower phase the accumulated degree days were projected to be increased by 14 5 and 19 0 and the total precipitation during this stage decrease by 12 3 and 9 0 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively during the reproductive stages from flower phase to physiological maturity the accumulated growing degree days were projected to be increased by 10 0 and 12 8 and the total precipitation increased by 10 4 and 8 9 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in addition under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the projected thermal unit during wheat cover crop growth season would be increased by 18 5 313 100 c and 22 0 371 100 c precipitation would be increased by 6 7 49 51 mm yr 1 and 5 5 40 69 mm yr 1 compared to the baseline 1690 c 727 mm yr 1 3 2 impact on crop yields the increased mean temperature during the growing season decreased corn and soybean yields fig 3 relative to the baseline projected corn yields averaged across 10 gcms were decreased by 6 7 6799 2 kg ha 1 versus 7285 62 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and by 6 1 6803 8 kg ha 1 versus 7246 0 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 scenario and by 11 0 6845 1 kg ha 1 versus 7285 62 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and 9 6 6552 5 kg ha 1 versus 7246 0 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 scenario similarly compared to the baseline period the simulated soybean yields were decreased by 18 5 2725 9 kg ha 1 versus 3346 3 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and by 18 6 2677 2 kg ha 1 versus 3290 2 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 scenario and by 16 3 2802 1 kg ha 1 versus 3346 3 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and 15 9 2766 6 kg ha 1 versus 3290 2 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 scenario due to the elevated co2 concentrations the biomass of wheat cover crop was projected to be increased by 0 9 2797 422 kg ha 1 under rcp4 5 and by 26 7 3512 298 kg ha 1 under rcp8 5 relative to the baseline 2771 kg ha 1 for the historical baseline grain yields under the cover crop treatment were 0 6 p value 0 07 higher for corn and 1 7 p value 0 001 higher for soybean compared to the no cover crop treatment however it is worth noting that compared to the no cover crop treatment corn yields under the cover crop treatment would be 0 1 p value 0 35 and 1 0 p value 0 001 lower for the future rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively by contrast compared to the no cover crop treatment soybean yields for the cover crop treatment are increased by 1 4 p value 0 001 and 1 3 p value 0 001 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively 3 3 impact on system water use efficiency swue fig 4 shows swue during crop growing season for the cover crop and no cover crop treatments under different climate scenarios the effect of cover crops on swue of corn and soybean was different during different crop growth seasons for corn the average swue across the 10 gcms during corn growing season was improved from 11 0 to 11 2 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for cover crop treatment over 60 years under the baseline period the overall average swue was improved from 9 4 to 9 6 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 and was improved 9 2 9 4 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 overall the average swue across the 10 gcms was enhanced by 1 7 2 6 and 2 4 due to the cultivation of winter wheat cover crop under baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively p value 0 001 nevertheless the winter wheat cover crop did not contribute to any notable changes in swue of soybean swue for soybean was only increased by 0 74 5 23 versus 5 19 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 under the baseline p value 0 06 the average swue was improved from 3 60 to 3 63 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 and was improved from 3 65 to 3 68 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 overall the average swue across the 10 gcms was enhanced by 1 0 and 0 9 due to the use of winter wheat cover crop under baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively p value 0 001 3 4 water losses and soil water storage during the main crop growing season to evaluate the effects of cover crop for mitigating negative impacts of climate change we analyzed the water balance components of swue during main crop growing season as an important component of water loss simulated soil evaporation the simulated soil evaporation for the cover crop treatment was significantly lower compared to the no cover crop treatment p value 0 01 during the crop growth period as shown in table 2 as well as fig s3 in the supplemental material with the wheat cover crop soil evaporation was reduced by 28 4 52 2 mm 24 4 53 3 mm and 26 8 58 8 mm during the corn growing season and by 26 6 42 7 mm 25 8 43 1 mm and 27 2 46 5 mm during the soybean growing season under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively wheat cover crop increased transpiration runoff and deep drainage in varied degrees table 2 runoff was significantly higher by around 3 mm p value 0 01 for the cover crop treatment under future climate scenarios compared to the baseline as is shown in fig 5 as well table s3 in the supplemental material cover crops increased soil water storage 0 1 8 m depth of soil profile during early stages of main crop growing period under historical and future climate scenarios the results indicated that wheat cover crop enhanced the soil water storage by as much as 14 8 mm on 133 day of the year doy 7 6 mm on 133 doy and 4 6 mm 134 doy under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during corn growing season respectively for soybean soil water storage could be improved by as much as 16 1 mm 149 doy 13 2 mm 150 doy and 11 7 mm 150 doy under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during soybean growing season 3 5 annual water losses and soil water storage cover crop main crop growing period higher transpiration during the cover crop growing period led to higher annual evapotranspiration under historical and future scenarios fig 6 by introducing wheat cover crop annual evapotranspiration was increased by 38 mm 5 5 53 mm 6 3 and 67 mm 7 9 under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively p value 0 01 fig 6a at the annual scale the increase in evapotranspiration could help dry the soil in the humid environment prior to growing the main crops cover crops could maintain soil moisture at a proper level that is favorable for sowing or soil management practices such as fertilization by contrast as demonstrated in fig 6 b and table 3 the drainage below 1 8 m soil depth was decreased by 38 mm 8 0 53 mm 11 8 and 67 mm 15 4 for the cover crop treatment compared to the no cover crop treatment under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively however the annual runoff was not affected by wheat cover crops table 3 3 6 mitigation to the impacts of climate extremes fig 7 shows the correlations of climate extreme indices with individual components of swue including corn yield y swue evapotranspiration et soil water evaporation es and plant transpiration ep during main crop growth for the cover crop and no cover crop treatments compared to the historical baseline future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios showed stronger negative correlations the swue of corn and soybean consistently showed notable positive correlations with ird pcp10 and pcp20 indices related to extreme rainfall conditions and strong negative correlations with ids mtmax dtr and ihd indices related to extreme temperature conditions compared to the no cover crop treatment the losses for the cover crop treatment showed weaker correlations with extreme climate indices in particular the correlation between ird and evaporation of corn was notably decreased due to cover crops the correlation coefficients for the cover crop and no cover crop treatments were 0 49 p 0 04 and 0 58 p 0 01 under the historical baseline 0 7 p 0 01 and 0 85 p 0 01 under the rcp4 5 scenario and 0 72 p 0 01 and 0 87 p 0 01 under the rcp8 5 scenario respectively fig 7a during the baseline period the simulated yield swue evapotranspiration plant transpiration under cc and no cc were weakly correlated to ihd mtmax ids and dtr the indices related to heat and drought in particular the results indicated that cover crop reduced the negative correlation between mtmax and evaporation from 0 55 to 0 47 and reduced the negative correlation between mtmax and evapotranspiration from 0 4 to 0 29 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 it showed stronger negative correlations between these variables and the climate indices especially for ihd and yield the correlation ranged from 0 4 to 0 43 and for ihd and swue the correlation ranged from 0 69 to 0 7 cover crops reduced the negative correlation between temperature extremes and soil evaporation especially for ihd 0 48 versus 0 49 under rcp4 5 0 3 versus 0 61 under rcp8 5 and for mtmax 0 4 versus 0 54 under rcp4 5 0 28 versus 0 53 under rcp8 5 ihd does not have severe impacts on soybean unlike corn mtmax still has negative impacts on soybean with the correlation values ranging between 0 19 and 0 66 under different scenarios fig 7b compared to the no cover crop treatment the negative correlations between actual evaporation of soybean and mtmax under the cover crop treatment was weaker than those under the no cover crop treatment 0 31 versus 0 53 under baseline 0 19 versus 0 29 under rcp4 5 0 04 versus 0 26 under rcp8 5 the negative correlation between mtmax and evapotranspiration was also weaker than those without cover crops 0 38 versus 0 48 under baseline 0 4 versus 0 42 under rcp4 5 0 39 versus 0 41 under rcp8 5 4 discussions 4 1 future temperature precipitation co2 and potential impacts future temperature and precipitation in the study region would increase significantly under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the high temperature would still be corresponding to the poor seasonal distribution of rainfall during crop growth dyer and mercer 2013 the months of crop growing season were still projected to be the period with low precipitation each year which is consistent with the conclusions by trend analysis and forecast of precipitation in mississippi cropping system feng et al 2016 tang et al 2017 our findings confirm that high temperature is the main driver for reducing corn and soybean yields particularly during crop reproductive stage due to a shorter grain filling period liu et al 2017b high temperatures above crop base temperature during reproductive stages will influence yield potential due to desiccation of the silks and pollen grains which results in poor pollination hatfield and prueger 2015 since soybean has a higher upper limit temperature compared to corn it has better ability to tolerate a warmer condition burkhead and klink 2018 our results were also consistent with lychuk et al 2017 who found that reductions in future aggregated c4 crop yields in our study corn were ranged from 6 to 10 and from 10 to 22 for c3 crops in our study soybean under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the elevated co2 concentrations can decrease stomatal conductance on leaves of plants which leads to reduced transpiration burkhead and klink 2018 thus soybeans and winter wheat as c3 plants could respond to elevated carbon dioxide strongly as evidenced by hastened photosynthesis and growth while c4 plants like corn do not respond rapidly leakey et al 2006 even so the effect of elevated co2 will only be partially compensated for the yield losses caused by increased temperature during summer growing season and the effect is more pronounced for soybean than corn jin et al 2017 as warmer air temperature can hold more moisture which is expected to enhance precipitation variability coumou and rahmstorf 2012 due to this reason there are significant increases of rainy days and consecutive wet days under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 compared to baseline the intensification of summer rainfall variability resulted in a decrease of rainfall events during extremely dry summers and an increase of heavy rainfall events in extremely wet summers wang et al 2005 however the projected heavier rainfall may increase runoff and drainage causing detrimental impact on environmental quality the direct effect of increases in temperature and precipitation can result in a lower swue due to the increased transpiration and water loss from the cropping system dietzel et al 2016 though increased co2 concentrations can reduce canopy transpiration and crop water use by decreasing stomatal conductance which can improve water use efficiency especially for c3 plants leakey et al 2006 adambounou et al 2019 demonstrated that water use efficiency wue would be decreased under future climate scenarios due to the reduction of crop yields in this study we further demonstrated that swue were significantly decreased under future climate scenarios with the elevated ambient co2 concentration compared to the baseline since swue also includes system water losses due to runoff and deep drainage the decrease of swue is expected to be greater than traditional wue that only considers crop yields and crop water use i e evapotranspiration with the growth of winter wheat cover crops swue could be enhanced significantly under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the humid region then in the following sections we further look at the impact on water losses and soil water storage during the main crop growing season as well as the entire year cover crop main crop growing period 4 2 effects of cover crops on grain yields under climate change with the cultivation of winter wheat cover crop grain yields were increased for both crops under the baseline period however compared to no cover crop treatment corn yields under the cover crop treatment would be lower or significantly lower for the future rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the cover crop treatment competition for nutrient and water could affect corn establishment tollenaar et al 1993 wang et al 2015 young corn plants are very susceptible to soil moisture modifications as affected by cover crops due to the stem apex below the soil surface during the vegetative stage stipešević and kladivko 2005 therefore the reasons for the decreased corn yield could be due to reduced soil moisture inadequate n and excess cover crop residues krueger et al 2011 on the contrary compared to the no cover crop treatment soybean yields for the cover crop treatment are increased significantly under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this may be due to the greater amount of water being conserved in the soil which is favorable for the soybean growth unger and vigil 1998 thus in contrast to the corn for legume crops like soybean it points to win win scenarios in which yields and climate mitigation are both improved by cover crops 4 3 effects of cover crops on hydrologic components under climate change during the crop growth period wheat cover crop increased transpiration runoff and deep drainage in varying degrees under different scenarios we found runoff was significantly increased by around 3 mm p value 0 01 for cover crop treatment under different climate scenarios in rzwqm2 model runoff was simply estimated based on the difference between rainfall and infiltration ma et al 2012 as the model did not consider of the effects of cover crop growth on soil macropore flow capacity and interception of precipitation by canopy or residue yang et al 2019 malone et al 2003 the preserved soil moisture and intercepted water due to the growth of cover crop krueger et al 2011 could be simulated as increased runoff by rzwqm2 during the crop growing season future work is needed to improve the model for precisely simulating interception effects of crop canopy and residue rainfall on soil hydrological components as a main component of water loss the simulated soil evaporation for the cover crop treatment was significantly lower compared to the no cover crop treatment p value 0 01 on the one hand the incorporation of cover crops can help cool regional climate by reducing sensible heat flux compared to the bare soil tribouillois et al 2018 the cool surface will prevent soil moisture loss by reducing evaporation blanco canqui et al 2015 2011 improved soil physical properties by long term use of the cover crop also increase soil water storage and decrease soil surface evaporation it can help enhance water holding capacity by increasing porosity and aggregate stability and aggregation villamil et al 2006 basche et al 2016b under future climate scenarios since runoff was significantly higher for the cover crop treatment the lower evaporation with cover crop contributed to a higher swue compared to no cover crop treatment in addition the decrease of soil evaporation due to live shoot stand and residue of cover crops exceeded the increase of plant transpiration due to high temperature and long lasting wet soil surface caused by increased summer rainfall field capacity during crop growing period can be more easily attained due to lower evaporation caused by cover crops leading to higher drainage and n leaching this finding is consistent with qi and helmers 2009 who showed that the cover crop could increase monthly drainage during heavier rainfall during early stages of main crop growing period we also find that cover crops increased soil water storage 0 1 8 m depth of soil profile under historical and future climate scenarios before growing main crops cover crops depleted soil water by transpiration basche et al 2016b qi et al 2011 which contributes to dry the soil for sowing in a humid early spring unger and vigil 1998 fig 2 in addition planting cover crops could help preserve soil moisture during the early stage of main crop growing season and thus relieve water stress during the reproductive stages of main crops feng et al 2018 2016 since benefits from cover crops were weather dependent krstić et al 2018 cover crops can be left alive until transpiration dries the soil to an optimal level for next crop establishment under wet conditions wagger and mengel 1988 at the same time timely terminations are needed to avoid water competition with the following crop under dry conditions alonso ayuso et al 2014 quemada et al 2017 at annual scale with the incorporation of the wheat cover crop the annual evapotranspiration was increased significantly which is contributed by higher transpiration the increase in evapotranspiration could help dry the soil in the humid environment prior to growing the main crops cover crops could maintain soil moisture at a proper level that is favorable for sowing or soil management practices such as fertilization however the drainage below 1 8 m soil depth was decreased for the cover crop treatment compared to the no cover crop treatment under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the increased evapotranspiration rates and decreased soil water storage contributed to decreased cumulative drainage which would result in a decrease in peak flow intensities and increased time lags of both peak flow and drainage initial daigh et al 2014b the decreased annual drainage could be due to the increased annual transpiration qi and helmers 2009 the findings indicated that annual runoff was not affected by wheat cover crops since runoff was increased during the main crop growing period but did not change at the annual timescale it suggested that the runoff was actually decreased during the cover crop growing period by growing wheat cover crops greater quantities of carbon input was taken as roots which contributed to a stable carbon pool at the soil surface kätterer et al 2011 more organic matter and greater macro faunal activity e g earthworms helped improve soil macroporosity increased water infiltration and consequently reduced runoff during the cover crop growing period blanco canqui et al 2011 4 4 effects of cover crops on mitigating impacts of rainfall and temperature extremes the relationships between climate indices and the swue components suggested that cover crops can mitigate the impacts of extreme rainfall conditions on swue of corn soybean rotation system in a humid environment this finding echoed previous studies which showed the benefits of cover crops for reducing erosion induced by intensive rainfall nearing et al 2004 unger and vigil 1998 the results also suggested that cover crops could mitigate the impact of rainfall extremes on evaporation in a humid environment by providing covers to the soil and intercepting the kinetic energy of rainfall dabney et al 2007 on the other hand the correlations between high temperature indices and soil surface evaporation are consistently lower for the cover crop treatment compared to the no cover crop treatment suggesting cover crops reduced the negative impact of extreme high temperature on soil evaporation in addition cover crops also reduced correlations between mtmax and soil evaporation suggesting its buffered effects on extreme temperature although different with corn ihd did not have notable impacts due to the higher heat tolerance of soybean mtmax still had negative effects on the correlation values for both crops compared to the no cover crop treatment cover crops reduced the negative correlation between mtmax and soil evaporation the negative correlations between actual evaporation and mtmax under the cover crop treatment was lower than those under the no cover crop treatment suggesting that the negative impact on evaporation would be mitigated by wheat cover crops in the future heat and drought events were predicted to be two of the major threats during the summer season in the humid southeastern united states ingram et al 2013 teixeira et al 2013 a reduction in the available water for evapotranspiration could make the overpassing air hotter and drier which increased potential evapotranspiration morton 1983 increased temperature will lead to a higher vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand which will cause increase in evapotranspiration and decrease in soil moisture this negative feedback will continue until the temperature increase cannot be damped by further increase in evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 by mitigating the negative effect of mtmax on evaporation evapotranspiration wheat cover crop could regulate sensible heat flux on soil surface georgescu et al 2011 tribouillois et al 2018 and mitigate this negative feedback thus the lower soil temperature due to cover crops can reduce evaporation and increase soil water storage which contributes to a higher system water use efficiency 5 conclusion the system water use efficiency swue is defined as crop yield per unit of water losses by means of evapotranspiration deep drainage and runoff it provides a systems level method to address both yield production and environmental quality by introducing all major system water losses variables i e evapotranspiration runoff and drainage when a cropping system fails to take advantage of available water during wet conditions we performed long term crop and soil water simulations for a corn soybean crop rotation system under 60 year historical and 60 year projected future climate conditions in a subtropical region considering the cover crop and no cover crop treatments compared to the historical baseline future temperature and precipitation were projected to be significantly increased under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios crop will experience a warmer and wetter condition especially under rcp8 5 scenario for the cover crop treatment the swue was increased by 1 7 2 6 and 2 3 for corn p value 0 001 and by 0 7 p value 0 06 1 0 p value 0 001 and 0 9 p value 0 001 for soybean under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively cover crops may slightly decrease corn yields due to nitrate leaching from drainage in a wet condition or water competition in a dry condition but significantly increase soybean yields due to the water conservation effects growing cover crops could reduce the soil evaporation and mitigate the adverse impacts from climate extremes during the summer main crop growing season wheat cover crops increased annual evapotranspiration but significantly decreased annual drainage under both historical baseline and future scenarios our results showed that the correlations of climate extreme indices with grain yields and major water losses were mostly decreased suggesting that long term growing of cover crops between the corn soybean cropping rotation is effective to mitigate adverse impacts from

changing climate and its extremes in the 20th and 21st century influence system water use efficiency swue of a corn soybean cropping rotation in a humid sub tropic environment and how much can cover crops mitigate these impacts different from the traditional yield focused water use efficiency wue swue addresses both production and environmental quality goals by considering grain yields and all major system water losses evapotranspiration runoff and drainage a calibrated crop simulation model root zone water quality model version 2 rzwqm2 was applied to simulate grain yields and all major system water losses the model was forced by daily climate data from in situ observations during 1956 2015 and 10 downscaled and bias corrected general circulation model gcms projections under the representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios during 2020 2079 the results showed that under the historical baseline and the future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios due to the growth of cover crops the swue for corn were improved by 1 7 2 6 and 2 3 respectively p value 0 001 and for soybean by 0 7 p 0 06 1 0 p value 0 001 and 0 9 p value 0 001 soil evaporation as the largest source of water loss from the cropping system was significantly decreased by 1 7 2 6 and 2 3 during the corn growing season and by 0 7 1 0 and 0 9 during the soybean growing season the annual drainage was decreased by 38 mm 53 mm and 67 mm under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively with the incorporation of wheat cover crops the correlations of temperature or precipitation extremes with grain yields and major water losses were mostly decreased suggesting that growing cover crop is an effective means to mitigate the impact of climate extremes on swue of a corn soybean cropping keywords cover crop system water use efficiency climate change climate extremes crop simulation model 1 introduction global climate change posed great threats to agricultural systems while climate change is a globe scale issue increased temperature and associated changes of rainfall patterns can be differed by locations landscapes and current environmental conditions white et al 2011 to mitigate the negative effects of climate change conservation management practices can be potentially adopted to improve water use efficiency enhance soil water storage and reduce runoff and subsurface drainage kaspar and singer 2011 benefits of growing cover crops as a conservation management practice has been documented in recent literatures e g kaye and quemada 2017 basche et al 2016a 2016b daigh et al 2014a 2014b qi et al 2011 tribouillois et al 2018 blanco canqui et al 2015 dabney et al 2007 in particularly basche et al 2016b demonstrated that soil water storage can be improved by the long term use of a winter rye cover crop without sacrificing main crop growth daigh et al 2014b and qi et al 2011 found that cover crops can significantly reduce cumulative drainage studies also found that cover crops may help to mitigate the negative impact of climate change by decreasing co2 released from cropping systems tribouillois et al 2018 and reduce diurnal temperature range of day and night soil temperature blanco canqui et al 2015 dabney et al 2007 given these identified effects over the historical period there is a potential to incorporate cover crops into agricultural mitigation and adaption strategies under future climate conditions system water use efficiency swue which is defined as crop yield per unit of water losses by means of evapotranspiration deep drainage and runoff during its growing season provided rounded analysis of the effects of water use inefficiency on decreasing productivity under drought conditions and detrimental environmental quality under abundant moisture conditions dietzel et al 2016 this novel definition firstly introduced by dietzel et al 2016 is different from the traditional water use efficiency wue the ratio of grain yield to water used for evapotranspiration which is yield focused without considering the environmental quality impacts due to water leaving the cropping system in such forms as runoff and drainage mo et al 2009 swue provides a simple systems level method to address both yield production and environmental quality by introducing all major system water losses variables i e evapotranspiration runoff and drainage when a cropping system fails to take advantage of available water during wet conditions while wue is yield focused which considers crop water use i e evapotranspiration but not the environmental quality impacts due to water leaving the cropping system in such forms as runoff and drainage previous studies have shown that crop yields and soil water dynamics were significantly affected by the increasing carbon dioxide concentration warming and changes in rainfall jeong et al 2019 the increase in co2 contributed to plant growth and significantly improved water use efficiency wue however higher temperatures would downsize these positive impacts during crop growth cycle hatfield et al 2011 liu et al 2017a found that the effect of crop residue on crop yield and swue varied greatly across semiarid sites under climate change in spite of these recent findings it is still not known how future climate and its extremes influence swue in corn soybean systems and how much we can mitigate these effects in the humid environment by growing cover crops crop simulation models simulate daily crop growth development and yield and their interactions with weather soil crop properties and agronomic management it provides a viable alternative to overcome limitations of field studies and gaining insights into the relationship between crop production water use environmental performance and climate change at the system level chen et al 2010 hou et al 2012 the rzwqm model ma et al 2000 which includes detailed crop growth soil water and soil nutrient modules ma et al 2007 has been widely used to simulate hydrologic transport effects of manage practices and crop yields malone et al 2004 schwartz and shuman 2005 the second verision of rzwqm rzwqm2 has been combined with dssat crop growth model jones et al 2003 and was used to simulate crop yields evapotranspiration et drainage and runoff in different cropping systems ma et al 2017 2012 tribouillois et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in the previous studies rzwqm2 was used to assess potential impacts of climate change and elevated co2 on crop yields and water demands especially under arid and semiarid lands and climate conditions anapalli et al 2016 chen et al 2019 islam et al 2012 the rzwqm2 model has recently been calibrated and validated for evaluating long term effects of a winter cover crop on annual et and surface drainage of a corn soybean rotation cropping system in humid subtropic environments tribouillois et al 2018 yang et al 2019 abazi et al 2013 to address the production and environmental quality goals in a changing climate it provides an ideal tool to analyze the effects of cover crops on system water use efficiency that integrates crop yields and all major system water losses due to evapotranspiration drainage and runoff under historical and future climate conditions general circulation models gcms are commonly used to simulate future climate at the global scale wright et al 2015 however gcms projections are at the coarse resolution and highly uncertain which include biases in projected temperature and rainfall patterns cammarano et al 2013 araya et al 2015 statistical downscaling and bias correction of multi model gcms ensembles such as gcms from coupled model intercomparison project cmip taylor et al 2012 wuebbles et al 2014 are required for reliable climate change impact assessments rosenzweig et al 2013 ruane et al 2013 tebaldi and knutti 2007 in this study we aim to explore how changing climate and its extremes in the 20th and 21st century influence swue of a corn soybean rotation system in a humid sub tropic environment and how much can cover crops mitigate these impacts a systematic comprehensive evaluation of cover crop effects on simulated crop yields and soil water balance components will be provided under historical baseline and future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from 10 statistically downscaled and bias corrected gcms this study will provide an insight on the use of cover crops as an adaption strategy to enhance system water use efficiency and improve the resilience of corn soybean cropping system to climate change 2 materials and methods

losses from a cropping system evaporation transpiration drainage and runoff which are important to both production and environmental quality we studied the effects of cover crops on swue and its components for each crop under corn soybean rotations 3 results 3 1 changes in rainfall and temperature we compared the daily average precipitation and temperature over the 10 gcms during the historical baseline 1956 2015 and the future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios 2020 2079 future temperature and precipitation in the study region was projected to be significantly increased under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 p value 0 01 fig 2 on average air temperature and precipitation would be increased by 4 7 c and 5 9 c and by 120 mm 8 6 and 117 mm 8 3 respectively under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios compared to the historical baseline during crop growth season may september daily temperature from the 10 gcms was projected to be 24 4 c 26 5 0 7 c and 27 2 1 c avg 1 std dev same hereafter under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively daily precipitation during the main crop growth season was projected to be 525 591 40 and 597 80 mm yr 1 under baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively which was 37 7 39 0 39 5 of accounted annual total precipitation of each scenario 1393 1513 75 and 1510 106 mm while rainfall was projected to be more abundant the timing of most abundant rainfall was not matching with the period of greatest crop growth needs fig 2 consistent with the average conditions climate extreme indices under different scenarios showed heavier rainfall and temperature during summer growing season for both corn and soybean the details are shown in figs s1 and s2 in the supplemental material the accumulated growing degree days and total precipitation during each main crop growth stage under different scenarios are shown in table s2 in the supplemental material during the corn vegetative stage from emergence to flower phase the accumulated degree days were projected to be increased by 14 5 and 19 0 and the total precipitation during this stage decrease by 12 3 and 9 0 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively during the reproductive stages from flower phase to physiological maturity the accumulated growing degree days were projected to be increased by 10 0 and 12 8 and the total precipitation increased by 10 4 and 8 9 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively in addition under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the projected thermal unit during wheat cover crop growth season would be increased by 18 5 313 100 c and 22 0 371 100 c precipitation would be increased by 6 7 49 51 mm yr 1 and 5 5 40 69 mm yr 1 compared to the baseline 1690 c 727 mm yr 1 3 2 impact on crop yields the increased mean temperature during the growing season decreased corn and soybean yields fig 3 relative to the baseline projected corn yields averaged across 10 gcms were decreased by 6 7 6799 2 kg ha 1 versus 7285 62 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and by 6 1 6803 8 kg ha 1 versus 7246 0 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 scenario and by 11 0 6845 1 kg ha 1 versus 7285 62 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and 9 6 6552 5 kg ha 1 versus 7246 0 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 scenario similarly compared to the baseline period the simulated soybean yields were decreased by 18 5 2725 9 kg ha 1 versus 3346 3 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and by 18 6 2677 2 kg ha 1 versus 3290 2 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 scenario and by 16 3 2802 1 kg ha 1 versus 3346 3 kg ha 1 for the cover crop treatment and 15 9 2766 6 kg ha 1 versus 3290 2 kg ha 1 for the no cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 scenario due to the elevated co2 concentrations the biomass of wheat cover crop was projected to be increased by 0 9 2797 422 kg ha 1 under rcp4 5 and by 26 7 3512 298 kg ha 1 under rcp8 5 relative to the baseline 2771 kg ha 1 for the historical baseline grain yields under the cover crop treatment were 0 6 p value 0 07 higher for corn and 1 7 p value 0 001 higher for soybean compared to the no cover crop treatment however it is worth noting that compared to the no cover crop treatment corn yields under the cover crop treatment would be 0 1 p value 0 35 and 1 0 p value 0 001 lower for the future rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively by contrast compared to the no cover crop treatment soybean yields for the cover crop treatment are increased by 1 4 p value 0 001 and 1 3 p value 0 001 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively 3 3 impact on system water use efficiency swue fig 4 shows swue during crop growing season for the cover crop and no cover crop treatments under different climate scenarios the effect of cover crops on swue of corn and soybean was different during different crop growth seasons for corn the average swue across the 10 gcms during corn growing season was improved from 11 0 to 11 2 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for cover crop treatment over 60 years under the baseline period the overall average swue was improved from 9 4 to 9 6 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 and was improved 9 2 9 4 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 overall the average swue across the 10 gcms was enhanced by 1 7 2 6 and 2 4 due to the cultivation of winter wheat cover crop under baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively p value 0 001 nevertheless the winter wheat cover crop did not contribute to any notable changes in swue of soybean swue for soybean was only increased by 0 74 5 23 versus 5 19 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 under the baseline p value 0 06 the average swue was improved from 3 60 to 3 63 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp4 5 and was improved from 3 65 to 3 68 kg grain ha 1 mm water 1 for wheat cover crop treatment under rcp8 5 overall the average swue across the 10 gcms was enhanced by 1 0 and 0 9 due to the use of winter wheat cover crop under baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively p value 0 001 3 4 water losses and soil water storage during the main crop growing season to evaluate the effects of cover crop for mitigating negative impacts of climate change we analyzed the water balance components of swue during main crop growing season as an important component of water loss simulated soil evaporation the simulated soil evaporation for the cover crop treatment was significantly lower compared to the no cover crop treatment p value 0 01 during the crop growth period as shown in table 2 as well as fig s3 in the supplemental material with the wheat cover crop soil evaporation was reduced by 28 4 52 2 mm 24 4 53 3 mm and 26 8 58 8 mm during the corn growing season and by 26 6 42 7 mm 25 8 43 1 mm and 27 2 46 5 mm during the soybean growing season under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively wheat cover crop increased transpiration runoff and deep drainage in varied degrees table 2 runoff was significantly higher by around 3 mm p value 0 01 for the cover crop treatment under future climate scenarios compared to the baseline as is shown in fig 5 as well table s3 in the supplemental material cover crops increased soil water storage 0 1 8 m depth of soil profile during early stages of main crop growing period under historical and future climate scenarios the results indicated that wheat cover crop enhanced the soil water storage by as much as 14 8 mm on 133 day of the year doy 7 6 mm on 133 doy and 4 6 mm 134 doy under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during corn growing season respectively for soybean soil water storage could be improved by as much as 16 1 mm 149 doy 13 2 mm 150 doy and 11 7 mm 150 doy under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during soybean growing season 3 5 annual water losses and soil water storage cover crop main crop growing period higher transpiration during the cover crop growing period led to higher annual evapotranspiration under historical and future scenarios fig 6 by introducing wheat cover crop annual evapotranspiration was increased by 38 mm 5 5 53 mm 6 3 and 67 mm 7 9 under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively p value 0 01 fig 6a at the annual scale the increase in evapotranspiration could help dry the soil in the humid environment prior to growing the main crops cover crops could maintain soil moisture at a proper level that is favorable for sowing or soil management practices such as fertilization by contrast as demonstrated in fig 6 b and table 3 the drainage below 1 8 m soil depth was decreased by 38 mm 8 0 53 mm 11 8 and 67 mm 15 4 for the cover crop treatment compared to the no cover crop treatment under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively however the annual runoff was not affected by wheat cover crops table 3 3 6 mitigation to the impacts of climate extremes fig 7 shows the correlations of climate extreme indices with individual components of swue including corn yield y swue evapotranspiration et soil water evaporation es and plant transpiration ep during main crop growth for the cover crop and no cover crop treatments compared to the historical baseline future rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios showed stronger negative correlations the swue of corn and soybean consistently showed notable positive correlations with ird pcp10 and pcp20 indices related to extreme rainfall conditions and strong negative correlations with ids mtmax dtr and ihd indices related to extreme temperature conditions compared to the no cover crop treatment the losses for the cover crop treatment showed weaker correlations with extreme climate indices in particular the correlation between ird and evaporation of corn was notably decreased due to cover crops the correlation coefficients for the cover crop and no cover crop treatments were 0 49 p 0 04 and 0 58 p 0 01 under the historical baseline 0 7 p 0 01 and 0 85 p 0 01 under the rcp4 5 scenario and 0 72 p 0 01 and 0 87 p 0 01 under the rcp8 5 scenario respectively fig 7a during the baseline period the simulated yield swue evapotranspiration plant transpiration under cc and no cc were weakly correlated to ihd mtmax ids and dtr the indices related to heat and drought in particular the results indicated that cover crop reduced the negative correlation between mtmax and evaporation from 0 55 to 0 47 and reduced the negative correlation between mtmax and evapotranspiration from 0 4 to 0 29 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 it showed stronger negative correlations between these variables and the climate indices especially for ihd and yield the correlation ranged from 0 4 to 0 43 and for ihd and swue the correlation ranged from 0 69 to 0 7 cover crops reduced the negative correlation between temperature extremes and soil evaporation especially for ihd 0 48 versus 0 49 under rcp4 5 0 3 versus 0 61 under rcp8 5 and for mtmax 0 4 versus 0 54 under rcp4 5 0 28 versus 0 53 under rcp8 5 ihd does not have severe impacts on soybean unlike corn mtmax still has negative impacts on soybean with the correlation values ranging between 0 19 and 0 66 under different scenarios fig 7b compared to the no cover crop treatment the negative correlations between actual evaporation of soybean and mtmax under the cover crop treatment was weaker than those under the no cover crop treatment 0 31 versus 0 53 under baseline 0 19 versus 0 29 under rcp4 5 0 04 versus 0 26 under rcp8 5 the negative correlation between mtmax and evapotranspiration was also weaker than those without cover crops 0 38 versus 0 48 under baseline 0 4 versus 0 42 under rcp4 5 0 39 versus 0 41 under rcp8 5 4 discussions 4 1 future temperature precipitation co2 and potential impacts future temperature and precipitation in the study region would increase significantly under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the high temperature would still be corresponding to the poor seasonal distribution of rainfall during crop growth dyer and mercer 2013 the months of crop growing season were still projected to be the period with low precipitation each year which is consistent with the conclusions by trend analysis and forecast of precipitation in mississippi cropping system feng et al 2016 tang et al 2017 our findings confirm that high temperature is the main driver for reducing corn and soybean yields particularly during crop reproductive stage due to a shorter grain filling period liu et al 2017b high temperatures above crop base temperature during reproductive stages will influence yield potential due to desiccation of the silks and pollen grains which results in poor pollination hatfield and prueger 2015 since soybean has a higher upper limit temperature compared to corn it has better ability to tolerate a warmer condition burkhead and klink 2018 our results were also consistent with lychuk et al 2017 who found that reductions in future aggregated c4 crop yields in our study corn were ranged from 6 to 10 and from 10 to 22 for c3 crops in our study soybean under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the elevated co2 concentrations can decrease stomatal conductance on leaves of plants which leads to reduced transpiration burkhead and klink 2018 thus soybeans and winter wheat as c3 plants could respond to elevated carbon dioxide strongly as evidenced by hastened photosynthesis and growth while c4 plants like corn do not respond rapidly leakey et al 2006 even so the effect of elevated co2 will only be partially compensated for the yield losses caused by increased temperature during summer growing season and the effect is more pronounced for soybean than corn jin et al 2017 as warmer air temperature can hold more moisture which is expected to enhance precipitation variability coumou and rahmstorf 2012 due to this reason there are significant increases of rainy days and consecutive wet days under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 compared to baseline the intensification of summer rainfall variability resulted in a decrease of rainfall events during extremely dry summers and an increase of heavy rainfall events in extremely wet summers wang et al 2005 however the projected heavier rainfall may increase runoff and drainage causing detrimental impact on environmental quality the direct effect of increases in temperature and precipitation can result in a lower swue due to the increased transpiration and water loss from the cropping system dietzel et al 2016 though increased co2 concentrations can reduce canopy transpiration and crop water use by decreasing stomatal conductance which can improve water use efficiency especially for c3 plants leakey et al 2006 adambounou et al 2019 demonstrated that water use efficiency wue would be decreased under future climate scenarios due to the reduction of crop yields in this study we further demonstrated that swue were significantly decreased under future climate scenarios with the elevated ambient co2 concentration compared to the baseline since swue also includes system water losses due to runoff and deep drainage the decrease of swue is expected to be greater than traditional wue that only considers crop yields and crop water use i e evapotranspiration with the growth of winter wheat cover crops swue could be enhanced significantly under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the humid region then in the following sections we further look at the impact on water losses and soil water storage during the main crop growing season as well as the entire year cover crop main crop growing period 4 2 effects of cover crops on grain yields under climate change with the cultivation of winter wheat cover crop grain yields were increased for both crops under the baseline period however compared to no cover crop treatment corn yields under the cover crop treatment would be lower or significantly lower for the future rcp4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the cover crop treatment competition for nutrient and water could affect corn establishment tollenaar et al 1993 wang et al 2015 young corn plants are very susceptible to soil moisture modifications as affected by cover crops due to the stem apex below the soil surface during the vegetative stage stipešević and kladivko 2005 therefore the reasons for the decreased corn yield could be due to reduced soil moisture inadequate n and excess cover crop residues krueger et al 2011 on the contrary compared to the no cover crop treatment soybean yields for the cover crop treatment are increased significantly under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 this may be due to the greater amount of water being conserved in the soil which is favorable for the soybean growth unger and vigil 1998 thus in contrast to the corn for legume crops like soybean it points to win win scenarios in which yields and climate mitigation are both improved by cover crops 4 3 effects of cover crops on hydrologic components under climate change during the crop growth period wheat cover crop increased transpiration runoff and deep drainage in varying degrees under different scenarios we found runoff was significantly increased by around 3 mm p value 0 01 for cover crop treatment under different climate scenarios in rzwqm2 model runoff was simply estimated based on the difference between rainfall and infiltration ma et al 2012 as the model did not consider of the effects of cover crop growth on soil macropore flow capacity and interception of precipitation by canopy or residue yang et al 2019 malone et al 2003 the preserved soil moisture and intercepted water due to the growth of cover crop krueger et al 2011 could be simulated as increased runoff by rzwqm2 during the crop growing season future work is needed to improve the model for precisely simulating interception effects of crop canopy and residue rainfall on soil hydrological components as a main component of water loss the simulated soil evaporation for the cover crop treatment was significantly lower compared to the no cover crop treatment p value 0 01 on the one hand the incorporation of cover crops can help cool regional climate by reducing sensible heat flux compared to the bare soil tribouillois et al 2018 the cool surface will prevent soil moisture loss by reducing evaporation blanco canqui et al 2015 2011 improved soil physical properties by long term use of the cover crop also increase soil water storage and decrease soil surface evaporation it can help enhance water holding capacity by increasing porosity and aggregate stability and aggregation villamil et al 2006 basche et al 2016b under future climate scenarios since runoff was significantly higher for the cover crop treatment the lower evaporation with cover crop contributed to a higher swue compared to no cover crop treatment in addition the decrease of soil evaporation due to live shoot stand and residue of cover crops exceeded the increase of plant transpiration due to high temperature and long lasting wet soil surface caused by increased summer rainfall field capacity during crop growing period can be more easily attained due to lower evaporation caused by cover crops leading to higher drainage and n leaching this finding is consistent with qi and helmers 2009 who showed that the cover crop could increase monthly drainage during heavier rainfall during early stages of main crop growing period we also find that cover crops increased soil water storage 0 1 8 m depth of soil profile under historical and future climate scenarios before growing main crops cover crops depleted soil water by transpiration basche et al 2016b qi et al 2011 which contributes to dry the soil for sowing in a humid early spring unger and vigil 1998 fig 2 in addition planting cover crops could help preserve soil moisture during the early stage of main crop growing season and thus relieve water stress during the reproductive stages of main crops feng et al 2018 2016 since benefits from cover crops were weather dependent krstić et al 2018 cover crops can be left alive until transpiration dries the soil to an optimal level for next crop establishment under wet conditions wagger and mengel 1988 at the same time timely terminations are needed to avoid water competition with the following crop under dry conditions alonso ayuso et al 2014 quemada et al 2017 at annual scale with the incorporation of the wheat cover crop the annual evapotranspiration was increased significantly which is contributed by higher transpiration the increase in evapotranspiration could help dry the soil in the humid environment prior to growing the main crops cover crops could maintain soil moisture at a proper level that is favorable for sowing or soil management practices such as fertilization however the drainage below 1 8 m soil depth was decreased for the cover crop treatment compared to the no cover crop treatment under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the increased evapotranspiration rates and decreased soil water storage contributed to decreased cumulative drainage which would result in a decrease in peak flow intensities and increased time lags of both peak flow and drainage initial daigh et al 2014b the decreased annual drainage could be due to the increased annual transpiration qi and helmers 2009 the findings indicated that annual runoff was not affected by wheat cover crops since runoff was increased during the main crop growing period but did not change at the annual timescale it suggested that the runoff was actually decreased during the cover crop growing period by growing wheat cover crops greater quantities of carbon input was taken as roots which contributed to a stable carbon pool at the soil surface kätterer et al 2011 more organic matter and greater macro faunal activity e g earthworms helped improve soil macroporosity increased water infiltration and consequently reduced runoff during the cover crop growing period blanco canqui et al 2011 4 4 effects of cover crops on mitigating impacts of rainfall and temperature extremes the relationships between climate indices and the swue components suggested that cover crops can mitigate the impacts of extreme rainfall conditions on swue of corn soybean rotation system in a humid environment this finding echoed previous studies which showed the benefits of cover crops for reducing erosion induced by intensive rainfall nearing et al 2004 unger and vigil 1998 the results also suggested that cover crops could mitigate the impact of rainfall extremes on evaporation in a humid environment by providing covers to the soil and intercepting the kinetic energy of rainfall dabney et al 2007 on the other hand the correlations between high temperature indices and soil surface evaporation are consistently lower for the cover crop treatment compared to the no cover crop treatment suggesting cover crops reduced the negative impact of extreme high temperature on soil evaporation in addition cover crops also reduced correlations between mtmax and soil evaporation suggesting its buffered effects on extreme temperature although different with corn ihd did not have notable impacts due to the higher heat tolerance of soybean mtmax still had negative effects on the correlation values for both crops compared to the no cover crop treatment cover crops reduced the negative correlation between mtmax and soil evaporation the negative correlations between actual evaporation and mtmax under the cover crop treatment was lower than those under the no cover crop treatment suggesting that the negative impact on evaporation would be mitigated by wheat cover crops in the future heat and drought events were predicted to be two of the major threats during the summer season in the humid southeastern united states ingram et al 2013 teixeira et al 2013 a reduction in the available water for evapotranspiration could make the overpassing air hotter and drier which increased potential evapotranspiration morton 1983 increased temperature will lead to a higher vapor pressure deficit and evaporative demand which will cause increase in evapotranspiration and decrease in soil moisture this negative feedback will continue until the temperature increase cannot be damped by further increase in evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 by mitigating the negative effect of mtmax on evaporation evapotranspiration wheat cover crop could regulate sensible heat flux on soil surface georgescu et al 2011 tribouillois et al 2018 and mitigate this negative feedback thus the lower soil temperature due to cover crops can reduce evaporation and increase soil water storage which contributes to a higher system water use efficiency 5 conclusion the system water use efficiency swue is defined as crop yield per unit of water losses by means of evapotranspiration deep drainage and runoff it provides a systems level method to address both yield production and environmental quality by introducing all major system water losses variables i e evapotranspiration runoff and drainage when a cropping system fails to take advantage of available water during wet conditions we performed long term crop and soil water simulations for a corn soybean crop rotation system under 60 year historical and 60 year projected future climate conditions in a subtropical region considering the cover crop and no cover crop treatments compared to the historical baseline future temperature and precipitation were projected to be significantly increased under both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios crop will experience a warmer and wetter condition especially under rcp8 5 scenario for the cover crop treatment the swue was increased by 1 7 2 6 and 2 3 for corn p value 0 001 and by 0 7 p value 0 06 1 0 p value 0 001 and 0 9 p value 0 001 for soybean under the baseline rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively cover crops may slightly decrease corn yields due to nitrate leaching from drainage in a wet condition or water competition in a dry condition but significantly increase soybean yields due to the water conservation effects growing cover crops could reduce the soil evaporation and mitigate the adverse impacts from climate extremes during the summer main crop growing season wheat cover crops increased annual evapotranspiration but significantly decreased annual drainage under both historical baseline and future scenarios our results showed that the correlations of climate extreme indices with grain yields and major water losses were mostly decreased suggesting that long term growing of cover crops between the corn soybean cropping rotation is effective to mitigate adverse impacts from

10006,accurate ahead evapotranspiration forecasting is crucial for irrigation planning for wetlands agricultural and forest habitats preservation and for water resource management deep learning algorithms can be used to develop effective forecasting models of ahead evapotranspiration in this study three recurrent neural network based models were built for the prediction of short term ahead actual evapotranspiration two variants of each model were developed changing the employed algorithm selecting between long short term memory lstm and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx while the modeling was performed in the context of an ensemble approach the prediction models were trained and tested using data from two sites with different climates cypress swamp southern florida and kobeh valley central nevada with reference to the subtropical climatic conditions of south florida lstm models proved to be more accurate than narx models while some exogenous variables such as sensible heat flux and relative humidity did not affect the results significantly an increase of the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days resulted in a slight reduction in the accuracy of both the lstm and narx based models considering instead the semi arid climate of central nevada narx models generally provided more accurate results which were only slightly affected by relative humidity sensible heat flux and forecast horizon on the other hand lstm models performance decayed if sensible heat flux and relative humidity were neglected and if the forecast horizon was increased from 1 to 7 days deep learning based models can provide very accurate predictions of actual evapotranspiration but the performance of the models can be significantly affected by local climatic conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration ensemble models deep learning lstm narx forecasting 1 introduction evapotranspiration is one of the major processes in the water cycle due to the complexity of balance based approaches which require complex direct measurements of mass or energy fluxes the estimation of evapotranspiration is generally carried out by theoretical approaches which lead to the evaluation of the reference evapotranspiration eto the most widely used method for estimating eto is represented by the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the subsequent evaluation of the actual evapotranspiration eta needs the estimation of the crop coefficient kc rosa et al 2012 marsal et al 2014 under actual conditions including water availability and other stresses optimal irrigation scheduling protection of agricultural and forest habitats and efficient water resource management would require an accurate forecast of the ahead actual evapotranspiration the mentioned approaches do not allow technicians and scholars to make predictions about ahead evapotranspiration unless it is possible to accurately predict future values of climate variables or energy fluxes or water fluxes such approaches are very complicated to implement a more direct and effective solution may be provided by machine learning ml algorithms these procedures are excellent tools for the development of forecasting models of hydrological quantities in recent years they have been used in some research in the context of eto or eta evaluation models feng et al 2017 kisi and alizamir 2018 xu et al 2018 dou and yang 2018 granata 2019 malik et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019 2020a b zhao et al 2019 granata et al 2020 yamaç and todorovic 2020 bai et al 2021 until now the use of ml algorithms to predict ahead evapotranspiration has been less frequent trajkovic et al 2003 applied a sequentially adaptive radial basis function network to the forecasting of eto at nis serbia exogenous climate variables were not included in their prediction model landeras et al 2009 compared artificial neural networks ann to autoregressive integrated moving average arima models in predicting weekly average eto in the region of alava basque country spain also in this research the authors did not consider climatic variables developing the forecast model only on the basis of the lagged values of eto torres et al 2011 used multivariate relevance vector machine mrvm and ann to forecast short term eto in central utah luo et al 2015 employed four anns for eto forecasting using predicted temperatures data obtained from public weather forecasts both torres et al 2011 and luo et al 2015 considered only temperature as an exogenous climatic input variable ashrafzadeh et al 2020 used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima support vector machine svm and group method of data handling gmdh to develop prediction models of monthly eto in guilan plain northern iran at different forecasting horizons the aforementioned studies focused on eto using time series generated with theoretical models penman monteith or hargreaves none of them investigated eta starting from experimental values deep learning is a special class of ml algorithms that employs multiple layers to gradually extract higher level features from the input data deng and yu 2014 deep learning is based on special architectures of anns currently in the literature there are still very few applications of deep learning algorithms to forecast ahead evapotranspiration values chen et al 2020a used three deep learning models namely deep neural network dnn temporal convolution neural network tcn and long short term memory neural network lstm to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration eto in the northeast plain of china a warm temperate zone with continental and monsoon climate characteristics the same authors developed a tcn with two engineering methods principal component analysis and maximal information coefficient to predict crop evapotranspiration using a two year dataset from lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film mulch chen et al 2020b ferreira and da cunha 2020 employed lstm network one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn and a combination of the two algorithms cnn lstm comparing them with traditional machine learning models to forecast multi step ahead daily eto up to seven days in minas gerais a state in south eastern brazil characterized by very warm climate little attention has been paid so far to the potential of deep learning algorithms in predicting eta while no attention has been devoted to assessing the influence of climatic conditions on the accuracy of forecasting algorithms in this study three different deep learning based models were developed for the forecasting of short term one day ahead and seven days ahead actual evapotranspiration models differ in exogenous input variables allowing to assess the impact of the latter on the forecasting performance two variants of each model were created modifying the deep learning algorithm employed choosing between two different recurrent neural network rnn architectures lstm and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input narx neural network rnns are particularly suitable for dealing with time series prediction problems because their connections form a directed cycle they can retain state from one iteration to the next by using their own output as input for the next step the relatively low computational complexities of these models lead to short training times while the recursive update of predictors allows to provide accurate predictions even for short time series these features make them preferable to many other machine learning algorithms for time series forecasting until now narx based models had never been used in evapotranspiration prediction problems furthermore rnn based models for predicting ahead evapotranspiration are very few in the literature and the few existing studies focus mainly on eto the forecast models were developed on the basis of data collected in two different locations respectively in southern florida and central nevada with very different climatic conditions this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of models based on lstm or narx networks in predicting short term ahead evapotranspiration but also to show that the model effectiveness can be affected by the different climatic conditions of the site under study 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas and dataset the cypress swamp site fig 1 left is in a wetland within the big cypress national preserve south florida on the atlantic coastal plain the cypress swamp area is classified as a swamp and dense tall cypress forest with a sub canopy of mixed hardwoods mcpherson 1973 the substrate consists of an irregular limestone bedrock with organic accumulations in the rock depressions reese and cunningham 2000 climate of this area is humid subtropical with a wet season from may to june and from september to october during this season tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally pass through the area leading heavy rainfall the mild dry season extends from november to april with a relatively low amount of rainfall overall the mean annual rainfall in the area is equal to about 1300 mm the mean annual air temperature is about 24 c in addition the annual evapotranspiration values in the big cypress national preserve range from about 800 1200 mm per year the differences between the different sites can be partially explained by the frequent forest fires during periods of drought that periodically affect the different preserve areas shoemaker et al 2011 the vegetation at the measurement site consists of tall cypress strands the cypress swamp site is located on the biscayne limestone aquifer in particular two monitored wells of the united states geological survey usgs on this aquifer revealed a shallow groundwater table between 0 26 m and 0 92 m in the period 2014 2017 salinity was quite high and between 3 5 ppt and 15 ppt for freshwater values of about 0 5 ppt were commonly measured which should be mainly related to saltwater intrusion prinos 2013 this led also to high values of specific conductance between 6420 μs cm and 25 000 μs cm at 25 c freshwater is between 0 and 2500 μs cm the kobeh valley site fig 1 right is located within the diamond valley flow system which consists of six hydraulically connected hydrographic areas in central nevada harrill et al 1983 climate of kobeh valley is semiarid with cold winters and warm to hot summers while the surrounding mountains which are part of the sub humid continental zone have cold winters and cool to mild summers mean annual precipitation in the diamond valley area is about 240 mm while the average annual temperatures in the area range from 3 c to 17 c in kobeh valley vegetation at the measurement site consists of moderate to dense shrubland in a usgs monitored well located on diamond valley aquifer the highest and lowest water level depth were equal to 10 4 m and 11 8 m in the period 1991 2019 deeper in comparison with the florida usgs wells above described specific conductance also exhibits lower values in comparison with the florida ones with mean value of 1160 μs cm data were provided by usgs daily measurements related to net radiation r sensible heat flux h relative humidity rh air temperature tair and actual evapotranspiration eta were collected from 25 april 2007 to 24 april 2010 for the cypress swamp site shoemaker et al 2011 and from 1 november 2010 to 2 november 2012 for the kobeh valley site berger et al 2016 garcia and mayers 2018 for the eta measurement the eddy covariance technique was used dyer 1961 wever et al 2002 sumner and jacobs 2005 anapalli et al 2018 the eddy covariance method presents several advantages including a fine temporal resolution without the need to estimate water budget terms at the same time the method requires the evaluation of the surface energy budget terms that governs the energy available for the evapotranspiration since there is bias in eddy covariance measurement which means that net radiation is not equal to the summation of latent heat flux soil flux and sensible heat flux usgs researchers applied the energy budget closure correction based on bowen s ratio 2 2 long short term memory networks the long short term memory lstm network is a special type of rnn designed to address sequence problems hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 rnn includes recurrent connections i e cycles that feed the network activations from a previous time step in such a way as to influence the outputs at the current time step the lstm network is characterized by a special formulation that facilitates training and scaling compared to other types of rnns an lstm layer gers et al 2000 consists of a set of recurrently connected computational units called memory cells a memory cell has an internal state used in the calculation of the output for a given time step as well as includes weight parameters for the input and output however the key elements of a memory cell are represented by the gates which are weighted functions that further regulate the flow of information through the cell a single cell is generally characterized by three gates an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the input gate and the forget gate contribute to the updating of the internal state the output gate is a final regulator on what the actual output of the cell the architecture of a lstm allows to preserve long term dependence a typical memory cell can be represented as in fig 2 in the schematized cell the internal gates are based on two activation functions the sigmoid σ and the hyperbolic tangent tanh the same functions were adopted in the models here developed the operation of a memory cell can be described by the following equations 1 f t σ w f h t 1 w f input t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 w i input t b i 3 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w c h t 1 w c input t b c 4 o t σ w o h t 1 w o input t b o 5 h t o t tanh c t where f t i t c t o t and h t represent the forget gate state the input gate state the cell state the output gate state and the hidden state respectively while the weights and the biases related to all these gates are w f and b f w i and b i w c and b c and w o and b o respectively in this paper each lstm network based model is made up of three hidden layers with 36 24 and 36 cells which is the optimal configuration obtained from a grid search procedure lstm models were implemented using deeplearning4j eclipse deeplearning4j development team 2020 an open source programming library written in java for the java virtual machine jvm stochastic gradient descent was chosen as optimization method the following parameters characterized the network configuration batch size 100 learning rate 0 1 number of training epochs 100 2 3 narx neural networks narx is a recurrent dynamic network lin et al 1996 commonly used for time series modeling narx is composed of interconnected nodes which represent artificial neurons that receive one or more inputs and elaborate them passing through a non linear activation function to produce an output represented by the target value the defining equation for the narx model is 6 y t f y t 1 y t 2 y t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where u t and y t are the input and output values at time t n u and n y are the input and output network layers and f is the non linear function twelve values of the input and output values were considered as autoregressive part namely the previous values of the variables indicated as the input delay id and the feedback delay fd in fig 3 respectively in order to detect the trend of both input and output values the narx architectures include 3 sequential layers fig 3 the input layer which contains the input parameters of the neural network the hidden layer which is the computational step between input and output and the output layer which leads to the predicted value y t moreover the output value is then fed back to the input values as part of the narx architectures for the hidden layer a sigmoid activation function f 1 was used for the output layer instead a linear activation function f 2 with one neuron n was used a preliminary grid search process allowed to assess the optimal number of hidden nodes equal to 10 fig 3 indicated as h 1 h 2 h h 10 for the output layer the weight w and bias b of the narx model were optimized based on the bayesian regularization training algorithm mackay 1992 which allowed to achieve the best predictions in comparison with other two training algorithms preliminarily tested the levenberg marquardt and the scaled conjugate gradient despite a fast convergence of the levenberg marquardt algorithm the bayesian regularization algorithm usually leads to improved forecasting di nunno and granata 2020 the narx based models were implemented in matlab 2020a environment mathworks 2020 the narx process was stopped if one of the following criteria was reached maximum number of epochs settled equal to 1000 levenberg marquardt adjustment parameter settled equal to 1 10 10 minimum performance gradient settled equal to 1 10 7 di nunno et al 2021a the batch size was equal to the size of the subset of the training stage which changes for each net of the ensemble model and for each usgs station 2 4 ensemble models the flowchart of the methodology to develop the proposed ensemble models is shown in fig 4 three different forecasting models were developed in this study the models differ in the exogenous input variables table 1 model 1 requires the following daily quantities as input variables net solar radiation r mean air temperature tair sensible heat flux h and relative humidity rh compared to model 1 model 2 does not include rh among the inputs finally model 3 requires only r and tair as exogenous input variables all three models include 12 lagged values of the actual evapotranspiration among the inputs two variants of each model were built varying the recurrent neural network employed experimental data were normalized with respect to their maximum values in the time series the common range for input and target values between 0 and 1 usually leads to more accurate predictions di nunno et al 2021b modeling was carried out using an ensemble approach which is a process where several models are built to predict the target values using different algorithms or different subsets for training and testing datasets the ensemble model then combines the outcomes of the single models providing a final prediction of the target values the use of an ensemble approach using different models may lead to a reduction of the prediction error kotu and deshpande 2019 in this study ten different networks were trained for each model and for each variant the results of which were averaged to obtain the final predictions since it was a time series prediction problem the temporal continuity of the training datasets was preserved the subsets used for training and testing the different networks are illustrated in fig 5 in particular the implemented ensemble models are comparable to models developed performing k fold cross validation on the available time series the entire initial dataset was divided into 20 subsets each containing 5 of the data preserving the order of the data in the time series in the next step the first model was trained using subsets 1 2 12 60 of data and tested using subsets 13 14 20 40 of data the second model was trained using subsets 1 2 13 65 of data and tested using subsets 14 15 20 35 of data the sixth model was trained using subsets 5 6 20 80 of data and tested using subsets 1 2 4 20 of data and so on following the scheme of the flow chart in the end the results of the 10 rnns were averaged for all subsets 2 5 evaluation metrics the performance of the cross validated prediction ensemble models was assessed by means of some different metrics the coefficient of determination r2 which evaluates how well the model replicates observed outcomes and predicts future outcomes it ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 which indicates a perfectly fit of the regression predictions to the data the root relative squared error rrse which takes the sum of the squared errors and normalizes it by dividing by the sum of the squared differences between the measured values and their respective mean it ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 that indicates a perfect predictive accuracy the mean absolute error mae and the mean absolute percentage error mape which respectively provides the average absolute and relative error magnitude for the predicted values in the case of evapotranspiration mae is expressed in mm day therefore a value equal to 0 indicates that on average there is no difference between measured and predicted values mape is expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100 with 0 that indicates the best performances the relative absolute error rae equal to the ratio between absolute error and absolute value of the difference between average and each measured value as for mape also rae is expressed as a percentage with 0 that indicates the best performances the root mean squared error rmse which provides the square root of the average squared errors for the predicted values rmse is expressed in mm day therefore values of rmse close to 0 indicate optimal predictions these metrics are defined as 7 r 2 1 i 1 m f i y i 2 i 1 m y a y i 2 8 rrse i 1 m f i y i 2 i 1 m y a y i 2 9 mae i 1 m f i y i m 10 mape 1 m i 1 m f i y i y i 11 rae i 1 m f i y i i 1 m y a y i 12 rmse i 1 m f i y i 2 m where m is the total number of measured data f i is the predicted value for the i th data y i is the measured value for the i th data and y a is the averaged value of the measured data the values of all these metrics have been reported in the following tables however for the sake of brevity in the discussion only r2 rmse and rae were considered these metrics are sufficient to characterize and compare the performance of the different models considered 3 results 3 1 evapotranspiration at cypress swamp the different complexity of the developed models is reflected in the input climatic variables they are representative of the main driving forces of evapotranspiration climatic parameters certainly have a different influence on the phenomenon however a priori it is difficult to determine which parameters may affect future evapotranspiration more than others table 2 and figs 6 8 show the results obtained in the 1 day ahead evapotranspiration forecasting with all developed models for cypress swamp site as for the lstm based variants model 1 gave the best results r2 0 915 rae 29 08 rmse 0 38 mm day although the differences with model 2 r2 0 914 rae 29 41 rmse 0 385 mm day were almost negligible model 3 was the least accurate but still characterized by good predictive capabilities slightly lower than those of the previous models r2 0 905 rae 30 76 rmse 0 402 mm day as for the variants based on narx networks model 1 r2 0 829 rae 41 36 rmse 0 540 mm day and model 2 r2 0 827 rae 41 56 rmse 0 544 mm day provided very similar results while model 3 r2 0 821 rae 42 36 rmse 0 555 mm day slightly underperformed both model 2 and model 1 the comparison between model 1 and model 2 in both cases showed that the relative humidity rh is not a variable that noticeably influences the evapotranspiration of the day after in cypress swamp by comparing the algorithms it can be seen that lstm networks clearly outperformed narx networks in all 3 models moreover it is clear figs 6 and 7 that all the considered models underestimated the higher values of the experimental evapotranspiration in particular this occurred when eta 5 mm day in the humid subtropical climate of cypress swamp both eta and other climatic variables changed over time in fairly wide ranges in these conditions of greater variability of the input dataset the lstm algorithm proved to be more accurate than the narx one in addition narx based models showed a tendency to overestimate the lowest observed values of eta fig 8 shows a further comparison between experimental and predicted values for the three models and their respective variants in the diagrams in the left column the comparisons refer to a winter period and the diagrams in the right column show comparisons referring to a summer period in the mild subtropical winter of southern florida actual evapotranspiration at cypress swamp varied between 1 and 2 5 mm day in the period considered in fig 8 with significant daily fluctuations lstm based models showed a low aptitude to reproduce sudden fluctuations as well as the less accurate models based on narx networks on the other hand in the summer period considered here during which evapotranspiration varied between 1 and 6 mm day the models based on lstm networks showed a good ability to reproduce the sudden fluctuations of eta in these diagrams the tendency of lstm models to underestimate the highest values is clear while the minimum values are well reproduced the narx based models instead although they reproduced the general trend of the phenomenon well were clearly less effective in following the oscillations and reproducing both the maximum and minimum values results for a 7 day forecast horizon are shown in table 3 and figs 9 11 again as far as the lstm based variants are concerned model 1 led to the best predictions r2 0 910 rae 30 07 rmse 0 394 mm day although the differences with model 2 r2 0 907 rae 30 42 rmse 0 399 mm day were almost insignificant model 3 proved to be a little less accurate but still characterized by good forecasting capabilities r2 0 899 rae 31 72 rmse 0 416 mm day it can be immediately noted that the prediction accuracy of the lstm based models in the case of a forecast horizon of 7 days was only slightly lower than that of the corresponding models with a forecast horizon of 1 day lstm based models ensured good results even if the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 7 days as regards the narx based variants the three models led to quite similar results with model 1 r2 0 823 rae 42 04 rmse 0 552 mm day slightly outperforming both model 2 r2 0 815 rae 43 06 rmse 0 566 mm day and model 3 r2 0 813 rae 43 25 rmse 0 568 mm day the accuracy of narx based models slightly decreased as the forecast horizon changed from 1 to 7 days however even for a 7 day forecast horizon narx based models significantly underperformed lstm based models figs 9 and 10 show comparisons between predicted and measured values of eta also in this case both the lstm and narx based models were able to reproduce the average trend of the phenomenon as well as both the classes of models underestimated the higher values of eta furthermore narx based models led again to a significant overestimation of the lower values of eta as can be seen also in fig 10 subplots b d f a significant number of outliers caused the worsening of the values of the metrics related to narx based models 3 2 evapotranspiration at kobeh valley table 4 and figs 11 13 show the results obtained in the forecasting of 1 day ahead evapotranspiration with all developed models for kobeh valley site focusing first on lstm based variants model 1 led again to the most accurate predictions r2 0 839 rae 40 14 rmse 0 298 mm day in this case the differences with the other 2 models are a little more noticeable and model 2 r2 0 817 rae 42 80 rmse 0 318 mm day outperformed model 3 r2 0 710 rae 53 88 rmse 0 400 mm day as for the narx based variants the three models provided similar results with model 1 r2 0 888 rae 33 43 rmse 0 248 mm day outperforming model 2 r2 0 882 rae 34 44 rmse 0 256 mm day and model 3 r2 0 863 rae 37 03 rmse 0 275 mm day in this case the inclusion of the exogenous variables h and rh improved the performance of the lstm based models while it had low improving effect in the models based on narx networks it is interesting to note that in the latter the rmse was slightly increasing while in the lstm based models it underwent a significant increase passing from model 1 to model 3 also due to the several outliers figs 11 and 12 show comparisons between predicted and measured values of eta the diagrams confirm that in the semiarid climate of kobeh valley the narx based models are characterized by higher accuracy than the lstm based models contrary to what happened for the cypress swamp case study both classes of models showed a tendency to underestimate eta values 2 mm day and especially the higher values fig 13 shows the comparisons referring to a winter period left column and a summer period right column for all models and their respective variants in the semiarid climate of kobeh valley both in the winter period during which the daily eta is generally between 0 and 1 mm day and in the summer period during which the eta is between 1 and 4 mm day the narx based models were able to reproduce eta oscillations with greater accuracy than lstm based models the already highlighted limit on the forecast of high daily evapotranspiration gradients remained table 5 and figs 14 16 exhibit the results gained in the forecasting of 7 days ahead actual evapotranspiration for kobeh valley in this case the forecast accuracy of lstm based models with a 7 day forecast horizon was significantly lower than that of corresponding models with a 1 day forecast horizon especially in the case of model 3 r2 0 569 rae 65 64 rmse 0 49 mm day the already unsatisfactory results further worsened if the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 7 days as for the narx based models they led again to similar outcomes in this case model 1 r2 0 881 rae 34 38 rmse 0 257 mm day slightly outperformed model 2 r2 0 873 rae 35 69 rmse 0 266 mm day which in turn outperformed model 3 r2 0 856 rae 37 98 rmse 0 283 mm day again both the lstm and narx based models were able to follow the trend of the phenomenon as well as both the classes of models underestimated the higher values of eta figs 14 and 15 underestimation was particularly relevant for lstm models which were also characterized by many outliers on the other hand narx based models were very accurate if 0 eta 2 mm day undergoing a decline in the accuracy if eta 2 mm day the underestimation of values greater than 2 mm day is probably due to two reasons the less effective training in this range which includes less data and the tendency of the ensemble approach to reduce the extreme values by averaging the forecasts of the individual networks 4 discussion the radar charts in figs 16 and 17 provide a good summary of the comparisons shown so far and allow for further discussion in the humid subtropical climate of south florida lstm based models proved to be more accurate than narx based models the inclusion of the exogenous variables h and rh did not play a decisive role in the quality of the predictions increasing the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days implied a slight reduction in the accuracy of the lstm models the narx models also showed a limited reduction in accuracy this result will lead to evaluate in the future developments of this research the applicability of both lstm and narx based models in the prediction of eta in the medium and long term on the other hand in the semi arid climate of central nevada narx models generally outperformed lstm models the forecasting capabilities of the latter decline both by excluding rh and especially h from the exogenous input variables and by increasing the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days on the contrary narx models were little influenced by the presence of the aforementioned exogenous variables and also showed a very limited reduction in accuracy if the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 7 days the results of this study are in agreement with previous research which has shown that deep learning based models can be powerful tools for predicting future evapotranspiration chen et al 2020a b moreover this study confirms the possibility of using artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately evaluate and predict evapotranspiration based on a limited number of climatic variables granata 2019 chen et al 2020a granata et al 2020 mean temperature and net solar radiation confirm to be essential variables also for predicting ahead evapotranspiration in addition in good agreement with the results of chen et al 2020a the presence of relative humidity rh among the input variables generally allows to improve the accuracy of the forecasts however the improvement is more relevant for lstm based models than for narx based ones a further improvement of forecasting capabilities is obtained if the models also include sensible heat flux h the impact of h and rh appears more relevant in the climatic conditions of kobeh valley the sensible heat flux h may be highly correlated also to ahead evapotranspiration this result confirms those of previous studies on eta prediction through machine learning algorithms granata 2019 granata et al 2020 however it is difficult to evaluate since h requires accurate measurement of temperature gradients above the surface jacovides et al 1991 therefore it is possible to build reliable forecasting models of ahead eta even neglecting h whose experimental measures are rarely available an ensemble approach can certainly improve the performance of a deep learning model in short term predictions of evapotranspiration ferreira and da cunha 2020 the higher values of metrics such as r2 and rmse than those obtained by ferreira and da cunha 2020 show that deep learning based approaches are likely more effective for predicting eta than eto however the systematic underestimation of the extreme values of eta is due to the ensemble approach which tends to mediate the predicted values of individual neural networks in addition the extreme values are a small subset of the input dataset so during the training phase the prediction models could not learn to forecast these values with sufficient accuracy the box plots of fig 18 show the residuals i e absolute errors of the developed models they represent the spread of errors with respect to the experimental values the lower end of each box plot stands for the lower quartile q1 25th percentile the upper end represents the upper quartile q3 75th percentile the band inside the box is the median of the data the whiskers extend from the bottom and top of the box to the smallest and highest non outlier in the dataset the median of the residuals of all the considered models is practically zero therefore the models are free from bias the width of the box plots confirms what was previously stated on the accuracy of the different models interestingly narx based models lead to mostly negative outliers for the cypress swamp site these outliers are obtained at low eta values as for the kobeh valley site positive outliers clearly prevail i e underestimates mainly of the higher values as already discussed another issue that needs further discussion is the real convenience of the ensemble approach fig 19 shows a comparison in terms of r2 and rmse between the performances of the individual rnns and those of the corresponding ensemble models for the sake of brevity only the prediction models with ta 1 day were considered the results are similar in the case of ta 7 days with reference to the cypress swamp site the ensemble approach leads to a clear improvement in forecasting capabilities with a significant increase in r2 and a remarkable reduction in rmse the benefit is greater for narx based models the performances of the individual rnns vary according to the datasets used for the training whereas the accuracy of the ensemble model does not depend on the aforementioned choice as for the kobeh valley site the ensemble models guaranteed an accuracy comparable to that of the best individual networks and in any case independent of the selection of the training dataset the benefit appears slightly more relevant in terms of rmse reduction a cross validated ensemble approach is certainly a reliable solution in the development of a forecasting model of the ahead eta however the actual improvement with respect to the individual networks may also depend on the climatic conditions of the site therefore the choice of the forecasting model cannot disregard the climatic conditions of the site which can significantly influence the performance of the model itself future developments of this research may focus on different climates e g mediterranean climate in order to better understand the influence of climatic conditions on the performance of forecasting models in addition it could be very useful to consider an additional input variable representing water availability if adequate data were available finally medium and long term forecast horizons will be considered also contemplating the possibility of using ensembles of further machine learning algorithms as well as hybrid models 5 conclusions an accurate forecast of the ahead evapotranspiration is essential for optimal irrigation scheduling and efficient water resource management deep learning algorithms can provide excellent tools for the development of forecasting models in this research three different deep learning based models were built for the forecasting of short term ahead actual evapotranspiration two variants of each model were developed changing the recurrent neural network employed selecting between lstm and narx neural network modeling was carried out using an ensemble approach which allowed to significantly improve the performance of a single model the prediction models were developed using data from two sites with different climates cypress swamp florida and kobeh valley nevada in the humid subtropical climate of southern florida lstm based models outperformed narx based models while sensible heat flux and relative humidity did not affect the predictions significantly an increase of the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days involved a reduction in the accuracy of the models in the semi arid climate of central nevada narx models generally led to more accurate predictions and were little influenced by relative humidity and sensible heat flux the accuracy slightly decreased if the forecast horizon was increased from 1 to 7 days conversely the forecasting capability of lstm models declined if sensible heat flux and relative humidity were not included among the input variables the results obtained show that forecasting models based on deep learning algorithms can provide very good results but the choice of the algorithm itself should not ignore the climatic conditions of the study area

10006,accurate ahead evapotranspiration forecasting is crucial for irrigation planning for wetlands agricultural and forest habitats preservation and for water resource management deep learning algorithms can be used to develop effective forecasting models of ahead evapotranspiration in this study three recurrent neural network based models were built for the prediction of short term ahead actual evapotranspiration two variants of each model were developed changing the employed algorithm selecting between long short term memory lstm and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx while the modeling was performed in the context of an ensemble approach the prediction models were trained and tested using data from two sites with different climates cypress swamp southern florida and kobeh valley central nevada with reference to the subtropical climatic conditions of south florida lstm models proved to be more accurate than narx models while some exogenous variables such as sensible heat flux and relative humidity did not affect the results significantly an increase of the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days resulted in a slight reduction in the accuracy of both the lstm and narx based models considering instead the semi arid climate of central nevada narx models generally provided more accurate results which were only slightly affected by relative humidity sensible heat flux and forecast horizon on the other hand lstm models performance decayed if sensible heat flux and relative humidity were neglected and if the forecast horizon was increased from 1 to 7 days deep learning based models can provide very accurate predictions of actual evapotranspiration but the performance of the models can be significantly affected by local climatic conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords evapotranspiration ensemble models deep learning lstm narx forecasting 1 introduction evapotranspiration is one of the major processes in the water cycle due to the complexity of balance based approaches which require complex direct measurements of mass or energy fluxes the estimation of evapotranspiration is generally carried out by theoretical approaches which lead to the evaluation of the reference evapotranspiration eto the most widely used method for estimating eto is represented by the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the subsequent evaluation of the actual evapotranspiration eta needs the estimation of the crop coefficient kc rosa et al 2012 marsal et al 2014 under actual conditions including water availability and other stresses optimal irrigation scheduling protection of agricultural and forest habitats and efficient water resource management would require an accurate forecast of the ahead actual evapotranspiration the mentioned approaches do not allow technicians and scholars to make predictions about ahead evapotranspiration unless it is possible to accurately predict future values of climate variables or energy fluxes or water fluxes such approaches are very complicated to implement a more direct and effective solution may be provided by machine learning ml algorithms these procedures are excellent tools for the development of forecasting models of hydrological quantities in recent years they have been used in some research in the context of eto or eta evaluation models feng et al 2017 kisi and alizamir 2018 xu et al 2018 dou and yang 2018 granata 2019 malik et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019 2020a b zhao et al 2019 granata et al 2020 yamaç and todorovic 2020 bai et al 2021 until now the use of ml algorithms to predict ahead evapotranspiration has been less frequent trajkovic et al 2003 applied a sequentially adaptive radial basis function network to the forecasting of eto at nis serbia exogenous climate variables were not included in their prediction model landeras et al 2009 compared artificial neural networks ann to autoregressive integrated moving average arima models in predicting weekly average eto in the region of alava basque country spain also in this research the authors did not consider climatic variables developing the forecast model only on the basis of the lagged values of eto torres et al 2011 used multivariate relevance vector machine mrvm and ann to forecast short term eto in central utah luo et al 2015 employed four anns for eto forecasting using predicted temperatures data obtained from public weather forecasts both torres et al 2011 and luo et al 2015 considered only temperature as an exogenous climatic input variable ashrafzadeh et al 2020 used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sarima support vector machine svm and group method of data handling gmdh to develop prediction models of monthly eto in guilan plain northern iran at different forecasting horizons the aforementioned studies focused on eto using time series generated with theoretical models penman monteith or hargreaves none of them investigated eta starting from experimental values deep learning is a special class of ml algorithms that employs multiple layers to gradually extract higher level features from the input data deng and yu 2014 deep learning is based on special architectures of anns currently in the literature there are still very few applications of deep learning algorithms to forecast ahead evapotranspiration values chen et al 2020a used three deep learning models namely deep neural network dnn temporal convolution neural network tcn and long short term memory neural network lstm to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration eto in the northeast plain of china a warm temperate zone with continental and monsoon climate characteristics the same authors developed a tcn with two engineering methods principal component analysis and maximal information coefficient to predict crop evapotranspiration using a two year dataset from lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film mulch chen et al 2020b ferreira and da cunha 2020 employed lstm network one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn and a combination of the two algorithms cnn lstm comparing them with traditional machine learning models to forecast multi step ahead daily eto up to seven days in minas gerais a state in south eastern brazil characterized by very warm climate little attention has been paid so far to the potential of deep learning algorithms in predicting eta while no attention has been devoted to assessing the influence of climatic conditions on the accuracy of forecasting algorithms in this study three different deep learning based models were developed for the forecasting of short term one day ahead and seven days ahead actual evapotranspiration models differ in exogenous input variables allowing to assess the impact of the latter on the forecasting performance two variants of each model were created modifying the deep learning algorithm employed choosing between two different recurrent neural network rnn architectures lstm and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input narx neural network rnns are particularly suitable for dealing with time series prediction problems because their connections form a directed cycle they can retain state from one iteration to the next by using their own output as input for the next step the relatively low computational complexities of these models lead to short training times while the recursive update of predictors allows to provide accurate predictions even for short time series these features make them preferable to many other machine learning algorithms for time series forecasting until now narx based models had never been used in evapotranspiration prediction problems furthermore rnn based models for predicting ahead evapotranspiration are very few in the literature and the few existing studies focus mainly on eto the forecast models were developed on the basis of data collected in two different locations respectively in southern florida and central nevada with very different climatic conditions this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of models based on lstm or narx networks in predicting short term ahead evapotranspiration but also to show that the model effectiveness can be affected by the different climatic conditions of the site under study 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas and dataset the cypress swamp site fig 1 left is in a wetland within the big cypress national preserve south florida on the atlantic coastal plain the cypress swamp area is classified as a swamp and dense tall cypress forest with a sub canopy of mixed hardwoods mcpherson 1973 the substrate consists of an irregular limestone bedrock with organic accumulations in the rock depressions reese and cunningham 2000 climate of this area is humid subtropical with a wet season from may to june and from september to october during this season tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally pass through the area leading heavy rainfall the mild dry season extends from november to april with a relatively low amount of rainfall overall the mean annual rainfall in the area is equal to about 1300 mm the mean annual air temperature is about 24 c in addition the annual evapotranspiration values in the big cypress national preserve range from about 800 1200 mm per year the differences between the different sites can be partially explained by the frequent forest fires during periods of drought that periodically affect the different preserve areas shoemaker et al 2011 the vegetation at the measurement site consists of tall cypress strands the cypress swamp site is located on the biscayne limestone aquifer in particular two monitored wells of the united states geological survey usgs on this aquifer revealed a shallow groundwater table between 0 26 m and 0 92 m in the period 2014 2017 salinity was quite high and between 3 5 ppt and 15 ppt for freshwater values of about 0 5 ppt were commonly measured which should be mainly related to saltwater intrusion prinos 2013 this led also to high values of specific conductance between 6420 μs cm and 25 000 μs cm at 25 c freshwater is between 0 and 2500 μs cm the kobeh valley site fig 1 right is located within the diamond valley flow system which consists of six hydraulically connected hydrographic areas in central nevada harrill et al 1983 climate of kobeh valley is semiarid with cold winters and warm to hot summers while the surrounding mountains which are part of the sub humid continental zone have cold winters and cool to mild summers mean annual precipitation in the diamond valley area is about 240 mm while the average annual temperatures in the area range from 3 c to 17 c in kobeh valley vegetation at the measurement site consists of moderate to dense shrubland in a usgs monitored well located on diamond valley aquifer the highest and lowest water level depth were equal to 10 4 m and 11 8 m in the period 1991 2019 deeper in comparison with the florida usgs wells above described specific conductance also exhibits lower values in comparison with the florida ones with mean value of 1160 μs cm data were provided by usgs daily measurements related to net radiation r sensible heat flux h relative humidity rh air temperature tair and actual evapotranspiration eta were collected from 25 april 2007 to 24 april 2010 for the cypress swamp site shoemaker et al 2011 and from 1 november 2010 to 2 november 2012 for the kobeh valley site berger et al 2016 garcia and mayers 2018 for the eta measurement the eddy covariance technique was used dyer 1961 wever et al 2002 sumner and jacobs 2005 anapalli et al 2018 the eddy covariance method presents several advantages including a fine temporal resolution without the need to estimate water budget terms at the same time the method requires the evaluation of the surface energy budget terms that governs the energy available for the evapotranspiration since there is bias in eddy covariance measurement which means that net radiation is not equal to the summation of latent heat flux soil flux and sensible heat flux usgs researchers applied the energy budget closure correction based on bowen s ratio 2 2 long short term memory networks the long short term memory lstm network is a special type of rnn designed to address sequence problems hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 rnn includes recurrent connections i e cycles that feed the network activations from a previous time step in such a way as to influence the outputs at the current time step the lstm network is characterized by a special formulation that facilitates training and scaling compared to other types of rnns an lstm layer gers et al 2000 consists of a set of recurrently connected computational units called memory cells a memory cell has an internal state used in the calculation of the output for a given time step as well as includes weight parameters for the input and output however the key elements of a memory cell are represented by the gates which are weighted functions that further regulate the flow of information through the cell a single cell is generally characterized by three gates an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the input gate and the forget gate contribute to the updating of the internal state the output gate is a final regulator on what the actual output of the cell the architecture of a lstm allows to preserve long term dependence a typical memory cell can be represented as in fig 2 in the schematized cell the internal gates are based on two activation functions the sigmoid σ and the hyperbolic tangent tanh the same functions were adopted in the models here developed the operation of a memory cell can be described by the following equations 1 f t σ w f h t 1 w f input t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 w i input t b i 3 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w c h t 1 w c input t b c 4 o t σ w o h t 1 w o input t b o 5 h t o t tanh c t where f t i t c t o t and h t represent the forget gate state the input gate state the cell state the output gate state and the hidden state respectively while the weights and the biases related to all these gates are w f and b f w i and b i w c and b c and w o and b o respectively in this paper each lstm network based model is made up of three hidden layers with 36 24 and 36 cells which is the optimal configuration obtained from a grid search procedure lstm models were implemented using deeplearning4j eclipse deeplearning4j development team 2020 an open source programming library written in java for the java virtual machine jvm stochastic gradient descent was chosen as optimization method the following parameters characterized the network configuration batch size 100 learning rate 0 1 number of training epochs 100 2 3 narx neural networks narx is a recurrent dynamic network lin et al 1996 commonly used for time series modeling narx is composed of interconnected nodes which represent artificial neurons that receive one or more inputs and elaborate them passing through a non linear activation function to produce an output represented by the target value the defining equation for the narx model is 6 y t f y t 1 y t 2 y t n y u t 1 u t 2 u t n u where u t and y t are the input and output values at time t n u and n y are the input and output network layers and f is the non linear function twelve values of the input and output values were considered as autoregressive part namely the previous values of the variables indicated as the input delay id and the feedback delay fd in fig 3 respectively in order to detect the trend of both input and output values the narx architectures include 3 sequential layers fig 3 the input layer which contains the input parameters of the neural network the hidden layer which is the computational step between input and output and the output layer which leads to the predicted value y t moreover the output value is then fed back to the input values as part of the narx architectures for the hidden layer a sigmoid activation function f 1 was used for the output layer instead a linear activation function f 2 with one neuron n was used a preliminary grid search process allowed to assess the optimal number of hidden nodes equal to 10 fig 3 indicated as h 1 h 2 h h 10 for the output layer the weight w and bias b of the narx model were optimized based on the bayesian regularization training algorithm mackay 1992 which allowed to achieve the best predictions in comparison with other two training algorithms preliminarily tested the levenberg marquardt and the scaled conjugate gradient despite a fast convergence of the levenberg marquardt algorithm the bayesian regularization algorithm usually leads to improved forecasting di nunno and granata 2020 the narx based models were implemented in matlab 2020a environment mathworks 2020 the narx process was stopped if one of the following criteria was reached maximum number of epochs settled equal to 1000 levenberg marquardt adjustment parameter settled equal to 1 10 10 minimum performance gradient settled equal to 1 10 7 di nunno et al 2021a the batch size was equal to the size of the subset of the training stage which changes for each net of the ensemble model and for each usgs station 2 4 ensemble models the flowchart of the methodology to develop the proposed ensemble models is shown in fig 4 three different forecasting models were developed in this study the models differ in the exogenous input variables table 1 model 1 requires the following daily quantities as input variables net solar radiation r mean air temperature tair sensible heat flux h and relative humidity rh compared to model 1 model 2 does not include rh among the inputs finally model 3 requires only r and tair as exogenous input variables all three models include 12 lagged values of the actual evapotranspiration among the inputs two variants of each model were built varying the recurrent neural network employed experimental data were normalized with respect to their maximum values in the time series the common range for input and target values between 0 and 1 usually leads to more accurate predictions di nunno et al 2021b modeling was carried out using an ensemble approach which is a process where several models are built to predict the target values using different algorithms or different subsets for training and testing datasets the ensemble model then combines the outcomes of the single models providing a final prediction of the target values the use of an ensemble approach using different models may lead to a reduction of the prediction error kotu and deshpande 2019 in this study ten different networks were trained for each model and for each variant the results of which were averaged to obtain the final predictions since it was a time series prediction problem the temporal continuity of the training datasets was preserved the subsets used for training and testing the different networks are illustrated in fig 5 in particular the implemented ensemble models are comparable to models developed performing k fold cross validation on the available time series the entire initial dataset was divided into 20 subsets each containing 5 of the data preserving the order of the data in the time series in the next step the first model was trained using subsets 1 2 12 60 of data and tested using subsets 13 14 20 40 of data the second model was trained using subsets 1 2 13 65 of data and tested using subsets 14 15 20 35 of data the sixth model was trained using subsets 5 6 20 80 of data and tested using subsets 1 2 4 20 of data and so on following the scheme of the flow chart in the end the results of the 10 rnns were averaged for all subsets 2 5 evaluation metrics the performance of the cross validated prediction ensemble models was assessed by means of some different metrics the coefficient of determination r2 which evaluates how well the model replicates observed outcomes and predicts future outcomes it ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 which indicates a perfectly fit of the regression predictions to the data the root relative squared error rrse which takes the sum of the squared errors and normalizes it by dividing by the sum of the squared differences between the measured values and their respective mean it ranges from 0 to 1 with 0 that indicates a perfect predictive accuracy the mean absolute error mae and the mean absolute percentage error mape which respectively provides the average absolute and relative error magnitude for the predicted values in the case of evapotranspiration mae is expressed in mm day therefore a value equal to 0 indicates that on average there is no difference between measured and predicted values mape is expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100 with 0 that indicates the best performances the relative absolute error rae equal to the ratio between absolute error and absolute value of the difference between average and each measured value as for mape also rae is expressed as a percentage with 0 that indicates the best performances the root mean squared error rmse which provides the square root of the average squared errors for the predicted values rmse is expressed in mm day therefore values of rmse close to 0 indicate optimal predictions these metrics are defined as 7 r 2 1 i 1 m f i y i 2 i 1 m y a y i 2 8 rrse i 1 m f i y i 2 i 1 m y a y i 2 9 mae i 1 m f i y i m 10 mape 1 m i 1 m f i y i y i 11 rae i 1 m f i y i i 1 m y a y i 12 rmse i 1 m f i y i 2 m where m is the total number of measured data f i is the predicted value for the i th data y i is the measured value for the i th data and y a is the averaged value of the measured data the values of all these metrics have been reported in the following tables however for the sake of brevity in the discussion only r2 rmse and rae were considered these metrics are sufficient to characterize and compare the performance of the different models considered 3 results 3 1 evapotranspiration at cypress swamp the different complexity of the developed models is reflected in the input climatic variables they are representative of the main driving forces of evapotranspiration climatic parameters certainly have a different influence on the phenomenon however a priori it is difficult to determine which parameters may affect future evapotranspiration more than others table 2 and figs 6 8 show the results obtained in the 1 day ahead evapotranspiration forecasting with all developed models for cypress swamp site as for the lstm based variants model 1 gave the best results r2 0 915 rae 29 08 rmse 0 38 mm day although the differences with model 2 r2 0 914 rae 29 41 rmse 0 385 mm day were almost negligible model 3 was the least accurate but still characterized by good predictive capabilities slightly lower than those of the previous models r2 0 905 rae 30 76 rmse 0 402 mm day as for the variants based on narx networks model 1 r2 0 829 rae 41 36 rmse 0 540 mm day and model 2 r2 0 827 rae 41 56 rmse 0 544 mm day provided very similar results while model 3 r2 0 821 rae 42 36 rmse 0 555 mm day slightly underperformed both model 2 and model 1 the comparison between model 1 and model 2 in both cases showed that the relative humidity rh is not a variable that noticeably influences the evapotranspiration of the day after in cypress swamp by comparing the algorithms it can be seen that lstm networks clearly outperformed narx networks in all 3 models moreover it is clear figs 6 and 7 that all the considered models underestimated the higher values of the experimental evapotranspiration in particular this occurred when eta 5 mm day in the humid subtropical climate of cypress swamp both eta and other climatic variables changed over time in fairly wide ranges in these conditions of greater variability of the input dataset the lstm algorithm proved to be more accurate than the narx one in addition narx based models showed a tendency to overestimate the lowest observed values of eta fig 8 shows a further comparison between experimental and predicted values for the three models and their respective variants in the diagrams in the left column the comparisons refer to a winter period and the diagrams in the right column show comparisons referring to a summer period in the mild subtropical winter of southern florida actual evapotranspiration at cypress swamp varied between 1 and 2 5 mm day in the period considered in fig 8 with significant daily fluctuations lstm based models showed a low aptitude to reproduce sudden fluctuations as well as the less accurate models based on narx networks on the other hand in the summer period considered here during which evapotranspiration varied between 1 and 6 mm day the models based on lstm networks showed a good ability to reproduce the sudden fluctuations of eta in these diagrams the tendency of lstm models to underestimate the highest values is clear while the minimum values are well reproduced the narx based models instead although they reproduced the general trend of the phenomenon well were clearly less effective in following the oscillations and reproducing both the maximum and minimum values results for a 7 day forecast horizon are shown in table 3 and figs 9 11 again as far as the lstm based variants are concerned model 1 led to the best predictions r2 0 910 rae 30 07 rmse 0 394 mm day although the differences with model 2 r2 0 907 rae 30 42 rmse 0 399 mm day were almost insignificant model 3 proved to be a little less accurate but still characterized by good forecasting capabilities r2 0 899 rae 31 72 rmse 0 416 mm day it can be immediately noted that the prediction accuracy of the lstm based models in the case of a forecast horizon of 7 days was only slightly lower than that of the corresponding models with a forecast horizon of 1 day lstm based models ensured good results even if the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 7 days as regards the narx based variants the three models led to quite similar results with model 1 r2 0 823 rae 42 04 rmse 0 552 mm day slightly outperforming both model 2 r2 0 815 rae 43 06 rmse 0 566 mm day and model 3 r2 0 813 rae 43 25 rmse 0 568 mm day the accuracy of narx based models slightly decreased as the forecast horizon changed from 1 to 7 days however even for a 7 day forecast horizon narx based models significantly underperformed lstm based models figs 9 and 10 show comparisons between predicted and measured values of eta also in this case both the lstm and narx based models were able to reproduce the average trend of the phenomenon as well as both the classes of models underestimated the higher values of eta furthermore narx based models led again to a significant overestimation of the lower values of eta as can be seen also in fig 10 subplots b d f a significant number of outliers caused the worsening of the values of the metrics related to narx based models 3 2 evapotranspiration at kobeh valley table 4 and figs 11 13 show the results obtained in the forecasting of 1 day ahead evapotranspiration with all developed models for kobeh valley site focusing first on lstm based variants model 1 led again to the most accurate predictions r2 0 839 rae 40 14 rmse 0 298 mm day in this case the differences with the other 2 models are a little more noticeable and model 2 r2 0 817 rae 42 80 rmse 0 318 mm day outperformed model 3 r2 0 710 rae 53 88 rmse 0 400 mm day as for the narx based variants the three models provided similar results with model 1 r2 0 888 rae 33 43 rmse 0 248 mm day outperforming model 2 r2 0 882 rae 34 44 rmse 0 256 mm day and model 3 r2 0 863 rae 37 03 rmse 0 275 mm day in this case the inclusion of the exogenous variables h and rh improved the performance of the lstm based models while it had low improving effect in the models based on narx networks it is interesting to note that in the latter the rmse was slightly increasing while in the lstm based models it underwent a significant increase passing from model 1 to model 3 also due to the several outliers figs 11 and 12 show comparisons between predicted and measured values of eta the diagrams confirm that in the semiarid climate of kobeh valley the narx based models are characterized by higher accuracy than the lstm based models contrary to what happened for the cypress swamp case study both classes of models showed a tendency to underestimate eta values 2 mm day and especially the higher values fig 13 shows the comparisons referring to a winter period left column and a summer period right column for all models and their respective variants in the semiarid climate of kobeh valley both in the winter period during which the daily eta is generally between 0 and 1 mm day and in the summer period during which the eta is between 1 and 4 mm day the narx based models were able to reproduce eta oscillations with greater accuracy than lstm based models the already highlighted limit on the forecast of high daily evapotranspiration gradients remained table 5 and figs 14 16 exhibit the results gained in the forecasting of 7 days ahead actual evapotranspiration for kobeh valley in this case the forecast accuracy of lstm based models with a 7 day forecast horizon was significantly lower than that of corresponding models with a 1 day forecast horizon especially in the case of model 3 r2 0 569 rae 65 64 rmse 0 49 mm day the already unsatisfactory results further worsened if the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 7 days as for the narx based models they led again to similar outcomes in this case model 1 r2 0 881 rae 34 38 rmse 0 257 mm day slightly outperformed model 2 r2 0 873 rae 35 69 rmse 0 266 mm day which in turn outperformed model 3 r2 0 856 rae 37 98 rmse 0 283 mm day again both the lstm and narx based models were able to follow the trend of the phenomenon as well as both the classes of models underestimated the higher values of eta figs 14 and 15 underestimation was particularly relevant for lstm models which were also characterized by many outliers on the other hand narx based models were very accurate if 0 eta 2 mm day undergoing a decline in the accuracy if eta 2 mm day the underestimation of values greater than 2 mm day is probably due to two reasons the less effective training in this range which includes less data and the tendency of the ensemble approach to reduce the extreme values by averaging the forecasts of the individual networks 4 discussion the radar charts in figs 16 and 17 provide a good summary of the comparisons shown so far and allow for further discussion in the humid subtropical climate of south florida lstm based models proved to be more accurate than narx based models the inclusion of the exogenous variables h and rh did not play a decisive role in the quality of the predictions increasing the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days implied a slight reduction in the accuracy of the lstm models the narx models also showed a limited reduction in accuracy this result will lead to evaluate in the future developments of this research the applicability of both lstm and narx based models in the prediction of eta in the medium and long term on the other hand in the semi arid climate of central nevada narx models generally outperformed lstm models the forecasting capabilities of the latter decline both by excluding rh and especially h from the exogenous input variables and by increasing the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days on the contrary narx models were little influenced by the presence of the aforementioned exogenous variables and also showed a very limited reduction in accuracy if the forecast horizon increased from 1 to 7 days the results of this study are in agreement with previous research which has shown that deep learning based models can be powerful tools for predicting future evapotranspiration chen et al 2020a b moreover this study confirms the possibility of using artificial intelligence algorithms to accurately evaluate and predict evapotranspiration based on a limited number of climatic variables granata 2019 chen et al 2020a granata et al 2020 mean temperature and net solar radiation confirm to be essential variables also for predicting ahead evapotranspiration in addition in good agreement with the results of chen et al 2020a the presence of relative humidity rh among the input variables generally allows to improve the accuracy of the forecasts however the improvement is more relevant for lstm based models than for narx based ones a further improvement of forecasting capabilities is obtained if the models also include sensible heat flux h the impact of h and rh appears more relevant in the climatic conditions of kobeh valley the sensible heat flux h may be highly correlated also to ahead evapotranspiration this result confirms those of previous studies on eta prediction through machine learning algorithms granata 2019 granata et al 2020 however it is difficult to evaluate since h requires accurate measurement of temperature gradients above the surface jacovides et al 1991 therefore it is possible to build reliable forecasting models of ahead eta even neglecting h whose experimental measures are rarely available an ensemble approach can certainly improve the performance of a deep learning model in short term predictions of evapotranspiration ferreira and da cunha 2020 the higher values of metrics such as r2 and rmse than those obtained by ferreira and da cunha 2020 show that deep learning based approaches are likely more effective for predicting eta than eto however the systematic underestimation of the extreme values of eta is due to the ensemble approach which tends to mediate the predicted values of individual neural networks in addition the extreme values are a small subset of the input dataset so during the training phase the prediction models could not learn to forecast these values with sufficient accuracy the box plots of fig 18 show the residuals i e absolute errors of the developed models they represent the spread of errors with respect to the experimental values the lower end of each box plot stands for the lower quartile q1 25th percentile the upper end represents the upper quartile q3 75th percentile the band inside the box is the median of the data the whiskers extend from the bottom and top of the box to the smallest and highest non outlier in the dataset the median of the residuals of all the considered models is practically zero therefore the models are free from bias the width of the box plots confirms what was previously stated on the accuracy of the different models interestingly narx based models lead to mostly negative outliers for the cypress swamp site these outliers are obtained at low eta values as for the kobeh valley site positive outliers clearly prevail i e underestimates mainly of the higher values as already discussed another issue that needs further discussion is the real convenience of the ensemble approach fig 19 shows a comparison in terms of r2 and rmse between the performances of the individual rnns and those of the corresponding ensemble models for the sake of brevity only the prediction models with ta 1 day were considered the results are similar in the case of ta 7 days with reference to the cypress swamp site the ensemble approach leads to a clear improvement in forecasting capabilities with a significant increase in r2 and a remarkable reduction in rmse the benefit is greater for narx based models the performances of the individual rnns vary according to the datasets used for the training whereas the accuracy of the ensemble model does not depend on the aforementioned choice as for the kobeh valley site the ensemble models guaranteed an accuracy comparable to that of the best individual networks and in any case independent of the selection of the training dataset the benefit appears slightly more relevant in terms of rmse reduction a cross validated ensemble approach is certainly a reliable solution in the development of a forecasting model of the ahead eta however the actual improvement with respect to the individual networks may also depend on the climatic conditions of the site therefore the choice of the forecasting model cannot disregard the climatic conditions of the site which can significantly influence the performance of the model itself future developments of this research may focus on different climates e g mediterranean climate in order to better understand the influence of climatic conditions on the performance of forecasting models in addition it could be very useful to consider an additional input variable representing water availability if adequate data were available finally medium and long term forecast horizons will be considered also contemplating the possibility of using ensembles of further machine learning algorithms as well as hybrid models 5 conclusions an accurate forecast of the ahead evapotranspiration is essential for optimal irrigation scheduling and efficient water resource management deep learning algorithms can provide excellent tools for the development of forecasting models in this research three different deep learning based models were built for the forecasting of short term ahead actual evapotranspiration two variants of each model were developed changing the recurrent neural network employed selecting between lstm and narx neural network modeling was carried out using an ensemble approach which allowed to significantly improve the performance of a single model the prediction models were developed using data from two sites with different climates cypress swamp florida and kobeh valley nevada in the humid subtropical climate of southern florida lstm based models outperformed narx based models while sensible heat flux and relative humidity did not affect the predictions significantly an increase of the forecast horizon from 1 to 7 days involved a reduction in the accuracy of the models in the semi arid climate of central nevada narx models generally led to more accurate predictions and were little influenced by relative humidity and sensible heat flux the accuracy slightly decreased if the forecast horizon was increased from 1 to 7 days conversely the forecasting capability of lstm models declined if sensible heat flux and relative humidity were not included among the input variables the results obtained show that forecasting models based on deep learning algorithms can provide very good results but the choice of the algorithm itself should not ignore the climatic conditions of the study area

10007,different irrigation treatments in plants significantly influence co2 emissions this study investigated the net ecosystem co2 exchange nee and yield of maize cropland under different irrigation treatments to determine the optimal irrigation treatment at different maize growth stages different degrees of water deficit irrigation were carried out in four fields full irrigation 100 evapotranspiration et moderate deficit irrigation 65 et and severe deficit irrigation 40 et automated static and dynamic chambers were used to measure co2 fluxes we found that nee showed a v shaped trend during the day and slowly declined at night the light response parameters were calculated using the rectangular hyperbola model and the leaf area index accounted for 85 of the light use efficiency in the late vegetative stage severe deficit irrigation led to a reduction in co2 emissions but significantly reduced the crop growth rate p 0 05 in the reproductive stage full irrigation not only reduced co2 emissions but also significantly increased the crop growth rate in the maturation stage moderate deficit irrigation reduced co2 emissions and the crop growth rate decreased compared with full irrigation but the decrease was not significant p 0 05 compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period full irrigation in the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and reproductive stages both increased the maize carbon sink capacity and light use efficiency at higher leaf area index and the harvest index did not decrease significantly however inadequate irrigation in the reproductive stage or severe deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and maturation stages significantly reduced the maize harvest index thus full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages were the optimal irrigation strategies for saving water reducing co2 emissions and ensuring a satisfactory maize yield keywords different irrigation treatments maize net ecosystem co2 exchange chamber yield 1 introduction in agricultural production people carry out

faloye et al 2019 and a reasonable irrigation regime could ensure satisfactory grain yield of maize kresović et al 2016 tilman et al 2011 reported that irrigation has harmful environmental impacts including increased emissions of greenhouse gases many scholars have studied the impact of irrigation on yield and co2 emissions but these studies are often carried out independently and there are few studies on water saving irrigation that consider yield and co2 emissions together hou et al 2020 studied the relationship between soil co2 emissions and maize yield under different irrigation treatments but more studies are needed on maize net ecosystem co2 exchange nee under different irrigation treatments the diurnal and seasonal variations in nee are important parameters to assess the capacity for maize ecosystems to be carbon sinks or sources zhang et al 2015 machado et al 2016 at present most of these estimates of diurnal and seasonal variations are based on the eddy covariance technique wagle et al 2018 wall et al 2020 however eddy covariance technique is a scale appropriate method that best applies to open habitats from hundreds of m2 to km2 pahari et al 2018 since the measurement scale of the eddy covariance technique is large it is not feasible for use in nee measurement at field scales especially when applying different irrigation treatments chamber methodologies provide measurements and direct evaluations of nee at the plot level barba et al 2018 however the traditional chamber method is based on manual measurements xi et al 2019 bah et al 2020 which limits the measurement of diurnal and seasonal nee data especially at night in this study we measured nighttime co2 fluxes of a maize ecosystem using an automated gas sampling chamber that we developed li et al 2020 and daytime co2 fluxes using a dynamic chamber our objectives were threefold 1 to quantify and compare diurnal and seasonal variations in the nee of maize at different growth stages under different irrigation treatments using the chamber method 2 to analyze the correlation between light response parameters and biological factors under different irrigation treatments and 3 to determine the optimal irrigation treatment for maize at different growth stages with the objectives of saving water reducing co2 emissions and ensuring yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the

crops the study area was divided into five fields of which f1 f2 f3 and f4 were selected as the research field fig 1 three sampling zones orange rectangles measuring 15 15 m2 within each field were demarcated for the data measurements fig 1 a mixture of soil samples taken at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm was used to estimate the soil characteristics the soil type was loamy sand 80 7 sand 13 7 powder

amounts of 100 65 and 40 of maximum nonstressed crop evapotranspiration et respectively different irrigation treatments were applied to each field in the late vegetative reproductive and maturation stages e g a 40 treatment would target 40 of maximum et during the corresponding stage nonstressed crop evapotranspiration was estimated by the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration and single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 the crop coefficients were 0 66 1 31 and 0 54 in the initial mid season and late season developmental stages alfalfa based respectively only one deficit irrigation treatment was set in the reproductive stage because the irrigation water requirements were greatest in this stage and water shortages in this stage will seriously affect the yield of maize cakir r 2004 ge et al 2012 these irrigation treatments could be used not only to study the response of co2 emissions and crop growth rate of maize in different growth stages to different irrigation treatments but also to study the effects of four irrigation treatments in four fields on maize yield and co2 emissions during the whole growth period maize plants were irrigated using a center pivot sprinkler system valmont industries inc omaha usa the irrigation amount was controlled by adjusting the walking speed of the sprinkler the coefficient of uniformity of the research field calculated by the modified formula of heermann and hein 1968 was 82 7 under a walking speed of 20 of the full speed and 88 3 under a walking speed of 40 of the full speed using r3000 sprinklers before the start of deficit irrigation on doy 184 all treatments f1 f4 received an equal amount of irrigation the purpose was to provide sufficient water in all treatments so that plants would emerge and grow as uniformly as possible before imposing the different levels of water deficit fertilization and other farmland management measure dates are presented in fig 2 three fertilization events with 533 kg ha 1

light transmission 95 to measure co2 fluxes of soil and maize the dimensions of the chambers to measure soil co2 fluxes were 36 cm 36 cm 36 cm each chamber system to measure the co2 fluxes of maize consisted of three chambers with heights of 54 cm 110 cm and 110 cm the lengths and widths were all 54 cm 54 cm when the height of maize plants was short one chamber was sufficient to measure the co2 fluxes of maize two chambers were needed when the height of maize plants was taller one without a lid to cover the lower part and the other with a lid to cover the upper part fig 3a and b more detailed information on the chambers is given in li et al 2020 field measurements of co2 fluxes of maize and soil were conducted at least once every two weeks between july and september 2019 six gas sampling events were conducted on sunny days throughout the growth period and each event consisted of two sampling days fig 2 in each gas sampling event co2 fluxes were measured in three maize sample plots and three soil plots in each field maize sample plots of the six gas sampling events a total of n 72 were randomly collected when the maize plants emerged a frame or collar enclosing each maize sample plot was constructed one month before gas sampling was carried out in each sampling event the co2 fluxes of 12 maize sample plots from the four fields 3 maize sample plots in each field were measured at night we measured the co2 fluxes variation in maize sample plots fig 3a and soil plots fig 3c based on the static chamber method bah et al 2020 xi et al 2019 in our study co2 fluxes of maize were measured using an automated static chamber as previously described in li et al 2020 the measurements were made once every 2 h between 22 00 and 4 00 the process of each gas collection was as follows gas samples were automatically collected by the chamber s gas sampling device at 0 5 10 and 15 min after the chamber was closed after the four gas samples were collected the chamber opened automatically the gas collection process was carried out in cycles with an interval of 2 h the gas samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc 2010plus shimadzu kyoto japan co2 flux was

heinemeyer and mcnamara 2011 the change in chamber co2 concentration over time was assessed with a portable battery operated infrared gas analyzer li 820 li cor lincoln ne usa measurements were carried out in most cases within 3 5 min of placing the chamber on the frames lindner et al 2016 choi et al 2018 data were logged every 15s and co2 fluxes were calculated with a linear regression describing the time dependent change in co2 concentration within the chamber co2 fluxes were sequentially observed with a systematic rotation over all plots using manually operated closed gas exchange chambers modified from the description given by li et al 2008 by mounting frozen ice packs on the back side of the chamber the temperature during measurements was maintained within 1 c relative to the ambient temperature li et al 2008 otieno et al 2009 xue et al 2017 choi et al 2018 the measurements were made once every 2 h between 6 00 and 20 00 the velocity of the air stream in the chamber

for f2 73 7 mm for f3 and 61 2 mm for f4 fig 4b there were 10 rain events 129 2 mm precipitation in total and only one unusually heavy rain event 59 7 mm precipitation in total fig 4c the vwc10 increased rapidly with irrigation or rainfall and then gradually decreased vwc10 fluctuated between 3 8 and 20 m3 m 3 fig 4c in this study the vwc10 values of each field under different irrigation treatments at each gas sampling event are shown in table 2 the air temperature fluctuated constantly in july and then gradually declined starting in august and the maximum daily average air temperature was 24 8 c daily fluctuations in air humidity were between 60 and 95 fig 4d 3 2 daily and seasonal patterns of co2 fluxes under different irrigation treatments diurnal nee changes of maize in different irrigation treatment fields are shown in fig 5 the nee was mostly negative co2 uptake during the day and positive co2 emission at night the nee of the maize fields showed a single peak in the day and declined slowly at night the co2 uptake capacity first increased and reached a maximum at noon before decreasing fig 5 however when there was a severe water deficit in the reproductive and maturation stages f3 at doy 239 and 245 f4 at doy 246 the peak appeared earlier before noon after which the maize ecosystem gradually decreased in carbon uptake and became a carbon source nee 0 the maximum nee or co2 uptake appeared in f1 with full irrigation throughout the growth stage with a value of 22 51 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 at doy 222 the integrated nee values for the day night and the total of day and night in the four fields are shown in fig 6 nee in the four fields during the day was expressed as co2 uptake fig 6a and nee at night was expressed as co2 emissions fig 6b during the late vegetative stage in the first two sampling events all four fields were carbon sources but the full irrigation treatment in f1 had higher co2 emissions than the deficit irrigation treatments in f2 f3 and f4 fig 6c however when maize approached the reproductive stage in the third sampling event the phenomenon of full irrigation promoting co2 emissions and deficit irrigation inhibiting co2 emissions became weaker fig 6c during the reproductive stage the carbon sink capacity of maize under the full irrigation treatment in f1 f2 and f4 was stronger than that under moderate deficit irrigation in f3 fig 6c thus full irrigation during the reproductive stage was useful for increasing carbon sink capacity during the maturation stage there was no significant difference p 0 05 table 4 in total nee in the day and night neetotal between the full irrigation treatment in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation treatment in f2 fig 6c 3 3 relationships between light response parameters and biological factors daily variations in the light response parameters of maize in the four different irrigation treatments at different growth stages are shown in table 3 the r2 of the curve fitted by the rectangular hyperbola model was too small for the model to be applicable under severe water deficit conditions i e f3 at doy 245 f4 at doy 246 so it is not displayed in this table the seasonal patterns of these parameters were closely related to crop phenology although the irrigation amounts differed the variations in parameters were consistent for the four fields the parameters α β γ and β γ 2000 first increased and then decreased according to crop growth development and senescence the difference in α was not significant p 0 05 between f1 full irrigation in the whole growth period and f2 full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and maturation stages the relationship between daytime nee and par for the four fields is shown in fig 7 the light response curves of the four fields were almost identical in the first sampling events fig 7a all treatments f1 f4 received an equal amount of irrigation before the start of deficit irrigation at doy 184 thereafter there was a greater separation between the curves corresponding to the difference in deficit irrigation fig 7b f the degree of divergence of the four curves decreased during the reproductive stage fig 7d and e likely due to the small differences in irrigation amount during the maturation stage the f1 and f2 curves remained divergent indicating that deficit irrigation still influenced nee at this stage fig 7f the relationship between lai and α over the whole growth period of maize in f1 and f2 is shown in fig 8a the comparison between f1 and f2 revealed a consistent trend with a higher rate of increase in α in f2 than in f1 thus compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages had no obvious effect on α the relationships between agb and β γ 2000 in f1 and f2 are shown in fig 8b there was a polynomial relationship throughout the growing season linear relationships can be found during the early and peak growing seasons doy 186 doy 223 there was a negative correlation between the decrease in β γ 2000 and the increase in agb in the late growing season doy 238 doy 246 3 4 effects of different irrigation treatments on maize nee agb and yield in each gas sampling event the neetotal and agb are shown in table 4 because of the different irrigation treatments in the four fields the differences in nee among the four fields in each growth period was significant and similar to the differences in nee agb had the same pattern the average daily nee of each growth stage neeaverage and crop growth rate cgr are shown in table 5 during the late vegetative stage the neeaverage and cgr were the smallest under the severe deficit irrigation treatment in f4 neeaverage did not differ significantly p 0 05 between full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 and in f3 but f1 had the greatest cgr in this stage in the reproductive stage the change in irrigation treatment from deficit irrigation to full irrigation in f2 and f4 promoted a rapid increase in cgr compared with f1 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in cgr in the reproductive stage between full irrigation in all stages in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stage and full irrigation during the reproductive stage in f2 during the maturation stage the difference in neeaverage and cgr between full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 was not significant p 0 05 the irrigation methods of f2 and f3 were the same except that in the reproductive stage f2 received full irrigation while f3 received moderate deficit irrigation because of the moderate deficit irrigation of f3 in the reproductive stage the neeaverage of f3 is greater than that of f2 and the cgr is less than that of f2 moreover among the four regions the neeaverage of f3 is the greatest and the cgr is the smallest when maize was harvested at doy 253 the agb values of f2 f3 and f4 were 10 12 42 53 and 26 58 less respectively than that of f1 1557 94 49 49 g m2 table 5 the maize yields of f2 f3 and f4 were 7 46 53 66 and 32 48 less respectively than that of f1 775 47 7 43 g m2 table 5 the harvest index hi relationships of the four fields were hif2 hif1 hif4 hif3 and the hi values for f1 f2 f3 and f4 were 0 50 0 51 0 41 and 0 46 respectively table 5 compared with f1 the irrigation amount of f2 in each period of the late vegetative and maturation stages decreased by 35 however the difference in hi between f1 and f2 was not significant p 0 05 table 5 the irrigation methods of f2 and f3 were the same except that in the reproductive stage f2 received full irrigation while f3 received moderate deficit irrigation therefore inadequate irrigation in the reproductive stage would significantly reduced the maize hi the irrigation methods of f2 and f4 were the same except that in the late vegetative and maturation stages f2 received moderate deficit irrigation while f3 received severe deficit irrigation therefore severe deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and maturation stages significantly reduced the maize hi thus full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages were the optimal irrigation strategies for saving water reducing co2 emissions and ensuring a satisfactory maize yield 4 discussion 4 1 diurnal and seasonal variations in nee under different irrigation treatments at present the nee of maize cropland is usually observed by the ec technique e g wagle et al 2018 however the ec method only measures the nee at the regional scale wagle et al 2017 and it is easily disturbed by the external environment such as human and animal respiration and vehicle emissions therefore it is necessary to observe the maize nee at the canopy scale chamber methods remain the sole approach for plot scale experimental agriculture and the observed data could represent the maize nee at the canopy scale barba et al 2018 increasing water use efficiency through deficit irrigation is the main method to resolve the shortage of water resources in arid areas wang et al 2019 there are too many researches on maize yield under different irrigation treatments at present e g ge et al 2012 kresović et al 2016 however it is scarcely considered maize co2 emissions and yield under different irrigation treatments and there are few studies on the nee of maize cropland based on the chamber method fang et al 2020 measured the nee of maize cropland using chambers however the row spacing and plant spacing of the maize were not considered so the results cannot represent the actual nee of maize cropland under this planting density therefore it is necessary to consider the row spacing and plant spacing when measuring the co2 exchange of a single crop with the chamber in our study we used the chamber method to observe the nee of maize cropland under different irrigation treatments to improve understanding of maize co2 exchange at the canopy scale in our study we found that a higher daytime maximum nee was usually observed in the field with higher vwc10 during the same growth stage and the maximum nee was higher during the reproductive stage fig 5 when there was a severe water deficit f3 at doy 245 f4 at doy 246 the co2 uptake by the maize canopy was stronger before noon the asymmetrical distribution of nee before noon was similar to the results from a previous study in a semiarid region wagle et al 2018 the midday depression in photosynthesis is a common survival strategy of plants in semiarid areas in response to high air temperature or water deficit chaves et al 2002 and can explain our observations that the field with severe water stress reaches the light saturation point and that the light saturation point tends to increase with the increase in vwc10 fig 5 in the late vegetative stage the maize ecosystem was mainly a carbon source table 4 neetotal 0 at doy 186 187 which may be due to the lower agb and lai of maize in this stage and beacause soil co2 emissions have a greater impact on maize ecosystems previous studies also show that young vegetation in cropland ecosystems shows limited carbon assimilation capacities zhang et al 2007 in the reproductive stage plants need more carbon for growth canopy development and grain filling wang et al 2015 which may explain our observation of a strong carbon sink neetotal 0 in this stage fig 6c during the maturation stage photosynthesis and respiration rates declined in senescent plants xi et al 2019 this may be the reason that there was no significant p 0 05 difference in neetotal between the maize with full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 treatments table 4 4 2 correlation and regression analyses of light response parameters with plant growth variables there is a strong linear relationship between lai and α fig 8a which is consistent with the work of lindner et al 2016 and who found that the values of α for both paddy and rainfed rice were linearly correlated with lai r2 0 93 and 0 94 respectively in our study α was lower in f2 than in f1 at a lower lai but f2 demonstrated higher α at a higher lai fig 8a biomass accumulation by crops depends on the efficiency of light and is used to produce dry matter plénet et al 2000 therefore the irrigation treatment of f2 was more advantageous than that of f1 in the period of higher lai a polynomial relationship was found between agb and β γ 2000 in the maize ecosystem throughout the growing season during the early and peak growing seasons at doy 186 223 agb and β γ 2000 were positively correlated fig 8b suggesting that an increase in agb enhances β γ 2000 in the early stage the growth of maize is mainly leaf and stem which promotes photosynthesis because it determines the photosynthetic surface area otieno et al 2009 however during the late growing season at doy 238 246 the β γ 2000 decreased to a low level compared to the peak of the growing season even with higher agb on the one hand the increase in maize agb was mainly due to the growth of fruit in the later stage although the contribution of fruit to photosynthesis is lower on the other hand as plants become senescent in the late growing season their growth and metabolism rates decline causing adecline in both photosynthesis and respiration rates xi et al 2019 4 3 effect of different irrigation treatments on maize nee agb and yield by studying the growth of maize under deficit irrigation eck 1984 showed that sufficient irrigation during vegetative growth is crucial to leaf area development and yield in our study the increasing irrigation promoted cgr in the late vegetative stage however we also found that co2 emissions also increased table 5 when irrigation was increased in this stage the reproductive stage is a critical period when crops such as maize grow most rapidly and water deficit during this stage reduces maize yield ge et al 2012 moreover wang et al 2015 reported that maize has a strong co2 uptake capacity based on observations using the ec method in our study we investigated the relationship among irrigation yield and co2 exchange of maize ecosystem and full irrigation in the reproductive stage can significantly improve the co2 uptake capacity and increase cgr table 5 shaw 1974 indicated that the effect on yield during the maturation stage is notably lower under water stress therefore we conducted different irrigation treatments in this period and the difference in co2 emissions and cgr between the full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 treatments was not significant table 5 p 0 05 during this period for the overall irrigation treatments of each field the agb and yield of maize with full irrigation in f1 were relatively higher than those of maize with deficit irrigation in f2 f3 and f4 however compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period in f1 full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages in f2 showed higher hi table 5 under water limited conditions crop yield is largely determined by the agb and hi thapa et al 2020 therefore when considering co2 emissions and hi the irrigation treatment in f2 was the best irrigation method however the yield of f2 was 717 58 14 63 g m 2 or 7 17 t ha 1 lower than the yields reported by wang et al 2018 of 8 04 12 98 t ha 1 on the north china plain and by agegnehu et al 2016 of 7 14 9 21 t ha 1 in australia however the maize yield of f2 was similar to or higher than those in other studies for example the maize yield was 6 13 t ha 1 on the loess plateau of china zhou et al 2009 and 2 57 6 35 t ha 1 in akure nigeria faloye et al 2019 therefore the irrigation treatment in f2 in our study was an optimal irrigation strategy for saving water reducing co2 emissions and maintaining satisfactory maize production when water was limited 5 conclusions this research aims to study the nee and yield of maize ecosystems under different irrigation treatments in semiarid inner mongolia in particular we explore whether deficit irrigation treatment could not only reduce co2 emissions but also ensure yield we found that moderate deficit irrigation can reduce co2 emissions which is interesting for fodder maize production in the late vegetative stage full irrigation can significantly improve the co2 uptake capacity and increase cgr in the reproductive stage the difference in co2 emissions and cgr between full irrigation and moderate deficit irrigation was not significant in the maturation stage our results demonstrated that reasonable deficit irrigation could improve the light use efficiency of maize canopy and could make maize ecosystems as a carbon sink throughout the growth period although the yield of the deficit irrigation treatment field was less than that of the full irrigation treatment field a reasonable deficit irrigation treatment can improve the hi of maize this study provides a reference point for future irrigation management decisions in agriculture in semiarid areas however the irrigation treatments in this study only considered three levels i e full irrigation moderate deficit irrigation and severe deficit irrigation with irrigation amounts of 100 65 40 of et respectively creating some limitations of this research more consideration of irrigation treatment levels is

10007,different irrigation treatments in plants significantly influence co2 emissions this study investigated the net ecosystem co2 exchange nee and yield of maize cropland under different irrigation treatments to determine the optimal irrigation treatment at different maize growth stages different degrees of water deficit irrigation were carried out in four fields full irrigation 100 evapotranspiration et moderate deficit irrigation 65 et and severe deficit irrigation 40 et automated static and dynamic chambers were used to measure co2 fluxes we found that nee showed a v shaped trend during the day and slowly declined at night the light response parameters were calculated using the rectangular hyperbola model and the leaf area index accounted for 85 of the light use efficiency in the late vegetative stage severe deficit irrigation led to a reduction in co2 emissions but significantly reduced the crop growth rate p 0 05 in the reproductive stage full irrigation not only reduced co2 emissions but also significantly increased the crop growth rate in the maturation stage moderate deficit irrigation reduced co2 emissions and the crop growth rate decreased compared with full irrigation but the decrease was not significant p 0 05 compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period full irrigation in the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and reproductive stages both increased the maize carbon sink capacity and light use efficiency at higher leaf area index and the harvest index did not decrease significantly however inadequate irrigation in the reproductive stage or severe deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and maturation stages significantly reduced the maize harvest index thus full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages were the optimal irrigation strategies for saving water reducing co2 emissions and ensuring a satisfactory maize yield keywords different irrigation treatments maize net ecosystem co2 exchange chamber yield 1 introduction in agricultural production people carry out

on crop yield and agricultural carbon emissions moinet et al 2017 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 determining the best method of reasonable irrigation to maintain yield and minimize negative climate impacts remains a challenge maize is a major crop that is widely planted in arid and semiarid regions around the world zhou et al 2019 it is one of the main food crops in inner mongolia qiao et al

agriculture accounts for the majority of agricultural crop production the successful growth and yield of maize mostly depend on supplemental irrigation during each growth stage especially in arid and semiarid areas that are generally restricted by stages of water shortage yang et al 2019 deficit irrigation is an effective water saving strategy that involves reducing the water consumed while

faloye et al 2019 and a reasonable irrigation regime could ensure satisfactory grain yield of maize kresović et al 2016 tilman et al 2011 reported that irrigation has harmful environmental impacts including increased emissions of greenhouse gases many scholars have studied the impact of irrigation on yield and co2 emissions but these studies are often carried out independently and there are few studies on water saving irrigation that consider yield and co2 emissions together hou et al 2020 studied the relationship between soil co2 emissions and maize yield under different irrigation treatments but more studies are needed on maize net ecosystem co2 exchange nee under different irrigation treatments the diurnal and seasonal variations in nee are important parameters to assess the capacity for maize ecosystems to be carbon sinks or sources zhang et al 2015 machado et al 2016 at present most of these estimates of diurnal and seasonal variations are based on the eddy covariance technique wagle et al 2018 wall et al 2020 however eddy covariance technique is a scale appropriate method that best applies to open habitats from hundreds of m2 to km2 pahari et al 2018 since the measurement scale of the eddy covariance technique is large it is not feasible for use in nee measurement at field scales especially when applying different irrigation treatments chamber methodologies provide measurements and direct evaluations of nee at the plot level barba et al 2018 however the traditional chamber method is based on manual measurements xi et al 2019 bah et al 2020 which limits the measurement of diurnal and seasonal nee data especially at night in this study we measured nighttime co2 fluxes of a maize ecosystem using an automated gas sampling chamber that we developed li et al 2020 and daytime co2 fluxes using a dynamic chamber our objectives were threefold 1 to quantify and compare diurnal and seasonal variations in the nee of maize at different growth stages under different irrigation treatments using the chamber method 2 to analyze the correlation between light response parameters and biological factors under different irrigation treatments and 3 to determine the optimal irrigation treatment for maize at different growth stages with the objectives of saving water reducing co2 emissions and ensuring yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted in a 1 13 ha maize field 40 26 0 29 n 109 36 25 99 e alt 1010 m located in ordos inner mongolia north china plain where rainfall is insufficient for the successful growth of maize crops the study area was divided into five fields of which f1 f2 f3 and f4 were selected as the research field fig 1 three sampling zones orange rectangles measuring 15 15 m2 within each field were demarcated for the data measurements fig 1 a mixture of soil samples taken at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm was used to estimate the soil characteristics the soil type was loamy sand 80 7 sand 13 7 powder and 5 6 clay using the united states department of agriculture soil taxonomy the soil ph was 9 27 and the organic matter and carbon content were 47 17 g kg 1 and 27 35 g kg 1 respectively maize was planted on junkai 918 may 11 2019 day of year doy 131 sowing depth was 5 cm row spacing was 50 cm and plant spacing was 30 cm plants emerged on may 21 doy 141 and were harvested on september 10 doy

amounts of 100 65 and 40 of maximum nonstressed crop evapotranspiration et respectively different irrigation treatments were applied to each field in the late vegetative reproductive and maturation stages e g a 40 treatment would target 40 of maximum et during the corresponding stage nonstressed crop evapotranspiration was estimated by the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration and single crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 the crop coefficients were 0 66 1 31 and 0 54 in the initial mid season and late season developmental stages alfalfa based respectively only one deficit irrigation treatment was set in the reproductive stage because the irrigation water requirements were greatest in this stage and water shortages in this stage will seriously affect the yield of maize cakir r 2004 ge et al 2012 these irrigation treatments could be used not only to study the response of co2 emissions and crop growth rate of maize in different growth stages to different irrigation treatments but also to study the effects of four irrigation treatments in four fields on maize yield and co2 emissions during the whole growth period maize plants were irrigated using a center pivot sprinkler system valmont industries inc omaha usa the irrigation amount was controlled by adjusting the walking speed of the sprinkler the coefficient of uniformity of the research field calculated by the modified formula of heermann and hein 1968 was 82 7 under a walking speed of 20 of the full speed and 88 3 under a walking speed of 40 of the full speed using r3000 sprinklers before the start of deficit irrigation on doy 184 all treatments f1 f4 received an equal amount of irrigation the purpose was to provide sufficient water in all treatments so that plants would emerge and grow as uniformly as possible before imposing the different levels of water deficit fertilization and other farmland management measure dates are presented in fig 2 three fertilization events with 533 kg ha 1 oridios urea each time were carried out by dissolving the fertilizer in water and spraying the fertilizer through the center pivot sprinkler system when carrying out fertilization management at doy 184 and 221 the center pivot sprinkler system first rotated at a uniform speed for complete spraying of the fertilizer and then the speed of the sprinkler irrigation system was adjusted to a different

acquisition interval of 30 min the automated weather station was used to obtain et 2 4 co2 flux measurement with chambers the chambers were constructed of transparent plexiglass 3 mm xt type 20070 light transmission 95 to measure co2 fluxes of soil and maize the dimensions of the chambers to measure soil co2 fluxes were 36 cm 36 cm 36 cm each chamber system to measure the co2 fluxes of maize consisted of three chambers with heights of 54 cm 110 cm and 110 cm the lengths and widths were all 54 cm 54 cm when the height of maize plants was short one chamber was sufficient to measure the co2 fluxes of maize two chambers were needed when the height of maize plants was taller one without a lid to cover the lower part and the other with a lid to cover the upper part fig 3a and b more detailed information on the chambers is given in li et al 2020 field measurements of co2 fluxes of maize and soil were conducted at least once every two weeks between july and september 2019 six gas sampling events were conducted on sunny days throughout the growth period and each event consisted of two sampling days fig 2 in each gas sampling event co2 fluxes were measured in three maize sample plots and three soil plots in each field maize sample plots of the six gas sampling events a total of n 72 were randomly collected when the maize plants emerged a frame or collar enclosing each maize sample plot was constructed one month before gas sampling was carried out in each sampling event the co2 fluxes of 12 maize sample plots from the four fields 3 maize sample plots in each field were measured at night we measured the co2 fluxes variation in maize sample plots fig 3a and soil plots fig 3c based on the static chamber method bah et al 2020 xi et al 2019 in our study co2 fluxes of maize were measured using an automated static chamber as previously described in li et al 2020 the measurements were made once every 2 h between 22 00 and 4 00 the process of each gas collection was as follows gas samples were automatically collected by the chamber s gas sampling device at 0 5 10 and 15 min after the chamber was closed after the four gas samples were collected the chamber opened automatically the gas collection process was carried out in cycles with an interval of 2 h the gas samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph gc 2010plus shimadzu kyoto japan co2 flux was determined using the following equation flessa et al 1998 1 f co 2 k co 2 273 t v a c t where f co 2 is the flux of co2 mg co2 m 2 h 1 k co 2 is the gas constant at 273 15 k 0 536 μg c μl 1 t is the

chamber over time ml l 1 h 1 in the daytime the same chamber used for measuring nighttime co2 fluxes was used but we used the dynamic chamber method to measure the daytime co2 fluxes of maize sample plots fig 3b and soil plots fig 3d in this method the chamber is connected to an infrared gas analyzer through flexible inlet and outlet pipes resulting in a closed circle structure with constant flow heinemeyer and mcnamara 2011 the change in chamber co2 concentration over time was assessed with a portable battery operated infrared gas analyzer li 820 li cor lincoln ne usa measurements were carried out in most cases within 3 5 min of placing the chamber on the frames lindner et al 2016 choi et al 2018 data were logged every 15s and co2 fluxes were calculated with a linear regression describing the time dependent change in co2 concentration within the chamber co2 fluxes were sequentially observed with a systematic rotation over all plots using manually operated closed gas exchange chambers modified from the description given by li et al 2008 by mounting frozen ice packs on the back side of the chamber the temperature during measurements was maintained within 1 c relative to the ambient temperature li et al 2008 otieno et al 2009 xue et al 2017 choi et al 2018 the measurements were made once every 2 h between 6 00 and 20 00 the velocity of the air stream in the chamber provided by the fans was less than 1 5 m s 1 along the chamber walls and still less in the center of the chamber 0 8 m s 1 2 5 calculate nee of maize cropland under the corresponding planting density

soil co2 fluxes and the square area with a length and width was 54 54 cm is the area covered by the chamber when measuring the maize ecosystem co2 fluxes the row and plant spacing of maize planting

were measured in each sampling zone on the gas sampling day 3 results 3 1 microclimate weather conditions during the growing season are summarized in fig 4 the daily average and maximum par fluctuations indicated frequent sunny conditions fig 4a the mean daily par during summer was approximately 900 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the growth period irrigation amounts were 114 mm for f1 83 4 mm for f2 73 7 mm for f3 and 61 2 mm for f4 fig 4b there were 10 rain events 129 2 mm precipitation in total and only one unusually heavy rain event 59 7 mm precipitation in total fig 4c the vwc10 increased rapidly with irrigation or rainfall and then gradually decreased vwc10 fluctuated between 3 8 and 20 m3 m 3 fig 4c in this study the vwc10 values of each field under different irrigation treatments at each gas sampling event are shown in table 2 the air temperature fluctuated constantly in july and then gradually declined starting in august and the maximum daily average air temperature was 24 8 c daily fluctuations in air humidity were between 60 and 95 fig 4d 3 2 daily and seasonal patterns of co2 fluxes under different irrigation treatments diurnal nee changes of maize in different irrigation treatment fields are shown in fig 5 the nee was mostly negative co2 uptake during the day and positive co2 emission at night the nee of the maize fields showed a single peak in the day and declined slowly at night the co2 uptake capacity first increased and reached a maximum at noon before decreasing fig 5 however when there was a severe water deficit in the reproductive and maturation stages f3 at doy 239 and 245 f4 at doy 246 the peak appeared earlier before noon after which the maize ecosystem gradually decreased in carbon uptake and became a carbon source nee 0 the maximum nee or co2 uptake appeared in f1 with full irrigation throughout the growth stage with a value of 22 51 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 at doy 222 the integrated nee values for the day night and the total of day and night in the four fields are shown in fig 6 nee in the four fields during the day was expressed as co2 uptake fig 6a and nee at night was expressed as co2 emissions fig 6b during the late vegetative stage in the first two sampling events all four fields were carbon sources but the full irrigation treatment in f1 had higher co2 emissions than the deficit irrigation treatments in f2 f3 and f4 fig 6c however when maize approached the reproductive stage in the third sampling event the phenomenon of full irrigation promoting co2 emissions and deficit irrigation inhibiting co2 emissions became weaker fig 6c during the reproductive stage the carbon sink capacity of maize under the full irrigation treatment in f1 f2 and f4 was stronger than that under moderate deficit irrigation in f3 fig 6c thus full irrigation during the reproductive stage was useful for increasing carbon sink capacity during the maturation stage there was no significant difference p 0 05 table 4 in total nee in the day and night neetotal between the full irrigation treatment in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation treatment in f2 fig 6c 3 3 relationships between light response parameters and biological factors daily variations in the light response parameters of maize in the four different irrigation treatments at different growth stages are shown in table 3 the r2 of the curve fitted by the rectangular hyperbola model was too small for the model to be applicable under severe water deficit conditions i e f3 at doy 245 f4 at doy 246 so it is not displayed in this table the seasonal patterns of these parameters were closely related to crop phenology although the irrigation amounts differed the variations in parameters were consistent for the four fields the parameters α β γ and β γ 2000 first increased and then decreased according to crop growth development and senescence the difference in α was not significant p 0 05 between f1 full irrigation in the whole growth period and f2 full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and maturation stages the relationship between daytime nee and par for the four fields is shown in fig 7 the light response curves of the four fields were almost identical in the first sampling events fig 7a all treatments f1 f4 received an equal amount of irrigation before the start of deficit irrigation at doy 184 thereafter there was a greater separation between the curves corresponding to the difference in deficit irrigation fig 7b f the degree of divergence of the four curves decreased during the reproductive stage fig 7d and e likely due to the small differences in irrigation amount during the maturation stage the f1 and f2 curves remained divergent indicating that deficit irrigation still influenced nee at this stage fig 7f the relationship between lai and α over the whole growth period of maize in f1 and f2 is shown in fig 8a the comparison between f1 and f2 revealed a consistent trend with a higher rate of increase in α in f2 than in f1 thus compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages had no obvious effect on α the relationships between agb and β γ 2000 in f1 and f2 are shown in fig 8b there was a polynomial relationship throughout the growing season linear relationships can be found during the early and peak growing seasons doy 186 doy 223 there was a negative correlation between the decrease in β γ 2000 and the increase in agb in the late growing season doy 238 doy 246 3 4 effects of different irrigation treatments on maize nee agb and yield in each gas sampling event the neetotal and agb are shown in table 4 because of the different irrigation treatments in the four fields the differences in nee among the four fields in each growth period was significant and similar to the differences in nee agb had the same pattern the average daily nee of each growth stage neeaverage and crop growth rate cgr are shown in table 5 during the late vegetative stage the neeaverage and cgr were the smallest under the severe deficit irrigation treatment in f4 neeaverage did not differ significantly p 0 05 between full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 and in f3 but f1 had the greatest cgr in this stage in the reproductive stage the change in irrigation treatment from deficit irrigation to full irrigation in f2 and f4 promoted a rapid increase in cgr compared with f1 there was no significant difference p 0 05 in cgr in the reproductive stage between full irrigation in all stages in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative stage and full irrigation during the reproductive stage in f2 during the maturation stage the difference in neeaverage and cgr between full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 was not significant p 0 05 the irrigation methods of f2 and f3 were the same except that in the reproductive stage f2 received full irrigation while f3 received moderate deficit irrigation because of the moderate deficit irrigation of f3 in the reproductive stage the neeaverage of f3 is greater than that of f2 and the cgr is less than that of f2 moreover among the four regions the neeaverage of f3 is the greatest and the cgr is the smallest when maize was harvested at doy 253 the agb values of f2 f3 and f4 were 10 12 42 53 and 26 58 less respectively than that of f1 1557 94 49 49 g m2 table 5 the maize yields of f2 f3 and f4 were 7 46 53 66 and 32 48 less respectively than that of f1 775 47 7 43 g m2 table 5 the harvest index hi relationships of the four fields were hif2 hif1 hif4 hif3 and the hi values for f1 f2 f3 and f4 were 0 50 0 51 0 41 and 0 46 respectively table 5 compared with f1 the irrigation amount of f2 in each period of the late vegetative and maturation stages decreased by 35 however the difference in hi between f1 and f2 was not significant p 0 05 table 5 the irrigation methods of f2 and f3 were the same except that in the reproductive stage f2 received full irrigation while f3 received moderate deficit irrigation therefore inadequate irrigation in the reproductive stage would significantly reduced the maize hi the irrigation methods of f2 and f4 were the same except that in the late vegetative and maturation stages f2 received moderate deficit irrigation while f3 received severe deficit irrigation therefore severe deficit irrigation in the late vegetative and maturation stages significantly reduced the maize hi thus full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages were the optimal irrigation strategies for saving water reducing co2 emissions and ensuring a satisfactory maize yield 4 discussion 4 1 diurnal and seasonal variations in nee under different irrigation treatments at present the nee of maize cropland is usually observed by the ec technique e g wagle et al 2018 however the ec method only measures the nee at the regional scale wagle et al 2017 and it is easily disturbed by the external environment such as human and animal respiration and vehicle emissions therefore it is necessary to observe the maize nee at the canopy scale chamber methods remain the sole approach for plot scale experimental agriculture and the observed data could represent the maize nee at the canopy scale barba et al 2018 increasing water use efficiency through deficit irrigation is the main method to resolve the shortage of water resources in arid areas wang et al 2019 there are too many researches on maize yield under different irrigation treatments at present e g ge et al 2012 kresović et al 2016 however it is scarcely considered maize co2 emissions and yield under different irrigation treatments and there are few studies on the nee of maize cropland based on the chamber method fang et al 2020 measured the nee of maize cropland using chambers however the row spacing and plant spacing of the maize were not considered so the results cannot represent the actual nee of maize cropland under this planting density therefore it is necessary to consider the row spacing and plant spacing when measuring the co2 exchange of a single crop with the chamber in our study we used the chamber method to observe the nee of maize cropland under different irrigation treatments to improve understanding of maize co2 exchange at the canopy scale in our study we found that a higher daytime maximum nee was usually observed in the field with higher vwc10 during the same growth stage and the maximum nee was higher during the reproductive stage fig 5 when there was a severe water deficit f3 at doy 245 f4 at doy 246 the co2 uptake by the maize canopy was stronger before noon the asymmetrical distribution of nee before noon was similar to the results from a previous study in a semiarid region wagle et al 2018 the midday depression in photosynthesis is a common survival strategy of plants in semiarid areas in response to high air temperature or water deficit chaves et al 2002 and can explain our observations that the field with severe water stress reaches the light saturation point and that the light saturation point tends to increase with the increase in vwc10 fig 5 in the late vegetative stage the maize ecosystem was mainly a carbon source table 4 neetotal 0 at doy 186 187 which may be due to the lower agb and lai of maize in this stage and beacause soil co2 emissions have a greater impact on maize ecosystems previous studies also show that young vegetation in cropland ecosystems shows limited carbon assimilation capacities zhang et al 2007 in the reproductive stage plants need more carbon for growth canopy development and grain filling wang et al 2015 which may explain our observation of a strong carbon sink neetotal 0 in this stage fig 6c during the maturation stage photosynthesis and respiration rates declined in senescent plants xi et al 2019 this may be the reason that there was no significant p 0 05 difference in neetotal between the maize with full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 treatments table 4 4 2 correlation and regression analyses of light response parameters with plant growth variables there is a strong linear relationship between lai and α fig 8a which is consistent with the work of lindner et al 2016 and who found that the values of α for both paddy and rainfed rice were linearly correlated with lai r2 0 93 and 0 94 respectively in our study α was lower in f2 than in f1 at a lower lai but f2 demonstrated higher α at a higher lai fig 8a biomass accumulation by crops depends on the efficiency of light and is used to produce dry matter plénet et al 2000 therefore the irrigation treatment of f2 was more advantageous than that of f1 in the period of higher lai a polynomial relationship was found between agb and β γ 2000 in the maize ecosystem throughout the growing season during the early and peak growing seasons at doy 186 223 agb and β γ 2000 were positively correlated fig 8b suggesting that an increase in agb enhances β γ 2000 in the early stage the growth of maize is mainly leaf and stem which promotes photosynthesis because it determines the photosynthetic surface area otieno et al 2009 however during the late growing season at doy 238 246 the β γ 2000 decreased to a low level compared to the peak of the growing season even with higher agb on the one hand the increase in maize agb was mainly due to the growth of fruit in the later stage although the contribution of fruit to photosynthesis is lower on the other hand as plants become senescent in the late growing season their growth and metabolism rates decline causing adecline in both photosynthesis and respiration rates xi et al 2019 4 3 effect of different irrigation treatments on maize nee agb and yield by studying the growth of maize under deficit irrigation eck 1984 showed that sufficient irrigation during vegetative growth is crucial to leaf area development and yield in our study the increasing irrigation promoted cgr in the late vegetative stage however we also found that co2 emissions also increased table 5 when irrigation was increased in this stage the reproductive stage is a critical period when crops such as maize grow most rapidly and water deficit during this stage reduces maize yield ge et al 2012 moreover wang et al 2015 reported that maize has a strong co2 uptake capacity based on observations using the ec method in our study we investigated the relationship among irrigation yield and co2 exchange of maize ecosystem and full irrigation in the reproductive stage can significantly improve the co2 uptake capacity and increase cgr table 5 shaw 1974 indicated that the effect on yield during the maturation stage is notably lower under water stress therefore we conducted different irrigation treatments in this period and the difference in co2 emissions and cgr between the full irrigation in f1 and moderate deficit irrigation in f2 treatments was not significant table 5 p 0 05 during this period for the overall irrigation treatments of each field the agb and yield of maize with full irrigation in f1 were relatively higher than those of maize with deficit irrigation in f2 f3 and f4 however compared with full irrigation throughout the growth period in f1 full irrigation during the reproductive stage and moderate deficit irrigation during the late vegetative and reproductive stages in f2 showed higher hi table 5 under water limited conditions crop yield is largely determined by the agb and hi thapa et al 2020 therefore when considering co2 emissions and hi the irrigation treatment in f2 was the best irrigation method however the yield of f2 was 717 58 14 63 g m 2 or 7 17 t ha 1 lower than the yields reported by wang et al 2018 of 8 04 12 98 t ha 1 on the north china plain and by agegnehu et al 2016 of 7 14 9 21 t ha 1 in australia however the maize yield of f2 was similar to or higher than those in other studies for example the maize yield was 6 13 t ha 1 on the loess plateau of china zhou et al 2009 and 2 57 6 35 t ha 1 in akure nigeria faloye et al 2019 therefore the irrigation treatment in f2 in our study was an optimal irrigation strategy for saving water reducing co2 emissions and maintaining satisfactory maize production when water was limited 5 conclusions this research aims to study the nee and yield of maize ecosystems under different irrigation treatments in semiarid inner mongolia in particular we explore whether deficit irrigation treatment could not only reduce co2 emissions but also ensure yield we found that moderate deficit irrigation can reduce co2 emissions which is interesting for fodder maize production in the late vegetative stage full irrigation can significantly improve the co2 uptake capacity and increase cgr in the reproductive stage the difference in co2 emissions and cgr between full irrigation and moderate deficit irrigation was not significant in the maturation stage our results demonstrated that reasonable deficit irrigation could improve the light use efficiency of maize canopy and could make maize ecosystems as a carbon sink throughout the growth period although the yield of the deficit irrigation treatment field was less than that of the full irrigation treatment field a reasonable deficit irrigation treatment can improve the hi of maize this study provides a reference point for future irrigation management decisions in agriculture in semiarid areas however the irrigation treatments in this study only considered three levels i e full irrigation moderate deficit irrigation and severe deficit irrigation with irrigation amounts of 100 65 40 of et respectively creating some limitations of this research more consideration of irrigation treatment levels is

10008,residues from the polyethylene pe film mulch pm in the south of china have caused severe soil pollution and reduction of crop yield biodegradable film mulch bm has been considered as a good alternative to pm for many crops but its suitability for winter planting potato solanum tuberosum l and the effects of its residues after incorporation on soil and succeeding crop have not been fully investigated we conducted a two year 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 field experiment to compare the effects of polylactic acid pla poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat based bm pm and no film mulch nm on dynamics of soil temperature and water storage water use efficiency wue and potato yield as well as the effects of their residues on rice yield and soil properties thereafter in 2020 the results showed that the soil temperature and soil water storage differed between treatments bm and pm in topsoil at later stages of potato growth due to the degradation of biodegradable film initiated at 60 days after sowing however there were no significant differences between treatments bm and pm on potato tuber yield and wue across two cropping seasons after harvest of rice the residual biodegradable films rbf were reduced to an extremely low level and did not cause yield loss of rice statistically as compared to the no residual film nrf treatment in addition rbfs could improve soil health regarding bulk density porosity and organic matter as compared to the residual pe film rpf treatment therefore we are confident that the pla pbat biodegradable film is a promising and sustainable option to replace pm in winter planting potato production keywords biodegradable and pe film mulch residual biodegradable and pe films soil water storage and temperature soil property crop yield 1 introduction plastic film mulching can effectively improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue through soil water retention soil temperature regulation and weed control thus this practice has been extensively used on many crops worldwide china introduced this practice from japan in 1978 and has become the largest user in the world daryanto et al 2017 consuming 60 of the total mulch used plastic film yang et al 2015 despite the advantages in crop production the residue from pe film mulch has caused increasingly environmental issues in china as farmers prefer to leave the residual plastic films on field or burn them sintim and flury 2017 it has been reported that the residual plastic films accumulated in soil up to 317 4 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 34 0 kg ha 1 across croplands in china zhang et al 2020a 2020b reduced soil pore connectivity and soil porosity have been observed when the accumulation of residual plastic films in soil reaches a certain level hodson et al 2017 nawaz et al 2017 thus interfering with soil structure and soil water movement jiang et al 2017 bläsing and amelung 2018 bai et al 2019 consequently crop root distribution is inhibited imposing negative effect on crop uptake of water and nutrients and subsequently limiting crop yields hu et al 2020 it has been reported that root growth is reduced by 35 9 when the amount of residual plastic films reaches 900 kg ha 1 zumilaiti et al 2017 liu et al 2014 reported that cotton yield is reduced by 15 along with delayed emerging time and weakened drought resistance when 200 kg ha 1 of residual plastic films are present in soil yield decreases of 11 13 in maize 9 10 in wheat 8 14 in rice and 5 5 9 in soybean are also observed when soil contains 58 5 kg ha 1 of residual plastic film du 2013 in addition residual plastic film is one of the major sources of terrestrial microplastics machado et al 2018 microplastics can be easily absorbed by organisms and subsequently transported through food webs due to their small particle size and extremely slow biodegradation process qi et al 2019a posing a potential threat to human health deng et al 2017 reported that microplastics accumulate in liver kidney and gut of mice after ingestion inducing alteration of oxidative stress energy and lipid metabolism and neurotoxic effect adsorption of large proteins to the surface of microplastics may lead to alteration of the immune system causing local inflammation powell et al 2007 these results raise concern of toxicity of microplastics towards human to mitigate the negative effect of pe film mulch biodegradable film mulch bm has been developed as a promising alternative biodegradable film can be produced from naturally polymers including starch cellulose and polyhydroxyalkanoates and synthetic polymers mainly aliphatic polyesters polylactic acid pla poly ε caprolactone pcl poly butylene succinate pbs and poly butylene succinate adipate pbsa as well as the aromatic co polyester poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat brodhagen et al 2015 in contrast to pe films biodegradable films can be incorporated into soil after use and completely catabolized by soil organisms to microbial biomass carbon dioxide co2 and water bandopadhyay et al 2018 thus imposing no adverse effect on environment crop or human theoretically a recent study evaluated the toxicity of pbat biodegradable films on allium cepa lactuca sativa and human cell line hepg2 c3a and the results showed that the soil does not induce damage to the tested organisms before and after degradation of pbat films souza et al 2020 global demand of plastic mulch is high and still increasing thus there is a growing market for bm to be a competitive alternative to pe film the most basic function of biodegradable film as mulch needs to be studied it has been reported that some biodegradable films show similar effects as pe film in the production of cotton wang et al 2019a oilseed rape gu et al 2017 strawberry costa et al 2014 and maize yin et al 2019 however the application of bm still has some limitations 1 the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and flexibility of biodegradable films need to be improved for better use during mechanized mulching practices 2 the degradation periods of biodegradable films need to be extended to meet the demand of crop growth 3 the costs of biodegradable films need to be reduced yan et al 2016 in order to promote the large scale application of biodegradable films studies need to be conducted on more crops in more typical areas to develop bm techniques potato solanum tuberosum l is the fourth largest food in the world and china is the largest potato producer worldwide yielding over 26 of the total production winter planting potato in the south of china is an important complement to potato supply during the off season of potato production due to the too low temperature and moisture in winter for potato growth in the main potato cultivation areas in the north of china thus potato is the main crop planted during winter season in guangdong province with planting area around 60 000 ha which accounts for almost 20 of the winter fallow fields to improve the production of winter planting potato plastic film mulch has been widely applied but barely recycled after use leading to severe white pollution in guangdong province china as application of bm has been proven to be a promising alternative to pm in many crops its suitability for winter planting potato needs to be fully investigated yang et al 2020 have evaluated a pbat based bm which performed similarly as pm on the yield of winter planting potato as a potential alternative however the low tensile strength and high melt index of pbat limit its processing property and practical application on mulch chen et al 2016 pla is a sustainable alternative to petrochemical derived products which can be produced on a mass scale from agricultural by products mainly the carbohydrate rich substances nampoothiri et al 2010 blend of pbat with pla significantly increases the tensile strength and decreases the melt index as compared to pbat chen et al 2016 making it a promising raw material for mulching film thus we conducted a two year 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 field experiment to compare the effects of pla pbat based bm pm and nm on dynamics of soil temperature and water storage water use efficiency wue and potato yield in addition although biodegradable films can be completely degraded bandopadhyay et al 2018 the residual biodegradable films rbfs will be still present in soil during the degradation process thus effects of accumulation of film residues from the two year mulching experiments on rice yield and soil properties were also evaluated the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal effect of biodegradable and pe film mulch on soil temperature soil moisture and the production of winter planting potato 2 evaluate the effects of rbfs on the yield of rice and soil health and 3 determine the suitability and sustainability of pla pbat based bm application as an alternative to pm on crop in the south of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experiment was performed in boluo huizhou city guangdong province where is the main cultivation area of winter planting potato in the south of china 114 2 e 23 7 n from 2018 to 2020 boluo huizhou city is the largest planting area of winter potato in guangdong province accounting for around 25 of the total planting area the study site has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1890 mm which mainly occurs from april to september an average annual temperature of 21 8 c and an average annual sunshine duration of 2023 h during the two cropping seasons from november 4th 2018 to march 3rd 2019 y1 and november 8th 2019 to march 7th 2020 y2 of winter planting potato the average air temperatures were 18 5 c and 17 8 c and total precipitations were 184 mm and 149 mm less than 10 of annual rainfall respectively supplementary fig 1 the soil at the study site is sandy loam with bulk density of 1 59 g cm 3 2 2 experimental design the mulching experiment was designed with three treatments 1 black biodegradable film mulch bm with a film thickness of 0 012 mm 2 black polyethylene pe film mulch pm with a film thickness of 0 008 mm and 3 no mulch nm the biodegradable film was made from pla pbat both biodegradable and pe film were produced by guangzhou sweet economic development co ltd guangdong china based on the mulching experiment the residual film experiment was also classified as three treatments 1 residual biodegradable film rbf 2 residual pe film rpf and 3 no residual film nrf 2 3 agronomic practices for mulching experiment each treatment had three replicates and each plot was 18 m in length and 2 m in width as described by yang et al 2020 shown in supplementary fig 2 field was ploughed with ridge 20 cm in depth and 70 cm in width and furrow 30 cm in width each plot contained two ridges and two furrows two rows of potato solanum tuberosum l cv favorita were seeded in the center of each ridge with interval of 0 2 m and row spacing of 0 3 m all of the agronomic managements were same as local winter planting potato fields fertilizers were applied evenly on the field before planting with n p k fertilizers 152 106 and 135 kg ha 1 respectively after sowing films 0 8 m in width were applied on the soil surface by machine each plot was tagged and remained same during the two years of experiment the irrigation schedule for potato was shown in supplementary data 1 pe films in soil were roughly collected by hand before planting of potato in 2019 whereas biodegradable film were tilled into soil for residual film experiment three months after harvest of potato in 2020 pe films in soil were roughly collected by hand whereas biodegradable film were incorporated into soil five samples of topsoil were randomly collected from each plot in the mulching experiment and moved to green house in institute of bioengineering guangdong academy of sciences guangzhou china for pot experiment thus each treatment in the residual film experiment had 15 replicates local rice cv ruanhuayou 1191 which is usually rotated with winter planting potato to reduce disease pests and weeds and is the staple food in guangdong province was used to evaluate the effects of residual films on crop yield and its components rice seeds were germinated and uniform seedlings were transplanted to 3 l pots one seedling per pot filled with soil from the mulching experiment rice was harvested at 130th day after seedlings were transplanted when the mature grains developed 2 4 potato growth and yield four months after seeding plants in each plot were harvested for yield potatoes were classified as 1 marketable tubers single tuber weight 70 g 2 small sized tubers single tuber weight 70 g and 3 green tubers 2 5 film degradation on the soil surface the degradation process of film was classified into five stages stage i film begins to lose integrity after induction period stage ii over 25 of cracks have the length of 2 2 5 cm stage iii large cracks with the length of 20 50 cm begin to appear and the number of cracks increases stage iv film breaks into small fragments and no larger film piece exists on the soil surface and stage v almost no residual film piece exists on the soil surface wang et al 2019a to evaluate the weight of residual films in the field a 1 m 1 m area of film was sampled washed thoroughly in an ultrasonic cleaner and air dried for weighing for the pot experiment residual films in each pot were collected washed dried and weighed 2 6 soil temperature soil temperatures were measured at soil depth of 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm in the middle of each ridge using geothermometers yuhuan zhituo technology co ltd zhejiang china for each cropping season soil temperatures were recorded at 8 00 12 00 16 00 and 20 00 on the day of vegetative growth stage 30 days after sowing das tuber bulking stage 90 das and harvest stage 120 das respectively a two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the differences between treatments at different soil depths as well as the interactions between factors on soil temperature li et al 2017 luo et al 2020 as shown in supplementary data 2 2 7 soil moisture gravimetric water content was determined by heating soil samples 105 taken at the depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 80 cm soil samples were collected at 0 30 60 90 120 das the influences of two different parameters soil depths and days on soil water storage sws were tested under different mulch treatments the influence of these parameters was estimated on various ranges soil depths 0 80 cm and days 0 120 das the model prediction was conducted by design expert v12 0 3 stat ease inc usa the quality of the fit of the model was judged by the coefficient of determination r2 and its statistical significance was determined by f test through anova the quality of fitted model was improved by model adequacy checking through lack of fit test the assumed model was sequentially built by step wise regression technique through backward selection criterion the model statistics and final equations for each treatment were recorded in supplementary data 3 a two way anova was also used to test the differences between treatments at different soil depths as well as the interactions between factors on soil water content supplementary data 2 2 8 evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue evapotranspiration was calculated by using the soil water balance method allen et al 2011 which is simple and sound in theory warrants accurate estimate of et as long as the water components can be accurately measured and does not require additional meteorological inputs except precipitation et i p s r d where i is the irrigation amount mm p is the precipitation mm r is the surface runoff mm d is the drainage below crop root zone mm and s is the change of soil water storage mm s was calculated as s s0 s1 where s0 and s1 are the water storage mm within the 0 80 cm root zone before sowing and after harvesting respectively r and d were assumed to be negligible thus et can be calculated as follows et i p s water use efficiency was calculated as potato yield divided by et over the cropping season wue y et where wue is water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y is the potato yield kg ha 1 and et is the evapotranspiration mm 2 9 soil properties after the residual film experiment ring samples 7 cm in diameter and 5 cm in depth were taken for analyses of soil properties the bulk density was measured using the dry mass of the sample and the ring volume klute and dinauer 1986 the porosity was estimated using the volume of water in a saturated sample divided by the total volume klute and dinauer 1986 ph and ec were measured in a 20 suspension w v of 2 mm sieved dry soil in demineralized water capka et al 2009 aggregate stability was determined using the wet sieving apparatus eijkelkamp netherlands with 4 g of 2 mm sieved soil and 2 g l of naoh almajmaie et

performed by using sas package sas institute inc u s a paired samples t test was used for comparisons of soil temperature soil water storage from different soil depths and days between two treatments tukey s hsd test was used for multiple comparisons between different treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 film degradation the degradation processes of biodegradable and pe films used for winter planting potato mulching were shown in table 1 the biodegradable films started to degrade stage i at around 60 das and had some small cracks stage ii at 90 das the cracks kept enlarging and the films reached stage iii at around 150 das in the study of evaluating different biodegradable film mulching in cotton field the pbsa pbat and starch films also started to lose integrity at 60 das but reached stage iii much earlier at 120 das wang et al 2019a the benefit of a relatively slower degradation process of our pla pbat films under the mulching condition is to decrease exposure of potato tubers to sunlight and thus reduce green tubers the biodegradable films were then broken into small fragments stage iv at 240 das and no larger film piece exists on the soil surface in contrast pe films remained intact until 90 das and were kept at stage i all along after harvest of potato from 120 das to 330 das it has been estimated that complete degradation of a 60 µm thin pe layer may take approximately 300 years ohtake et al 1998 after harvest of potato large amounts of rpfs were left in soil before manual collection measures were taken from 120 das to 330 das whereas the weight of rbfs was extremely reduced in 2019 fig 1a similarly in 2020 the weight of rbfs was significantly lower than that of rpfs after harvest of potato fig 1b the weight of rpf dramatically decreased before planting of rice due to the manual removal of pe films and maintained at approximate 30 kg ha 1 during the growing season of rice fig 1b a certain amount of rpfs will be still left in soil even with manual and or machine removal because the tensile strength of pe film after use was too week for intact collection previous studies showed that the weight of low density polyethylene ldpe buried in soil decreased by only 0 2 per year in a 10 year laboratory experiment albertsson et al 1987 thus decades use of pe film for mulch has resulted in an estimated accumulation up to 317 4 kg ha 1 in china zhang et al 2020a 2020b a meta analysis investigating the effect of residual films on maize wheat cotton and potato in china based on 266 publications revealed that residual plastics significantly decrease crop yield by 16 10 on average gao et al 2019 in contrast the weight of rbfs was reduced from 51 57 kg ha 1 to 4 98 kg ha 1 after growing of rice fig 1b however the complete degradation of biodegradable films in the soil would take a few years ammala et al 2011 this also suggests that long term field tests are needed in the future to validate the degradation rate of biodegradable films after used for several years 3 2 effects of bm and pm on soil temperature soil temperature and its spatial and temporal changes directly or indirectly affect the extent and direction of many processes occurring in soil including seed germination root elongation evaporation storage and movement of water and microbial activities nutrient cycle and many other dynamic processes of the soil shamshirband et al 2020 several methods have been developed to evaluate and predict soil temperature spatially and temporally faroughi et al 2020 kazemi et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 in our study we investigated the relative soil temperature at vegetative growth stage 30 das tuber bulking stage 90 das and harvest stage 120 das of potato in soil depth of 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm respectively fig 2a c both treatments bm and pm increased soil temperature in topsoil 0 20 cm in depth as compared to nm whereas the effect of mulching on temperature of soil under 30 cm appeared to be weak this is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2017 gu et al 2017 li et al 2017 that the thermal effect of film mulching on soil at 20 50 cm depths were very small paired t test on temperature from different soil depth between any two treatments during each cropping season showed no significant difference fig 2d thus topsoil temperature at three growth stages of potato was used to test again the results between two cropping seasons were similar fig 2 e g at vegetative growth stage topsoil temperature under treatments bm and pm showed no significant difference but was significantly higher than nm by 0 49 and 0 46 on average over two cropping seasons respectively fig 2a and e similarly at tuber bulking stage treatments bm and pm increased topsoil temperature by 0 99 and 0 97 on average respectively as compared to nm fig 2b mulch affects the temperature of the soil which in turn positively influences the growth of the crop especially in winter martí and mira 2020 a model developed for prediction of the interaction among the plastic film mulch potato canopy growth and soil thermal conditions showed that aboveground plant growth is closely related to temperature especially during the early plant growth stages zhang et al 2020a 2020b although the biodegradable films started to degrade at 60 das table 1 the low degradation level did not lead to significant difference of soil temperature between bm and pm fig 2f in contrast topsoil temperature under treatment bm was significantly reduced at harvest stage as compared to treatment pm fig 2c and g however a slightly lower soil temperature after the reproductive stage will not affect the growth and yield of crop weymann et al 2015 3 3 effects of bm and pm on soil water storage sws and evapotranspiration et simulation of profiles of soil water content for different stages of crop growth via predicted model can guide irrigation wu et al 2007 the three dimensional sws profiles regarding soil depths and days after sowing das for both cropping seasons and for three treatments were shown in fig 3a f the sws in topsoil under treatments pm and bm were similar before 60 das but higher than that under treatment nm while the sws in top soil after 60 das ranked as pm bm nm fig 3 a f supplementary fig 3 a f during both cropping seasons the higher sws under treatment pm than bm at late growth stages of potato was probably due to the degradation of the biodegradable film table 1 and the subsequent reduction of soil moisture conservation fan et al 2017 in contrast pe film remained intact until 90 das and were kept at stage i afterwards table 1 which is more effective on conserving soil water than treatment bm wang et al 2019a gu et al 2017 also reported that reduced soil water retention capacity under treatment bm is observed after degradation of biofilm at late growth stages of winter oilseed rape as compared to treatment pm during cropping season 2018 2019 the sws under the three treatments dropped to a similar level and then rose with the increase of soil depth at lower layer 30 80 cm while during cropping season 2018 2019 treatments pm and bm increased the sws as compared to treatment nm especially at the early growth stages of potato fig 3 a f supplementary fig 3 a f it has been reported that the mulching function was more considerable in the drier year wang et al 2019b which is consistent with our results as the precipitation during cropping season 2019 2020 was lower than that during cropping season 2018 2019 especially at the early growth stages of potato supplementary fig 1 the difference of sws between treatments bm and pm was not significant statistically during the whole growing season fig 3g the et consisting of precipitation irrigation and change of soil water storage s was shown in fig 4 the et under treatments bm and pm was significantly reduced by 17 3 mm and 22 1 mm on average over two cropping seasons respectively as compared to treatment nm as both of the precipitation and irrigation amounts were exactly equal among different treatments during each growing season the difference of et between treatments bm and pm was determined by sws fig 4a no significant difference of et was observed between treatments bm and pm fig 4 which was due to the fact that there was no significant difference of sws between treatments bm and pm fig 3g even though the biodegradable films started to degrade at 60 das table 1 wang et al 2019b reported that at early growth stages of cotton the consumption of water is mainly via soil evaporation while at late growth stages via cotton transpiration due to the development of crop canopies thus the degradation of biodegradable films at late growth stages of crop have limited effect on et as compared to treatment pm across the whole growth stages this conclusion is also supported by the study of yin et al 2019 that the full crop canopy reduces the soil evaporation and the increase of precipitation weakens the moisture conservation effect of film mulching at the later growth stages 3 4 effects of bm and pm on potato tuber yield and water use efficiency wue potato tubers were classified into marketable tubers small sized tubers and green tubers in general both treatments bm and pm increased number of marketable tubers and decreased number of small sized tubers and green tubers leading to reduced total tuber numbers under mulched treatments as compared to treatment nm table 2 previous studies also reported that tuber number could be reduced by plastic mulch wang et al 2009 hou et al 2010 due to the decrease of small size tubers qin et al 2014 accordingly yield of marketable tubers as well as total tubers were significantly increased and yield of small sized tubers were decreased under treatments bm and pm as compared to their respective treatment nm table 3 no significant difference was observed between treatments bm and pm in terms of marketable tuber yield and total tuber yields over two cropping seasons table 3 these results are consistent with the reported of yang et al 2020 that treatments bm and pm perform similarly on increasing potato yield as compared to treatment nm treatments bm and pm significantly improved wue as compared to treatment nm and there was no difference between treatments bm and pm in both cropping seasons fig 4 similar results have been reported in maize yin et al 2019 tomato moreno and moreno 2008 and winter rapeseed gu et al 2017 at early growth stages bm acts like pm by significantly reducing soil evaporation enhancing the retention of soil water and increasing topsoil temperature gu et al 2016 at later growth stages although the mulching function of biodegradable film was weakened due to degradation leading to lower soil temperature and sws as compared to pm figs 2 and 3 the effect on potato yield was slight tables 2 and 3 this is supported by weymann et al 2015 and wang et al 2019a that reduced soil temperature and sws at later growth stages don t affect the yield of crop 3 5 effects of residual films on rice yield before rice was planted pe films were manually removed whereas biodegradable films were incorporated into soil both ear number per plant and seed setting rate of rice showed no differences between treatments nrf and rbf but were significantly reduced by treatment rpf table 4 treatment rpf significantly increased the grain number per ear as compared to treatments nrf and rbf table 4 subsequently the rice yield was significantly reduced by treatment rpf as compared to treatments rbf and nrf table 4 du 2013 reported that rice yield decreased by 8 14 when soil contains 58 5 kg ha 1 of rpf in our case yield decrease was observed when approximate 30 kg ha 1 of rpfs was present in soil table 4 fig 1b although the weight of rbfs in soil was 51 57 kg ha 1 before planting of rice there was no significant difference of rice yield between treatments rbf and nrf table 4 this is due to the dramatic degradation of rbfs during the growing of rice as the weight of rbfs had been reduced to an extremely low level 4 98 kg ha 1 after harvest of rice fig 1b which is consistent with the observation that rbfs are scarce at 200 days after soil incorporation and have little effects on environment and crop moreno et al 2017 even though the complete degradation of rbfs in the soil might take a few years ammala et al 2011 3 6 effects of residual films on soil properties and enzyme activities in order to assess soil health sintim et al 2019 classified soil properties into different indicators here we specifically tested bulk density and aggregate stability as soil structure indicators porosity as hydraulic indicator organic matter and three extracellular enzyme activities as biological indicators ph as chemical indicator and electrical conductivity ec as salinity and sodicity indicator table 5 residual films had no effects on soil ec ph aggregate stability and activity of l leucine aminopeptidase lap as compared to treatment nrf however increased bulk density and reduced porosity were observed under treatment rpf as compared to treatments nrf and rbf it has been reported that accumulation of rpfs in soil reduces soil pore connectivity and soil porosity hodson et al 2017 nawaz et al 2017 wan et al 2019 thus interfering with soil structure and soil water movement bläsing and amelung 2018 bai et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 also demonstrated that rpfs change soil water content bulk density and porosity and alter soil water distribution involved with plant roots soil organic matter was significantly increased by treatment rbf as compared to treatments nrf and rpf rbfs are an input of carbon although the amount is small when taking into account the volume of soil into which they are incorporated bandopadhyay et al 2018 both treatments rbf and rpf significantly increased the activities of β glucosidase bg and β 1 4 n acetylglucosaminidase nag two nutrient cycling related enzymes it has been reported that increased residual films elevate soil nitrogen level lower the c n ratio and decrease microbial biomass c and n levels significantly koskei et al 2021 these results indicate that residual films affect the nutrient cycling of soil 3 7 potential of bm as an alternative to pm to evaluate bm as a competitive alternative to pm sintim and flury 2017 proposed the following standards 1 maintain a conducive microclimate for plant growth 2 be flexible to allow mechanical installation 3 remain intact during the majority of the cropping season 4 undergo complete degradation after soil incorporation or composting 5 have no adverse impact on the environment and 6 be economical in our study the pla pbat biodegradable films were applied on soil surface by machine although the biodegradable films started to degraded during the cropping season the differences of thermal and moisture effects on soil between treatments bm and pm at later stages of potato growth figs 2 and 3 did not affect the potato tuber yield and wue tables 2 and 3 fig 4 after incorporated into soil rbfs were almost degraded thoroughly fig 1 and did not cause yield loss of rice statistically as compared to treatment nrf table 4 in addition rbfs could improve soil health as compared to rpfs table 5 so far the high costs of biodegradable films have been the main constraint to the large scale application of bm xue et al 2017 as it is urgent to reduce plastic pollution in soil the compensation policy by government and the enhancement of knowledge of ecological value in farmers is the key to promote the use of bm wang et al 2020 4 conclusion the pla pbat biodegradable films started to degrade during the growing season of winter planting potato which led to the differences of thermal and moisture effects on soil between treatments bm and pm at later stages of potato growth however the potato tuber yield and wue under treatment bm were not significantly altered as compared to treatment pm the rbfs were reduced to an extremely low level after harvest of rice and increased rice yield as compared to treatment rpf in addition the treatment rbf improved soil health regarding bulk density porosity and organic matter of soil as compared to treatment rpf thus we are confident that the pla pbat biodegradable film is a promising and sustainable option to replace pm in the south of china as this is only a two year study we also suggest continued efforts to test the effects of long term use of biodegradable film mulch and accumulation of their residues

10008,residues from the polyethylene pe film mulch pm in the south of china have caused severe soil pollution and reduction of crop yield biodegradable film mulch bm has been considered as a good alternative to pm for many crops but its suitability for winter planting potato solanum tuberosum l and the effects of its residues after incorporation on soil and succeeding crop have not been fully investigated we conducted a two year 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 field experiment to compare the effects of polylactic acid pla poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat based bm pm and no film mulch nm on dynamics of soil temperature and water storage water use efficiency wue and potato yield as well as the effects of their residues on rice yield and soil properties thereafter in 2020 the results showed that the soil temperature and soil water storage differed between treatments bm and pm in topsoil at later stages of potato growth due to the degradation of biodegradable film initiated at 60 days after sowing however there were no significant differences between treatments bm and pm on potato tuber yield and wue across two cropping seasons after harvest of rice the residual biodegradable films rbf were reduced to an extremely low level and did not cause yield loss of rice statistically as compared to the no residual film nrf treatment in addition rbfs could improve soil health regarding bulk density porosity and organic matter as compared to the residual pe film rpf treatment therefore we are confident that the pla pbat biodegradable film is a promising and sustainable option to replace pm in winter planting potato production keywords biodegradable and pe film mulch residual biodegradable and pe films soil water storage and temperature soil property crop yield 1 introduction plastic film mulching can effectively improve crop yield and water use efficiency wue through soil water retention soil temperature regulation and weed control thus this practice has been extensively used on many crops worldwide china introduced this practice from japan in 1978 and has become the largest user in the world daryanto et al 2017 consuming 60 of the total mulch used plastic film yang et al 2015 despite the advantages in crop production the residue from pe film mulch has caused increasingly environmental issues in china as farmers prefer to leave the residual plastic films on field or burn them sintim and flury 2017 it has been reported that the residual plastic films accumulated in soil up to 317 4 kg ha 1 with a mean value of 34 0 kg ha 1 across croplands in china zhang et al 2020a 2020b reduced soil pore connectivity and soil porosity have been observed when the accumulation of residual plastic films in soil reaches a certain level hodson et al 2017 nawaz et al 2017 thus interfering with soil structure and soil water movement jiang et al 2017 bläsing and amelung 2018 bai et al 2019 consequently crop root distribution is inhibited imposing negative effect on crop uptake of water and nutrients and subsequently limiting crop yields hu et al 2020 it has been reported that root growth is reduced by 35 9 when the amount of residual plastic films reaches 900 kg ha 1 zumilaiti et al 2017 liu et al 2014 reported that cotton yield is reduced by 15 along with delayed emerging time and weakened drought resistance when 200 kg ha 1 of residual plastic films are present in soil yield decreases of 11 13 in maize 9 10 in wheat 8 14 in rice and 5 5 9 in soybean are also observed when soil contains 58 5 kg ha 1 of residual plastic film du 2013 in addition residual plastic film is one of the major sources of terrestrial microplastics machado et al 2018 microplastics can be easily absorbed by organisms and subsequently transported through food webs due to their small particle size and extremely slow biodegradation process qi et al 2019a posing a potential threat to human health deng et al 2017 reported that microplastics accumulate in liver kidney and gut of mice after ingestion inducing alteration of oxidative stress energy and lipid metabolism and neurotoxic effect adsorption of large proteins to the surface of microplastics may lead to alteration of the immune system causing local inflammation powell et al 2007 these results raise concern of toxicity of microplastics towards human to mitigate the negative effect of pe film mulch biodegradable film mulch bm has been developed as a promising alternative biodegradable film can be produced from naturally polymers including starch cellulose and polyhydroxyalkanoates and synthetic polymers mainly aliphatic polyesters polylactic acid pla poly ε caprolactone pcl poly butylene succinate pbs and poly butylene succinate adipate pbsa as well as the aromatic co polyester poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat brodhagen et al 2015 in contrast to pe films biodegradable films can be incorporated into soil after use and completely catabolized by soil organisms to microbial biomass carbon dioxide co2 and water bandopadhyay et al 2018 thus imposing no adverse effect on environment crop or human theoretically a recent study evaluated the toxicity of pbat biodegradable films on allium cepa lactuca sativa and human cell line hepg2 c3a and the results showed that the soil does not induce damage to the tested organisms before and after degradation of pbat films souza et al 2020 global demand of plastic mulch is high and still increasing thus there is a growing market for bm to be a competitive alternative to pe film the most basic function of biodegradable film as mulch needs to be studied it has been reported that some biodegradable films show similar effects as pe film in the production of cotton wang et al 2019a oilseed rape gu et al 2017 strawberry costa et al 2014 and maize yin et al 2019 however the application of bm still has some limitations 1 the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and flexibility of biodegradable films need to be improved for better use during mechanized mulching practices 2 the degradation periods of biodegradable films need to be extended to meet the demand of crop growth 3 the costs of biodegradable films need to be reduced yan et al 2016 in order to promote the large scale application of biodegradable films studies need to be conducted on more crops in more typical areas to develop bm techniques potato solanum tuberosum l is the fourth largest food in the world and china is the largest potato producer worldwide yielding over 26 of the total production winter planting potato in the south of china is an important complement to potato supply during the off season of potato production due to the too low temperature and moisture in winter for potato growth in the main potato cultivation areas in the north of china thus potato is the main crop planted during winter season in guangdong province with planting area around 60 000 ha which accounts for almost 20 of the winter fallow fields to improve the production of winter planting potato plastic film mulch has been widely applied but barely recycled after use leading to severe white pollution in guangdong province china as application of bm has been proven to be a promising alternative to pm in many crops its suitability for winter planting potato needs to be fully investigated yang et al 2020 have evaluated a pbat based bm which performed similarly as pm on the yield of winter planting potato as a potential alternative however the low tensile strength and high melt index of pbat limit its processing property and practical application on mulch chen et al 2016 pla is a sustainable alternative to petrochemical derived products which can be produced on a mass scale from agricultural by products mainly the carbohydrate rich substances nampoothiri et al 2010 blend of pbat with pla significantly increases the tensile strength and decreases the melt index as compared to pbat chen et al 2016 making it a promising raw material for mulching film thus we conducted a two year 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 field experiment to compare the effects of pla pbat based bm pm and nm on dynamics of soil temperature and water storage water use efficiency wue and potato yield in addition although biodegradable films can be completely degraded bandopadhyay et al 2018 the residual biodegradable films rbfs will be still present in soil during the degradation process thus effects of accumulation of film residues from the two year mulching experiments on rice yield and soil properties were also evaluated the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial and temporal effect of biodegradable and pe film mulch on soil temperature soil moisture and the production of winter planting potato 2 evaluate the effects of rbfs on the yield of rice and soil health and 3 determine the suitability and sustainability of pla pbat based bm application as an alternative to pm on crop in the south of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description experiment was performed in boluo huizhou city guangdong province where is the main cultivation area of winter planting potato in the south of china 114 2 e 23 7 n from 2018 to 2020 boluo huizhou city is the largest planting area of winter potato in guangdong province accounting for around 25 of the total planting area the study site has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1890 mm which mainly occurs from april to september an average annual temperature of 21 8 c and an average annual sunshine duration of 2023 h during the two cropping seasons from november 4th 2018 to march 3rd 2019 y1 and november 8th 2019 to march 7th 2020 y2 of winter planting potato the average air temperatures were 18 5 c and 17 8 c and total precipitations were 184 mm and 149 mm less than 10 of annual rainfall respectively supplementary fig 1 the soil at the study site is sandy loam with bulk density of 1 59 g cm 3 2 2 experimental design the mulching experiment was designed with three treatments 1 black biodegradable film mulch bm with a film thickness of 0 012 mm 2 black polyethylene pe film mulch pm with a film thickness of 0 008 mm and 3 no mulch nm the biodegradable film was made from pla pbat both biodegradable and pe film were produced by guangzhou sweet economic development co ltd guangdong china based on the mulching experiment the residual film experiment was also classified as three treatments 1 residual biodegradable film rbf 2 residual pe film rpf and 3 no residual film nrf 2 3 agronomic practices for mulching experiment each treatment had three replicates and each plot was 18 m in length and 2 m in width as described by yang et al 2020 shown in supplementary fig 2 field was ploughed with ridge 20 cm in depth and 70 cm in width and furrow 30 cm in width each plot contained two ridges and two furrows two rows of potato solanum tuberosum l cv favorita were seeded in the center of each ridge with interval of 0 2 m and row spacing of 0 3 m all of the agronomic managements were same as local winter planting potato fields fertilizers were applied evenly on the field before planting with n p k fertilizers 152 106 and 135 kg ha 1 respectively after sowing films 0 8 m in width were applied on the soil surface by machine each plot was tagged and remained same during the two years of experiment the irrigation schedule for potato was shown in supplementary data 1 pe films in soil were roughly collected by hand before planting of potato in 2019 whereas biodegradable film were tilled into soil for residual film experiment three months after harvest of potato in 2020 pe films in soil were roughly collected by hand whereas biodegradable film were incorporated into soil five samples of topsoil were randomly collected from each plot in the mulching experiment and moved to green house in institute of bioengineering guangdong academy of sciences guangzhou china for pot experiment thus each treatment in the residual film experiment had 15 replicates local rice cv ruanhuayou 1191 which is usually rotated with winter planting potato to reduce disease pests and weeds and is the staple food in guangdong province was used to evaluate the effects of residual films on crop yield and its components rice seeds were germinated and uniform seedlings were transplanted to 3 l pots one seedling per pot filled with soil from the mulching experiment rice was harvested at 130th day after seedlings were transplanted when the mature grains developed 2 4 potato growth and yield four months after seeding plants in each plot were harvested for yield potatoes were classified as 1 marketable tubers single tuber weight 70 g 2 small sized tubers single tuber weight 70 g and 3 green tubers 2 5 film degradation on the soil surface the degradation process of film was classified into five stages stage i film begins to lose integrity after induction period stage ii over 25 of cracks have the length of 2 2 5 cm stage iii large cracks with the length of 20 50 cm begin to appear and the number of cracks increases stage iv film breaks into small fragments and no larger film piece exists on the soil surface and stage v almost no residual film piece exists on the soil surface wang et al 2019a to evaluate the weight of residual films in the field a 1 m 1 m area of film was sampled washed thoroughly in an ultrasonic cleaner and air dried for weighing for the pot experiment residual films in each pot were collected washed dried and weighed 2 6 soil temperature soil temperatures were measured at soil depth of 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm in the middle of each ridge using geothermometers yuhuan zhituo technology co ltd zhejiang china for each cropping season soil temperatures were recorded at 8 00 12 00 16 00 and 20 00 on the day of vegetative growth stage 30 days after sowing das tuber bulking stage 90 das and harvest stage 120 das respectively a two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the differences between treatments at different soil depths as well as the interactions between factors on soil temperature li et al 2017 luo et al 2020 as shown in supplementary data 2 2 7 soil moisture gravimetric water content was determined by heating soil samples 105 taken at the depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 70 80 cm soil samples were collected at 0 30 60 90 120 das the influences of two different parameters soil depths and days on soil water storage sws were tested under different mulch treatments the influence of these parameters was estimated on various ranges soil depths 0 80 cm and days 0 120 das the model prediction was conducted by design expert v12 0 3 stat ease inc usa the quality of the fit of the model was judged by the coefficient of determination r2 and its statistical significance was determined by f test through anova the quality of fitted model was improved by model adequacy checking through lack of fit test the assumed model was sequentially built by step wise regression technique through backward selection criterion the model statistics and final equations for each treatment were recorded in supplementary data 3 a two way anova was also used to test the differences between treatments at different soil depths as well as the interactions between factors on soil water content supplementary data 2 2 8 evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue evapotranspiration was calculated by using the soil water balance method allen et al 2011 which is simple and sound in theory warrants accurate estimate of et as long as the water components can be accurately measured and does not require additional meteorological inputs except precipitation et i p s r d where i is the irrigation amount mm p is the precipitation mm r is the surface runoff mm d is the drainage below crop root zone mm and s is the change of soil water storage mm s was calculated as s s0 s1 where s0 and s1 are the water storage mm within the 0 80 cm root zone before sowing and after harvesting respectively r and d were assumed to be negligible thus et can be calculated as follows et i p s water use efficiency was calculated as potato yield divided by et over the cropping season wue y et where wue is water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y is the potato yield kg ha 1 and et is the evapotranspiration mm 2 9 soil properties after the residual film experiment ring samples 7 cm in diameter and 5 cm in depth were taken for analyses of soil properties the bulk density was measured using the dry mass of the sample and the ring volume klute and dinauer 1986 the porosity was estimated using the volume of water in a saturated sample divided by the total volume klute and dinauer 1986 ph and ec were measured in a 20 suspension w v of 2 mm sieved dry soil in demineralized water capka et al 2009 aggregate stability was determined using the wet sieving apparatus eijkelkamp netherlands with 4 g of 2 mm sieved soil and 2 g l of naoh almajmaie et al 2017 soil organic matter was measured using k2cr2o7 oxidation reduction titration method nelson and sommers 1982 2 10 soil extracellular enzyme activities the activities of soil extracellular enzymes involved in c cycling β glucosidase bg n cycling l leucine aminopeptidase lap and c n cycling β 1 4 n acetylglucosaminidase nag were measured using microplate assay and fluorogenic substrates qi et al 2016 fluorescence was determined at 365 nm excitation and 450 nm emission by eliasa infinite 200 pro tecan mannedorf switzerland 2 11 statistical analysis analyses of variance anova were performed by using sas package sas institute inc u s a paired samples t test was used for comparisons of soil temperature soil water storage from different soil depths and days between two treatments tukey s hsd test was used for multiple comparisons between different treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 film degradation the degradation processes of biodegradable and pe films used for winter planting potato mulching were shown in table 1 the biodegradable films started to degrade stage i at around 60 das and had some small cracks stage ii at 90 das the cracks kept enlarging and the films reached stage iii at around 150 das in the study of evaluating different biodegradable film mulching in cotton field the pbsa pbat and starch films also started to lose integrity at 60 das but reached stage iii much earlier at 120 das wang et al 2019a the benefit of a relatively slower degradation process of our pla pbat films under the mulching condition is to decrease exposure of potato tubers to sunlight and thus reduce green tubers the biodegradable films were then broken into small fragments stage iv at 240 das and no larger film piece exists on the soil surface in contrast pe films remained intact until 90 das and were kept at stage i all along after harvest of potato from 120 das to 330 das it has been estimated that complete degradation of a 60 µm thin pe layer may take approximately 300 years ohtake et al 1998 after harvest of potato large amounts of rpfs were left in soil before manual collection measures were taken from 120 das to 330 das whereas the weight of rbfs was extremely reduced in 2019 fig 1a similarly in 2020 the weight of rbfs was significantly lower than that of rpfs after harvest of potato fig 1b the weight of rpf dramatically decreased before planting of rice due to the manual removal of pe films and maintained at approximate 30 kg ha 1 during the growing season of rice fig 1b a certain amount of rpfs will be still left in soil even with manual and or machine removal because the tensile strength of pe film after use was too week for intact collection previous studies showed that the weight of low density polyethylene ldpe buried in soil decreased by only 0 2 per year in a 10 year laboratory experiment albertsson et al 1987 thus decades use of pe film for mulch has resulted in an estimated accumulation up to 317 4 kg ha 1 in china zhang et al 2020a 2020b a meta analysis investigating the effect of residual films on maize wheat cotton and potato in china based on 266 publications revealed that residual plastics significantly decrease crop yield by 16 10 on average gao et al 2019 in contrast the weight of rbfs was reduced from 51 57 kg ha 1 to 4 98 kg ha 1 after growing of rice fig 1b however the complete degradation of biodegradable films in the soil would take a few years ammala et al 2011 this also suggests that long term field tests are needed in the future to validate the degradation rate of biodegradable films after used for several years 3 2 effects of bm and pm on soil temperature soil temperature and its spatial and temporal changes directly or indirectly affect the extent and direction of many processes occurring in soil including seed germination root elongation evaporation storage and movement of water and microbial activities nutrient cycle and many other dynamic processes of the soil shamshirband et al 2020 several methods have been developed to evaluate and predict soil temperature spatially and temporally faroughi et al 2020 kazemi et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 in our study we investigated the relative soil temperature at vegetative growth stage 30 das tuber bulking stage 90 das and harvest stage 120 das of potato in soil depth of 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm respectively fig 2a c both treatments bm and pm increased soil temperature in topsoil 0 20 cm in depth as compared to nm whereas the effect of mulching on temperature of soil under 30 cm appeared to be weak this is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2017 gu et al 2017 li et al 2017 that the thermal effect of film mulching on soil at 20 50 cm depths were very small paired t test on temperature from different soil depth between any two treatments during each cropping season showed no significant difference fig 2d thus topsoil temperature at three growth stages of potato was used to test again the results between two cropping seasons were similar fig 2 e g at vegetative growth stage topsoil temperature under treatments bm and pm showed no significant difference but was significantly higher than nm by 0 49 and 0 46 on average over two cropping seasons respectively fig 2a and e similarly at tuber bulking stage treatments bm and pm increased topsoil temperature by 0 99 and 0 97 on average respectively as compared to nm fig 2b mulch affects the temperature of the soil which in turn positively influences the growth of the crop especially in winter martí and mira 2020 a model developed for prediction of the interaction among the plastic film mulch potato canopy growth and soil thermal conditions showed that aboveground plant growth is closely related to temperature especially during the early plant growth stages zhang et al 2020a 2020b although the biodegradable films started to degrade at 60 das table 1 the low degradation level did not lead to significant difference of soil temperature between bm and pm fig 2f in contrast topsoil temperature under treatment bm was significantly reduced at harvest stage as compared to treatment pm fig 2c and g however a slightly lower soil temperature after the reproductive stage will not affect the growth and yield of crop weymann et al 2015 3 3 effects of bm and pm on soil water storage sws and evapotranspiration et simulation of profiles of soil water content for different stages of crop growth via predicted model can guide irrigation wu et al 2007 the three dimensional sws profiles regarding soil depths and days after sowing das for both cropping seasons and for three treatments were shown in fig 3a f the sws in topsoil under treatments pm and bm were similar before 60 das but higher than that under treatment nm while the sws in top soil after 60 das ranked as pm bm nm fig 3 a f supplementary fig 3 a f during both cropping seasons the higher sws under treatment pm than bm at late growth stages of potato was probably due to the degradation of the biodegradable film table 1 and the subsequent reduction of soil moisture conservation fan et al 2017 in contrast pe film remained intact until 90 das and were kept at stage i afterwards table 1 which is more effective on conserving soil water than treatment bm wang et al 2019a gu et al 2017 also reported that reduced soil water retention capacity under treatment bm is observed after degradation of biofilm at late growth stages of winter oilseed rape as compared to treatment pm during cropping season 2018 2019 the sws under the three treatments dropped to a similar level and then rose with the increase of soil depth at lower layer 30 80 cm while during cropping season 2018 2019 treatments pm and bm increased the sws as compared to treatment nm especially at the early growth stages of potato fig 3 a f supplementary fig 3 a f it has been reported that the mulching function was more considerable in the drier year wang et al 2019b which is consistent with our results as the precipitation during cropping season 2019 2020 was lower than that during cropping season 2018 2019 especially at the early growth stages of potato supplementary fig 1 the difference of sws between treatments bm and pm was not significant statistically during the whole growing season fig 3g the et consisting of precipitation irrigation and change of soil water storage s was shown in fig 4 the et under treatments bm and pm was significantly reduced by 17 3 mm and 22 1 mm on average over two cropping seasons respectively as compared to treatment nm as both of the precipitation and irrigation amounts were exactly equal among different treatments during each growing season the difference of et between treatments bm and pm was determined by sws fig 4a no significant difference of et was observed between treatments bm and pm fig 4 which was due to the fact that there was no significant difference of sws between treatments bm and pm fig 3g even though the biodegradable films started to degrade at 60 das table 1 wang et al 2019b reported that at early growth stages of cotton the consumption of water is mainly via soil evaporation while at late growth stages via cotton transpiration due to the development of crop canopies thus the degradation of biodegradable films at late growth stages of crop have limited effect on et as compared to treatment pm across the whole growth stages this conclusion is also supported by the study of yin et al 2019 that the full crop canopy reduces the soil evaporation and the increase of precipitation weakens the moisture conservation effect of film mulching at the later growth stages 3 4 effects of bm and pm on potato tuber yield and water use efficiency wue potato tubers were classified into marketable tubers small sized tubers and green tubers in general both treatments bm and pm increased number of marketable tubers and decreased number of small sized tubers and green tubers leading to reduced total tuber numbers under mulched treatments as compared to treatment nm table 2 previous studies also reported that tuber number could be reduced by plastic mulch wang et al 2009 hou et al 2010 due to the decrease of small size tubers qin et al 2014 accordingly yield of marketable tubers as well as total tubers were significantly increased and yield of small sized tubers were decreased under treatments bm and pm as compared to their respective treatment nm table 3 no significant difference was observed between treatments bm and pm in terms of marketable tuber yield and total tuber yields over two cropping seasons table 3 these results are consistent with the reported of yang et al 2020 that treatments bm and pm perform similarly on increasing potato yield as compared to treatment nm treatments bm and pm significantly improved wue as compared to treatment nm and there was no difference between treatments bm and pm in both cropping seasons fig 4 similar results have been reported in maize yin et al 2019 tomato moreno and moreno 2008 and winter rapeseed gu et al 2017 at early growth stages bm acts like pm by significantly reducing soil evaporation enhancing the retention of soil water and increasing topsoil temperature gu et al 2016 at later growth stages although the mulching function of biodegradable film was weakened due to degradation leading to lower soil temperature and sws as compared to pm figs 2 and 3 the effect on potato yield was slight tables 2 and 3 this is supported by weymann et al 2015 and wang et al 2019a that reduced soil temperature and sws at later growth stages don t affect the yield of crop 3 5 effects of residual films on rice yield before rice was planted pe films were manually removed whereas biodegradable films were incorporated into soil both ear number per plant and seed setting rate of rice showed no differences between treatments nrf and rbf but were significantly reduced by treatment rpf table 4 treatment rpf significantly increased the grain number per ear as compared to treatments nrf and rbf table 4 subsequently the rice yield was significantly reduced by treatment rpf as compared to treatments rbf and nrf table 4 du 2013 reported that rice yield decreased by 8 14 when soil contains 58 5 kg ha 1 of rpf in our case yield decrease was observed when approximate 30 kg ha 1 of rpfs was present in soil table 4 fig 1b although the weight of rbfs in soil was 51 57 kg ha 1 before planting of rice there was no significant difference of rice yield between treatments rbf and nrf table 4 this is due to the dramatic degradation of rbfs during the growing of rice as the weight of rbfs had been reduced to an extremely low level 4 98 kg ha 1 after harvest of rice fig 1b which is consistent with the observation that rbfs are scarce at 200 days after soil incorporation and have little effects on environment and crop moreno et al 2017 even though the complete degradation of rbfs in the soil might take a few years ammala et al 2011 3 6 effects of residual films on soil properties and enzyme activities in order to assess soil health sintim et al 2019 classified soil properties into different indicators here we specifically tested bulk density and aggregate stability as soil structure indicators porosity as hydraulic indicator organic matter and three extracellular enzyme activities as biological indicators ph as chemical indicator and electrical conductivity ec as salinity and sodicity indicator table 5 residual films had no effects on soil ec ph aggregate stability and activity of l leucine aminopeptidase lap as compared to treatment nrf however increased bulk density and reduced porosity were observed under treatment rpf as compared to treatments nrf and rbf it has been reported that accumulation of rpfs in soil reduces soil pore connectivity and soil porosity hodson et al 2017 nawaz et al 2017 wan et al 2019 thus interfering with soil structure and soil water movement bläsing and amelung 2018 bai et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 also demonstrated that rpfs change soil water content bulk density and porosity and alter soil water distribution involved with plant roots soil organic matter was significantly increased by treatment rbf as compared to treatments nrf and rpf rbfs are an input of carbon although the amount is small when taking into account the volume of soil into which they are incorporated bandopadhyay et al 2018 both treatments rbf and rpf significantly increased the activities of β glucosidase bg and β 1 4 n acetylglucosaminidase nag two nutrient cycling related enzymes it has been reported that increased residual films elevate soil nitrogen level lower the c n ratio and decrease microbial biomass c and n levels significantly koskei et al 2021 these results indicate that residual films affect the nutrient cycling of soil 3 7 potential of bm as an alternative to pm to evaluate bm as a competitive alternative to pm sintim and flury 2017 proposed the following standards 1 maintain a conducive microclimate for plant growth 2 be flexible to allow mechanical installation 3 remain intact during the majority of the cropping season 4 undergo complete degradation after soil incorporation or composting 5 have no adverse impact on the environment and 6 be economical in our study the pla pbat biodegradable films were applied on soil surface by machine although the biodegradable films started to degraded during the cropping season the differences of thermal and moisture effects on soil between treatments bm and pm at later stages of potato growth figs 2 and 3 did not affect the potato tuber yield and wue tables 2 and 3 fig 4 after incorporated into soil rbfs were almost degraded thoroughly fig 1 and did not cause yield loss of rice statistically as compared to treatment nrf table 4 in addition rbfs could improve soil health as compared to rpfs table 5 so far the high costs of biodegradable films have been the main constraint to the large scale application of bm xue et al 2017 as it is urgent to reduce plastic pollution in soil the compensation policy by government and the enhancement of knowledge of ecological value in farmers is the key to promote the use of bm wang et al 2020 4 conclusion the pla pbat biodegradable films started to degrade during the growing season of winter planting potato which led to the differences of thermal and moisture effects on soil between treatments bm and pm at later stages of potato growth however the potato tuber yield and wue under treatment bm were not significantly altered as compared to treatment pm the rbfs were reduced to an extremely low level after harvest of rice and increased rice yield as compared to treatment rpf in addition the treatment rbf improved soil health regarding bulk density porosity and organic matter of soil as compared to treatment rpf thus we are confident that the pla pbat biodegradable film is a promising and sustainable option to replace pm in the south of china as this is only a two year study we also suggest continued efforts to test the effects of long term use of biodegradable film mulch and accumulation of their residues

10009,the spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration et are the basic problem of the circulation of water resources several studies have reported the spatiotemporal patterns of et however there is a lack of systematic analysis of seasonal et patterns over large areas and the factors affecting et under variable environmental conditions are still uncertain in this study flux observation data was used to evaluate the performance of mod16 the modis global et product data under different conditions and then the mod16 data were used to analyze the interannual and seasonal variability of et and its spatial distribution characteristics in china furthermore path analysis was used to analyze the factors affecting the change of et the results can be summarized as follows 1 mod16 data are sufficiently reliable and meet the precision requirements for research 2 the vegetation et in china showed significant temporal and spatial differences at the interannual and seasonal timescales respectively with an average annual value of 359 61 mm between 2001 and 2018 3 the et in china showed an upward trend in 2001 2018 with an average change rate of 2 95 mm year and exhibited differences in various seasons and for different vegetation types 4 surface vegetation are the main factors affecting et in southeast of china while in northwest the et variation is affected by multiple factors under the conditions of climate change and vegetation cover change several strategies should be implemented to deal with the sustained increase of vegetation water consumption for example the adjustment of agricultural production structure and the optimization of planting structure the et change law obtained in this study can be used as a reference for water resource regulation and management keywords seasonal changes vegetation spatiotemporal patterns path analysis method coefficient of determination 1 introduction evapotranspiration et the sum of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a critical component of the surface energy conversion process and water balance wang and dickinson 2012 approximately 60 of global precipitation ultimately returns to the atmosphere through et wang and dickinson 2012 moreover et represents the vegetation water requirement to some extent especially for cropland which determines the irrigation scheme and also affects crop growth and yield zhao et al 2020 et is also an important indicator for drought monitoring aa et al 2019 therefore accurately quantifying the regional et and understanding its spatiotemporal patterns is important for regional water resource management and sustainable water utilization milly et al 2008 tang et al 2013 traditional methods for the measurement of et for example the energy balance bowen ratio br method bowen 1926 the penman monteith pm method monteith 1965 penman 1948 the lysimeter method seneviratne et al 2010 and the eddy covariance technique hu et al 2019 have often been used for point scale and small area scale studies wang and dickinson 2012 since the united states successfully launched the first meteorological satellite in the 1960s the application of remote sensing rs technology in hydrology has developed rapidly and has led to huge breakthroughs khan et al 2018 many models have been proposed for the retrieval of et using satellite data and these have been widely used for the study of large areas many rs based methods for the measurement of et have been developed and applied such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 the two source energy balance tseb method norman et al 1995 the improved penman monteith method mu et al 2007 2011 and the improved priestley taylor method fisher et al 2008 moreover several datasets have been generated for the regional scale study of et using rs based methods table 1 shows the 12 et products that are currently commonly used in studies of these gleam et eb holaps lsa saf pmsrb pu ptsrb pu and sebssrb pu have a high temporal resolution daily or finer the mod16 product is an 8 day composite cumulative et every 8 days and has a higher spatial resolution 500 m however only three products mod16 ssebop and pt jpl have a kilometer scale or finer spatial resolution these products have been widely used for water resource management lv et al 2019 monteith 1965 drought monitoring jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016b and the study of climate change shao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 land cover change li et al 2011 maia et al 2020 and agricultural production autovino et al 2016 tadesse et al 2015 furthermore these products have been evaluated and compared under various conditions in previous studies for example li et al 2015 used measurements from 17 flux towers including one in china to evaluate the performance of the mod16 et product in asia and concluded that it can be used to estimate et with a reasonable accuracy tang et al 2015 used measurements from seven flux towers in northern china to evaluate the performance of the mod16 et product and concluded that it has a good overall accuracy but its accuracy is limited in irrigated cropland velpuri et al 2013 evaluated and compared the performance of mod16 and ssebop et products in the united states by using flux tower data and concluded that these two products have comparable accuracies overall although accuracy differences were found under various conditions for example mod16 performed better than ssebop in cropland and woody savanna while ssebop was more accurate in urban areas and shrubland kim et al 2012 used data from nine flux towers to evaluate the performances of three et products mod16 gleam and gldas in asia the results showed that mod16 performed better for paddy rice bias 0 22 mm 8 d than the other two products 4 32 mm 8 d and 5 35 mm 8 d for gldas and gleam respectively while gleam performed best in grassland bias 1 99 mm 8 d rmse 6 23 mm 8 d most et measurement methods are often complementary and have different strengths and weaknesses and the characterization of the accuracy and error of each et product may provide useful insights into the environmental conditions that lead to lower accuracy hu et al 2015 therefore an et product should be sufficiently evaluated before use china which is mainly composed of semi arid and arid regions is seriously affected by water resource shortage kang et al 2017 et is a critical component of the water cycle and is often used for the assessment of water resources han et al 2018 it should be noted that et is sensitive to the environmental factors yang et al 2020 in china there are large uncertainties in the spatiotemporal et variation especially under climate change and human activities e g the returning farmland into forest rff project and the south to north water diversion snwd project the rff project was fully initiated in 2002 and has continued for nearly 20 years zhang et al 2019 leading to large changes in the country s vegetation coverage status according to china s land and resources statistical yearbook clrsy between 2000 and 2018 the rff project increased the forest land area in china by 4 1 the rff project is important for environmental protection and sustainable development zhang et al 2018 however the effect of the conversion of vegetation types on the spatiotemporal patterns of the et of vegetation over china has not been clearly discussed meanwhile the snwd project delivers water resources from southern china yangtze river basin yrb to northern china to resolve water shortage problems in the latter although many problems were discussed before the project was implemented in 2002 loew et al 2016 however the effect of this water resource delivery on the spatiotemporal patterns of the et of vegetation over china has not been clearly investigated besides human activities climate change also affects the et of vegetation shao et al 2019 according to a report by the china meteorological administration between 1951 and 2018 the temperature in china rose at an average rate of 0 24 c 10 years and temperature is known to be a crucial factor affecting et ferreira and cunha 2020 however the impact of climate change on the spatiotemporal patterns of et is still not clear rs based et products are reliable tools to study spatiotemporal et patterns the modis global et product mod16 is the first regular 500 m resolution terrestrial actual et dataset for vegetated land areas at a temporal resolution of 8 day composite hu et al 2015 compared to the other et products listed in table 1 the spatial resolution of mod16 could effectively alleviate the effect of mixed pixels besides the temporal resolution of mod16 could be used for studies of the interannual and seasonal variation of et several studies have been conducted on spatiotemporal et patterns in china using mod16 wang et al 2018 used mod16 to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the vegetation et in hebei province china during 2000 2014 and observed significant spatial heterogeneity and a decreased trend of et in cropland during this period maia et al 2020 studied the et variation in 2000 2015 in the loess plateau china based on modis data and the results showed that et exhibited a marginally increasing trend during 2000 2010 but no obvious trend during 2011 2015 yang et al 2017a used mod16 to study the et variation in the manas river basin china under land use change during 2000 2015 and found that cropland became more humid et increased while other land cover types became more arid et decreased most previous studies focused on the interannual variation of et and studied a relatively small area however due to the seasonal characteristics of vegetation growth the long term seasonal patterns of et over china have not been clearly investigated moreover few studies have discussed the spatiotemporal patterns of et over the whole of china and their response to effect factors under human activities and climate change therefore in this study we aimed to achieve the following three objectives 1 use flux tower observations of et to verify the precision of mod16 et data in china 2 use mod16 et data to analyze the interannual and seasonal variability of et and its spatial distribution characteristics in china 3 use path analysis to quantify the correlations between et and the daily maximum temperature tmx daily average temperature tmp daily minimum temperature tmn precipitation pre leaf area index lai fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar soil moisture sm relative humidity rh surface albedo sa wind speed ws and net shortwave radiation rsn and analyze their degree of impact on et under climate change and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china 3 31 00 53 33 47 n 73 29 59 79 135 2 30 e covers a land area of approximately 9 600 000 km2 most of china has a temperate climate and a small part has a tropical climate based on the distribution of water resources china can be divided into nine basin regions zhang et al 2011 the continental basin cb in northwestern china which mainly has a temperate continental climate and an alpine climate with low precipitation and low vegetation coverage the southwest basin swb in the southwest plateau which mainly has a subtropical monsoon climate and a plateau mountain climate with abundant precipitation and high vegetation coverage the yangtze river basin yrb which extends from eastern china to western china and has abundant precipitation with an uneven spatial and temporal distribution and mainly has a subtropical monsoon climate and high vegetation coverage the pearl river basin prb in southern china which mainly has a subtropical monsoon climate with abundant precipitation the vegetation is mostly cropland and forest with a high vegetation coverage the southeast basin seb in southeastern china which has similar environmental conditions to the pearl river basin the haihe river basin hrb and the huaihe river basin hurb in the north china plain which mainly have a warm temperate climate and a northern subtropical climate and a relatively high vegetation coverage mainly cropland the yellow river basin yerb which covers china s qinghai tibet plateau inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and huanghuaihai plain it has a monsoon climate with abundant precipitation in the middle and lower reaches and the cropland coverage is relatively high and the songhua and liaohe river basin slrb located in the sanjiang plain of china which has a temperate continental monsoon climate zone with cold and long winters and humid and rainy summers and whose vegetation is mostly cropland the locations of the eight flux tower observation stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 data used 2 2 1 modis16 et data global mod16 et data were obtained from the nasa atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac table 1 mod16 et data include transpiration of vegetation and evaporation of soil and rainwater retained by the canopy the mod16 et data were produced using an et algorithm based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and have been improved mu et al 2007 2011 the mod16 et data are available for regular 500 m grid cells for the entire global vegetated land surface at 8 day composite table 2 the mod16 et data can be accumulated from 46 phases of images to obtain the annual et value and each phase is mosaicked with 28 images to cover mainland china mod16 et data do not cover the regions corresponding to water areas barren land and building areas the mod16 data were used to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of et in china 2 2 2 flux observation data data from 15 flux observation stations in china obtained in 2003 2018 were used to validate the mod16 et algorithm the data were obtained from chinaflux http www chinaflux org fig 1 shows the locations of the eight flux observation stations and table 3 presents information of each flux observation station it should be noted that the energy balance closure issue that is the phenomenon that the sum of sensible heat h latent heat λet and soil heat flux g is not equal to the net radiation rn was often found in the eddy covariance system therefore the value measured using the eddy covariance system should be filtered and corrected first the data with an energy balance closure ratio ecr eq 1 of less than 85 were not selected for validation wang et al 2019 the remaining data with an ecr of more than 85 were corrected using the bowen ratio energy balance correction eq 2 chen et al 2014 1 e c r h λ e t r n g 2 λ e t c o r r n g h λ e t λ e t where rn g h and λet are values measured in the eddy covariance system λet cor is the corrected value units w m2 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg to ensure a reliable evaluation the et of the pixels in the 3 km 3 km area surrounding each flux tower was extracted for comparison with the measured values mu et al 2011 tang et al 2015 the daily et data that were obtained based on the tower measured flux data were accumulated to 8 days to match the mod16 et data the flux observation data were then used to validate the mod16 et data 2 2 3 ancillary data the lai data fpar data gridded pre data gridded tmx data gridded tmp data gridded tmn data gridded sm data gridded rh data gridded ws data gridded sa data and gridded rsn data were used to analyze the effect of these factors on changes in et the lai and fpar products are 8 day 500 m resolution products table 1 on a sinusoidal grid and were obtained from the nasa laads daac the lai is defined as the sum of the leaf area per unit area of ground while the fpar is the ratio of the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by the canopy to the solar radiation the sm data rh data ws data sa data and rsn data were obtained from nasa global land data assimilation system noah land surface model gldas noah025 m version 2 1 rodell et al 2004 in which the sm data is the surface 100 cm depth soil moisture the datasets were all spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolution of monthly scale the pre data tmx data tmp data and tmn data table 1 were obtained from the national earth system science data center these datasets are generated by a delta spatial downscaling process based on the global 0 5 climate dataset released by the climatic research unit cru and a high resolution climate dataset released by worldclim after downscaling the spatial resolution of these datasets is 1 km 1 km additionally the data were verified using data from 496 independent meteorological observation sites in china the results showed that the correlation coefficients r of pre tmx tmp and tmn were 0 93 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 respectively while the root mean square errors rmses were 21 94 mm month 1 49 c month 0 97 c month and 1 25 c month respectively peng et al 2019 these datasets have a good performance over china and have been widely used in previous studies li et al 2018b 2018a mao et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 the above datasets were accumulated to interannual values and compared with mod16 datasets which were accumulated to annual values using the same method 2 3 methods 2 3 1 data validation the eddy covariance tower measured daily flux data from the eight stations were used to validate the mod16 products at the point scale the daily flux observation data from 2003 to 2018 were accumulated to 8 days to match the mod16 data two indicators namely the correlation coefficient and the rmse were used to verify the accuracy of the data the calculation equations for these two parameters were as follows 3 r i 1 n e t m i e t m e t f i e t f i 1 n e t m i e t m 2 i 1 n e t f i e t f 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e t m i e t f i 2 where et m is the mod16 et et f is the et based on the daily latent heat flux observed at the flux stations n is the number of samples and i is an integer ranging from 1 to n 2 3 2 change rate calculation the change rate cr mm year of et between years was calculated using the least squares method the et cr for 2001 2018 based on each grid was calculated as follows 5 c r n i 1 n i e t i i 1 n i i 1 n e t i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n e t i 2 where et i is the total et in year i 2001 is the first year corresponding to an i value of 1 while 2018 is the last year corresponding to an i value of 18 when cr is positive it indicates that et shows an increasing trend while when cr is negative it indicates that et shows a decreasing trend the t test was used to test the significance of the et change trend the statistical index cr stdcr where stdcr is the standard deviation of the cr has a t distribution the results of the t test can be used to judge the significance of the change trend when cr stdcr t0 05 1 96 the trend was considered to be statistically significant it should be noted that in this case significance only represents the confidence level of the change trend 2 3 3 path analysis method path analysis pa is generally used to explain the causal relationships between multiple variables and can determine the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable zhang et al 2016a path analysis has been widely used in previous studies for example shinde et al 2009 used pa to analyze the factors affecting maize yield li et al 2019 used pa to explore the causes of runoff in the kaidu river watershed and cai et al 2011 used pa to analyze the spatiotemporal scaling effect of the transpiration of winter wheat in china therefore in this study pa was used to investigate the factors affecting et under various environmental conditions the pa method involves decomposing the correlation coefficient using multiple regression the direct path coefficient the indirect path coefficient and the total path coefficient are used to express the direct indirect and total effects of an independent variable on the dependent variable respectively the pa method does not require variables to be independent of each other gorai et al 2020 the path coefficient is obtained by solving the following equations 6 p 1 r 12 p 2 r 13 p 3 r 1 k p k r 1 y r 21 p 1 p 2 r 23 p 3 r 2 k p k r 2 y r k 1 p 1 r k 2 p 2 r k 3 p 3 p k r k y where k represents the number of independent variables and is equal to 6 in this study i e representing tmn tmp tmx pre lai and fpar r ij represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variables i and j i and j both range from 1 to 6 which represents the sequence number r iy represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variable i and the dependent variable and also represents the total effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable p i is the direct path coefficient which represents the direct effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable and r ij p i is the indirect path coefficient which represents the indirect effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable through the independent variable j therefore the sum of the direct and indirect path coefficients total effect of an independent variable is equal to the correlation coefficient between the independent variable and the dependent variable the coefficient of determination indicates the effect of relevant factors on the dependent variable including the effects of single factors and double factors on the dependent variable the calculation equations of coefficient of determination are as follows 7 d i p i 2 8 d i j 2 p i r i j p j where d i is the direct coefficient of determination of the independent variable i on the dependent variable and d ij is the co coefficient of determination of the independent variable i and the independent variable j on the dependent variable i and j both ranged from 1 to 6 when the coefficient of determination is positive it means that the indicator is positively correlated with the dependent variable while when the coefficient of determination is negative it means that the indicator is negatively correlated with the dependent variable in this study we follow previous studies aa et al 2019 davarzani et al 2014 li et al 2011 luo 2010 maia et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in selecting 11 indicators in which five climate factors tmx tmp tmn ws and rsn three surface vegetation factors sa lai and fpar and three water condition factors pre rh and sm these six indicators are sufficient to explore the factors affecting et using path analysis all data were used for path analysis in 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution additionally the f test was employed to determine the significance of the path coefficient p 0 001 moreover the method proposed by ming 1985 was used to test the significance of the coefficient of determination this method assumes that p i is the minimum value of all significant direct path coefficients the coefficient of determination d j was considered significant when the absolute value of d j was more than p i 2 otherwise it was not considered to be significant 2 3 4 data processing tools the modis data were projected and mosaicked using the batch processing function of the mrt software version 1 0 nasa washington d c usa the mean standard deviation and cr of et were calculated using the band operation function of the envi software version 5 3 esri redlands california usa the et of a specified area was counted by using the mask function and the extraction function of the arcgis software version 10 4 esri in this study the correlation analysis and path analysis were implemented using the anova function correlation analysis function and stepwise regression analysis function of the spss software version 21 ibm armonk new york usa 3 results 3 1 data validation the mod16 et product was validated using flux tower measurements from 2003 to 2018 from the 15 flux observation stations fig 2 in general mod16 et showed a reliable performance over china with the average r value and rmse being 0 87 range 0 77 0 95 and 4 59 mm 8d range 1 38 7 22 mm 8d respectively furthermore mod16 slightly underestimated et fig 2a among the 15 stations mod16 performed best for luancheng lc with an r value of 0 95 and performed worst for ailao mountain alm r 0 69 it is worth noting that the accuracy decreased with elevation in plain areas with an elevation below 500 m the average r value is 0 88 while it is 0 77 in mountain or plateau areas with an elevation higher than 1000 m among the three vegetation types mod16 showed the highest r value in cropland 0 88 and the second highest in forest 0 85 additionally the rmse reached 4 11 mm 8d in forest which is caused by the higher et rates in forest the lowest r value was found in grassland 0 79 moreover the performance of mod16 varied in different climate zones the mod16 performed best in temperate and warm temperate zones for which the r value reached 0 87 and 0 90 respectively and the rmse was 3 34 mm 8d and 3 94 mm 8d respectively the poorest mod16 performance was obtained in the plateau climate zone which has the lowest temperature r 0 79 however these areas showed the lowest rmse 2 54 mm 8d which is caused by lower et rates in general mod16 showed an acceptable accuracy suggesting that it can be used for the study of spatiotemporal et patterns 3 2 interannual and seasonal spatiotemporal evapotranspiration patterns 3 2 1 interannual et variation the spatial distribution of the annual average et differed significantly across china fig 3a and followed a normal distribution p 0 05 the et mainly ranged from 0 to 750 mm which accounted for 98 76 of the total vegetated area with a mean value of 359 61 mm in general the et was higher in southeast china and lower in northwest china and the country can be roughly divided into three parts based on the et cr as shown by the two dashed lines shown in fig 3a the first part mainly contains prb seb and swb which are distributed in southern china south of the southernmost dashed line this area had the highest et change rates 400 600 mm year the second part mainly contains slrb hrb hurb yerb and yrb which are distributed in central and northern china between the two dashed lines this area had lower et crs 300 400 mm year than the first part and the third part north of the northernmost dashed line mainly contained cb northeast china which had et rates of less than 300 mm year the distribution of std was similar with the distribution of et fig 3b and in areas with high et the values of et fluctuated greatly moreover the nine basins all displayed periodic change as shown in fig 4 it should be noted that southeast china prb seb and the middle and lower reaches of the yrb showed large fluctuations of et high std however without a significant increasing or decreasing trend meanwhile parts of the yerb showed an increasing et trend at a significant level p 0 05 additionally the spatial distribution of the interannual cr of et differed significantly across china fig 3c the value of the cr mainly ranged from 15 to 15 mm year which accounted for 98 78 of the total vegetated area with a mean value of 2 95 mm year and followed a normal distribution p 0 05 a total of 7 96 of the vegetated area showed a significant increasing trend of et during the study period this area was mainly distributed in northern china and parts of northeastern china specifically the seb had negative et growth with a cr of 2 58 mm year however the increasing 68 82 or decreasing 17 58 trend which most areas in china generally performed were all not reached significant level 3 2 2 seasonal et variation due to the uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and temperature there were differences in the distribution of et in different seasons fig 5a d g and j however the two dashed lines shown in fig 3 can still divide china s et distribution into three parts regardless of the season the distribution of std is the same as the distribution of et fig 5b e h and k specifically the slrb exhibited the highest seasonal differences of et figs 4f and 5d j in summer the et in parts of the slrb even exceeded the values in the prb and seb in southeastern china while in winter the et in the slrb was the lowest among the nine basins moreover the cr of et was different in different seasons in spring a total of 84 77 of china s vegetated area showed an increasing trend and this trend was significant p 0 05 in 10 24 of the vegetated area mainly distributed in central china in summer the et increased in 66 03 of the vegetated area and this trend was significant in 5 76 of the vegetated area mainly distributed in northern china in autumn 79 48 of the vegetated area showed an increasing trend and this trend was significant in 7 82 of the vegetated area mainly distributed in northern and northeastern china in winter the area with increasing et was the smallest of any season namely 55 67 of china s vegetated area with this trend being significant in 4 75 of the vegetated area in general the areas that experienced a significant increase in et are mainly distributed in central and northern china additionally the seasonal et and cr differed among the three vegetation types cropland forest and grassland as shown in fig 6 in general forest had the highest et regardless of the season followed by cropland grassland had the lowest et change rates however in winter the et in grassland was higher than that in cropland in terms of the average cr of et an increasing trend was found in most cases however in summer the forest et exhibited a decreasing trend cr 0 22 mm year it should also be noted that cropland showed a relatively high cr for all three vegetation types with the cr of cropland reaching 2 16 mm year in summer which is the highest increase rate of any season forest and grassland had comparable crs in all seasons except summer in spring the et showed an increasing trend in 84 77 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 10 24 of the vegetated area of which 4 07 was cropland 4 14 was forest and 2 04 was grassland in summer the et showed an increasing trend in 66 03 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 5 76 of the vegetated area of which 2 74 was cropland 1 44 was forest and 1 59 was grassland in autumn the et showed an increasing trend in 79 48 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 7 82 of the vegetated area of which 3 08 was cropland 3 34 was forest and 1 41 was grassland in winter the et showed an increasing trend in 55 67 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 4 75 of the vegetated area among which cropland accounted for 1 06 forest for 2 75 and grassland for 0 93 in terms of the annual change a significant growth in et was observed in 7 96 of the vegetated area of china of which 3 33 was cropland 2 63 was forest and 0 20 was grassland overall the trend of et growth was more significant in cropland 3 2 3 et variation under land use and land cover change lucc regarding the temporal variation the et of vegetation in china showed an overall upward trend between 2001 and 2018 it should be noted that the surface environment changed during this period for example land use and land cover change lucc occurred which can affect the studied factors de chazal 2009 and further affect the et as shown in table 4 the area of vegetated land in china increased by 153 300 km2 between 2001 and 2018 accounting for 13 66 of the total vegetated area in the country in 2001 as described in section 3 2 2 the et of the different vegetation types followed the order forest cropland grassland the cr of the area where cropland changed to forest land was 5 93 mm year which was higher than that in the area where cropland changed to grassland 1 72 mm year and the area where cropland was unchanged 4 34 mm year the cr of vegetation in the area where grassland was converted to forest was 4 68 mm year which is higher than that in the area where grassland was converted to cropland 3 58 mm year and the area where grassland was unchanged 2 86 mm meanwhile the cr in the area where forest was unchanged was 1 91 mm year which is higher than that in the area where forest was converted to cropland 1 78 mm year and the area where forest was converted to grassland 1 17 mm year the change of vegetation is also reflected in the fpar and lai that is the area that was converted to forest had a higher change rate of fpar and lai table 4 3 3 analysis of factors influencing evapotranspiration path analysis was used to explain the direct or indirect impact of the 11 indicators on et in this study table 5 these factors had different effect degrees in the nine basins of china in slrb hurb seb and prb lai had the highest determination coefficient it should be noted that there were parts of effect of lai to et came from indirect effect through other indicators for example the total effect of lai to et was 0 71 in slrb while the indirect effects through fpar pre and sa were 0 35 in swb and yrb fpar had the highest determination coefficient the above six basins have relative abundant water resources and water condition factors pre sm and rh do not significantly drive et variation while in hrb and yerb with relative shortage of water resources pre is the most decisive factor the highest determination coefficient to drive et variation in 2001 2018 followed by surface vegetation factors lai for hrb and fpar for yerb in cb there were seven factors effect et in different degrees in which four of them reached significant level tmx lai tmn and pre complex terrain and environment of cb may cause the multiple factors driving et variation moreover tmp was excluded in the all basins which indicates that the information of tmp may be contained in other factors in this study the 11 indicators were divided into three categories surface vegetation factors lai fpar and sa water condition factors pre sm and rh and climate factors tmx tmp tmn ws and rsn fig 7 showed the significant driving factors to et of different area overall surface vegetation were the main factors driving et variation in most areas 68 77 which was mainly distributed in seb prb southeast of swb and west of yrb water condition indicators were the main factors in the north of china accounting of 54 33 area moreover a total of 24 71 area were significantly affected by climate indicators it should be noted that there were totally of 42 70 area which mainly distributed in north of china were affected by multiple factors generally in the southeast of china with abundant water resources surface vegetation are the main factors in driving et variation while in northwest with complex environment e g poor water resources and sparse vegetation the et variation is affected by multiple factors 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of mod16 in china in this study the mod16 product was evaluated using data from 15 flux tower stations in china the mod16 et performance obtained in the present study is similar to the performance obtained by hu et al 2015 aguilar et al 2018 and ramoelo et al 2014 for china europe mexico and south africa when using flux observations for validation fig 8a and c however the mod16 performance obtained in the united states velpuri et al 2013 and parts of asia li et al 2015 were significantly worse than that in china obtained in the present study p 0 01 this may be due to the fact that in the present study filtration and correction of flux observations were conducted to improve their reliability eqs 1 and 2 moreover velpuri et al 2013 evaluated mod16 by comparing the pixels in the 1 km 1 km area surrounding each station with the flux data whereas an area of 3 km 3 km was used in this study the study of tang et al 2015 reported that using an area of 3 km 3 km is more accurate when using flux observations to validate et products additionally several studies have evaluated the performances of other et products in china for example yang et al 2017b used data from eight flux towers to evaluate the performance of gleam in china and the results showed that the r values of gleam ranged from 0 64 to 0 95 and the rmse ranged from 7 72 to 29 76 mm month 2 06 7 93 mm 8d moreover li et al 2020 evaluated the performance of gldas in china by using data from 12 flux towers and found that the r value ranged from 0 73 to 0 98 and the rmse ranged from 14 93 to 35 17 mm month 3 98 9 37 mm 8d together the results of this study and the aforementioned previous studies indicate that the mod16 gleam and gldas et products have comparable accuracies in china fig 8b and d however the present results show that the mod16 et product still contains errors there are several possible reasons for the difference between the mod16 et data and the flux tower measured et observed in this study first the algorithm of mu et al 2011 has limitations for example the algorithm does not sufficiently consider the physiological condition of the vegetation since it assumes that the stomata of vegetation are closed at night whereas actually several studies have reported the complete opening of stomata at night in some vegetation caird et al 2007 daley and phillips 2006 melanie et al 2010 accordingly the algorithm may not be able to accurately estimate the plant transpiration at night which may have caused the observed deviation between the mod16 et data and the flux tower measured et for some vegetation second there are uncertainties in the input data for example the land use type data that were used in the algorithm are derived from mod12 products of the same modis series and meteorological data of the global modeling and assimilation office gmao zhao et al 2006 heinsch et al 2006 compared these datasets with terrestrial observations and found bias in the datasets moreover yang et al 2014 evaluated the performance of mod12 products land use type and found that mod12 generally underestimated the vegetation cover area third there is a deviation in the flux observation data even though they represent the best measurement method for et eddy covariance flux towers have an error of about 10 30 glenn et al 2008 ramoelo et al 2014 meanwhile another source of error is the uncertainties of the flux tower footprints which are affected by wind direction atmospheric stability and surface type gamon 2015 and will cause mismatching between remote sensing data and flux tower footprint 4 2 spatiotemporal et patterns in response to effect factors spatiotemporal et patterns and their causes have always been a hot topic in the field of global change however due to differences in the data sources and sequence lengths some different results were found in the previous studies for example mo et al 2015 used the ndvi to estimate et in china during 1980 2010 and found that the average value of et was 415 mm year yao et al 2013 used the improved priestley taylor method to compute the average et in china during 2001 2010 and obtained a value of 364 9 mm year zhou et al 2009 used the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps to simulate the et in china and found that the et of terrestrial ecosystems in china increased between 1991 and 2000 with an average annual et of 442 6 mm year yang et al 2015 used gleam to estimate the et in china and obtained an average value of 397 5 mm year during 1980 2010 in the present study the average et in china during 2001 2018 was found to be 359 61 mm year which was less than that reported in other studies this difference may have been caused by the fact that mod16 product underestimate the actual et as reported in section 3 1 furthermore only the et of vegetated areas was investigated in this study and therefore the evaporation from water areas was not considered moreover there is no unified conclusion about the spatiotemporal et patterns in china in this study the et in china was generally shown to be lower in the northwest and higher in the southeast with the highest annual et being observed in the seb 565 10 mm and the second highest being observed in the prb 464 89 mm in terms of path analysis lai was found to be the main factor affecting et in the seb and the prb these basins are located in the tropics and subtropics close to the ocean and their rich water resources and solar irradiance provide hydrothermal conditions that reduce the effect of pre and fpar on et in these areas although some studies demonstrated that climate factors e g temperature and sunshine hours significantly affected et in the prb the lai which is used to characterize vegetation status was not considered in these studies gao et al 2019b zhang et al 2010 additionally the table 5 was also showed the parts of effect of climate factor tmn was came from lai indirect effect is 0 25 in prb the yrb is rich in water resources but its terrain is diverse and complex with high elevations in the west and low elevations in the east zhou and lei 2020 therefore the et of the yrb is affected by multiple factors similar conditions were also found in the cb whose et is also affected by multiple factors in the cb desert and sandy areas are widely distributed and accordingly there is low vegetation coverage despite the high altitude and sufficient solar radiation in the cb the energy needed for evapotranspiration is satisfied however because of its inland location its high altitude makes it difficult to transport water vapor he and shao 2014 additionally the low precipitation and low soil moisture restrict the surface et resulting in a generally low et wu et al 2018 in fact the present study found that the surface et measured in the cb was the lowest in china the terrain conditions of the swb are similar to those of the cb however the latitude is lower and precipitation is more abundant shi et al 2015 this can explain why the et was found to be higher in this basin in the present study the slrb in northeastern china is located at high latitudes and experiences low temperatures in this river basin the et was found to exhibit clear seasonal characteristics in this study high snow and ice cover and low vegetation cover limit the et in winter martens et al 2017 therefore the sa which is sensitive to snow cover was significantly affect et variation in slrb table 5 in the yerb hurb and hrb which are mainly located in northern china although the climate is dry and water resources are relatively scarce due to the high level of development of irrigation agriculture the irrigated area accounts for 30 50 of the total agricultural land which leads to higher et values yang et al 2015 additionally the hurb and hrb are located in a low latitude coastal area with high water vapor transportation and sufficient energy which could improve the et rates in multivariate analysis when each variable has a strong correlation the correlation between each variable and the dependent variable is not independent and the strong correlation between the independent variables causes multiple collinear independent variables the path analysis method can split the correlation coefficient into the direct effect from the indicator itself and the indirect effect through other indicators and can thus be used to eliminate unnecessary independent variables in this study the lai and fpar were both found to have a high correlation with et however some of the correlation comes from the indirect effect through temperature or precipitation for example in slrb the correlation coefficient between lai and et was 0 71 while the indirect path coefficient of lai through pre was 0 09 and the correlation coefficient between fpar and et was 0 50 and the indirect path coefficient of fpar through pre was 0 09 which demonstrated that the fpar and lai were sensitive to precipitation since the vegetation growth was influenced by these climate factors therefore although correlation analysis can provide the degree of correlation between two indicators it cannot explain the influence of each variable on the dependent variable meanwhile path analysis is more comprehensive in multivariate analysis and the results of correlation analysis and path analysis are not contradictory 4 3 uncertainties analysis of the datasets path analysis could effectively explain the contributions of different factors to et in china however the errors of the different datasets may lead the uncertainties to the results of related analysis li et al 2021 for example das et al 2019 demonstrated that the gldas soil moisture products have an error of rmse 0 05 m3 m3 in malaysian yang et al 2017c reported that gldas shortwave radiation products have a relative bias of 15 in major land areas of china mod15 lai products were proved to underestimated by about 5 10 in southern china cheng 2008 the other factors used in this study e g surface albedo relative humidity and wind speed also be proved to have errors to different extents comas et al 2018 liu and zheng 2002 it is difficult to avoid the error of remotely sensed indicators therefore understanding the effect from the errors of remote sensing based indicators to the studied object is necessary in this study sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of uncertainties of dataset 11 indicators accuracy to the results of the path analysis lópez olivari et al 2016 i e setting a random hypothesis bias 5 to 20 in each factor which had significant effect to et of each basin according to table 5 then the results of path analysis were compared with before without hypothesis error as shown in table a1 in the most situations the results of path analysis have not been affected by the hypothesis bias of each factor however the results begin to be changed when the bias reached 20 overall the path analysis in this study allowed a certain bias of each factor and the results can not be significantly affected therefore the study of spatiotemporal et patterns in response to effect factors by using path analysis is reliable 4 4 effect of human activities on spatiotemporal et patterns human activities affect the regional water cycle by changing the underlying surface type ma et al 2019 since the beginning of the 21st century the chinese government has implemented a series of policies such as the rff project and the snwd project these projects will affect the surface vegetation type and water resource distribution the rff project has addressed issues such as soil erosion and has improved the ecological environment however the fact that the et of forest consumes vast amounts of water has often been ignored during the implementation of the rff project in the present study the annual et of forest was found to be 444 42 mm while that of cropland was found to be 345 85 mm fig 6 moreover the cr of the area where cropland changed to forest land was found to be 5 93 mm year while that of unchanged cropland was found to be 4 34 mm year table 4 therefore the rff will cause more serious water shortages because of higher cr of et ma et al 2019 additionally excessive water consumption will cause serious soil desiccation jun et al 2008 and water yield reduction yu et al 2009 especially in the arid area of northern china meanwhile the snwd project transports water resources from the yrb to northern china mainly are yerb hurb and hrb sufficient water supply provides the basis for water consumption by vegetation as shown in figs 3 and 5 the increasing trend of et was clearly found in these areas object area of snwd project the water balances of the yrb and northern china have been calculated in a previous study loew et al 2016 however it should be noted that northern china is expected to become increasingly dependent on the supplementation of water resources due to vegetation cover change and the increase of the irrigated area pei et al 2018 additionally the increase in the irrigation area may also have contributed to the increase in the et of vegetation according to the statistical yearbook of water conservancy in china between 2000 and 2017 the irrigated area in china increased by 19 1 with the irrigated area of cropland forest and forage grassland increasing by 19 1 107 7 and 8 3 respectively irrigation makes the soil water sufficient and the et conditions better for example in the slrb the transformation of large scale dry cropland to paddy field in the past 10 years has led to a large growth trend of et in this region fig 3c moreover between 2000 and 2017 the area of economic crops with high water consumption in china also increased by 10 21 which also contributed to the growth of the overall et pei et al 2018 in general human activities contribute to social development and environmental improvement however the effect of human activities on the water cycle cannot be ignored most studies have shown that human activities have a much greater impact on water resources than climate change does yang et al 2018 ma et al 2019 additionally human activities also have a great effect on et therefore the variation of water consumption should be considered when a policy implemented such as rff 4 5 effect of climate change on spatiotemporal et patterns as shown in table 4 in the absence of vegetation type change the cropland forest and grassland showed crs of 4 34 mm year 1 91 mm year and 2 86 mm year respectively the high cr of cropland was likely due to temperature rise and the increase of irrigation area the lowest cr was found in forest in which a decreasing trend was found in summer as shown in fig 1b most of the forest area is distributed in the seb prb swb and yrb which were significantly affected by vegetation status lai and fpar table 4 the decreasing trend of forest et in summer may be due to the inhibition of vegetation growth when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold zhang et al 2016a cui 2013 demonstrated that the reference optimum temperature rot of vegetation growth in china ranged from 7 0 to 22 0 c however in the present study it was found that the temperature was higher than the rot in these areas in summer especially under temperature rise moreover pradhan et al 2012 and hossain et al 2012 proposed that high temperature stress could inhibit the growth of crops although the high temperature in summer can lead to strong evaporation it can also inhibit vegetation growth therefore the superposition of these two effects the promotion of evaporation and the inhibition of vegetation growth may have reduced the effect of temperature on et 4 6 prospects under the conditions of climate change and the sustained increase of et in china reducing the ineffective water consumption of vegetation is critical for water resource management for example soil evaporation as a part of et is relatively useless for crop growth ding et al 2013 zhao et al 2010 plastic mulching planting technology can reduce the soil evaporation and promote the storage of water in soil to promote root absorption gao et al 2019a 2019b li et al 2018b gao et al 2019a demonstrated that plastic mulching significantly increased crop water use efficiency by 27 63 in china during 1980 2017 plastic mulching planting technology is necessary in the cb which has sufficient evaporation capacity and low water resources moreover the breeding of drought resistant and water saving crops hu and xiong 2014 okogbenin et al 2013 and the application of deficit irrigation are also effective means for water saving in agriculture comas et al 2018 galindo et al 2018 as reviewed by lv et al 2017 the planting of rice which is the main crop in china consumes 50 of the freshwater resources in china and the target of rice breeding in china is to reduce the water consumption by 50 compared to traditional paddy rice under prerequisites that ensure an acceptable level of yield potential and quality additionally it should be noted as described in section 3 2 3 that the change from low water consumption vegetation to high water consumption vegetation such as the change from cropland to forest will also increase the water consumption therefore the adjustment of the agricultural production structure and the optimization of the planting structure are necessary under poor water resource status as well as the implementation of returning farmland to forest and afforestation policy which should be considered depends on actual regional water resource status 5 conclusions based on mod16 data this paper studied the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation et in china from 2001 to 2018 and analyzed the causes of changes in et the mod16 data were shown to be sufficiently reliable and to meet the precision requirements for research in china through validation using data from 15 flux towers the average annual et in china was shown to be 359 61 mm with higher et values being observed in southeast china and lower values being observed in northwest china moreover the results suggest that between 2001 and 2018 et generally increased in different vegetation types and different seasons with an average increase rate of 2 95 mm year with cropland showing the highest increase rate 4 34 mm year additionally path analysis showed that the factors driving et variation were different over space surface vegetation are the main factors in southeast of china while in northwest with complex environment e g poor water resources and sparse vegetation the et variation is affected by multiple factors under conditions of climate change and vegetation cover change several strategies e g the adjustment of the agricultural production structure and the optimization of the planting structure should be implemented to deal with the sustained increase of vegetation water consumption declaration

10009,the spatiotemporal patterns of evapotranspiration et are the basic problem of the circulation of water resources several studies have reported the spatiotemporal patterns of et however there is a lack of systematic analysis of seasonal et patterns over large areas and the factors affecting et under variable environmental conditions are still uncertain in this study flux observation data was used to evaluate the performance of mod16 the modis global et product data under different conditions and then the mod16 data were used to analyze the interannual and seasonal variability of et and its spatial distribution characteristics in china furthermore path analysis was used to analyze the factors affecting the change of et the results can be summarized as follows 1 mod16 data are sufficiently reliable and meet the precision requirements for research 2 the vegetation et in china showed significant temporal and spatial differences at the interannual and seasonal timescales respectively with an average annual value of 359 61 mm between 2001 and 2018 3 the et in china showed an upward trend in 2001 2018 with an average change rate of 2 95 mm year and exhibited differences in various seasons and for different vegetation types 4 surface vegetation are the main factors affecting et in southeast of china while in northwest the et variation is affected by multiple factors under the conditions of climate change and vegetation cover change several strategies should be implemented to deal with the sustained increase of vegetation water consumption for example the adjustment of agricultural production structure and the optimization of planting structure the et change law obtained in this study can be used as a reference for water resource regulation and management keywords seasonal changes vegetation spatiotemporal patterns path analysis method coefficient of determination 1 introduction evapotranspiration et the sum of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is a critical component of the surface energy conversion process and water balance wang and dickinson 2012 approximately 60 of global precipitation ultimately returns to the atmosphere through et wang and dickinson 2012 moreover et represents the vegetation water requirement to some extent especially for cropland which determines the irrigation scheme and also affects crop growth and yield zhao et al 2020 et is also an important indicator for drought monitoring aa et al 2019 therefore accurately quantifying the regional et and understanding its spatiotemporal patterns is important for regional water resource management and sustainable water utilization milly et al 2008 tang et al 2013 traditional methods for the measurement of et for example the energy balance bowen ratio br method bowen 1926 the penman monteith pm method monteith 1965 penman 1948 the lysimeter method seneviratne et al 2010 and the eddy covariance technique hu et al 2019 have often been used for point scale and small area scale studies wang and dickinson 2012 since the united states successfully launched the first meteorological satellite in the 1960s the application of remote sensing rs technology in hydrology has developed rapidly and has led to huge breakthroughs khan et al 2018 many models have been proposed for the retrieval of et using satellite data and these have been widely used for the study of large areas many rs based methods for the measurement of et have been developed and applied such as the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 the two source energy balance tseb method norman et al 1995 the improved penman monteith method mu et al 2007 2011 and the improved priestley taylor method fisher et al 2008 moreover several datasets have been generated for the regional scale study of et using rs based methods table 1 shows the 12 et products that are currently commonly used in studies of these gleam et eb holaps lsa saf pmsrb pu ptsrb pu and sebssrb pu have a high temporal resolution daily or finer the mod16 product is an 8 day composite cumulative et every 8 days and has a higher spatial resolution 500 m however only three products mod16 ssebop and pt jpl have a kilometer scale or finer spatial resolution these products have been widely used for water resource management lv et al 2019 monteith 1965 drought monitoring jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016b and the study of climate change shao et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 land cover change li et al 2011 maia et al 2020 and agricultural production autovino et al 2016 tadesse et al 2015 furthermore these products have been evaluated and compared under various conditions in previous studies for example li et al 2015 used measurements from 17 flux towers including one in china to evaluate the performance of the mod16 et product in asia and concluded that it can be used to estimate et with a reasonable accuracy tang et al 2015 used measurements from seven flux towers in northern china to evaluate the performance of the mod16 et product and concluded that it has a good overall accuracy but its accuracy is limited in irrigated cropland velpuri et al 2013 evaluated and compared the performance of mod16 and ssebop et products in the united states by using flux tower data and concluded that these two products have comparable accuracies overall although accuracy differences were found under various conditions for example mod16 performed better than ssebop in cropland and woody savanna while ssebop was more accurate in urban areas and shrubland kim et al 2012 used data from nine flux towers to evaluate the performances of three et products mod16 gleam and gldas in asia the results showed that mod16 performed better for paddy rice bias 0 22 mm 8 d than the other two products 4 32 mm 8 d and 5 35 mm 8 d for gldas and gleam respectively while gleam performed best in grassland bias 1 99 mm 8 d rmse 6 23 mm 8 d most et measurement methods are often complementary and have different strengths and weaknesses and the characterization of the accuracy and error of each et product may provide useful insights into the environmental conditions that lead to lower accuracy hu et al 2015 therefore an et product should be sufficiently evaluated before use china which is mainly composed of semi arid and arid regions is seriously affected by water resource shortage kang et al 2017 et is a critical component of the water cycle and is often used for the assessment of water resources han et al 2018 it should be noted that et is sensitive to the environmental factors yang et al 2020 in china there are large uncertainties in the spatiotemporal et variation especially under climate change and human activities e g the returning farmland into forest rff project and the south to north water diversion snwd project the rff project was fully initiated in 2002 and has continued for nearly 20 years zhang et al 2019 leading to large changes in the country s vegetation coverage status according to china s land and resources statistical yearbook clrsy between 2000 and 2018 the rff project increased the forest land area in china by 4 1 the rff project is important for environmental protection and sustainable development zhang et al 2018 however the effect of the conversion of vegetation types on the spatiotemporal patterns of the et of vegetation over china has not been clearly discussed meanwhile the snwd project delivers water resources from southern china yangtze river basin yrb to northern china to resolve water shortage problems in the latter although many problems were discussed before the project was implemented in 2002 loew et al 2016 however the effect of this water resource delivery on the spatiotemporal patterns of the et of vegetation over china has not been clearly investigated besides human activities climate change also affects the et of vegetation shao et al 2019 according to a report by the china meteorological administration between 1951 and 2018 the temperature in china rose at an average rate of 0 24 c 10 years and temperature is known to be a crucial factor affecting et ferreira and cunha 2020 however the impact of climate change on the spatiotemporal patterns of et is still not clear rs based et products are reliable tools to study spatiotemporal et patterns the modis global et product mod16 is the first regular 500 m resolution terrestrial actual et dataset for vegetated land areas at a temporal resolution of 8 day composite hu et al 2015 compared to the other et products listed in table 1 the spatial resolution of mod16 could effectively alleviate the effect of mixed pixels besides the temporal resolution of mod16 could be used for studies of the interannual and seasonal variation of et several studies have been conducted on spatiotemporal et patterns in china using mod16 wang et al 2018 used mod16 to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of the vegetation et in hebei province china during 2000 2014 and observed significant spatial heterogeneity and a decreased trend of et in cropland during this period maia et al 2020 studied the et variation in 2000 2015 in the loess plateau china based on modis data and the results showed that et exhibited a marginally increasing trend during 2000 2010 but no obvious trend during 2011 2015 yang et al 2017a used mod16 to study the et variation in the manas river basin china under land use change during 2000 2015 and found that cropland became more humid et increased while other land cover types became more arid et decreased most previous studies focused on the interannual variation of et and studied a relatively small area however due to the seasonal characteristics of vegetation growth the long term seasonal patterns of et over china have not been clearly investigated moreover few studies have discussed the spatiotemporal patterns of et over the whole of china and their response to effect factors under human activities and climate change therefore in this study we aimed to achieve the following three objectives 1 use flux tower observations of et to verify the precision of mod16 et data in china 2 use mod16 et data to analyze the interannual and seasonal variability of et and its spatial distribution characteristics in china 3 use path analysis to quantify the correlations between et and the daily maximum temperature tmx daily average temperature tmp daily minimum temperature tmn precipitation pre leaf area index lai fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fpar soil moisture sm relative humidity rh surface albedo sa wind speed ws and net shortwave radiation rsn and analyze their degree of impact on et under climate change and human activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china 3 31 00 53 33 47 n 73 29 59 79 135 2 30 e covers a land area of approximately 9 600 000 km2 most of china has a temperate climate and a small part has a tropical climate based on the distribution of water resources china can be divided into nine basin regions zhang et al 2011 the continental basin cb in northwestern china which mainly has a temperate continental climate and an alpine climate with low precipitation and low vegetation coverage the southwest basin swb in the southwest plateau which mainly has a subtropical monsoon climate and a plateau mountain climate with abundant precipitation and high vegetation coverage the yangtze river basin yrb which extends from eastern china to western china and has abundant precipitation with an uneven spatial and temporal distribution and mainly has a subtropical monsoon climate and high vegetation coverage the pearl river basin prb in southern china which mainly has a subtropical monsoon climate with abundant precipitation the vegetation is mostly cropland and forest with a high vegetation coverage the southeast basin seb in southeastern china which has similar environmental conditions to the pearl river basin the haihe river basin hrb and the huaihe river basin hurb in the north china plain which mainly have a warm temperate climate and a northern subtropical climate and a relatively high vegetation coverage mainly cropland the yellow river basin yerb which covers china s qinghai tibet plateau inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and huanghuaihai plain it has a monsoon climate with abundant precipitation in the middle and lower reaches and the cropland coverage is relatively high and the songhua and liaohe river basin slrb located in the sanjiang plain of china which has a temperate continental monsoon climate zone with cold and long winters and humid and rainy summers and whose vegetation is mostly cropland the locations of the eight flux tower observation stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 data used 2 2 1 modis16 et data global mod16 et data were obtained from the nasa atmosphere archive distribution system laads distributed active archive center daac table 1 mod16 et data include transpiration of vegetation and evaporation of soil and rainwater retained by the canopy the mod16 et data were produced using an et algorithm based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 and have been improved mu et al 2007 2011 the mod16 et data are available for regular 500 m grid cells for the entire global vegetated land surface at 8 day composite table 2 the mod16 et data can be accumulated from 46 phases of images to obtain the annual et value and each phase is mosaicked with 28 images to cover mainland china mod16 et data do not cover the regions corresponding to water areas barren land and building areas the mod16 data were used to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of et in china 2 2 2 flux observation data data from 15 flux observation stations in china obtained in 2003 2018 were used to validate the mod16 et algorithm the data were obtained from chinaflux http www chinaflux org fig 1 shows the locations of the eight flux observation stations and table 3 presents information of each flux observation station it should be noted that the energy balance closure issue that is the phenomenon that the sum of sensible heat h latent heat λet and soil heat flux g is not equal to the net radiation rn was often found in the eddy covariance system therefore the value measured using the eddy covariance system should be filtered and corrected first the data with an energy balance closure ratio ecr eq 1 of less than 85 were not selected for validation wang et al 2019 the remaining data with an ecr of more than 85 were corrected using the bowen ratio energy balance correction eq 2 chen et al 2014 1 e c r h λ e t r n g 2 λ e t c o r r n g h λ e t λ e t where rn g h and λet are values measured in the eddy covariance system λet cor is the corrected value units w m2 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg to ensure a reliable evaluation the et of the pixels in the 3 km 3 km area surrounding each flux tower was extracted for comparison with the measured values mu et al 2011 tang et al 2015 the daily et data that were obtained based on the tower measured flux data were accumulated to 8 days to match the mod16 et data the flux observation data were then used to validate the mod16 et data 2 2 3 ancillary data the lai data fpar data gridded pre data gridded tmx data gridded tmp data gridded tmn data gridded sm data gridded rh data gridded ws data gridded sa data and gridded rsn data were used to analyze the effect of these factors on changes in et the lai and fpar products are 8 day 500 m resolution products table 1 on a sinusoidal grid and were obtained from the nasa laads daac the lai is defined as the sum of the leaf area per unit area of ground while the fpar is the ratio of the photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by the canopy to the solar radiation the sm data rh data ws data sa data and rsn data were obtained from nasa global land data assimilation system noah land surface model gldas noah025 m version 2 1 rodell et al 2004 in which the sm data is the surface 100 cm depth soil moisture the datasets were all spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolution of monthly scale the pre data tmx data tmp data and tmn data table 1 were obtained from the national earth system science data center these datasets are generated by a delta spatial downscaling process based on the global 0 5 climate dataset released by the climatic research unit cru and a high resolution climate dataset released by worldclim after downscaling the spatial resolution of these datasets is 1 km 1 km additionally the data were verified using data from 496 independent meteorological observation sites in china the results showed that the correlation coefficients r of pre tmx tmp and tmn were 0 93 0 99 0 99 and 0 99 respectively while the root mean square errors rmses were 21 94 mm month 1 49 c month 0 97 c month and 1 25 c month respectively peng et al 2019 these datasets have a good performance over china and have been widely used in previous studies li et al 2018b 2018a mao et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 the above datasets were accumulated to interannual values and compared with mod16 datasets which were accumulated to annual values using the same method 2 3 methods 2 3 1 data validation the eddy covariance tower measured daily flux data from the eight stations were used to validate the mod16 products at the point scale the daily flux observation data from 2003 to 2018 were accumulated to 8 days to match the mod16 data two indicators namely the correlation coefficient and the rmse were used to verify the accuracy of the data the calculation equations for these two parameters were as follows 3 r i 1 n e t m i e t m e t f i e t f i 1 n e t m i e t m 2 i 1 n e t f i e t f 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e t m i e t f i 2 where et m is the mod16 et et f is the et based on the daily latent heat flux observed at the flux stations n is the number of samples and i is an integer ranging from 1 to n 2 3 2 change rate calculation the change rate cr mm year of et between years was calculated using the least squares method the et cr for 2001 2018 based on each grid was calculated as follows 5 c r n i 1 n i e t i i 1 n i i 1 n e t i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n e t i 2 where et i is the total et in year i 2001 is the first year corresponding to an i value of 1 while 2018 is the last year corresponding to an i value of 18 when cr is positive it indicates that et shows an increasing trend while when cr is negative it indicates that et shows a decreasing trend the t test was used to test the significance of the et change trend the statistical index cr stdcr where stdcr is the standard deviation of the cr has a t distribution the results of the t test can be used to judge the significance of the change trend when cr stdcr t0 05 1 96 the trend was considered to be statistically significant it should be noted that in this case significance only represents the confidence level of the change trend 2 3 3 path analysis method path analysis pa is generally used to explain the causal relationships between multiple variables and can determine the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable zhang et al 2016a path analysis has been widely used in previous studies for example shinde et al 2009 used pa to analyze the factors affecting maize yield li et al 2019 used pa to explore the causes of runoff in the kaidu river watershed and cai et al 2011 used pa to analyze the spatiotemporal scaling effect of the transpiration of winter wheat in china therefore in this study pa was used to investigate the factors affecting et under various environmental conditions the pa method involves decomposing the correlation coefficient using multiple regression the direct path coefficient the indirect path coefficient and the total path coefficient are used to express the direct indirect and total effects of an independent variable on the dependent variable respectively the pa method does not require variables to be independent of each other gorai et al 2020 the path coefficient is obtained by solving the following equations 6 p 1 r 12 p 2 r 13 p 3 r 1 k p k r 1 y r 21 p 1 p 2 r 23 p 3 r 2 k p k r 2 y r k 1 p 1 r k 2 p 2 r k 3 p 3 p k r k y where k represents the number of independent variables and is equal to 6 in this study i e representing tmn tmp tmx pre lai and fpar r ij represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variables i and j i and j both range from 1 to 6 which represents the sequence number r iy represents the correlation coefficient between the independent variable i and the dependent variable and also represents the total effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable p i is the direct path coefficient which represents the direct effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable and r ij p i is the indirect path coefficient which represents the indirect effect of the independent variable i on the dependent variable through the independent variable j therefore the sum of the direct and indirect path coefficients total effect of an independent variable is equal to the correlation coefficient between the independent variable and the dependent variable the coefficient of determination indicates the effect of relevant factors on the dependent variable including the effects of single factors and double factors on the dependent variable the calculation equations of coefficient of determination are as follows 7 d i p i 2 8 d i j 2 p i r i j p j where d i is the direct coefficient of determination of the independent variable i on the dependent variable and d ij is the co coefficient of determination of the independent variable i and the independent variable j on the dependent variable i and j both ranged from 1 to 6 when the coefficient of determination is positive it means that the indicator is positively correlated with the dependent variable while when the coefficient of determination is negative it means that the indicator is negatively correlated with the dependent variable in this study we follow previous studies aa et al 2019 davarzani et al 2014 li et al 2011 luo 2010 maia et al 2020 yang et al 2020 in selecting 11 indicators in which five climate factors tmx tmp tmn ws and rsn three surface vegetation factors sa lai and fpar and three water condition factors pre rh and sm these six indicators are sufficient to explore the factors affecting et using path analysis all data were used for path analysis in 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution additionally the f test was employed to determine the significance of the path coefficient p 0 001 moreover the method proposed by ming 1985 was used to test the significance of the coefficient of determination this method assumes that p i is the minimum value of all significant direct path coefficients the coefficient of determination d j was considered significant when the absolute value of d j was more than p i 2 otherwise it was not considered to be significant 2 3 4 data processing tools the modis data were projected and mosaicked using the batch processing function of the mrt software version 1 0 nasa washington d c usa the mean standard deviation and cr of et were calculated using the band operation function of the envi software version 5 3 esri redlands california usa the et of a specified area was counted by using the mask function and the extraction function of the arcgis software version 10 4 esri in this study the correlation analysis and path analysis were implemented using the anova function correlation analysis function and stepwise regression analysis function of the spss software version 21 ibm armonk new york usa 3 results 3 1 data validation the mod16 et product was validated using flux tower measurements from 2003 to 2018 from the 15 flux observation stations fig 2 in general mod16 et showed a reliable performance over china with the average r value and rmse being 0 87 range 0 77 0 95 and 4 59 mm 8d range 1 38 7 22 mm 8d respectively furthermore mod16 slightly underestimated et fig 2a among the 15 stations mod16 performed best for luancheng lc with an r value of 0 95 and performed worst for ailao mountain alm r 0 69 it is worth noting that the accuracy decreased with elevation in plain areas with an elevation below 500 m the average r value is 0 88 while it is 0 77 in mountain or plateau areas with an elevation higher than 1000 m among the three vegetation types mod16 showed the highest r value in cropland 0 88 and the second highest in forest 0 85 additionally the rmse reached 4 11 mm 8d in forest which is caused by the higher et rates in forest the lowest r value was found in grassland 0 79 moreover the performance of mod16 varied in different climate zones the mod16 performed best in temperate and warm temperate zones for which the r value reached 0 87 and 0 90 respectively and the rmse was 3 34 mm 8d and 3 94 mm 8d respectively the poorest mod16 performance was obtained in the plateau climate zone which has the lowest temperature r 0 79 however these areas showed the lowest rmse 2 54 mm 8d which is caused by lower et rates in general mod16 showed an acceptable accuracy suggesting that it can be used for the study of spatiotemporal et patterns 3 2 interannual and seasonal spatiotemporal evapotranspiration patterns 3 2 1 interannual et variation the spatial distribution of the annual average et differed significantly across china fig 3a and followed a normal distribution p 0 05 the et mainly ranged from 0 to 750 mm which accounted for 98 76 of the total vegetated area with a mean value of 359 61 mm in general the et was higher in southeast china and lower in northwest china and the country can be roughly divided into three parts based on the et cr as shown by the two dashed lines shown in fig 3a the first part mainly contains prb seb and swb which are distributed in southern china south of the southernmost dashed line this area had the highest et change rates 400 600 mm year the second part mainly contains slrb hrb hurb yerb and yrb which are distributed in central and northern china between the two dashed lines this area had lower et crs 300 400 mm year than the first part and the third part north of the northernmost dashed line mainly contained cb northeast china which had et rates of less than 300 mm year the distribution of std was similar with the distribution of et fig 3b and in areas with high et the values of et fluctuated greatly moreover the nine basins all displayed periodic change as shown in fig 4 it should be noted that southeast china prb seb and the middle and lower reaches of the yrb showed large fluctuations of et high std however without a significant increasing or decreasing trend meanwhile parts of the yerb showed an increasing et trend at a significant level p 0 05 additionally the spatial distribution of the interannual cr of et differed significantly across china fig 3c the value of the cr mainly ranged from 15 to 15 mm year which accounted for 98 78 of the total vegetated area with a mean value of 2 95 mm year and followed a normal distribution p 0 05 a total of 7 96 of the vegetated area showed a significant increasing trend of et during the study period this area was mainly distributed in northern china and parts of northeastern china specifically the seb had negative et growth with a cr of 2 58 mm year however the increasing 68 82 or decreasing 17 58 trend which most areas in china generally performed were all not reached significant level 3 2 2 seasonal et variation due to the uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and temperature there were differences in the distribution of et in different seasons fig 5a d g and j however the two dashed lines shown in fig 3 can still divide china s et distribution into three parts regardless of the season the distribution of std is the same as the distribution of et fig 5b e h and k specifically the slrb exhibited the highest seasonal differences of et figs 4f and 5d j in summer the et in parts of the slrb even exceeded the values in the prb and seb in southeastern china while in winter the et in the slrb was the lowest among the nine basins moreover the cr of et was different in different seasons in spring a total of 84 77 of china s vegetated area showed an increasing trend and this trend was significant p 0 05 in 10 24 of the vegetated area mainly distributed in central china in summer the et increased in 66 03 of the vegetated area and this trend was significant in 5 76 of the vegetated area mainly distributed in northern china in autumn 79 48 of the vegetated area showed an increasing trend and this trend was significant in 7 82 of the vegetated area mainly distributed in northern and northeastern china in winter the area with increasing et was the smallest of any season namely 55 67 of china s vegetated area with this trend being significant in 4 75 of the vegetated area in general the areas that experienced a significant increase in et are mainly distributed in central and northern china additionally the seasonal et and cr differed among the three vegetation types cropland forest and grassland as shown in fig 6 in general forest had the highest et regardless of the season followed by cropland grassland had the lowest et change rates however in winter the et in grassland was higher than that in cropland in terms of the average cr of et an increasing trend was found in most cases however in summer the forest et exhibited a decreasing trend cr 0 22 mm year it should also be noted that cropland showed a relatively high cr for all three vegetation types with the cr of cropland reaching 2 16 mm year in summer which is the highest increase rate of any season forest and grassland had comparable crs in all seasons except summer in spring the et showed an increasing trend in 84 77 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 10 24 of the vegetated area of which 4 07 was cropland 4 14 was forest and 2 04 was grassland in summer the et showed an increasing trend in 66 03 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 5 76 of the vegetated area of which 2 74 was cropland 1 44 was forest and 1 59 was grassland in autumn the et showed an increasing trend in 79 48 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 7 82 of the vegetated area of which 3 08 was cropland 3 34 was forest and 1 41 was grassland in winter the et showed an increasing trend in 55 67 of the vegetated area of china with this trend being significant in 4 75 of the vegetated area among which cropland accounted for 1 06 forest for 2 75 and grassland for 0 93 in terms of the annual change a significant growth in et was observed in 7 96 of the vegetated area of china of which 3 33 was cropland 2 63 was forest and 0 20 was grassland overall the trend of et growth was more significant in cropland 3 2 3 et variation under land use and land cover change lucc regarding the temporal variation the et of vegetation in china showed an overall upward trend between 2001 and 2018 it should be noted that the surface environment changed during this period for example land use and land cover change lucc occurred which can affect the studied factors de chazal 2009 and further affect the et as shown in table 4 the area of vegetated land in china increased by 153 300 km2 between 2001 and 2018 accounting for 13 66 of the total vegetated area in the country in 2001 as described in section 3 2 2 the et of the different vegetation types followed the order forest cropland grassland the cr of the area where cropland changed to forest land was 5 93 mm year which was higher than that in the area where cropland changed to grassland 1 72 mm year and the area where cropland was unchanged 4 34 mm year the cr of vegetation in the area where grassland was converted to forest was 4 68 mm year which is higher than that in the area where grassland was converted to cropland 3 58 mm year and the area where grassland was unchanged 2 86 mm meanwhile the cr in the area where forest was unchanged was 1 91 mm year which is higher than that in the area where forest was converted to cropland 1 78 mm year and the area where forest was converted to grassland 1 17 mm year the change of vegetation is also reflected in the fpar and lai that is the area that was converted to forest had a higher change rate of fpar and lai table 4 3 3 analysis of factors influencing evapotranspiration path analysis was used to explain the direct or indirect impact of the 11 indicators on et in this study table 5 these factors had different effect degrees in the nine basins of china in slrb hurb seb and prb lai had the highest determination coefficient it should be noted that there were parts of effect of lai to et came from indirect effect through other indicators for example the total effect of lai to et was 0 71 in slrb while the indirect effects through fpar pre and sa were 0 35 in swb and yrb fpar had the highest determination coefficient the above six basins have relative abundant water resources and water condition factors pre sm and rh do not significantly drive et variation while in hrb and yerb with relative shortage of water resources pre is the most decisive factor the highest determination coefficient to drive et variation in 2001 2018 followed by surface vegetation factors lai for hrb and fpar for yerb in cb there were seven factors effect et in different degrees in which four of them reached significant level tmx lai tmn and pre complex terrain and environment of cb may cause the multiple factors driving et variation moreover tmp was excluded in the all basins which indicates that the information of tmp may be contained in other factors in this study the 11 indicators were divided into three categories surface vegetation factors lai fpar and sa water condition factors pre sm and rh and climate factors tmx tmp tmn ws and rsn fig 7 showed the significant driving factors to et of different area overall surface vegetation were the main factors driving et variation in most areas 68 77 which was mainly distributed in seb prb southeast of swb and west of yrb water condition indicators were the main factors in the north of china accounting of 54 33 area moreover a total of 24 71 area were significantly affected by climate indicators it should be noted that there were totally of 42 70 area which mainly distributed in north of china were affected by multiple factors generally in the southeast of china with abundant water resources surface vegetation are the main factors in driving et variation while in northwest with complex environment e g poor water resources and sparse vegetation the et variation is affected by multiple factors 4 discussion 4 1 applicability of mod16 in china in this study the mod16 product was evaluated using data from 15 flux tower stations in china the mod16 et performance obtained in the present study is similar to the performance obtained by hu et al 2015 aguilar et al 2018 and ramoelo et al 2014 for china europe mexico and south africa when using flux observations for validation fig 8a and c however the mod16 performance obtained in the united states velpuri et al 2013 and parts of asia li et al 2015 were significantly worse than that in china obtained in the present study p 0 01 this may be due to the fact that in the present study filtration and correction of flux observations were conducted to improve their reliability eqs 1 and 2 moreover velpuri et al 2013 evaluated mod16 by comparing the pixels in the 1 km 1 km area surrounding each station with the flux data whereas an area of 3 km 3 km was used in this study the study of tang et al 2015 reported that using an area of 3 km 3 km is more accurate when using flux observations to validate et products additionally several studies have evaluated the performances of other et products in china for example yang et al 2017b used data from eight flux towers to evaluate the performance of gleam in china and the results showed that the r values of gleam ranged from 0 64 to 0 95 and the rmse ranged from 7 72 to 29 76 mm month 2 06 7 93 mm 8d moreover li et al 2020 evaluated the performance of gldas in china by using data from 12 flux towers and found that the r value ranged from 0 73 to 0 98 and the rmse ranged from 14 93 to 35 17 mm month 3 98 9 37 mm 8d together the results of this study and the aforementioned previous studies indicate that the mod16 gleam and gldas et products have comparable accuracies in china fig 8b and d however the present results show that the mod16 et product still contains errors there are several possible reasons for the difference between the mod16 et data and the flux tower measured et observed in this study first the algorithm of mu et al 2011 has limitations for example the algorithm does not sufficiently consider the physiological condition of the vegetation since it assumes that the stomata of vegetation are closed at night whereas actually several studies have reported the complete opening of stomata at night in some vegetation caird et al 2007 daley and phillips 2006 melanie et al 2010 accordingly the algorithm may not be able to accurately estimate the plant transpiration at night which may have caused the observed deviation between the mod16 et data and the flux tower measured et for some vegetation second there are uncertainties in the input data for example the land use type data that were used in the algorithm are derived from mod12 products of the same modis series and meteorological data of the global modeling and assimilation office gmao zhao et al 2006 heinsch et al 2006 compared these datasets with terrestrial observations and found bias in the datasets moreover yang et al 2014 evaluated the performance of mod12 products land use type and found that mod12 generally underestimated the vegetation cover area third there is a deviation in the flux observation data even though they represent the best measurement method for et eddy covariance flux towers have an error of about 10 30 glenn et al 2008 ramoelo et al 2014 meanwhile another source of error is the uncertainties of the flux tower footprints which are affected by wind direction atmospheric stability and surface type gamon 2015 and will cause mismatching between remote sensing data and flux tower footprint 4 2 spatiotemporal et patterns in response to effect factors spatiotemporal et patterns and their causes have always been a hot topic in the field of global change however due to differences in the data sources and sequence lengths some different results were found in the previous studies for example mo et al 2015 used the ndvi to estimate et in china during 1980 2010 and found that the average value of et was 415 mm year yao et al 2013 used the improved priestley taylor method to compute the average et in china during 2001 2010 and obtained a value of 364 9 mm year zhou et al 2009 used the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps to simulate the et in china and found that the et of terrestrial ecosystems in china increased between 1991 and 2000 with an average annual et of 442 6 mm year yang et al 2015 used gleam to estimate the et in china and obtained an average value of 397 5 mm year during 1980 2010 in the present study the average et in china during 2001 2018 was found to be 359 61 mm year which was less than that reported in other studies this difference may have been caused by the fact that mod16 product underestimate the actual et as reported in section 3 1 furthermore only the et of vegetated areas was investigated in this study and therefore the evaporation from water areas was not considered moreover there is no unified conclusion about the spatiotemporal et patterns in china in this study the et in china was generally shown to be lower in the northwest and higher in the southeast with the highest annual et being observed in the seb 565 10 mm and the second highest being observed in the prb 464 89 mm in terms of path analysis lai was found to be the main factor affecting et in the seb and the prb these basins are located in the tropics and subtropics close to the ocean and their rich water resources and solar irradiance provide hydrothermal conditions that reduce the effect of pre and fpar on et in these areas although some studies demonstrated that climate factors e g temperature and sunshine hours significantly affected et in the prb the lai which is used to characterize vegetation status was not considered in these studies gao et al 2019b zhang et al 2010 additionally the table 5 was also showed the parts of effect of climate factor tmn was came from lai indirect effect is 0 25 in prb the yrb is rich in water resources but its terrain is diverse and complex with high elevations in the west and low elevations in the east zhou and lei 2020 therefore the et of the yrb is affected by multiple factors similar conditions were also found in the cb whose et is also affected by multiple factors in the cb desert and sandy areas are widely distributed and accordingly there is low vegetation coverage despite the high altitude and sufficient solar radiation in the cb the energy needed for evapotranspiration is satisfied however because of its inland location its high altitude makes it difficult to transport water vapor he and shao 2014 additionally the low precipitation and low soil moisture restrict the surface et resulting in a generally low et wu et al 2018 in fact the present study found that the surface et measured in the cb was the lowest in china the terrain conditions of the swb are similar to those of the cb however the latitude is lower and precipitation is more abundant shi et al 2015 this can explain why the et was found to be higher in this basin in the present study the slrb in northeastern china is located at high latitudes and experiences low temperatures in this river basin the et was found to exhibit clear seasonal characteristics in this study high snow and ice cover and low vegetation cover limit the et in winter martens et al 2017 therefore the sa which is sensitive to snow cover was significantly affect et variation in slrb table 5 in the yerb hurb and hrb which are mainly located in northern china although the climate is dry and water resources are relatively scarce due to the high level of development of irrigation agriculture the irrigated area accounts for 30 50 of the total agricultural land which leads to higher et values yang et al 2015 additionally the hurb and hrb are located in a low latitude coastal area with high water vapor transportation and sufficient energy which could improve the et rates in multivariate analysis when each variable has a strong correlation the correlation between each variable and the dependent variable is not independent and the strong correlation between the independent variables causes multiple collinear independent variables the path analysis method can split the correlation coefficient into the direct effect from the indicator itself and the indirect effect through other indicators and can thus be used to eliminate unnecessary independent variables in this study the lai and fpar were both found to have a high correlation with et however some of the correlation comes from the indirect effect through temperature or precipitation for example in slrb the correlation coefficient between lai and et was 0 71 while the indirect path coefficient of lai through pre was 0 09 and the correlation coefficient between fpar and et was 0 50 and the indirect path coefficient of fpar through pre was 0 09 which demonstrated that the fpar and lai were sensitive to precipitation since the vegetation growth was influenced by these climate factors therefore although correlation analysis can provide the degree of correlation between two indicators it cannot explain the influence of each variable on the dependent variable meanwhile path analysis is more comprehensive in multivariate analysis and the results of correlation analysis and path analysis are not contradictory 4 3 uncertainties analysis of the datasets path analysis could effectively explain the contributions of different factors to et in china however the errors of the different datasets may lead the uncertainties to the results of related analysis li et al 2021 for example das et al 2019 demonstrated that the gldas soil moisture products have an error of rmse 0 05 m3 m3 in malaysian yang et al 2017c reported that gldas shortwave radiation products have a relative bias of 15 in major land areas of china mod15 lai products were proved to underestimated by about 5 10 in southern china cheng 2008 the other factors used in this study e g surface albedo relative humidity and wind speed also be proved to have errors to different extents comas et al 2018 liu and zheng 2002 it is difficult to avoid the error of remotely sensed indicators therefore understanding the effect from the errors of remote sensing based indicators to the studied object is necessary in this study sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of uncertainties of dataset 11 indicators accuracy to the results of the path analysis lópez olivari et al 2016 i e setting a random hypothesis bias 5 to 20 in each factor which had significant effect to et of each basin according to table 5 then the results of path analysis were compared with before without hypothesis error as shown in table a1 in the most situations the results of path analysis have not been affected by the hypothesis bias of each factor however the results begin to be changed when the bias reached 20 overall the path analysis in this study allowed a certain bias of each factor and the results can not be significantly affected therefore the study of spatiotemporal et patterns in response to effect factors by using path analysis is reliable 4 4 effect of human activities on spatiotemporal et patterns human activities affect the regional water cycle by changing the underlying surface type ma et al 2019 since the beginning of the 21st century the chinese government has implemented a series of policies such as the rff project and the snwd project these projects will affect the surface vegetation type and water resource distribution the rff project has addressed issues such as soil erosion and has improved the ecological environment however the fact that the et of forest consumes vast amounts of water has often been ignored during the implementation of the rff project in the present study the annual et of forest was found to be 444 42 mm while that of cropland was found to be 345 85 mm fig 6 moreover the cr of the area where cropland changed to forest land was found to be 5 93 mm year while that of unchanged cropland was found to be 4 34 mm year table 4 therefore the rff will cause more serious water shortages because of higher cr of et ma et al 2019 additionally excessive water consumption will cause serious soil desiccation jun et al 2008 and water yield reduction yu et al 2009 especially in the arid area of northern china meanwhile the snwd project transports water resources from the yrb to northern china mainly are yerb hurb and hrb sufficient water supply provides the basis for water consumption by vegetation as shown in figs 3 and 5 the increasing trend of et was clearly found in these areas object area of snwd project the water balances of the yrb and northern china have been calculated in a previous study loew et al 2016 however it should be noted that northern china is expected to become increasingly dependent on the supplementation of water resources due to vegetation cover change and the increase of the irrigated area pei et al 2018 additionally the increase in the irrigation area may also have contributed to the increase in the et of vegetation according to the statistical yearbook of water conservancy in china between 2000 and 2017 the irrigated area in china increased by 19 1 with the irrigated area of cropland forest and forage grassland increasing by 19 1 107 7 and 8 3 respectively irrigation makes the soil water sufficient and the et conditions better for example in the slrb the transformation of large scale dry cropland to paddy field in the past 10 years has led to a large growth trend of et in this region fig 3c moreover between 2000 and 2017 the area of economic crops with high water consumption in china also increased by 10 21 which also contributed to the growth of the overall et pei et al 2018 in general human activities contribute to social development and environmental improvement however the effect of human activities on the water cycle cannot be ignored most studies have shown that human activities have a much greater impact on water resources than climate change does yang et al 2018 ma et al 2019 additionally human activities also have a great effect on et therefore the variation of water consumption should be considered when a policy implemented such as rff 4 5 effect of climate change on spatiotemporal et patterns as shown in table 4 in the absence of vegetation type change the cropland forest and grassland showed crs of 4 34 mm year 1 91 mm year and 2 86 mm year respectively the high cr of cropland was likely due to temperature rise and the increase of irrigation area the lowest cr was found in forest in which a decreasing trend was found in summer as shown in fig 1b most of the forest area is distributed in the seb prb swb and yrb which were significantly affected by vegetation status lai and fpar table 4 the decreasing trend of forest et in summer may be due to the inhibition of vegetation growth when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold zhang et al 2016a cui 2013 demonstrated that the reference optimum temperature rot of vegetation growth in china ranged from 7 0 to 22 0 c however in the present study it was found that the temperature was higher than the rot in these areas in summer especially under temperature rise moreover pradhan et al 2012 and hossain et al 2012 proposed that high temperature stress could inhibit the growth of crops although the high temperature in summer can lead to strong evaporation it can also inhibit vegetation growth therefore the superposition of these two effects the promotion of evaporation and the inhibition of vegetation growth may have reduced the effect of temperature on et 4 6 prospects under the conditions of climate change and the sustained increase of et in china reducing the ineffective water consumption of vegetation is critical for water resource management for example soil evaporation as a part of et is relatively useless for crop growth ding et al 2013 zhao et al 2010 plastic mulching planting technology can reduce the soil evaporation and promote the storage of water in soil to promote root absorption gao et al 2019a 2019b li et al 2018b gao et al 2019a demonstrated that plastic mulching significantly increased crop water use efficiency by 27 63 in china during 1980 2017 plastic mulching planting technology is necessary in the cb which has sufficient evaporation capacity and low water resources moreover the breeding of drought resistant and water saving crops hu and xiong 2014 okogbenin et al 2013 and the application of deficit irrigation are also effective means for water saving in agriculture comas et al 2018 galindo et al 2018 as reviewed by lv et al 2017 the planting of rice which is the main crop in china consumes 50 of the freshwater resources in china and the target of rice breeding in china is to reduce the water consumption by 50 compared to traditional paddy rice under prerequisites that ensure an acceptable level of yield potential and quality additionally it should be noted as described in section 3 2 3 that the change from low water consumption vegetation to high water consumption vegetation such as the change from cropland to forest will also increase the water consumption therefore the adjustment of the agricultural production structure and the optimization of the planting structure are necessary under poor water resource status as well as the implementation of returning farmland to forest and afforestation policy which should be considered depends on actual regional water resource status 5 conclusions based on mod16 data this paper studied the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation et in china from 2001 to 2018 and analyzed the causes of changes in et the mod16 data were shown to be sufficiently reliable and to meet the precision requirements for research in china through validation using data from 15 flux towers the average annual et in china was shown to be 359 61 mm with higher et values being observed in southeast china and lower values being observed in northwest china moreover the results suggest that between 2001 and 2018 et generally increased in different vegetation types and different seasons with an average increase rate of 2 95 mm year with cropland showing the highest increase rate 4 34 mm year additionally path analysis showed that the factors driving et variation were different over space surface vegetation are the main factors in southeast of china while in northwest with complex environment e g poor water resources and sparse vegetation the et variation is affected by multiple factors under conditions of climate change and vegetation cover change several strategies e g the adjustment of the agricultural production structure and the optimization of the planting structure should be implemented to deal with the sustained increase of vegetation water consumption declaration
