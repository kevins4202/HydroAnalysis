6045,the mekong river basin one of the largest river basins in asia is facing a great challenge to meet escalating water food and energy demands due to rapid development meanwhile climate change and dam development intensify the security issues of these water related resources these changes have resulted in flow regime variations that may affect local hydroecological conditions hec further influencing the ecosystem and have resulted in potential economic losses especially agricultural losses caused by natural hazards this study explores the impacts of dam development and climate change on baseline local hec and natural hazard risk nhr using a coupled agent based model that simulates interactions between autonomous agents in the whole basin a cross system analysis between the impact on baseline hec and nhr is conducted to inform future policy in this transboundary basin the impact on baseline hec is evaluated from the flow regime variation perspective based on the range of variability approach and the indicators of hydrologic alteration the impact on nhr depends on variations in the risk of lowest flow and peak flow the results primarily show that hec and nhr in the upstream region are more sensitive to precipitation change the negative impact on baseline hec by joint dam development and climate change is more significant in the upstream region as well under the hot and dry climate condition dam development can potentially mitigate both ecological and economic loss in the middle and downstream regions central and southern laos the kratie area and mekong delta if additional storage can be used in a flexible manner keywords transboundary river basin tradeoffs agent based modeling water resources systems analysis 1 introduction the mekong river is a transboundary river with an important role in asia water and energy demands in the basin have increased with economic development industrialization and a growing population dugan et al 2010 lacombe et al 2014 räsänen et al 2012 to better meet growing demands for water and energy many dams have been constructed and planned grumbine 2018 mekong river commission 2010 pittock et al 2016 although there are many debates about dam development including the impact of upstream dam development on downstream water flow sediment flow and ecological concerns kuenzer et al 2013 räsänen et al 2012 riparian states still consider hydroelectricity a cheap way to satisfy growing energy demands efforts have been made to quantify the impact of dam development in the mekong river basin mrb on one hand the positive effects of dam development include energy generation recreation and the regulation of streamflow for human water uses these positive effects can somewhat compensate for the hazards caused by extreme hydrologic events lacombe et al 2014 on the other hand flow regulation alters natural flow and changes hec which negatively affects some benefits that humans gain from ecosystems i e the ecosystem services provided by ecosystems such as the fish stock wildlife habitat and biodiversity dugan et al 2010 intralawan et al 2018 kummu and sarkkula 2008 the effects of climate change add another layer of concern to regional water and energy security economist intelligence unit 2017 kingston et al 2011 trisurat et al 2018 several previous studies have assessed the impact of climate change in the mrb for example shrestha et al 2013 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to evaluate climate change impacts on sediment in northern laos by four general circulation models gcms they found that annual streamflow would change from 17 decrease to 66 increase and resulted in 27 decrease to 160 increase changes in annual sediment yield shrestha et al 2016 evaluated groundwater resource variations as a result of climate change and showed declines in future groundwater levels in the mekong delta vu et al 2018 simulated seawater intrusion under climate change in the mekong delta of vietnam and estimated that a sea level increase of 30 cm would affect 30 000 ha agricultural area kontgis et al 2019 appraised the impact of climate change on rice productivity and noted that even more water and fertilizers could not offset the yield loss evaluating the joint impact of dams and climate change in large river basins is common around the world such as for the indus river basin yang et al 2016 the carpathian river kędra and wiejaczka 2018 and the yuan river wen et al 2018 for the mrb le et al 2007 stated that global warming and dam construction might worsen flooding in the mekong river delta ngo et al 2018 investigated the joint impact on such a hydrological regime in the lower mekong basin and reported that climate change might reduce flow changes caused by dams in the wet season while it might increase changes in other months shrestha et al 2018 quantified the joint impact on sediment outflow in the nam ou river basin in northern laos and concluded enhanced dam sediment management was required hoang et al 2019 depicted the impact on seasonal flow in the whole mrb and concluded that cumulative impacts would intensify the flow decrease in the early wet season the mrb is the largest fishery and is among the most uniquely biodiverse regions in the world dugan et al 2010 piman et al 2012 agriculture and fishery can be seen as two key ecosystem services that local people depend on for livelihoods and income anh et al 2018 dugan et al 2010 intralawan et al 2018 yu et al 2019 in river ecosystems hydroecological conditions hec play an important role li et al 2017 hec reflects multiple streamflow characteristics such as the magnitude and timing of extreme high low discharge and the frequency and duration of the high low pulse which is critical to sustain the fish life history and production yen et al 2008 therefore assessments of major concerns for mrb dam development and climate change should target impacts on hec and the natural hazard risk nhr which directly affects crop production and potential economic losses ringler et al 2011 also since mrb is a transboundary river basin the assessment of hec and nhr should not follow the maximizing basin wide benefit strategy jalilov et al 2015 yu et al 2019 for example upstream countries enhancing hydroelectricity will influence the downstream hec further affecting the ecosystem services li et al 2018 those countries who lose benefits may consider the outcome to be unfair which may also worsen geopolitical conditions yu et al 2019 therefore these impact analyses should consider both different regions and the whole basin keskinen et al 2015 pittock et al 2016 yang et al 2016 based on the outline above the primary goal of this study is to simultaneously assess dam development and climate change impacts on hec and nhr as compared to the baseline then we conduct a cross system analysis between the impact on baseline hec and nhr for comprehensive tradeoff analyses among different regions dividing mrb into different stakeholders this study can be seen as an initial effort at concurrent regional and cross system tradeoff analysis in the mrb different stakeholders in the mrb may have different interests and water use preferences because different departments compete with each other for limited water resources to conduct the tradeoff analysis an agent based model abm used for dividing the mrb into different self organized regions to better reflect real world human interventions in each region coupled swat model utilized for simulating streamflow previously developed by khan et al 2017a is employed for the complex human and natural water system the outcome of this study can be used to inform policies in different regions based on dam impacts on baseline local aquatic ecosystems and potential economic losses 2 study area data and scenarios 2 1 mrb in the coupled abm swat model the mekong river originates in tibet and flows through china laos myanmar thailand cambodia and vietnam before entering the south east asia sea fig 1 it is one of the largest rivers in asia with a length of approximately 4800 km and a drainage area of 795 000 km2 rapid dam development and the changing environment may lead to hec changes and local ecosystem service losses as a result of changing flow regimes twenty three ecosystem hotspots mostly wetlands are identified by local ecological experts in worldfish based on species richness number of species at risk existing protection schemes and area sensitivity baran et al 2015 fig 1 and table s1 in supplementary materials hec changes in these hotspots will notably affect aquatic habitats fish biodiversity and spawning grounds so they are selected as analysis targets in this study we also divide the entire mrb into 12 regions based on political boundaries and natural catchment boundaries first we divide the basin by political boundaries among each country the basin is further divided by the natural catchment boundaries these 12 regions are defined as water use agents in the abm following the settings in khan et al 2017a to evaluate the impact on nhr 2 2 data and scenarios this study identifies a series of potential uncertain scenarios to explore the impact of different dam development and climate change conditions in the mrb numerous dams are under construction räsänen et al 2018 in this study we select a total of 19 major dams dams already being operated and those dams will be completed around 2020 based on volume with relatively large storage and most critically data availability in the mrb to assess the dam development impact all 19 dams 6 in china 10 in laos 1 in thailand 1 in vietnam and 1 in cambodia generate hydroelectricity while only one dam ubol ratana located in thailand is also used for irrigation the characteristics country ownership status storage and purpose of the 19 modeled dams are shown in table s2 in supplementary materials as our available data period is from 1983 to 2007 we consider 6 dams all completed and operated before 2007 as the baseline dam scenario with total storage of 12 463 million cubic meters mcm and in total 19 dams are modeled with the total storage of 76 215 mcm in the dam development scenario fig 1 climatic drivers that may affect the streamflow include precipitation temperature wind humidity vapor pressure solar radiation and others tian et al 2018 precipitation p and temperature t are the two main climatic drivers considered in this study several previous studies have quantified the impact of climate change on future precipitation and temperature across the mrb hasson et al 2016 hoang et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 in general precipitation and temperature projections vary with representative concentration pathways rcps and gcms based on future precipitation and temperature projections of these available studies we conduct a climate stress test with five precipitation change levels p 0 15 30 15 and 30 and four temperature change levels t 0 c 1 5 c 3 c and 4 5 c to cover the possible range of future climate conditions brown et al 2012 the tested temperature increase scenarios fit with the rcp 2 6 1 5 c and rcp 8 5 3 c projections for the period of 2050 2093 under the ensemble gcm results tested by ruan et al 2019 changes in precipitation and temperature are applied to daily historical data period from 1983 to 2007 precipitation data is obtained from the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards the evaluation of water resources project yatagai et al 2012 and temperature data is obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 therefore 40 scenarios are considered in this study as a joint dam and climate sensitivity test which consist of 2 dam development scenarios and 20 4 5 climate change conditions table s3 shown in supplementary materials the scenario containing the baseline dams 6 dams with no precipitation or temperature changes is defined as the baseline scenario other data required to run the coupled abm swat model include reservoir characteristics such as operational rule and storage geographic linkages of different agents and ecosystem hotspots elevation obtained from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds database land use obtained from spatial production allocation model spam database for 2005 land cover obtained from the global land cover 2000 database soil from the fao unesco cropped area estimated based on the spam database and meteorological data such as solar radiation wind speed humidity obtained from ncep cfsr with the data period from 1983 to 2007 3 methods 3 1 coupled abm swat model the coupled abm swat model developed by khan et al 2017a is used for cross system analysis between hec and nhr the abm allows each agent to make its own behavior rule about the water use preferences agricultural irrigation hydroelectricity generation or water for ecosystem health in the mrb by considering the behavioral rule in each agent this coupled modeling framework reflects real world human adaptive decisions better than a simple process based hydrological model the water use preferences of each agent are determined and set based on a comprehensive e survey khan et al 2017b water use rankings in each agent are shown in table s4 in supplementary materials in the swat model the 12 agents in the basin are further divided into 289 sub basins to better simulate the spatial variations of hydrologic process fig 1 each sub basin has several hydrological response units with similar soils land use land cover and slope which are then used to simulate runoff generation the swat is calibrated period from 1983 to 1992 and validated period from 1993 to 2007 based on streamflow data obtained from l institut de recherche pour le développement the nash sutcliffe coefficient of the swat calibration and validation for ten gauging stations are mostly over 0 8 indicating a relatively good performance of the model khan et al 2017a besides running the swat model following the behavioral rules set in abm this coupled model also allows each agent to observe the impact of their behavior rule and to make corresponding changes based on the output in swat the two way coupled model can better represent the interaction between the nature and human the abm and swat models interact on an annual time scale at the end of each year agents update their decisions on dam operations and crop area based on the comparisons between swat outputs such as streamflow crop yield reservoir storage and release from that year and the initial target setting for example if agriculture production ranks first and the actual crop production is lower than the target the agent will increase the irrigated area if hydropower generation ranks first and the actual production is smaller than the target agent will decrease number of days to reach the target dam storage however if the ecosystem health ranks first and the streamflow does not reach the target the agent will not take any measures no matter crop and hydropower production reach their targets or not then the swat model uses the new settings to simulate the runoff for the coming year the model workflow and more technical details for the coupled model can be found in khan et al 2017a 3 2 calculation of impact on baseline hec this study uses the flow regime variation to reflect the impact on baseline hec first the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha method including 33 hydroecological parameters richter et al 1996 1998 is selected these parameters represent different aspect of flow conditions that can potentially influence the ecosystem for example the 7 day annual maximal and minimal flow are well known descriptors of dam impact as well as the 30 day annual maximal and minimal flow reflect dry or wet years in the mrb baran et al 2015 more general interlinks between iha parameters and corresponding ecosystem influences can be found in table s5 in supplementary materials then the range of variability approach rva richter et al 1997 is employed to assess the flow regime change by analyzing variations of the 33 iha parameters under different climate and dam development scenarios compared to the baseline we acknowledge that iha rva are intended to start with a natural flow regime as the baseline to represent potential deviation from desired ecological state however given the data availability is after 1983 in this study the truly natural flow regime for the mrb is difficult to assess to inform policy we alternatively define the flow condition from 1983 to 2007 as a baseline scenario and then compare the flow condition under climate change and or dam development condition with the baseline in this setting we assume higher flow regime variation that is hec away from the baseline is less desirable and may lead to more serious potential ecosystem degradation and ecological loss we use the following four steps to compute the impact on baseline hec for each ecosystem hotspot in the mrb 1 determine the baseline flow condition in this study the output of the abm swat model under the baseline scenario is defined as the baseline flow condition then 33 iha parameters values for each year at each hotspot are calculated based on the baseline daily streamflow data inside the boundary of the hotspot 2 determine the environmental flow target of each iha parameter following richter et al 1997 the 25th and 75th percentile ranges of multiyear iha parameter values under the baseline scenario calculated in step 1 are selected as the flow target to maintain the baseline local hec 3 run the abm swat model for altered climate and dam development scenarios and calculate the 33 iha parameters for each year at each hotspot in these 39 scenarios 4 calculate the hydrologic alteration degree to quantify the flow regime variation richter et al 1998 the hydrologic alteration degree hadi of each iha parameter is evaluated as follows 1 ha d i na s i n b s i nb s i 100 where ha d i is the hydrologic alteration degree of ith iha parameter in the future scenario compared to the baseline scenario na s i is the number of years for which the multiyear iha parameter values under the altered climate change and dam development scenarios obtained in step 3 falling into the baseline environmental flow target and nb s i is the number of years for which the multiyear iha parameter values under the baseline scenario obtained in step 1 falling into the baseline environmental flow target the hydrologic alteration degree varies with the iha parameter shiau and wu 2004 some values may increase while others may decrease it is difficult to directly use 33 iha parameters at the same time to assess the tradeoffs between hec and nhr for policy makings therefore in this study we use eq 2 to calculate the comprehensive hydrologic alteration degree chad which is the mathematical definition of impact on baseline hec compared to the baseline scenario in this study considering 33 iha parameters in future scenarios compared to the baseline scenario 2 chad i 1 33 ha d i 2 33 this mathematical mean summarizes ecologically relevant flow alterations giving us a common standard for comparison across hotspots however it does not in itself give any indication of the actual ecological state of a system actual potential ecosystem states that may arise from specific iha parameter values need further investigation with more detailed ecological studies following richter et al 1998 the chad value ranges from 0 to 100 while larger chad value indicates that hec is away from the baseline and less desired a value of 0 means no change from baseline again not natural flow regime but baseline and 100 means complete change from baseline 3 3 calculation of impact on nhr in this study we focus on two natural hazards the lowest flow in the dry season and the peak flow in the wet season both having major impacts on agricultural productivity and economic development economist intelligence unit 2017 we use the change in nhr to reflect the potential impact of both lowest flow and peak flow events on economic losses nhr is statistically defined as the occurrence probability of the streamflow higher or lower than a threshold in this study to compare the impact on nhr at each agent the risk both lowest flow and peak flow of the baseline scenario for each agent is assigned to be the same this concept is similar to the identification of hydrologic events by the streamflow drought index sdi a widely applied hydrological drought index calculated based on long term streamflow data including both wet and dry period nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 this index is analogous to the standardized precipitation index spi a normalized index and the low flow event and high flow event can be represented similarly angelidis et al 2012 following the sdi concept hydrologic events can be characterized as extreme severe moderate and mild nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 extreme and severe low flow and high flow events hydrologic events that may lead to higher economic loss compared to other kinds of events both have an occurrence probability of 6 7 this also indicates that extreme and severe low flow events have a flow value with a cumulative probability smaller than 6 7 while the extreme and severe high flow events have a flow value with a cumulative probability higher than 93 3 fig 2 in this study we separate the dry and wet season to identify the lowest flow and peak flow as flow patterns in the mekong are entirely different for wet and dry seasons intralawan et al 2018 for easy calculation we assume the dry season is from january to june and the wet season is from july to december for all 12 agents the streamflow for each agent is divided into two ranges acceptable and unacceptable fig 2 unacceptable events are the lowest flow and peak flow with the occurrence probability equal to 6 7 based on the sdi concept this also indicates that the occurrence probabilities i e risk defined in this study of lowest flow and peak flow are both 6 7 in the baseline scenario a four step process is used to calculate the impact on nhr for each agent 1 determine the best fit probability distribution function of the baseline flow in general peak flow affects ecosystem and human society by a fast and relatively short term process while the lowest flow will have a slow and long term effect van loon 2015 due to these different characteristics we use the daily flow data for peak flow risk pfr calculation and monthly flow data for the lowest flow risk lfr calculation data series both from 1983 to 2007 first four probability distribution functions including gamma weibull rayleigh and lognormal are employed in this study as candidates to fit the flow distribution daily flow in the wet season or monthly flow in the dry season the best fit function is determined based on the root mean square error rmse which reflects the difference between the theoretical cumulative probability pt and empirical cumulative probability pe shown in eq 3 3 rmse 1 n 1 i 1 n p e p t 2 lower rmse value is better because pt has a better ability to match pe pe is calculated by the gringorten formula in eq 4 gringorten 1963 4 p e p x x i m 1 i n m 0 44 n 0 12 where n m is the number counted as x x i x i is the streamflow value and n represents the total number of streamflow data the values 0 44 and 0 12 in eq 4 are empirical constraints gringorten 1963 the equations to calculate the pt of gamma weibull rayleigh and lognormal are shown in eqs 5 8 respectively 5 p t f x a b 1 b

shape parameter b is the scale parameter and u and σ are the mean and deviation of the streamflow values respectively the parameters of each distribution function are estimated by a matlab function 2 determine the acceptable and unacceptable flow range diagram shown in fig 2 based on the determined best function for the baseline flow in step 1 the upper streamflow value of the unacceptable lowest flow event that is lower acceptable flow value laf is calculated by the cumulative probability of 6 7 and the lower streamflow value of the unacceptable peak flow event that is the upper acceptable flow value uaf can also be computed by the cumulative probability of 93 3 3 run the abm swat model for altered climate and dam development scenarios and determine the best fit distribution function similarly as in step 1 and the corresponding parameters of the rest of the 39 scenarios 4 based on the upper lower streamflow value of the unacceptable lowest flow peak flow event determined in step 2 and the best fit distribution function of the altered flow determined in step 3 calculate the upper lower cumulative occurrence probability of the unacceptable lowest flow peak flow event for the altered climate change and dam development scenarios fig 2 then calculate the occurrence probabilities the mathematical definition of nhr in this study of the unacceptable lowest flow and peak flow events under the altered climate change and dam development scenarios lfr2 and pfr2 shown in fig 2 the lfr and pfr calculation equations are shown in 9 and 10 respectively 9 lfr u p p e r c u m u l a

impact on baseline hec fig 3 demonstrates chad values that quantify the change of hec under dam development without climate change condition the chad value is plotted on the y axis and ecosystem hotspots are on the x axis note that ecosystem hotspots are ordered alphabetically from left to right which is approximately upstream to downstream not in chronological order larger chad value means hec is away from the baseline and is less desirable the impacts on mainstream hotspots hec are somewhat higher than those in the tributaries this is because more dams with higher storage are located upstream of mainstream higher dam regulation capacity leads to higher streamflow variation and flow regime change among the hotspots in the tributaries hec in hotspot l m and n is affected because there are two dams xepian xenamnoy and xe kaman 1 with total storage of 7 204 mcm upstream of these hotspots further considered in the dam development scenario the chad values for other hotspots are equal to 0 because there are no dams upstream of these hotspots further considered in the dam development scenario compared to the baseline focusing on the mainstream hotspots the impact on upstream hec hotspot a to i is higher than impacts on downstream hotspots hotspot j to w a possible reason is that more dams are further considered in the dam development scenario compared to the baseline thus affecting the mainstream flow that upstream hotspots highly depends upon a majority of streamflow in downstream hotspots coming from tributaries li et al 2017 can mitigate the upstream dam development impact to a certain extent 4 1 2 climate change impact on baseline hec fig 4 a and b demonstrates chad results under climate change scenarios reflecting the impact of precipitation and temperature change on hec compared to the baseline scenario for easy comparison the scale is the same as that of the baseline scenario in fig 3 following a single line from left to right in fig 4 a correlates to moving downstream which demonstrates a decreasing trend streamflow at tributary hotspots is smaller but with higher inter annual variations compared to those of the mainstream hotspots this flow pattern results in a relatively larger flow range in the baseline condition to sustain the local aquatic ecosystem health therefore the impact on baseline hec by precipitation change of these hotspots is lower than that in the mainstream hotspots next we compare different lines in fig 4 a the results show that impacts on baseline hec by larger precipitation variation precipitation 30 are higher than those with lower precipitation variation precipitation 15 which is expected larger precipitation variation leads to larger streamflow changes in fig 4 a at the same precipitation change condition precipitation decreases basically result in higher chad values which correlates to negative impacts on baseline local aquatic ecosystems this is because the modeling results show that river streamflow variations after being consumed by agricultural irrigation and hydroelectricity generation are higher in precipitation decrease scenarios than in precipitation increase scenarios furthermore the distances between four chad lines under four precipitation change conditions are larger in the upstream than those in the downstream this result indicates that upstream hec is more sensitive to precipitation change than the downstream since the upstream region of the mrb is characterized by narrow and steep gorges thompson et al 2013 terrain causes rapid rise and recession during the hydrological process limiting the precipitation redistribution capacity therefore with the same precipitation variation percentage larger flow variation is observed upstream fig 4 b demonstrates the impacts of temperature change on baseline hec from upstream left to downstream right a declining trend is observed from left to right similar to fig 4 a this effect is caused by lower inter annual variation in streamflow at mainstream hotspots which then leads to higher chad values by temperature change comparing different temperature change levels in fig 4 b the impact of temperature change on baseline local hec is not consistent unlike the pattern of precipitation change in fig 4 a temperature is an important factor that affects irrigation water demand and crop production in the swat model different crops have different suitable temperature ranges and temperature increases lead to inconsistent crop growth and irrigation water demand change resulting in an inconsistent trend of impact on baseline local hec by temperature change in summary the impact of a temperature increase of 4 5 c is the highest among the three temperature increase conditions due to the higher evaporation and higher flow decrease 4 1 3 joint impact of dam development and climate change on baseline hec the chad results under two dam development levels together with 20 climate change levels are shown in fig 5 with the same x and y axes as in figs 3 and 4 the 20 diagrams refers to 20 climate change levels in each diagram the solid line and the dot represent baseline and dam development scenarios respectively this figure aims to show the impact on baseline local hec by precipitation change column to column comparison by temperature change row to row comparison and by dam development in each climate change diagram difference of chad values between baseline and dam development conditions simultaneously fig 5 shows that the difference between chad values under baseline and dam development conditions with no precipitation change third column is the highest this difference gradually decreases with extreme precipitation first and fifth columns as shown in fig 4 a precipitation change impact on baseline local hec without dam development varies significantly and the impact dramatically increases under p 30 however fig 5 shows that the impact of dam development is greater than that of climate change resulting in similar chad values across all precipitation and temperature change conditions that is all chad values under the dam development condition all dots are at approximately the same horizontal level fig 5 also demonstrates that the impact of temperature is less distinguishable than precipitation when comparing different temperature scenarios in different rows also chad values under dam development conditions are above the values in the baseline dam condition under the p 15 p 30 and p 0 precipitation conditions this indicates that under these four precipitation change conditions dam construction may be not a good choice for maintaining the baseline local hec however under the p 30 condition the difference is smaller than the other four precipitation conditions also chad values under dam development condition are below those values under the baseline dam condition in hotspots i j k m n p and v these findings indicate that dam construction with larger streamflow regulation capacity may increase the low flow and reduce the streamflow variation degree which can slightly mitigate the impact of precipitation and temperature change on baseline hec under extreme precipitation decrease condition in these hotspots 4 2 impact on nhr 4 2 1 dam development impact on nhr according to the method in section 3 3 for lowest flow event identification the best fit probability distribution function of streamflow for agents 7 and 11 in the baseline scenario is gamma while that for other agents is lognormal for peak flow event identification the best fit probability distribution function of streamflow for agent 9 in the baseline scenario is gamma while that for the other agents is weibull we use these functions to further calculate the nhr in 39 future scenarios fig 6 a demonstrates the laf and uaf for each agent while fig 6 b shows the upper lower cumulative probability of lowest flow and peak flow for altered flow lfcp and pfcp respectively under the scenario with dam development and no climate change higher lfcp represents higher unacceptable lfr while higher pfcp represents lower unacceptable pfr agents 7 and 11 are located at the tributaries the nhr in these two agents is not affected by dam development lfcp and pfcp equal to 6 7 and 93 3 respectively same with the values in the baseline scenario for the other ten agents lfcp values are all smaller than 6 7 and pfcp values are all higher than 93 3 meaning lfr and pfr decrease with dam development due to the higher streamflow regulation capacity of more dams these findings are consistent with some previous studies lacombe et al 2014 lauri et al 2012 matthews and motta 2015 piman et al 2012 the lfcp values in each agent affected by dam development are approximately 0 for all while the pfcp values are all over 96 6 when we compare pfcp with 93 3 the pfr decrease in the upstream agents is relatively less this is because most dam developments are placed upstream with higher storage increase more dams mainly used for hydroelectricity generation may lead to relatively lower water release variation and lower pfr variation which highly depends on mainstream flow 4 2 2 impacts of climate change on nhr fig 7 a and b demonstrate the impact on lfr and pfr under future precipitation change scenarios without temperature change or dam development the x axis shows the agent number approximately upstream to downstream from left to right but not the chronological order while the y axis represents the nhr value the occurrence probability of unacceptable events larger nhr values may lead to larger potential economic losses precipitation decrease results in increased lfr fig 7a and decreased pfr fig 7b as expected and vice versa next we focus on nhr variation between a single bar either precipitation decrease or increase with the precipitation remained unchanged bar from left to right the same precipitation change results in higher lfr red bars and pfr blue bars variations in the upstream agents when compared to the downstream agents these results suggest that nhr variation in the upstream is more sensitive to precipitation possibly due to the upstream steep terrain characteristic resulting in larger hydrologic variations 4 2 3 impacts of climate change and dam development on nhr the lfr and pfr results under two dam development scenarios together with 20 climate change levels i e 40 scenarios are shown in fig 8 with the same x and y axes as fig 7 in each diagram solid red and blue lines represent the results of lfr and pfr respectively when no additional dam is considered dash red and blue lines represent the results of lfr and pfr respectively with future dam development again the x axis represents agent order basically from upstream to downstream rather than in the chronological order under the precipitation decrease conditions lfr decreases with dam development and the difference between lowest flow risk under baseline and dam development condition under the p 30 condition is the largest and it gradually approaches the no precipitation change scenario third column therefore the reduction of lfr by dam development under p 30 is the highest because the larger capacity of dams further increases low flow when precipitation decreases similarly under the precipitation increase conditions pfr decreases with dam development in addition the difference of pfr between the baseline and dam development condition for p 30 condition is the largest and it gradually approaches the p 0 scenario higher regulation capacity of dam development is mostly beneficial when streamflow increases as more dams can further decrease the high flow in fig 8 the difference between the natural hazard risk no matter under baseline or dam development condition in different rows is hardly visible indicating that the temperature impact on nhr variation is very small 5 discussion 5 1 cross system analysis between hec and nhr to inform policy to quantify the tradeoffs between hec and nhr under dam development and climate change we label each hotspot where the most downstream sub basins located into an agent and calculate the average chad for each agent because there are no hotspots in agents 2 5 and 7 and dam development will not affect agent 11 this tradeoff analysis only focuses on agent 1 upper mekong in china agent 3 northern thailand chiang rai agent 4 northern laos agent 6 central laos agent 8 southern laos agent 9 se san sre pok se kong agent 10 cambodia kratie and agent 12 mekong delta fig 9 demonstrates the tradeoff analysis among chad lfr and pfr for those selected agents under two extreme climate change conditions the left subplot demonstrates the temperature increase 4 5 c and precipitation increase 30 for the hot and wet condition in this condition we focus on peak flow events the right subplot demonstrates the temperature increase 4 5 c and precipitation decrease 30 for the hot and dry condition and we focus on lowest flow events since it is unlikely that the temperature will go down we only test these two extreme climate conditions different colors represent different agents the symbols o and x indicate results under baseline and dam development scenarios respectively therefore moving from symbol o to x reflects the impact of dam development since the highest values of all these axes are negative movement toward to the left bottom is ideal the star in the left subplot fig 9a all agents have movements toward the upper left this indicates that dam development reduces pfr but causes chad increase in all regions these results indicate that all regions have to trade the economic benefit reduced pfr with ecological cost increased chad in fig 9b similar horizontal movements to the left are observed therefore dam development can mitigate lfr under the hot and dry scenario for all agents however unlike fig 9a chad values in different agents show different movements in the hot and dry condition the chad values in agents 1 3 and 9 show upward movement in the magnitude of 6 indicating these agents do need to further consider the tradeoffs between ecological cost increased chad and economic benefit reduced lfr especially agent 1 the chad values in agent 4 basically remain unchanged and in agent 6 8 10 and 12 show downward movement meaning these agents do not have the tradeoff between ecological cost and economic benefit by dam development under this future climatic condition it is noteworthy that the storage increase in dam development scenario in agent 1 upper mekong in china is the highest it will also suffer more ecological loss among these 8 agents in the tradeoff analysis under these two extreme climate change conditions in addition dam development impact on baseline hec under the hot and wet condition is relatively higher than that under the hot and dry condition all additional dams tested in this paper are in the upper mekong in china agent 1 northern and central laos agent 4 and 6 and the 3 s basin agent 9 these four agents also show the highest impact on baseline hec under the hot and wet condition these indicate the dam development relatively causing a local effect under the hot and wet condition 5 2 limitations and potential future work this study attempts to quantify the impact of dam development and climate change on baseline hec and nhr to inform better transboundary water resources management however we acknowledge several limitations that require further evaluations in the future studies first we assume that hec away from the baseline is less desirable however the baseline flow is not necessarily the optimal flow condition to sustain ecosystem health as desired habitat conditions vary with fish species at a specific time and space barbour et al 2016 more efforts should be devoted to determining the target fish species and its corresponding desired ecological state in each hotspot for better transboundary tradeoff analysis in addition the large scale hydroecological data needed for the relationship analysis may be also be a constraint pastor et al 2014 second we only evaluate the impact on streamflow dam development and climate change may also result in the relocation of people kuenzer et al 2013 changed irrigation capacity kondolf et al 2014 landscape changes zhao et al 2012 interruption of fish mitigation dugan et al 2010 and biodiversity degradation ziv et al 2012 it is also worth mentioning the sedimentation issue in the mrb dams catching sediment have reduced the sediment transport and enlarged the ground subsidence thus leading to the increasing salt water intrusion in the coastal areas together with the sand extraction and rising sea level caused by global warming schmitt et al 2017 a more comprehensive impact assessment that consider all these aspects caused by dam when more dams characteristics available and climate change considering more climatic drivers is desired but challenging third we simply apply a blanket ratio to the precipitation and temperature record to reflect the possible precipitation and temperature changes these two climatic drivers patterns may also change leading to altered flow patterns which should be emphasized in projected climate change impact analysis evers and pathirana 2018 furthermore shorter timescale analyses such as seasonal or even monthly flow abnormal variations in the mrb are important li et al 2018 but ignored in this study anomalous conditions e g wet season abnormal low flow should be further identified throughout the year when the hazard threshold for different time period are determined in each agent this can provide better support for transboundary policy makings besides other drivers such as population growth land use change urbanization vegetation deterioration agricultural expansion that may also affect hec and nhr grumbine et al 2012 should be considered finally due to data availability limitations nearly all accessible hydrologic stations located in the mainstream of the mrb will affect the swat calibration especially in the large tributaries such as the agent 7 mui river and agent 11 tonle sap the results in these two agents can be misleading such as the very low laf values shown in fig 6 using these results for policymaking should be avoided 6 conclusions given the rapid industrialization and population growth in the mrb many dams have been planned or constructed to satisfy growing demands for food energy and fresh water these dams together with climate change may affect natural flow regimes in ecosystem hotspots and the natural hazard risk in this basin some regions may gain benefits while some may experience losses caused by dam development under different climate change conditions which may escalate geopolitical conflicts in this transboundary river basin this study assesses the impact of dam development and climate change on baseline local hec and nhr and then presents the cross system analysis between hec and nhr which can be used to inform transboundary policy a coupled abm swat model khan et al 2017a is applied to simulate streamflow dam operation and irrigation in the basin both hec and nhr are quantified by streamflow results forty scenarios including two with dam development five with precipitation changes and four with temperature changes are tested the modeling results demonstrate that 1 precipitation changes have a greater influence on baseline local hec and nhr than temperature changes 2 upstream hec and nhr variations are more sensitive to precipitation and 3 negative impacts on baseline local hec by dam development is more serious under the hot and wet condition than the hot and dry condition under the hot and wet extreme climate condition tradeoffs between reduced pfr and increased chad by dam development in upper mekong in china northern and central laos and se san sre pok and se kong basin require special attention under the hot and dry condition dam development may reduce the negative impact on baseline hec and lfr in central and southern laos the kratie area in cambodia and mekong delta if the storage capacity can be used in a flexible manner since the methods employed in this paper are all statistical the rva the iha and the nhr calculation they can potentially be applied to other river basins to support hec and nhr analyses under changing environments future studies should consider a full scale economic impact analysis hec indicators that also include water quality and fish migration address the sedimentation issue of dam development and test more exogenous drivers such as humidity solar radiation population growth land use change agricultural expansion

6045,the mekong river basin one of the largest river basins in asia is facing a great challenge to meet escalating water food and energy demands due to rapid development meanwhile climate change and dam development intensify the security issues of these water related resources these changes have resulted in flow regime variations that may affect local hydroecological conditions hec further influencing the ecosystem and have resulted in potential economic losses especially agricultural losses caused by natural hazards this study explores the impacts of dam development and climate change on baseline local hec and natural hazard risk nhr using a coupled agent based model that simulates interactions between autonomous agents in the whole basin a cross system analysis between the impact on baseline hec and nhr is conducted to inform future policy in this transboundary basin the impact on baseline hec is evaluated from the flow regime variation perspective based on the range of variability approach and the indicators of hydrologic alteration the impact on nhr depends on variations in the risk of lowest flow and peak flow the results primarily show that hec and nhr in the upstream region are more sensitive to precipitation change the negative impact on baseline hec by joint dam development and climate change is more significant in the upstream region as well under the hot and dry climate condition dam development can potentially mitigate both ecological and economic loss in the middle and downstream regions central and southern laos the kratie area and mekong delta if additional storage can be used in a flexible manner keywords transboundary river basin tradeoffs agent based modeling water resources systems analysis 1 introduction the mekong river is a transboundary river with an important role in asia water and energy demands in the basin have increased with economic development industrialization and a growing population dugan et al 2010 lacombe et al 2014 räsänen et al 2012 to better meet growing demands for water and energy many dams have been constructed and planned grumbine 2018 mekong river commission 2010 pittock et al 2016 although there are many debates about dam development including the impact of upstream dam development on downstream water flow sediment flow and ecological concerns kuenzer et al 2013 räsänen et al 2012 riparian states still consider hydroelectricity a cheap way to satisfy growing energy demands efforts have been made to quantify the impact of dam development in the mekong river basin mrb on one hand the positive effects of dam development include energy generation recreation and the regulation of streamflow for human water uses these positive effects can somewhat compensate for the hazards caused by extreme hydrologic events lacombe et al 2014 on the other hand flow regulation alters natural flow and changes hec which negatively affects some benefits that humans gain from ecosystems i e the ecosystem services provided by ecosystems such as the fish stock wildlife habitat and biodiversity dugan et al 2010 intralawan et al 2018 kummu and sarkkula 2008 the effects of climate change add another layer of concern to regional water and energy security economist intelligence unit 2017 kingston et al 2011 trisurat et al 2018 several previous studies have assessed the impact of climate change in the mrb for example shrestha et al 2013 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to evaluate climate change impacts on sediment in northern laos by four general circulation models gcms they found that annual streamflow would change from 17 decrease to 66 increase and resulted in 27 decrease to 160 increase changes in annual sediment yield shrestha et al 2016 evaluated groundwater resource variations as a result of climate change and showed declines in future groundwater levels in the mekong delta vu et al 2018 simulated seawater intrusion under climate change in the mekong delta of vietnam and estimated that a sea level increase of 30 cm would affect 30 000 ha agricultural area kontgis et al 2019 appraised the impact of climate change on rice productivity and noted that even more water and fertilizers could not offset the yield loss evaluating the joint impact of dams and climate change in large river basins is common around the world such as for the indus river basin yang et al 2016 the carpathian river kędra and wiejaczka 2018 and the yuan river wen et al 2018 for the mrb le et al 2007 stated that global warming and dam construction might worsen flooding in the mekong river delta ngo et al 2018 investigated the joint impact on such a hydrological regime in the lower mekong basin and reported that climate change might reduce flow changes caused by dams in the wet season while it might increase changes in other months shrestha et al 2018 quantified the joint impact on sediment outflow in the nam ou river basin in northern laos and concluded enhanced dam sediment management was required hoang et al 2019 depicted the impact on seasonal flow in the whole mrb and concluded that cumulative impacts would intensify the flow decrease in the early wet season the mrb is the largest fishery and is among the most uniquely biodiverse regions in the world dugan et al 2010 piman et al 2012 agriculture and fishery can be seen as two key ecosystem services that local people depend on for livelihoods and income anh et al 2018 dugan et al 2010 intralawan et al 2018 yu et al 2019 in river ecosystems hydroecological conditions hec play an important role li et al 2017 hec reflects multiple streamflow characteristics such as the magnitude and timing of extreme high low discharge and the frequency and duration of the high low pulse which is critical to sustain the fish life history and production yen et al 2008 therefore assessments of major concerns for mrb dam development and climate change should target impacts on hec and the natural hazard risk nhr which directly affects crop production and potential economic losses ringler et al 2011 also since mrb is a transboundary river basin the assessment of hec and nhr should not follow the maximizing basin wide benefit strategy jalilov et al 2015 yu et al 2019 for example upstream countries enhancing hydroelectricity will influence the downstream hec further affecting the ecosystem services li et al 2018 those countries who lose benefits may consider the outcome to be unfair which may also worsen geopolitical conditions yu et al 2019 therefore these impact analyses should consider both different regions and the whole basin keskinen et al 2015 pittock et al 2016 yang et al 2016 based on the outline above the primary goal of this study is to simultaneously assess dam development and climate change impacts on hec and nhr as compared to the baseline then we conduct a cross system analysis between the impact on baseline hec and nhr for comprehensive tradeoff analyses among different regions dividing mrb into different stakeholders this study can be seen as an initial effort at concurrent regional and cross system tradeoff analysis in the mrb different stakeholders in the mrb may have different interests and water use preferences because different departments compete with each other for limited water resources to conduct the tradeoff analysis an agent based model abm used for dividing the mrb into different self organized regions to better reflect real world human interventions in each region coupled swat model utilized for simulating streamflow previously developed by khan et al 2017a is employed for the complex human and natural water system the outcome of this study can be used to inform policies in different regions based on dam impacts on baseline local aquatic ecosystems and potential economic losses 2 study area data and scenarios 2 1 mrb in the coupled abm swat model the mekong river originates in tibet and flows through china laos myanmar thailand cambodia and vietnam before entering the south east asia sea fig 1 it is one of the largest rivers in asia with a length of approximately 4800 km and a drainage area of 795 000 km2 rapid dam development and the changing environment may lead to hec changes and local ecosystem service losses as a result of changing flow regimes twenty three ecosystem hotspots mostly wetlands are identified by local ecological experts in worldfish based on species richness number of species at risk existing protection schemes and area sensitivity baran et al 2015 fig 1 and table s1 in supplementary materials hec changes in these hotspots will notably affect aquatic habitats fish biodiversity and spawning grounds so they are selected as analysis targets in this study we also divide the entire mrb into 12 regions based on political boundaries and natural catchment boundaries first we divide the basin by political boundaries among each country the basin is further divided by the natural catchment boundaries these 12 regions are defined as water use agents in the abm following the settings in khan et al 2017a to evaluate the impact on nhr 2 2 data and scenarios this study identifies a series of potential uncertain scenarios to explore the impact of different dam development and climate change conditions in the mrb numerous dams are under construction räsänen et al 2018 in this study we select a total of 19 major dams dams already being operated and those dams will be completed around 2020 based on volume with relatively large storage and most critically data availability in the mrb to assess the dam development impact all 19 dams 6 in china 10 in laos 1 in thailand 1 in vietnam and 1 in cambodia generate hydroelectricity while only one dam ubol ratana located in thailand is also used for irrigation the characteristics country ownership status storage and purpose of the 19 modeled dams are shown in table s2 in supplementary materials as our available data period is from 1983 to 2007 we consider 6 dams all completed and operated before 2007 as the baseline dam scenario with total storage of 12 463 million cubic meters mcm and in total 19 dams are modeled with the total storage of 76 215 mcm in the dam development scenario fig 1 climatic drivers that may affect the streamflow include precipitation temperature wind humidity vapor pressure solar radiation and others tian et al 2018 precipitation p and temperature t are the two main climatic drivers considered in this study several previous studies have quantified the impact of climate change on future precipitation and temperature across the mrb hasson et al 2016 hoang et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 in general precipitation and temperature projections vary with representative concentration pathways rcps and gcms based on future precipitation and temperature projections of these available studies we conduct a climate stress test with five precipitation change levels p 0 15 30 15 and 30 and four temperature change levels t 0 c 1 5 c 3 c and 4 5 c to cover the possible range of future climate conditions brown et al 2012 the tested temperature increase scenarios fit with the rcp 2 6 1 5 c and rcp 8 5 3 c projections for the period of 2050 2093 under the ensemble gcm results tested by ruan et al 2019 changes in precipitation and temperature are applied to daily historical data period from 1983 to 2007 precipitation data is obtained from the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards the evaluation of water resources project yatagai et al 2012 and temperature data is obtained from the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr saha et al 2010 therefore 40 scenarios are considered in this study as a joint dam and climate sensitivity test which consist of 2 dam development scenarios and 20 4 5 climate change conditions table s3 shown in supplementary materials the scenario containing the baseline dams 6 dams with no precipitation or temperature changes is defined as the baseline scenario other data required to run the coupled abm swat model include reservoir characteristics such as operational rule and storage geographic linkages of different agents and ecosystem hotspots elevation obtained from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds database land use obtained from spatial production allocation model spam database for 2005 land cover obtained from the global land cover 2000 database soil from the fao unesco cropped area estimated based on the spam database and meteorological data such as solar radiation wind speed humidity obtained from ncep cfsr with the data period from 1983 to 2007 3 methods 3 1 coupled abm swat model the coupled abm swat model developed by khan et al 2017a is used for cross system analysis between hec and nhr the abm allows each agent to make its own behavior rule about the water use preferences agricultural irrigation hydroelectricity generation or water for ecosystem health in the mrb by considering the behavioral rule in each agent this coupled modeling framework reflects real world human adaptive decisions better than a simple process based hydrological model the water use preferences of each agent are determined and set based on a comprehensive e survey khan et al 2017b water use rankings in each agent are shown in table s4 in supplementary materials in the swat model the 12 agents in the basin are further divided into 289 sub basins to better simulate the spatial variations of hydrologic process fig 1 each sub basin has several hydrological response units with similar soils land use land cover and slope which are then used to simulate runoff generation the swat is calibrated period from 1983 to 1992 and validated period from 1993 to 2007 based on streamflow data obtained from l institut de recherche pour le développement the nash sutcliffe coefficient of the swat calibration and validation for ten gauging stations are mostly over 0 8 indicating a relatively good performance of the model khan et al 2017a besides running the swat model following the behavioral rules set in abm this coupled model also allows each agent to observe the impact of their behavior rule and to make corresponding changes based on the output in swat the two way coupled model can better represent the interaction between the nature and human the abm and swat models interact on an annual time scale at the end of each year agents update their decisions on dam operations and crop area based on the comparisons between swat outputs such as streamflow crop yield reservoir storage and release from that year and the initial target setting for example if agriculture production ranks first and the actual crop production is lower than the target the agent will increase the irrigated area if hydropower generation ranks first and the actual production is smaller than the target agent will decrease number of days to reach the target dam storage however if the ecosystem health ranks first and the streamflow does not reach the target the agent will not take any measures no matter crop and hydropower production reach their targets or not then the swat model uses the new settings to simulate the runoff for the coming year the model workflow and more technical details for the coupled model can be found in khan et al 2017a 3 2 calculation of impact on baseline hec this study uses the flow regime variation to reflect the impact on baseline hec first the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha method including 33 hydroecological parameters richter et al 1996 1998 is selected these parameters represent different aspect of flow conditions that can potentially influence the ecosystem for example the 7 day annual maximal and minimal flow are well known descriptors of dam impact as well as the 30 day annual maximal and minimal flow reflect dry or wet years in the mrb baran et al 2015 more general interlinks between iha parameters and corresponding ecosystem influences can be found in table s5 in supplementary materials then the range of variability approach rva richter et al 1997 is employed to assess the flow regime change by analyzing variations of the 33 iha parameters under different climate and dam development scenarios compared to the baseline we acknowledge that iha rva are intended to start with a natural flow regime as the baseline to represent potential deviation from desired ecological state however given the data availability is after 1983 in this study the truly natural flow regime for the mrb is difficult to assess to inform policy we alternatively define the flow condition from 1983 to 2007 as a baseline scenario and then compare the flow condition under climate change and or dam development condition with the baseline in this setting we assume higher flow regime variation that is hec away from the baseline is less desirable and may lead to more serious potential ecosystem degradation and ecological loss we use the following four steps to compute the impact on baseline hec for each ecosystem hotspot in the mrb 1 determine the baseline flow condition in this study the output of the abm swat model under the baseline scenario is defined as the baseline flow condition then 33 iha parameters values for each year at each hotspot are calculated based on the baseline daily streamflow data inside the boundary of the hotspot 2 determine the environmental flow target of each iha parameter following richter et al 1997 the 25th and 75th percentile ranges of multiyear iha parameter values under the baseline scenario calculated in step 1 are selected as the flow target to maintain the baseline local hec 3 run the abm swat model for altered climate and dam development scenarios and calculate the 33 iha parameters for each year at each hotspot in these 39 scenarios 4 calculate the hydrologic alteration degree to quantify the flow regime variation richter et al 1998 the hydrologic alteration degree hadi of each iha parameter is evaluated as follows 1 ha d i na s i n b s i nb s i 100 where ha d i is the hydrologic alteration degree of ith iha parameter in the future scenario compared to the baseline scenario na s i is the number of years for which the multiyear iha parameter values under the altered climate change and dam development scenarios obtained in step 3 falling into the baseline environmental flow target and nb s i is the number of years for which the multiyear iha parameter values under the baseline scenario obtained in step 1 falling into the baseline environmental flow target the hydrologic alteration degree varies with the iha parameter shiau and wu 2004 some values may increase while others may decrease it is difficult to directly use 33 iha parameters at the same time to assess the tradeoffs between hec and nhr for policy makings therefore in this study we use eq 2 to calculate the comprehensive hydrologic alteration degree chad which is the mathematical definition of impact on baseline hec compared to the baseline scenario in this study considering 33 iha parameters in future scenarios compared to the baseline scenario 2 chad i 1 33 ha d i 2 33 this mathematical mean summarizes ecologically relevant flow alterations giving us a common standard for comparison across hotspots however it does not in itself give any indication of the actual ecological state of a system actual potential ecosystem states that may arise from specific iha parameter values need further investigation with more detailed ecological studies following richter et al 1998 the chad value ranges from 0 to 100 while larger chad value indicates that hec is away from the baseline and less desired a value of 0 means no change from baseline again not natural flow regime but baseline and 100 means complete change from baseline 3 3 calculation of impact on nhr in this study we focus on two natural hazards the lowest flow in the dry season and the peak flow in the wet season both having major impacts on agricultural productivity and economic development economist intelligence unit 2017 we use the change in nhr to reflect the potential impact of both lowest flow and peak flow events on economic losses nhr is statistically defined as the occurrence probability of the streamflow higher or lower than a threshold in this study to compare the impact on nhr at each agent the risk both lowest flow and peak flow of the baseline scenario for each agent is assigned to be the same this concept is similar to the identification of hydrologic events by the streamflow drought index sdi a widely applied hydrological drought index calculated based on long term streamflow data including both wet and dry period nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 this index is analogous to the standardized precipitation index spi a normalized index and the low flow event and high flow event can be represented similarly angelidis et al 2012 following the sdi concept hydrologic events can be characterized as extreme severe moderate and mild nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 extreme and severe low flow and high flow events hydrologic events that may lead to higher economic loss compared to other kinds of events both have an occurrence probability of 6 7 this also indicates that extreme and severe low flow events have a flow value with a cumulative probability smaller than 6 7 while the extreme and severe high flow events have a flow value with a cumulative probability higher than 93 3 fig 2 in this study we separate the dry and wet season to identify the lowest flow and peak flow as flow patterns in the mekong are entirely different for wet and dry seasons intralawan et al 2018 for easy calculation we assume the dry season is from january to june and the wet season is from july to december for all 12 agents the streamflow for each agent is divided into two ranges acceptable and unacceptable fig 2 unacceptable events are the lowest flow and peak flow with the occurrence probability equal to 6 7 based on the sdi concept this also indicates that the occurrence probabilities i e risk defined in this study of lowest flow and peak flow are both 6 7 in the baseline scenario a four step process is used to calculate the impact on nhr for each agent 1 determine the best fit probability distribution function of the baseline flow in general peak flow affects ecosystem and human society by a fast and relatively short term process while the lowest flow will have a slow and long term effect van loon 2015 due to these different characteristics we use the daily flow data for peak flow risk pfr calculation and monthly flow data for the lowest flow risk lfr calculation data series both from 1983 to 2007 first four probability distribution functions including gamma weibull rayleigh and lognormal are employed in this study as candidates to fit the flow distribution daily flow in the wet season or monthly flow in the dry season the best fit function is determined based on the root mean square error rmse which reflects the difference between the theoretical cumulative probability pt and empirical cumulative probability pe shown in eq 3 3 rmse 1 n 1 i 1 n p e p t 2 lower rmse value is better because pt has a better ability to match pe pe is calculated by the gringorten formula in eq 4 gringorten 1963 4 p e p x x i m 1 i n m 0 44 n 0 12 where n m is the number counted as x x i x i is the streamflow value and n represents the total number of streamflow data the values 0 44 and 0 12 in eq 4 are empirical constraints gringorten 1963 the equations to calculate the pt of gamma weibull rayleigh and lognormal are shown in eqs 5 8 respectively 5 p t f x a b 1 b

shape parameter b is the scale parameter and u and σ are the mean and deviation of the streamflow values respectively the parameters of each distribution function are estimated by a matlab function 2 determine the acceptable and unacceptable flow range diagram shown in fig 2 based on the determined best function for the baseline flow in step 1 the upper streamflow value of the unacceptable lowest flow event that is lower acceptable flow value laf is calculated by the cumulative probability of 6 7 and the lower streamflow value of the unacceptable peak flow event that is the upper acceptable flow value uaf can also be computed by the cumulative probability of 93 3 3 run the abm swat model for altered climate and dam development scenarios and determine the best fit distribution function similarly as in step 1 and the corresponding parameters of the rest of the 39 scenarios 4 based on the upper lower streamflow value of the unacceptable lowest flow peak flow event determined in step 2 and the best fit distribution function of the altered flow determined in step 3 calculate the upper lower cumulative occurrence probability of the unacceptable lowest flow peak flow event for the altered climate change and dam development scenarios fig 2 then calculate the occurrence probabilities the mathematical definition of nhr in this study of the unacceptable lowest flow and peak flow events under the altered climate change and dam development scenarios lfr2 and pfr2 shown in fig 2 the lfr and pfr calculation equations are shown in 9 and 10 respectively 9 lfr u p p e r c u m u l a

impact on baseline hec fig 3 demonstrates chad values that quantify the change of hec under dam development without climate change condition the chad value is plotted on the y axis and ecosystem hotspots are on the x axis note that ecosystem hotspots are ordered alphabetically from left to right which is approximately upstream to downstream not in chronological order larger chad value means hec is away from the baseline and is less desirable the impacts on mainstream hotspots hec are somewhat higher than those in the tributaries this is because more dams with higher storage are located upstream of mainstream higher dam regulation capacity leads to higher streamflow variation and flow regime change among the hotspots in the tributaries hec in hotspot l m and n is affected because there are two dams xepian xenamnoy and xe kaman 1 with total storage of 7 204 mcm upstream of these hotspots further considered in the dam development scenario the chad values for other hotspots are equal to 0 because there are no dams upstream of these hotspots further considered in the dam development scenario compared to the baseline focusing on the mainstream hotspots the impact on upstream hec hotspot a to i is higher than impacts on downstream hotspots hotspot j to w a possible reason is that more dams are further considered in the dam development scenario compared to the baseline thus affecting the mainstream flow that upstream hotspots highly depends upon a majority of streamflow in downstream hotspots coming from tributaries li et al 2017 can mitigate the upstream dam development impact to a certain extent 4 1 2 climate change impact on baseline hec fig 4 a and b demonstrates chad results under climate change scenarios reflecting the impact of precipitation and temperature change on hec compared to the baseline scenario for easy comparison the scale is the same as that of the baseline scenario in fig 3 following a single line from left to right in fig 4 a correlates to moving downstream which demonstrates a decreasing trend streamflow at tributary hotspots is smaller but with higher inter annual variations compared to those of the mainstream hotspots this flow pattern results in a relatively larger flow range in the baseline condition to sustain the local aquatic ecosystem health therefore the impact on baseline hec by precipitation change of these hotspots is lower than that in the mainstream hotspots next we compare different lines in fig 4 a the results show that impacts on baseline hec by larger precipitation variation precipitation 30 are higher than those with lower precipitation variation precipitation 15 which is expected larger precipitation variation leads to larger streamflow changes in fig 4 a at the same precipitation change condition precipitation decreases basically result in higher chad values which correlates to negative impacts on baseline local aquatic ecosystems this is because the modeling results show that river streamflow variations after being consumed by agricultural irrigation and hydroelectricity generation are higher in precipitation decrease scenarios than in precipitation increase scenarios furthermore the distances between four chad lines under four precipitation change conditions are larger in the upstream than those in the downstream this result indicates that upstream hec is more sensitive to precipitation change than the downstream since the upstream region of the mrb is characterized by narrow and steep gorges thompson et al 2013 terrain causes rapid rise and recession during the hydrological process limiting the precipitation redistribution capacity therefore with the same precipitation variation percentage larger flow variation is observed upstream fig 4 b demonstrates the impacts of temperature change on baseline hec from upstream left to downstream right a declining trend is observed from left to right similar to fig 4 a this effect is caused by lower inter annual variation in streamflow at mainstream hotspots which then leads to higher chad values by temperature change comparing different temperature change levels in fig 4 b the impact of temperature change on baseline local hec is not consistent unlike the pattern of precipitation change in fig 4 a temperature is an important factor that affects irrigation water demand and crop production in the swat model different crops have different suitable temperature ranges and temperature increases lead to inconsistent crop growth and irrigation water demand change resulting in an inconsistent trend of impact on baseline local hec by temperature change in summary the impact of a temperature increase of 4 5 c is the highest among the three temperature increase conditions due to the higher evaporation and higher flow decrease 4 1 3 joint impact of dam development and climate change on baseline hec the chad results under two dam development levels together with 20 climate change levels are shown in fig 5 with the same x and y axes as in figs 3 and 4 the 20 diagrams refers to 20 climate change levels in each diagram the solid line and the dot represent baseline and dam development scenarios respectively this figure aims to show the impact on baseline local hec by precipitation change column to column comparison by temperature change row to row comparison and by dam development in each climate change diagram difference of chad values between baseline and dam development conditions simultaneously fig 5 shows that the difference between chad values under baseline and dam development conditions with no precipitation change third column is the highest this difference gradually decreases with extreme precipitation first and fifth columns as shown in fig 4 a precipitation change impact on baseline local hec without dam development varies significantly and the impact dramatically increases under p 30 however fig 5 shows that the impact of dam development is greater than that of climate change resulting in similar chad values across all precipitation and temperature change conditions that is all chad values under the dam development condition all dots are at approximately the same horizontal level fig 5 also demonstrates that the impact of temperature is less distinguishable than precipitation when comparing different temperature scenarios in different rows also chad values under dam development conditions are above the values in the baseline dam condition under the p 15 p 30 and p 0 precipitation conditions this indicates that under these four precipitation change conditions dam construction may be not a good choice for maintaining the baseline local hec however under the p 30 condition the difference is smaller than the other four precipitation conditions also chad values under dam development condition are below those values under the baseline dam condition in hotspots i j k m n p and v these findings indicate that dam construction with larger streamflow regulation capacity may increase the low flow and reduce the streamflow variation degree which can slightly mitigate the impact of precipitation and temperature change on baseline hec under extreme precipitation decrease condition in these hotspots 4 2 impact on nhr 4 2 1 dam development impact on nhr according to the method in section 3 3 for lowest flow event identification the best fit probability distribution function of streamflow for agents 7 and 11 in the baseline scenario is gamma while that for other agents is lognormal for peak flow event identification the best fit probability distribution function of streamflow for agent 9 in the baseline scenario is gamma while that for the other agents is weibull we use these functions to further calculate the nhr in 39 future scenarios fig 6 a demonstrates the laf and uaf for each agent while fig 6 b shows the upper lower cumulative probability of lowest flow and peak flow for altered flow lfcp and pfcp respectively under the scenario with dam development and no climate change higher lfcp represents higher unacceptable lfr while higher pfcp represents lower unacceptable pfr agents 7 and 11 are located at the tributaries the nhr in these two agents is not affected by dam development lfcp and pfcp equal to 6 7 and 93 3 respectively same with the values in the baseline scenario for the other ten agents lfcp values are all smaller than 6 7 and pfcp values are all higher than 93 3 meaning lfr and pfr decrease with dam development due to the higher streamflow regulation capacity of more dams these findings are consistent with some previous studies lacombe et al 2014 lauri et al 2012 matthews and motta 2015 piman et al 2012 the lfcp values in each agent affected by dam development are approximately 0 for all while the pfcp values are all over 96 6 when we compare pfcp with 93 3 the pfr decrease in the upstream agents is relatively less this is because most dam developments are placed upstream with higher storage increase more dams mainly used for hydroelectricity generation may lead to relatively lower water release variation and lower pfr variation which highly depends on mainstream flow 4 2 2 impacts of climate change on nhr fig 7 a and b demonstrate the impact on lfr and pfr under future precipitation change scenarios without temperature change or dam development the x axis shows the agent number approximately upstream to downstream from left to right but not the chronological order while the y axis represents the nhr value the occurrence probability of unacceptable events larger nhr values may lead to larger potential economic losses precipitation decrease results in increased lfr fig 7a and decreased pfr fig 7b as expected and vice versa next we focus on nhr variation between a single bar either precipitation decrease or increase with the precipitation remained unchanged bar from left to right the same precipitation change results in higher lfr red bars and pfr blue bars variations in the upstream agents when compared to the downstream agents these results suggest that nhr variation in the upstream is more sensitive to precipitation possibly due to the upstream steep terrain characteristic resulting in larger hydrologic variations 4 2 3 impacts of climate change and dam development on nhr the lfr and pfr results under two dam development scenarios together with 20 climate change levels i e 40 scenarios are shown in fig 8 with the same x and y axes as fig 7 in each diagram solid red and blue lines represent the results of lfr and pfr respectively when no additional dam is considered dash red and blue lines represent the results of lfr and pfr respectively with future dam development again the x axis represents agent order basically from upstream to downstream rather than in the chronological order under the precipitation decrease conditions lfr decreases with dam development and the difference between lowest flow risk under baseline and dam development condition under the p 30 condition is the largest and it gradually approaches the no precipitation change scenario third column therefore the reduction of lfr by dam development under p 30 is the highest because the larger capacity of dams further increases low flow when precipitation decreases similarly under the precipitation increase conditions pfr decreases with dam development in addition the difference of pfr between the baseline and dam development condition for p 30 condition is the largest and it gradually approaches the p 0 scenario higher regulation capacity of dam development is mostly beneficial when streamflow increases as more dams can further decrease the high flow in fig 8 the difference between the natural hazard risk no matter under baseline or dam development condition in different rows is hardly visible indicating that the temperature impact on nhr variation is very small 5 discussion 5 1 cross system analysis between hec and nhr to inform policy to quantify the tradeoffs between hec and nhr under dam development and climate change we label each hotspot where the most downstream sub basins located into an agent and calculate the average chad for each agent because there are no hotspots in agents 2 5 and 7 and dam development will not affect agent 11 this tradeoff analysis only focuses on agent 1 upper mekong in china agent 3 northern thailand chiang rai agent 4 northern laos agent 6 central laos agent 8 southern laos agent 9 se san sre pok se kong agent 10 cambodia kratie and agent 12 mekong delta fig 9 demonstrates the tradeoff analysis among chad lfr and pfr for those selected agents under two extreme climate change conditions the left subplot demonstrates the temperature increase 4 5 c and precipitation increase 30 for the hot and wet condition in this condition we focus on peak flow events the right subplot demonstrates the temperature increase 4 5 c and precipitation decrease 30 for the hot and dry condition and we focus on lowest flow events since it is unlikely that the temperature will go down we only test these two extreme climate conditions different colors represent different agents the symbols o and x indicate results under baseline and dam development scenarios respectively therefore moving from symbol o to x reflects the impact of dam development since the highest values of all these axes are negative movement toward to the left bottom is ideal the star in the left subplot fig 9a all agents have movements toward the upper left this indicates that dam development reduces pfr but causes chad increase in all regions these results indicate that all regions have to trade the economic benefit reduced pfr with ecological cost increased chad in fig 9b similar horizontal movements to the left are observed therefore dam development can mitigate lfr under the hot and dry scenario for all agents however unlike fig 9a chad values in different agents show different movements in the hot and dry condition the chad values in agents 1 3 and 9 show upward movement in the magnitude of 6 indicating these agents do need to further consider the tradeoffs between ecological cost increased chad and economic benefit reduced lfr especially agent 1 the chad values in agent 4 basically remain unchanged and in agent 6 8 10 and 12 show downward movement meaning these agents do not have the tradeoff between ecological cost and economic benefit by dam development under this future climatic condition it is noteworthy that the storage increase in dam development scenario in agent 1 upper mekong in china is the highest it will also suffer more ecological loss among these 8 agents in the tradeoff analysis under these two extreme climate change conditions in addition dam development impact on baseline hec under the hot and wet condition is relatively higher than that under the hot and dry condition all additional dams tested in this paper are in the upper mekong in china agent 1 northern and central laos agent 4 and 6 and the 3 s basin agent 9 these four agents also show the highest impact on baseline hec under the hot and wet condition these indicate the dam development relatively causing a local effect under the hot and wet condition 5 2 limitations and potential future work this study attempts to quantify the impact of dam development and climate change on baseline hec and nhr to inform better transboundary water resources management however we acknowledge several limitations that require further evaluations in the future studies first we assume that hec away from the baseline is less desirable however the baseline flow is not necessarily the optimal flow condition to sustain ecosystem health as desired habitat conditions vary with fish species at a specific time and space barbour et al 2016 more efforts should be devoted to determining the target fish species and its corresponding desired ecological state in each hotspot for better transboundary tradeoff analysis in addition the large scale hydroecological data needed for the relationship analysis may be also be a constraint pastor et al 2014 second we only evaluate the impact on streamflow dam development and climate change may also result in the relocation of people kuenzer et al 2013 changed irrigation capacity kondolf et al 2014 landscape changes zhao et al 2012 interruption of fish mitigation dugan et al 2010 and biodiversity degradation ziv et al 2012 it is also worth mentioning the sedimentation issue in the mrb dams catching sediment have reduced the sediment transport and enlarged the ground subsidence thus leading to the increasing salt water intrusion in the coastal areas together with the sand extraction and rising sea level caused by global warming schmitt et al 2017 a more comprehensive impact assessment that consider all these aspects caused by dam when more dams characteristics available and climate change considering more climatic drivers is desired but challenging third we simply apply a blanket ratio to the precipitation and temperature record to reflect the possible precipitation and temperature changes these two climatic drivers patterns may also change leading to altered flow patterns which should be emphasized in projected climate change impact analysis evers and pathirana 2018 furthermore shorter timescale analyses such as seasonal or even monthly flow abnormal variations in the mrb are important li et al 2018 but ignored in this study anomalous conditions e g wet season abnormal low flow should be further identified throughout the year when the hazard threshold for different time period are determined in each agent this can provide better support for transboundary policy makings besides other drivers such as population growth land use change urbanization vegetation deterioration agricultural expansion that may also affect hec and nhr grumbine et al 2012 should be considered finally due to data availability limitations nearly all accessible hydrologic stations located in the mainstream of the mrb will affect the swat calibration especially in the large tributaries such as the agent 7 mui river and agent 11 tonle sap the results in these two agents can be misleading such as the very low laf values shown in fig 6 using these results for policymaking should be avoided 6 conclusions given the rapid industrialization and population growth in the mrb many dams have been planned or constructed to satisfy growing demands for food energy and fresh water these dams together with climate change may affect natural flow regimes in ecosystem hotspots and the natural hazard risk in this basin some regions may gain benefits while some may experience losses caused by dam development under different climate change conditions which may escalate geopolitical conflicts in this transboundary river basin this study assesses the impact of dam development and climate change on baseline local hec and nhr and then presents the cross system analysis between hec and nhr which can be used to inform transboundary policy a coupled abm swat model khan et al 2017a is applied to simulate streamflow dam operation and irrigation in the basin both hec and nhr are quantified by streamflow results forty scenarios including two with dam development five with precipitation changes and four with temperature changes are tested the modeling results demonstrate that 1 precipitation changes have a greater influence on baseline local hec and nhr than temperature changes 2 upstream hec and nhr variations are more sensitive to precipitation and 3 negative impacts on baseline local hec by dam development is more serious under the hot and wet condition than the hot and dry condition under the hot and wet extreme climate condition tradeoffs between reduced pfr and increased chad by dam development in upper mekong in china northern and central laos and se san sre pok and se kong basin require special attention under the hot and dry condition dam development may reduce the negative impact on baseline hec and lfr in central and southern laos the kratie area in cambodia and mekong delta if the storage capacity can be used in a flexible manner since the methods employed in this paper are all statistical the rva the iha and the nhr calculation they can potentially be applied to other river basins to support hec and nhr analyses under changing environments future studies should consider a full scale economic impact analysis hec indicators that also include water quality and fish migration address the sedimentation issue of dam development and test more exogenous drivers such as humidity solar radiation population growth land use change agricultural expansion

6046,sand mining has significant impacts on the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes of river lake systems recently continuous sand mining has occurred in poyang lake a large floodplain lake connected to the yangtze river previous studies on the impact of sand mining in poyang lake focused on water level variations however the influence of different magnitudes of sand mining on the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes in such a complex river lake floodplain system is unclear the current study aims to address this issue by combining a hydrodynamic model and hydrological data based on average conditions 2000 2010 the influences of 1 4 m uniform sand mining in the northern lake on water levels and outflows were quantified and the spatial and temporal impacts of cumulative sand mining 1998 2010 on current speeds and residence times were further assessed the results showed that the elevations of the thalwegs in the northern outlet channels decreased unevenly from 1998 to 2010 the water levels decreased cumulatively but nonlinearly with increasing sand mining mining 1 4 m of sand caused cumulative water level decreases of 0 55 2 14 m in the northern channels when the water levels were lower than 14 m due to cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 the current speeds in the northern mining channels generally decreased and those in the central channels mostly increased with the majority varying from 0 4 to 0 4 m s the residence time changes were opposite to the current speed changes with 4 to 10 day variations the opposite outflow variations between uniform mining and realistic uneven mining indicated that outflow variations depended on the mining magnitudes and bed slope changes the above results suggested that for this river connected floodplain lake sand mining in outlet channels enhanced the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the lake hydrodynamics and that the blocking effect of the connected large river impacted the hydrodynamic variation patterns this study leads to better understanding of the effects of different magnitudes of sand mining on the hydrologic and hydrodynamic regimes in poyang lake and provides a reference for quantifying similar human activities in complex floodplain lakes keywords sand mining cumulative effect hydrodynamic model low water level poyang lake 1 introduction sand mining for building construction and other infrastructure development is widespread in most developing and developed countries padmalal and maya 2014 in particular in some developing countries such as india padmalal et al 2008 ramkumar et al 2015 china lai et al 2014 and iran sadeghi and harchegani 2012 rapid economic development has driven strong growth in the sand mining de leeuw et al 2010 sand mining directly results in bathymetric changes and triggers wave transformation and flow variability byrnes et al 2004 maa et al 2004 as a result the renewal ability of the water is changed accordingly malhadas et al 2009 hossain et al 2004 sand mining also influences the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration van maren et al 2015 and sediment transport patterns byrnes et al 2004 disturbing the natural erosion and deposition patterns jonge 1983 additionally both the substance distribution in water and water exchange are affected hossain et al 2004 chubarenko and tchepikova 2001 the increased turbidity and sediment concentrations from sand mining have adverse impacts on aquatic organisms erftemeijer and robin lewis 2006 meng et al 2018 luo et al 2007 quantified the effect of sand mining in the pearl river delta based on field surveys and river hypsography they found that the water levels in upstream areas decreased by 1 59 3 12 m and that the divided flow ratios between various water courses were changed due to uneven sand mining duan et al 2019 used satellite data to depict the appearance time and number of sand mining vessels in lake hongze and quantified the increase in suspended particulate matter due to sand mining sharip and zaki 2014 illustrated the impacts of sand mining on the dynamics of the thermal structure and water quality in bukit merah lake indicating that sand mining led to an increase in turbidity exceeding 100 ntu and an enhanced temperature gradient river connected floodplain lakes have complex topographies and bathymetries upon which hydrological and hydrodynamic processes strongly depend baugh et al 2013 french 2008 floodplain lakes are characterised by hydrological phases of riverine to lake and lake to riverine transitions townsend 2006 with extensive seasonally inundated areas lesack and melack 1995 sand mining changes the topography and bathymetry and enhances the inhomogeneous characteristics of hydrology and hydrodynamics in addition to changing the water level and inundation extent hardy et al 1999 malhadas et al 2009 marks et al 2000 sand mining in floodplain channels which play a key role in hydrodynamic exchange and sediment transport trigg et al 2012 changes the patterns of water and mass transport of entire river floodplain systems a prominent example of how sand mining affects hydrology and hydrodynamics is the regime changes to poyang lake the largest freshwater lake with the most extensive floodplain in china zhang and werner 2015 as an internationally important wetland and the largest bird conservation area for migratory birds worldwide poyang lake has important ecological functions hui et al 2008 the lake receives catchment runoff from five tributary rivers and subsequently discharges into the yangtze river through the northern outlet of the lake spatio temporal heterogeneity in floodplain systems due to river lake interactions makes understanding the highly dynamic hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes more challenging since 2000 poyang lake has been severely dry zhang et al 2014 compared to the levels reported in previous decades the lake water levels dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded from 2001 to 2010 zhang et al 2014 resulting in significant decreases in the lake area feng et al 2012a previous studies suggested that the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river was the primary cause of the frequently low lake levels in autumn yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 while decreased catchment inflows were responsible for the low water levels in spring feng et al 2012 yao et al 2016 sand mining was also found to play an important role in triggering water level decreases during the dry season in winter lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2018 intense sand mining in poyang lake was initiated in 2000 sand mining was concentrated in the northern part of poyang lake prior to 2008 and has expanded southwards since 2009 li et al 2014 the total volume of mined sand was approximately 1 29 109 m3 from 2000 to 2010 almost 6 5 times the volume of natural sediment that accumulated from 1955 to 2010 jiang et al 2015 sand mining has led to an annual extraction of sand that is 20 times greater than the natural deposition level de leeuw et al 2010 due to extensive sand mining the bed elevation of the north outflow channel has decreased by approximately 5 9 m during the past decade lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 used medium resolution satellite images to construct annual and quasi annual topographic maps of poyang lake from 2000 to 2010 and found that the average elevation of the lakebed decreased by 14 4 cm yr from 2000 to 2010 lai et al 2014 combined survey and remote sensing data to examine the impact of sand mining on the low water levels and the results showed that the discharge ability of the lake into the yangtze river during the dry season increased 1 5 2 times due to sand mining ye et al 2018 used a back propagation neural network bpnn model and found that sand mining resulted in an average decrease in the annual water level of 0 26 0 75 m across the lake from 2000 to 2014 additionally the annual lake water level decline had a long term increasing trend suggesting the cumulative effects of sand mining yao et al 2018 used a hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of bathymetric changes 1998 2010 on the hydrological regimes in poyang lake from 2000 to 2010 the results showed that the water levels in the northern channels decreased by 1 2 2 m during low water level periods despite several efforts to evaluate the effects of sand mining on poyang lake water levels questions regarding how different magnitudes of mining affect lake hydrology and how lake hydrodynamics for example current speed and residence time respond to cumulative sand mining remain unanswered and must be addressed in particular a deteriorating water quality trend has been observed at the interannual scale in poyang lake wu et al 2017 as the basis of material transport the spatial and temporal changes in the lake hydrodynamics should be assessed to better understand the causes of water quality variations this paper extends previous studies by examining the effects of different magnitudes of sand mining on the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes of a river connected floodplain lake poyang lake by combining a hydrodynamic model and long term hydrological data the objectives of this paper are to 1 analyse bathymetric changes in poyang lake caused by cumulative sand mining in the 2000s and consequent water head changes 2 quantify the influence of the various magnitudes of sand mining on the water levels and outflow and 3 further investigate the spatial and temporal influence of cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 on the lake current speed and residence time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data poyang lake is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 28 24 29 46 n 115 49 116 46 e fig 1 spanning 170 km from north to south and approximately 74 km from east to west the catchment area of poyang lake is 1 62 105 km2 the catchment has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1654 mm an average temperature of 17 6 c and an annual potential evapotranspiration of 1049 mm year zhang et al 2014 shaped by a combination of lacustrine and riverine morphological processes poyang lake is characterised by complex topography including narrow channels islands and large floodplain areas the elevation of the lake bottom is less than 2 m in the northern channels and greater than 14 m in the southern deltas wusong datum which is also the water surface elevation system used in this study generally decreasing from south upstream to north downstream fig 1 poyang lake receives inflows from five rivers in the catchment the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers fig 1a poyang lake exchanges water with the yangtze river via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1a however a time lag exists in the peak discharge of the yangtze river july september relative to the maximum catchment inflow april june as a result poyang lake experiences four hydrological periods a period of rising water level march june a high water level period july august a period of receding water level september october and a low water level period november february yao et al 2018 during the low and rising water level periods the water level of poyang lake is mainly controlled by variations in the catchment inflows hu et al 2007 shankman et al 2006 during the high and receding water level periods changes in the yangtze river discharge strongly influence the outflow from poyang lake by a blocking effect hu et al 2007 as a result the annual average water level fluctuates by 8 18 m with the lake area varying from less than 1000 km2 to more than 3000 km2 feng et al 2012a creating highly complex floodplains zhang and werner 2015 despite the occurrence of thermal stratification in the center area and eastern bay during summer li et al 2018 poyang lake is generally well mixed depending on seasonal hydrological forcings within the lake rather than on meteorological conditions li et al 2016 it has high spatial variability in current speed and residence time the current speed in channels up to 1 0 m s is higher than that in the floodplains generally lower than 0 2 m s li et al 2015 consequently the average residence times in channels are less than 10 days during the low water level period and those in most floodplains are approximately 30 days li et al 2015 only in some bays can the average residence times reach more than six months due to the local topography li et al 2015 the daily water levels at five gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan as shown in fig 1a from 1960 to 2016 were used to represent the water levels in the downstream central and upstream areas of poyang lake the runoff amounts for the five major rivers from 2000 to 2010 were used to represent the catchment inflows digital elevation models dems of poyang lake from 1 10 000 maps surveyed in 1998 and 2010 were used to describe the realistic bathymetric changes due to sand mining all data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china 2 2 statistical methods the sequential version of the mann kendall m k test which has been widely used in hydrological and hydrodynamic studies elshemy et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 was employed to identify change points for water head in this study for any samples of n variables x 1 x 2 x n the m k rank statistic d k is calculated as the summation of m i which is the number of later terms in the series whose values exceed x i 1 d k i 1 k m i 2 k n the mean and variance of the test statistic d k are as follows 2 e d k k k 1 4 3 var d k k k 1 2 k 5 72 the sequential values of the statistic uf d k are then calculated as follows 4 uf d k d k e d k v a r d k in the equation uf d k 1 k n values constitute a forward sequence curve uf and the backward sequence curve ub is estimated using the inverted data series by the same method the intersection of uf and ub within the confidence interval indicates the time when a change point occurs 2 3 hydrodynamic model a hydrodynamic model was used to examine the hydrologic and hydrodynamic influences of bathymetric changes due to sand mining a refined hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was established based on 1998 dem and 2010 dem respectively yao et al 2018 the model was based on mike 21 which was developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi dhi 2012 the hydrodynamic model had 347 709 triangular elements with variable grid sizes of 37 467 m for differentiating the lake topography at different scales spatially varying manning s roughness coefficients were used for the friction coefficient from 0 018 s m1 3 in the channels to 0 028 s m1 3 in the floodplains the time step was 1 5 s the daily catchment inflows from the five major rivers were combined with the runoff from the ungauged catchment area zhang et al 2014 and specified as the upstream boundary conditions the daily observed water levels at hukou were used to define the downstream boundary condition the hydrodynamic model using the 2010 dem was calibrated against the observed water levels at four gauging stations in the lake and the outflow at hukou station for the period of january december 2010 the model using the 1998 dem which had the same mesh and parameter settings as the 2010 model was validated against the observations at the same stations from march 1997 to march 1998 in both the calibrations and validations of the two dem models the nash sutcliffe efficency coefficients of the water levels were greater than 0 96 and the determination coefficients of the outflow were greater than 0 92 suggesting that the accuracy was satisfactory other details regarding the construction of the model are described in yao et al 2018 2 4 simulation scenarios considering that sand mining in poyang lake has mostly occurred since 2000 and that the latest dem is from 2010 the annual average conditions from 2000 to 2010 were chosen to represent the average hydrologic conditions reflecting the impact of the cumulative sand mining from 2000 to 2010 based on various sand mining conditions in the northern area table 1 six scenarios were developed to simulate the same 2000 2010 average conditions the same boundary conditions were used to exclude the impact of different hydrological conditions scenario s0 represented the 1998 dem condition comparison of 1999 and 2007 satellite imagery revealed that the bottom of the outlet channel was lowered by 59 cm year 1 due to the sand mining in poyang lake de leeuw et al 2010 lai et al 2014 compared the channel profiles measured in 2013 and extracted from the 1998 dem and a series of satellite images during 2002 2014 in poyang lake s outflow channels illustrating that along with channel depth channel width also increased significantly considering the increases in both channel depth and width and the 3 m of averaged bed erosion across the whole northern part of poyang lake yao et al 2018 scenarios s1 to s4 were set to simulate a bed elevation decrease from 1 to 4 m in the whole northern area based on the 1998 dem fig 1a which allowed us to assess the effects of different magnitudes of sand mining scenario s5 represented the 2010 dem condition the cumulative effects of sand mining on hydrodynamics current speed and residence time were assessed by comparing the 2010 and 1998 dems s5 s0 2 5 residence time to assess the influence of sand mining on the renewal capacity of poyang lake the residence times were further calculated based on a conservative tracer simulation under the 2000 2010 average conditions the tracer simulation ran from 1 july to 31 december a homogeneous concentration of 1 kg m3 was set as the initial concentration of each element in the whole lake while the inflow concentrations were zero and the outflow was set with a zero concentration gradient subsequently the tracer concentration decreased due to the effects of convection and diffusion the e folding time which is a widely used concept for quantifying the residence times of lakes li et al 2015 monsen et al 2002 nguyen et al 2014 was used to calculate the residence time that is the residence time of an element is defined as the time required for each element s concentration to decrease below 1 e 0 37 of its initial concentration cucco and umgiesser 2006 nguyen et al 2014 therefore the distributions of the residence times can be determined the distributions of residence times were calculated with the 1998 and 2010 dems and the differences were considered changes in the renewal capacity caused by cumulative sand mining 3 results 3 1 bathymetric changes caused by cumulative sand mining based on the 1998 and 2010 dems fig 1 the changes in lakebed elevation caused by cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 were calculated fig 2 a significant bathymetric changes occurred in the northern outlet channels which are the main locations of sand mining the elevation of the outlet channels generally decreased by 4 10 m significantly thalweg changes in the northern channels showed dramatic decreases with considerable spatial heterogeneity fig 2b the thalweg declined sharply from hukou 0 km to the 28 km section and declined relatively homogeneously from 28 km to 70 km the elevation of the thalweg decreased by 6 m on average with a maximum decrease of approximately 30 m 3 2 water head changes caused by cumulative sand mining fig 3 highlights the annual average water levels near the end of the northern channels duchang and lake outlet hukou and the associated trend from the m k test in their water head difference from 1960 to 2016 showing clear interannual variations the annual average water levels at both duchang and hukou have decreased significantly since 2000 additionally the water head difference decreased the average water head difference between duchang and hukou was 1 m from 1960 to 2002 and decreased to 0 8 m from 2003 to 2007 the value decreased to 0 38 m from 2008 to 2016 when historically low levels occurred the m k test indicated a decreasing trend in the water head difference uf less than 0 and a change point in 2007 the decreasing monotonic trend was significant after 2007 when uf was less than the critical value of 1 96 this point coincided with the timing of the shift in the sand mining area from the hukou channels to the central lake jiang et al 2015 the continuing decrease in the water head difference indicated the effect of cumulative sand mining 3 3 influences of various magnitudes of sand mining on the water levels 3 3 1 changes in water level yao et al 2018 explored the spatial variations in water level affected by the bathymetric changes from 1998 to 2010 in poyang lake suggesting that the most affected area was concentrated in the channel areas of the northern and middle parts therefore in this study three stations xingzi duchang and tangyin in the channel areas were chosen to analyse water level variation responses to various magnitudes of sand mining the southern kangshan station was excluded because it showed a less prominent change yao et al 2018 fig 4 shows that the water levels decreased to different extents due to the decrease in the bottom elevation under various magnitudes of sand mining the impact of sand mining was much more significant in the low water level periods lower than 14 m than in the high water level periods the water level changes were significant at duchang and xingzi and not significant at tangyin the corresponding values at xingzi and duchang are shown in table 2 for mining depths of 1 4 m when the water levels were lower than 14 m the average water level decreases varied from 0 55 m to 1 35 m at xingzi and from 0 74 m to 2 14 m at duchang suggesting a cumulative decrease with deeper sand mining for equal magnitudes of sand mining 1 m when the water levels were lower than 14 m the average magnitude of the water level decrease was greatest between s1 and s0 approximately 0 55 m and 0 74 m at xingzi and duchang respectively with deeper sand mining the magnitude of the water level decline decreased gradually and reached its lowest values between s4 and s3 at approximately 0 14 m and 0 30 m at xingzi and duchang respectively 3 3 2 changes in rising and receding water levels fig 5 shows the relationship between the hukou water level and the water level decreases at xingzi and duchang due to sand mining during the rising and receding water level periods the water level reduction at duchang was generally greater than that at xingzi especially during the low level periods the water level changed nonlinearly with the hukou water level variation when the hukou water level rose higher than 14 m the water level reductions at xingzi and duchang were mainly lower than 0 5 m and 0 8 m respectively and the changes were not obvious given the hukou water level variation when the hukou water level increased from 10 5 m to 14 m the magnitude of reduction at xingzi decreased dramatically from 0 8 m to 0 2 m in s1 and 2 m to 0 7 m in s4 and that at duchang decreased from 0 9 m to 0 5 m in s1 and 2 6 m to 0 8 m in s4 compared to that during the rising period the water level during the receding period responded to sand mining differently at the same hukou water level the water level decreases at both stations were less prominent during the receding periods than during the rising periods the water level reduction was significant when the water level receded below 12 m while the threshold was 14 m during the rising period in general sand mining enhanced water level reductions much more during the low water level period than during the high water level period however when the hukou water level was lower than 10 5 m the water level reduction remained relatively stable for s1 and s2 at both xingzi and duchang 3 4 influence of various sand mining magnitudes on the outflow to the yangtze river as a result of bed level reductions caused by sand mining the outflow discharge to the yangtze river changed fig 6 shows the outflow discharge variations in s0 s5 suggesting decreased outflows in s1 s4 compared to s0 the variations were more significant during the rising and high water level periods than in the receding and low water level periods the decreases in total annual outflows from s1 to s4 accounted for approximately 2 6 2 3 3 5 and 4 4 of the total outflow in s0 respectively the decreased outflow was larger with deeper sand mining the outflow discharge in s5 showed the opposite pattern increasing by approximately 6 8 of the total outflow in s0 3 5 influence of cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 on hydrodynamics 3 5 1 changes in current speed fig 7 shows the current speed changes at four lake stations due to cumulative sand mining from 1998 s0 to 2010 s5 the current speed changes due to sand mining were significant during the low water level periods and not significant during the high water level periods which corresponded with variations in the water level note that the current speeds upstream at both tangyin and kangshan increased maximum increases of 0 3 m s and 0 1 m s respectively throughout the year and those at xingzi and duchang showed different patterns at xingzi the current speed increased during the spring low water level period and decreased during the other periods and the maximum change was less than 0 2 m s at duchang the current speed increased during all low water level periods and decreased during the other periods the greatest change occurred at duchang with a maximum increase of 0 5 m s suggesting approximately twice the current speed after sand mining these differences resulted from local differences in bathymetry because of uneven sand mining in general sand mining enhanced the current speed variation within the year to quantify the current speed variation in the whole lake due to cumulative sand mining from 1998 s0 to 2010 s5 the distributions of average current speed changes in the rising march june high july august receding september october and low november february water level periods were analysed fig 8 the northern areas channels and floodplains on both sides of the channels were most affected the channels in the centre and southern parts of the lake were also affected the sub lakes were nearly unaffected the distribution of current speed changes varied during the four periods during the rising period the current speed changes ranged from 0 4 to 0 4 m s and the maximum affected area was from the northern to the southern part of the lake during the high water level period the current speed changed the least mostly 0 1 to 0 1 m s with the affected area limited to the northern lake during the low water level period only channel areas were influenced however the variation magnitude was greatest 0 8 to 0 4 m s in the northern part of the lake the current speeds mainly decreased although the current speed increased in some local regions in the centre part of the lake the current speeds increased in the channels and decreased in the floodplains in general the variations in current speed mostly ranged between 0 4 m s and 0 4 m s the spatial variations in current speed were enhanced 3 5 2 changes in residence time a further study was conducted to determine the influence of cumulative sand mining on the spatial distributions of residence time fig 9 the residence time showed considerable spatial heterogeneity sand mining did not change the spatial distribution pattern of the residence time however the magnitude of residence time changed in the northern and central parts of the lake in the northern part of the lake the residence time mainly increased 10 days although it decreased in some local areas in the central part of the lake the residence time mainly decreased by 4 days on the lake shore and in delta regions the residence time was also affected due to morphological changes the residence time generally varied from 4 to 4 days 4 discussion various reports have been published concerning sand mining effects on the water level in poyang lake lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2018 these studies demonstrated the influence of extensive sand mining on water declines based on realistic dems from different years using a hydrodynamic model this work expanded upon previous studies by quantifying the contributions of various sand mining magnitudes to water levels and further assessed the impact of cumulative sand mining on hydrodynamics the results illustrated that the areas most affected by sand mining were the northern channels with duchang having the largest response fig 4 this conclusion was consistent with those of previous studies yao et al 2018 ye et al 2018 suggesting that the spatial influence was similar for various patterns and magnitudes of sand mining the possible reason for the spatial pattern was that southern areas near duchang were less affected by the yangtze river than the northern areas of xingzi resulting in the largest water level reduction generally the water levels became lower with increasing mining depth the water level decreased by less than 0 5 m when the water level was higher than 14 m and the differences in influence were not significant for different mining magnitudes fig 4 when the water level was lower than 14 m the sand mining effect on water level decrease was cumulative but not linearly related to increasing mining depth for example the water level decrease caused by a 4 m mining depth was less than 4 times that caused by a 1 m mining depth table 2 furthermore the water level decreased sharply when the hukou level varied from 14 m or 12 m to 10 5 m fig 5 and the level reduction was positively correlated with the sand mining magnitude however for 1 2 m mining magnitudes the water level reductions remained relatively stable and did not increase when the hukou level was lower than 10 5 m fig 5 the above characteristics may have been triggered by the blocking effect from the yangtze river due to inhibitory effects between the yangtze river and poyang lake the low water level of the lake allowed the blocking effect of the yangtze river to increase on the other hand the difference between the rising and receding periods indicated clockwise hysteresis namely for a given hukou water level the water level reduction was much higher during the rising period than during the receding period particularly when the level was low to moderate fig 5 the hydrological hysteresis of poyang lake was found to be caused by the complex floodplain bathymetry and time lag between the peaks of catchment inflow and discharge from the yangtze river zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 with increasing sand mining magnitude the difference between the rising period and receding period increased therefore the increase in sand mining magnitude enhanced the hysteretic effect this result agreed with the finding of yao et al 2018 based on the stage discharge relation while the water level showed a decreasing trend the current speed responded differently to cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 in different regions the current speed in the main mining area northern channels generally decreased because of the increased water depth bed decline greater than water level decline and the blocking effect from the yangtze river and those in the central and southern parts of the lake generally increased due to the emptying effect of downstream mining a similar spatial current speed change pattern was found in the study of maa et al 2004 the results showed that the current speed decreased at a dredging site and increased downstream during the low water level periods only the channel areas were influenced however the current variation magnitude was the greatest 0 8 to 0 4 m s compared to those in the other periods during the high water level periods only the northern current was influenced with a general decrease of 0 1 m s during the rising and receding periods the currents in the northern part of the lake and the central channel as well as the marshland area were all affected producing the largest area of influence in general the spatial variation in the current speed was consistent with that in the water level yao et al 2018 corresponding to the current speed variation the residence time increased in the northern part of the lake up to 10 days and decreased in the central part of the lake less than 4 days other sand mining studies malhadas et al 2009 hossain et al 2004 also demonstrated that sand mining increased the residence time and decreased the renewal ability of mining sites note that the previous studies lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 which were based on realistic bathymetric changes showed that lowering the bottom elevation allowed poyang lake to drain quickly and that the total annual outflow increased by approximately 6 yao et al 2018 however the opposite conclusion was drawn in this study the total annual outflow decreased by 2 6 4 4 with increasing sand mining magnitude 1 4 m the realistic sand mining operations were spatially heterogeneous and changed the slopes of the outflow channels in this study to quantify and distinguish the effects of differences in mining magnitude the bed lowering scenarios were assumed to decline uniformly in the whole northern lake therefore the bed slopes of the outflow channels were unchanged although the beds were lower resulting in a greater increase in storage capacity than in drainage capacity the comparison of the results showed that sand mining did not necessarily increase the outflow of the river connected lake the outflow variation depended on the sand mining region magnitude and change in bed slope the water velocity variation caused by cumulative sand mining changes the mixing and transport patterns in local areas and strongly influences the water environment and ecology in addition sand mining can lead to a decrease in water transparency due to increased concentrations of suspended matter ashraf et al 2011 sand mining and resuspension may also result in water quality degradation due to the release of contaminants erftemeijer and robin lewis 2006 increasing turbidity probably causes losses in primary productivity and benthic habitats because of decreased light and potential pollutants hossain et al 2004 the impacts of cumulative sand mining on the above factors should be explored to further assess the ecological and environmental effects in addition cumulative sand mining in the outlet channel bed might influence the backflow which is a temporary reversal of the discharge at the outlet of poyang lake and largely depends on the outlet bathymetry and relative variations between lake inflows and yangtze river discharge li et al 2017 ye et al 2012 a decrease in the outlet channel bed and a relative increase in the yangtze river effect might enhance the occurrence and magnitude of the backflow ye et al 2012 further work needs to be undertaken to elucidate the influence of cumulative sand mining on the backflow some assumptions were used in the study as the downstream boundary condition the water levels at hukou were assumed to be the same for different scenarios the water levels at hukou were dominated by and basically proportional to the yangtze river discharge zhang et al 2015 the same yangtze river discharge was adopted for different scenarios to exclude the influence of the yangtze river which means that the water levels at hukou were basically unchanged on the other hand during the dry season the most affected period the mean water level at hukou remained at an almost constant level of approximately 8 5 m from 1961 to 2012 lai et al 2014 suggesting that the water level at hukou was little affected by sand mining in poyang lake another assumption related to the uniform reduction in bed elevation was discussed in the previous section in addition the difference between the 1998 and 2010 dems was considered to be caused totally by sand mining when assessing the influence of cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 realistically the difference between the 1998 and 2010 dems was caused by both sand mining and natural erosion and deposition variations however the annual extraction of sand was 20 times greater than the natural deposition level de leeuw et al 2010 the natural erosion and deposition variation impacts could be ignored in contrast to the cumulative effects of extensive sand mining 5 conclusions this study combined a hydrodynamic model and hydrological data to quantify the influence of cumulative sand mining on the hydrology and hydrodynamics of poyang lake the results showed that the elevation of the thalweg in the northern outlet channels decreased by an average of 6 m with high heterogeneity resulting in a smaller difference in water head the water levels were generally lower with increasing mining depth mining 1 4 m of sand caused average cumulative water level decreases of 0 55 2 14 m in the mining channels when the water levels were lower than 14 m as a result the total annual outflow decreased by 2 6 4 4 with deeper sand mining the magnitude of the water level decline decreased gradually per 1 m of mining and the hysteretic effect was enhanced the current speeds in the northern mining channels generally decreased and those in the central channels mostly increased consequently the residence times increased in the northern lake and decreased in the central and southern parts of the lake this study highlights the enhanced heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal variations in hydrology and hydrodynamics triggered by cumulative sand mining and provides better understanding of potential variations in the water environment and ecology this study can be extended to similar river lake floodplain systems to quantify the hydrological and hydrodynamic effects of cumulative

6046,sand mining has significant impacts on the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes of river lake systems recently continuous sand mining has occurred in poyang lake a large floodplain lake connected to the yangtze river previous studies on the impact of sand mining in poyang lake focused on water level variations however the influence of different magnitudes of sand mining on the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes in such a complex river lake floodplain system is unclear the current study aims to address this issue by combining a hydrodynamic model and hydrological data based on average conditions 2000 2010 the influences of 1 4 m uniform sand mining in the northern lake on water levels and outflows were quantified and the spatial and temporal impacts of cumulative sand mining 1998 2010 on current speeds and residence times were further assessed the results showed that the elevations of the thalwegs in the northern outlet channels decreased unevenly from 1998 to 2010 the water levels decreased cumulatively but nonlinearly with increasing sand mining mining 1 4 m of sand caused cumulative water level decreases of 0 55 2 14 m in the northern channels when the water levels were lower than 14 m due to cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 the current speeds in the northern mining channels generally decreased and those in the central channels mostly increased with the majority varying from 0 4 to 0 4 m s the residence time changes were opposite to the current speed changes with 4 to 10 day variations the opposite outflow variations between uniform mining and realistic uneven mining indicated that outflow variations depended on the mining magnitudes and bed slope changes the above results suggested that for this river connected floodplain lake sand mining in outlet channels enhanced the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the lake hydrodynamics and that the blocking effect of the connected large river impacted the hydrodynamic variation patterns this study leads to better understanding of the effects of different magnitudes of sand mining on the hydrologic and hydrodynamic regimes in poyang lake and provides a reference for quantifying similar human activities in complex floodplain lakes keywords sand mining cumulative effect hydrodynamic model low water level poyang lake 1 introduction sand mining for building construction and other infrastructure development is widespread in most developing and developed countries padmalal and maya 2014 in particular in some developing countries such as india padmalal et al 2008 ramkumar et al 2015 china lai et al 2014 and iran sadeghi and harchegani 2012 rapid economic development has driven strong growth in the sand mining de leeuw et al 2010 sand mining directly results in bathymetric changes and triggers wave transformation and flow variability byrnes et al 2004 maa et al 2004 as a result the renewal ability of the water is changed accordingly malhadas et al 2009 hossain et al 2004 sand mining also influences the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentration van maren et al 2015 and sediment transport patterns byrnes et al 2004 disturbing the natural erosion and deposition patterns jonge 1983 additionally both the substance distribution in water and water exchange are affected hossain et al 2004 chubarenko and tchepikova 2001 the increased turbidity and sediment concentrations from sand mining have adverse impacts on aquatic organisms erftemeijer and robin lewis 2006 meng et al 2018 luo et al 2007 quantified the effect of sand mining in the pearl river delta based on field surveys and river hypsography they found that the water levels in upstream areas decreased by 1 59 3 12 m and that the divided flow ratios between various water courses were changed due to uneven sand mining duan et al 2019 used satellite data to depict the appearance time and number of sand mining vessels in lake hongze and quantified the increase in suspended particulate matter due to sand mining sharip and zaki 2014 illustrated the impacts of sand mining on the dynamics of the thermal structure and water quality in bukit merah lake indicating that sand mining led to an increase in turbidity exceeding 100 ntu and an enhanced temperature gradient river connected floodplain lakes have complex topographies and bathymetries upon which hydrological and hydrodynamic processes strongly depend baugh et al 2013 french 2008 floodplain lakes are characterised by hydrological phases of riverine to lake and lake to riverine transitions townsend 2006 with extensive seasonally inundated areas lesack and melack 1995 sand mining changes the topography and bathymetry and enhances the inhomogeneous characteristics of hydrology and hydrodynamics in addition to changing the water level and inundation extent hardy et al 1999 malhadas et al 2009 marks et al 2000 sand mining in floodplain channels which play a key role in hydrodynamic exchange and sediment transport trigg et al 2012 changes the patterns of water and mass transport of entire river floodplain systems a prominent example of how sand mining affects hydrology and hydrodynamics is the regime changes to poyang lake the largest freshwater lake with the most extensive floodplain in china zhang and werner 2015 as an internationally important wetland and the largest bird conservation area for migratory birds worldwide poyang lake has important ecological functions hui et al 2008 the lake receives catchment runoff from five tributary rivers and subsequently discharges into the yangtze river through the northern outlet of the lake spatio temporal heterogeneity in floodplain systems due to river lake interactions makes understanding the highly dynamic hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes more challenging since 2000 poyang lake has been severely dry zhang et al 2014 compared to the levels reported in previous decades the lake water levels dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded from 2001 to 2010 zhang et al 2014 resulting in significant decreases in the lake area feng et al 2012a previous studies suggested that the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river was the primary cause of the frequently low lake levels in autumn yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 while decreased catchment inflows were responsible for the low water levels in spring feng et al 2012 yao et al 2016 sand mining was also found to play an important role in triggering water level decreases during the dry season in winter lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2018 intense sand mining in poyang lake was initiated in 2000 sand mining was concentrated in the northern part of poyang lake prior to 2008 and has expanded southwards since 2009 li et al 2014 the total volume of mined sand was approximately 1 29 109 m3 from 2000 to 2010 almost 6 5 times the volume of natural sediment that accumulated from 1955 to 2010 jiang et al 2015 sand mining has led to an annual extraction of sand that is 20 times greater than the natural deposition level de leeuw et al 2010 due to extensive sand mining the bed elevation of the north outflow channel has decreased by approximately 5 9 m during the past decade lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 used medium resolution satellite images to construct annual and quasi annual topographic maps of poyang lake from 2000 to 2010 and found that the average elevation of the lakebed decreased by 14 4 cm yr from 2000 to 2010 lai et al 2014 combined survey and remote sensing data to examine the impact of sand mining on the low water levels and the results showed that the discharge ability of the lake into the yangtze river during the dry season increased 1 5 2 times due to sand mining ye et al 2018 used a back propagation neural network bpnn model and found that sand mining resulted in an average decrease in the annual water level of 0 26 0 75 m across the lake from 2000 to 2014 additionally the annual lake water level decline had a long term increasing trend suggesting the cumulative effects of sand mining yao et al 2018 used a hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of bathymetric changes 1998 2010 on the hydrological regimes in poyang lake from 2000 to 2010 the results showed that the water levels in the northern channels decreased by 1 2 2 m during low water level periods despite several efforts to evaluate the effects of sand mining on poyang lake water levels questions regarding how different magnitudes of mining affect lake hydrology and how lake hydrodynamics for example current speed and residence time respond to cumulative sand mining remain unanswered and must be addressed in particular a deteriorating water quality trend has been observed at the interannual scale in poyang lake wu et al 2017 as the basis of material transport the spatial and temporal changes in the lake hydrodynamics should be assessed to better understand the causes of water quality variations this paper extends previous studies by examining the effects of different magnitudes of sand mining on the hydrological and hydrodynamic regimes of a river connected floodplain lake poyang lake by combining a hydrodynamic model and long term hydrological data the objectives of this paper are to 1 analyse bathymetric changes in poyang lake caused by cumulative sand mining in the 2000s and consequent water head changes 2 quantify the influence of the various magnitudes of sand mining on the water levels and outflow and 3 further investigate the spatial and temporal influence of cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 on the lake current speed and residence time 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data poyang lake is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 28 24 29 46 n 115 49 116 46 e fig 1 spanning 170 km from north to south and approximately 74 km from east to west the catchment area of poyang lake is 1 62 105 km2 the catchment has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1654 mm an average temperature of 17 6 c and an annual potential evapotranspiration of 1049 mm year zhang et al 2014 shaped by a combination of lacustrine and riverine morphological processes poyang lake is characterised by complex topography including narrow channels islands and large floodplain areas the elevation of the lake bottom is less than 2 m in the northern channels and greater than 14 m in the southern deltas wusong datum which is also the water surface elevation system used in this study generally decreasing from south upstream to north downstream fig 1 poyang lake receives inflows from five rivers in the catchment the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers fig 1a poyang lake exchanges water with the yangtze river via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1a however a time lag exists in the peak discharge of the yangtze river july september relative to the maximum catchment inflow april june as a result poyang lake experiences four hydrological periods a period of rising water level march june a high water level period july august a period of receding water level september october and a low water level period november february yao et al 2018 during the low and rising water level periods the water level of poyang lake is mainly controlled by variations in the catchment inflows hu et al 2007 shankman et al 2006 during the high and receding water level periods changes in the yangtze river discharge strongly influence the outflow from poyang lake by a blocking effect hu et al 2007 as a result the annual average water level fluctuates by 8 18 m with the lake area varying from less than 1000 km2 to more than 3000 km2 feng et al 2012a creating highly complex floodplains zhang and werner 2015 despite the occurrence of thermal stratification in the center area and eastern bay during summer li et al 2018 poyang lake is generally well mixed depending on seasonal hydrological forcings within the lake rather than on meteorological conditions li et al 2016 it has high spatial variability in current speed and residence time the current speed in channels up to 1 0 m s is higher than that in the floodplains generally lower than 0 2 m s li et al 2015 consequently the average residence times in channels are less than 10 days during the low water level period and those in most floodplains are approximately 30 days li et al 2015 only in some bays can the average residence times reach more than six months due to the local topography li et al 2015 the daily water levels at five gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan as shown in fig 1a from 1960 to 2016 were used to represent the water levels in the downstream central and upstream areas of poyang lake the runoff amounts for the five major rivers from 2000 to 2010 were used to represent the catchment inflows digital elevation models dems of poyang lake from 1 10 000 maps surveyed in 1998 and 2010 were used to describe the realistic bathymetric changes due to sand mining all data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china 2 2 statistical methods the sequential version of the mann kendall m k test which has been widely used in hydrological and hydrodynamic studies elshemy et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 was employed to identify change points for water head in this study for any samples of n variables x 1 x 2 x n the m k rank statistic d k is calculated as the summation of m i which is the number of later terms in the series whose values exceed x i 1 d k i 1 k m i 2 k n the mean and variance of the test statistic d k are as follows 2 e d k k k 1 4 3 var d k k k 1 2 k 5 72 the sequential values of the statistic uf d k are then calculated as follows 4 uf d k d k e d k v a r d k in the equation uf d k 1 k n values constitute a forward sequence curve uf and the backward sequence curve ub is estimated using the inverted data series by the same method the intersection of uf and ub within the confidence interval indicates the time when a change point occurs 2 3 hydrodynamic model a hydrodynamic model was used to examine the hydrologic and hydrodynamic influences of bathymetric changes due to sand mining a refined hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was established based on 1998 dem and 2010 dem respectively yao et al 2018 the model was based on mike 21 which was developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi dhi 2012 the hydrodynamic model had 347 709 triangular elements with variable grid sizes of 37 467 m for differentiating the lake topography at different scales spatially varying manning s roughness coefficients were used for the friction coefficient from 0 018 s m1 3 in the channels to 0 028 s m1 3 in the floodplains the time step was 1 5 s the daily catchment inflows from the five major rivers were combined with the runoff from the ungauged catchment area zhang et al 2014 and specified as the upstream boundary conditions the daily observed water levels at hukou were used to define the downstream boundary condition the hydrodynamic model using the 2010 dem was calibrated against the observed water levels at four gauging stations in the lake and the outflow at hukou station for the period of january december 2010 the model using the 1998 dem which had the same mesh and parameter settings as the 2010 model was validated against the observations at the same stations from march 1997 to march 1998 in both the calibrations and validations of the two dem models the nash sutcliffe efficency coefficients of the water levels were greater than 0 96 and the determination coefficients of the outflow were greater than 0 92 suggesting that the accuracy was satisfactory other details regarding the construction of the model are described in yao et al 2018 2 4 simulation scenarios considering that sand mining in poyang lake has mostly occurred since 2000 and that the latest dem is from 2010 the annual average conditions from 2000 to 2010 were chosen to represent the average hydrologic conditions reflecting the impact of the cumulative sand mining from 2000 to 2010 based on various sand mining conditions in the northern area table 1 six scenarios were developed to simulate the same 2000 2010 average conditions the same boundary conditions were used to exclude the impact of different hydrological conditions scenario s0 represented the 1998 dem condition comparison of 1999 and 2007 satellite imagery revealed that the bottom of the outlet channel was lowered by 59 cm year 1 due to the sand mining in poyang lake de leeuw et al 2010 lai et al 2014 compared the channel profiles measured in 2013 and extracted from the 1998 dem and a series of satellite images during 2002 2014 in poyang lake s outflow channels illustrating that along with channel depth channel width also increased significantly considering the increases in both channel depth and width and the 3 m of averaged bed erosion across the whole northern part of poyang lake yao et al 2018 scenarios s1 to s4 were set to simulate a bed elevation decrease from 1 to 4 m in the whole northern area based on the 1998 dem fig 1a which allowed us to assess the effects of different magnitudes of sand mining scenario s5 represented the 2010 dem condition the cumulative effects of sand mining on hydrodynamics current speed and residence time were assessed by comparing the 2010 and 1998 dems s5 s0 2 5 residence time to assess the influence of sand mining on the renewal capacity of poyang lake the residence times were further calculated based on a conservative tracer simulation under the 2000 2010 average conditions the tracer simulation ran from 1 july to 31 december a homogeneous concentration of 1 kg m3 was set as the initial concentration of each element in the whole lake while the inflow concentrations were zero and the outflow was set with a zero concentration gradient subsequently the tracer concentration decreased due to the effects of convection and diffusion the e folding time which is a widely used concept for quantifying the residence times of lakes li et al 2015 monsen et al 2002 nguyen et al 2014 was used to calculate the residence time that is the residence time of an element is defined as the time required for each element s concentration to decrease below 1 e 0 37 of its initial concentration cucco and umgiesser 2006 nguyen et al 2014 therefore the distributions of the residence times can be determined the distributions of residence times were calculated with the 1998 and 2010 dems and the differences were considered changes in the renewal capacity caused by cumulative sand mining 3 results 3 1 bathymetric changes caused by cumulative sand mining based on the 1998 and 2010 dems fig 1 the changes in lakebed elevation caused by cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 were calculated fig 2 a significant bathymetric changes occurred in the northern outlet channels which are the main locations of sand mining the elevation of the outlet channels generally decreased by 4 10 m significantly thalweg changes in the northern channels showed dramatic decreases with considerable spatial heterogeneity fig 2b the thalweg declined sharply from hukou 0 km to the 28 km section and declined relatively homogeneously from 28 km to 70 km the elevation of the thalweg decreased by 6 m on average with a maximum decrease of approximately 30 m 3 2 water head changes caused by cumulative sand mining fig 3 highlights the annual average water levels near the end of the northern channels duchang and lake outlet hukou and the associated trend from the m k test in their water head difference from 1960 to 2016 showing clear interannual variations the annual average water levels at both duchang and hukou have decreased significantly since 2000 additionally the water head difference decreased the average water head difference between duchang and hukou was 1 m from 1960 to 2002 and decreased to 0 8 m from 2003 to 2007 the value decreased to 0 38 m from 2008 to 2016 when historically low levels occurred the m k test indicated a decreasing trend in the water head difference uf less than 0 and a change point in 2007 the decreasing monotonic trend was significant after 2007 when uf was less than the critical value of 1 96 this point coincided with the timing of the shift in the sand mining area from the hukou channels to the central lake jiang et al 2015 the continuing decrease in the water head difference indicated the effect of cumulative sand mining 3 3 influences of various magnitudes of sand mining on the water levels 3 3 1 changes in water level yao et al 2018 explored the spatial variations in water level affected by the bathymetric changes from 1998 to 2010 in poyang lake suggesting that the most affected area was concentrated in the channel areas of the northern and middle parts therefore in this study three stations xingzi duchang and tangyin in the channel areas were chosen to analyse water level variation responses to various magnitudes of sand mining the southern kangshan station was excluded because it showed a less prominent change yao et al 2018 fig 4 shows that the water levels decreased to different extents due to the decrease in the bottom elevation under various magnitudes of sand mining the impact of sand mining was much more significant in the low water level periods lower than 14 m than in the high water level periods the water level changes were significant at duchang and xingzi and not significant at tangyin the corresponding values at xingzi and duchang are shown in table 2 for mining depths of 1 4 m when the water levels were lower than 14 m the average water level decreases varied from 0 55 m to 1 35 m at xingzi and from 0 74 m to 2 14 m at duchang suggesting a cumulative decrease with deeper sand mining for equal magnitudes of sand mining 1 m when the water levels were lower than 14 m the average magnitude of the water level decrease was greatest between s1 and s0 approximately 0 55 m and 0 74 m at xingzi and duchang respectively with deeper sand mining the magnitude of the water level decline decreased gradually and reached its lowest values between s4 and s3 at approximately 0 14 m and 0 30 m at xingzi and duchang respectively 3 3 2 changes in rising and receding water levels fig 5 shows the relationship between the hukou water level and the water level decreases at xingzi and duchang due to sand mining during the rising and receding water level periods the water level reduction at duchang was generally greater than that at xingzi especially during the low level periods the water level changed nonlinearly with the hukou water level variation when the hukou water level rose higher than 14 m the water level reductions at xingzi and duchang were mainly lower than 0 5 m and 0 8 m respectively and the changes were not obvious given the hukou water level variation when the hukou water level increased from 10 5 m to 14 m the magnitude of reduction at xingzi decreased dramatically from 0 8 m to 0 2 m in s1 and 2 m to 0 7 m in s4 and that at duchang decreased from 0 9 m to 0 5 m in s1 and 2 6 m to 0 8 m in s4 compared to that during the rising period the water level during the receding period responded to sand mining differently at the same hukou water level the water level decreases at both stations were less prominent during the receding periods than during the rising periods the water level reduction was significant when the water level receded below 12 m while the threshold was 14 m during the rising period in general sand mining enhanced water level reductions much more during the low water level period than during the high water level period however when the hukou water level was lower than 10 5 m the water level reduction remained relatively stable for s1 and s2 at both xingzi and duchang 3 4 influence of various sand mining magnitudes on the outflow to the yangtze river as a result of bed level reductions caused by sand mining the outflow discharge to the yangtze river changed fig 6 shows the outflow discharge variations in s0 s5 suggesting decreased outflows in s1 s4 compared to s0 the variations were more significant during the rising and high water level periods than in the receding and low water level periods the decreases in total annual outflows from s1 to s4 accounted for approximately 2 6 2 3 3 5 and 4 4 of the total outflow in s0 respectively the decreased outflow was larger with deeper sand mining the outflow discharge in s5 showed the opposite pattern increasing by approximately 6 8 of the total outflow in s0 3 5 influence of cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 on hydrodynamics 3 5 1 changes in current speed fig 7 shows the current speed changes at four lake stations due to cumulative sand mining from 1998 s0 to 2010 s5 the current speed changes due to sand mining were significant during the low water level periods and not significant during the high water level periods which corresponded with variations in the water level note that the current speeds upstream at both tangyin and kangshan increased maximum increases of 0 3 m s and 0 1 m s respectively throughout the year and those at xingzi and duchang showed different patterns at xingzi the current speed increased during the spring low water level period and decreased during the other periods and the maximum change was less than 0 2 m s at duchang the current speed increased during all low water level periods and decreased during the other periods the greatest change occurred at duchang with a maximum increase of 0 5 m s suggesting approximately twice the current speed after sand mining these differences resulted from local differences in bathymetry because of uneven sand mining in general sand mining enhanced the current speed variation within the year to quantify the current speed variation in the whole lake due to cumulative sand mining from 1998 s0 to 2010 s5 the distributions of average current speed changes in the rising march june high july august receding september october and low november february water level periods were analysed fig 8 the northern areas channels and floodplains on both sides of the channels were most affected the channels in the centre and southern parts of the lake were also affected the sub lakes were nearly unaffected the distribution of current speed changes varied during the four periods during the rising period the current speed changes ranged from 0 4 to 0 4 m s and the maximum affected area was from the northern to the southern part of the lake during the high water level period the current speed changed the least mostly 0 1 to 0 1 m s with the affected area limited to the northern lake during the low water level period only channel areas were influenced however the variation magnitude was greatest 0 8 to 0 4 m s in the northern part of the lake the current speeds mainly decreased although the current speed increased in some local regions in the centre part of the lake the current speeds increased in the channels and decreased in the floodplains in general the variations in current speed mostly ranged between 0 4 m s and 0 4 m s the spatial variations in current speed were enhanced 3 5 2 changes in residence time a further study was conducted to determine the influence of cumulative sand mining on the spatial distributions of residence time fig 9 the residence time showed considerable spatial heterogeneity sand mining did not change the spatial distribution pattern of the residence time however the magnitude of residence time changed in the northern and central parts of the lake in the northern part of the lake the residence time mainly increased 10 days although it decreased in some local areas in the central part of the lake the residence time mainly decreased by 4 days on the lake shore and in delta regions the residence time was also affected due to morphological changes the residence time generally varied from 4 to 4 days 4 discussion various reports have been published concerning sand mining effects on the water level in poyang lake lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 ye et al 2018 these studies demonstrated the influence of extensive sand mining on water declines based on realistic dems from different years using a hydrodynamic model this work expanded upon previous studies by quantifying the contributions of various sand mining magnitudes to water levels and further assessed the impact of cumulative sand mining on hydrodynamics the results illustrated that the areas most affected by sand mining were the northern channels with duchang having the largest response fig 4 this conclusion was consistent with those of previous studies yao et al 2018 ye et al 2018 suggesting that the spatial influence was similar for various patterns and magnitudes of sand mining the possible reason for the spatial pattern was that southern areas near duchang were less affected by the yangtze river than the northern areas of xingzi resulting in the largest water level reduction generally the water levels became lower with increasing mining depth the water level decreased by less than 0 5 m when the water level was higher than 14 m and the differences in influence were not significant for different mining magnitudes fig 4 when the water level was lower than 14 m the sand mining effect on water level decrease was cumulative but not linearly related to increasing mining depth for example the water level decrease caused by a 4 m mining depth was less than 4 times that caused by a 1 m mining depth table 2 furthermore the water level decreased sharply when the hukou level varied from 14 m or 12 m to 10 5 m fig 5 and the level reduction was positively correlated with the sand mining magnitude however for 1 2 m mining magnitudes the water level reductions remained relatively stable and did not increase when the hukou level was lower than 10 5 m fig 5 the above characteristics may have been triggered by the blocking effect from the yangtze river due to inhibitory effects between the yangtze river and poyang lake the low water level of the lake allowed the blocking effect of the yangtze river to increase on the other hand the difference between the rising and receding periods indicated clockwise hysteresis namely for a given hukou water level the water level reduction was much higher during the rising period than during the receding period particularly when the level was low to moderate fig 5 the hydrological hysteresis of poyang lake was found to be caused by the complex floodplain bathymetry and time lag between the peaks of catchment inflow and discharge from the yangtze river zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 with increasing sand mining magnitude the difference between the rising period and receding period increased therefore the increase in sand mining magnitude enhanced the hysteretic effect this result agreed with the finding of yao et al 2018 based on the stage discharge relation while the water level showed a decreasing trend the current speed responded differently to cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 in different regions the current speed in the main mining area northern channels generally decreased because of the increased water depth bed decline greater than water level decline and the blocking effect from the yangtze river and those in the central and southern parts of the lake generally increased due to the emptying effect of downstream mining a similar spatial current speed change pattern was found in the study of maa et al 2004 the results showed that the current speed decreased at a dredging site and increased downstream during the low water level periods only the channel areas were influenced however the current variation magnitude was the greatest 0 8 to 0 4 m s compared to those in the other periods during the high water level periods only the northern current was influenced with a general decrease of 0 1 m s during the rising and receding periods the currents in the northern part of the lake and the central channel as well as the marshland area were all affected producing the largest area of influence in general the spatial variation in the current speed was consistent with that in the water level yao et al 2018 corresponding to the current speed variation the residence time increased in the northern part of the lake up to 10 days and decreased in the central part of the lake less than 4 days other sand mining studies malhadas et al 2009 hossain et al 2004 also demonstrated that sand mining increased the residence time and decreased the renewal ability of mining sites note that the previous studies lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 which were based on realistic bathymetric changes showed that lowering the bottom elevation allowed poyang lake to drain quickly and that the total annual outflow increased by approximately 6 yao et al 2018 however the opposite conclusion was drawn in this study the total annual outflow decreased by 2 6 4 4 with increasing sand mining magnitude 1 4 m the realistic sand mining operations were spatially heterogeneous and changed the slopes of the outflow channels in this study to quantify and distinguish the effects of differences in mining magnitude the bed lowering scenarios were assumed to decline uniformly in the whole northern lake therefore the bed slopes of the outflow channels were unchanged although the beds were lower resulting in a greater increase in storage capacity than in drainage capacity the comparison of the results showed that sand mining did not necessarily increase the outflow of the river connected lake the outflow variation depended on the sand mining region magnitude and change in bed slope the water velocity variation caused by cumulative sand mining changes the mixing and transport patterns in local areas and strongly influences the water environment and ecology in addition sand mining can lead to a decrease in water transparency due to increased concentrations of suspended matter ashraf et al 2011 sand mining and resuspension may also result in water quality degradation due to the release of contaminants erftemeijer and robin lewis 2006 increasing turbidity probably causes losses in primary productivity and benthic habitats because of decreased light and potential pollutants hossain et al 2004 the impacts of cumulative sand mining on the above factors should be explored to further assess the ecological and environmental effects in addition cumulative sand mining in the outlet channel bed might influence the backflow which is a temporary reversal of the discharge at the outlet of poyang lake and largely depends on the outlet bathymetry and relative variations between lake inflows and yangtze river discharge li et al 2017 ye et al 2012 a decrease in the outlet channel bed and a relative increase in the yangtze river effect might enhance the occurrence and magnitude of the backflow ye et al 2012 further work needs to be undertaken to elucidate the influence of cumulative sand mining on the backflow some assumptions were used in the study as the downstream boundary condition the water levels at hukou were assumed to be the same for different scenarios the water levels at hukou were dominated by and basically proportional to the yangtze river discharge zhang et al 2015 the same yangtze river discharge was adopted for different scenarios to exclude the influence of the yangtze river which means that the water levels at hukou were basically unchanged on the other hand during the dry season the most affected period the mean water level at hukou remained at an almost constant level of approximately 8 5 m from 1961 to 2012 lai et al 2014 suggesting that the water level at hukou was little affected by sand mining in poyang lake another assumption related to the uniform reduction in bed elevation was discussed in the previous section in addition the difference between the 1998 and 2010 dems was considered to be caused totally by sand mining when assessing the influence of cumulative sand mining from 1998 to 2010 realistically the difference between the 1998 and 2010 dems was caused by both sand mining and natural erosion and deposition variations however the annual extraction of sand was 20 times greater than the natural deposition level de leeuw et al 2010 the natural erosion and deposition variation impacts could be ignored in contrast to the cumulative effects of extensive sand mining 5 conclusions this study combined a hydrodynamic model and hydrological data to quantify the influence of cumulative sand mining on the hydrology and hydrodynamics of poyang lake the results showed that the elevation of the thalweg in the northern outlet channels decreased by an average of 6 m with high heterogeneity resulting in a smaller difference in water head the water levels were generally lower with increasing mining depth mining 1 4 m of sand caused average cumulative water level decreases of 0 55 2 14 m in the mining channels when the water levels were lower than 14 m as a result the total annual outflow decreased by 2 6 4 4 with deeper sand mining the magnitude of the water level decline decreased gradually per 1 m of mining and the hysteretic effect was enhanced the current speeds in the northern mining channels generally decreased and those in the central channels mostly increased consequently the residence times increased in the northern lake and decreased in the central and southern parts of the lake this study highlights the enhanced heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal variations in hydrology and hydrodynamics triggered by cumulative sand mining and provides better understanding of potential variations in the water environment and ecology this study can be extended to similar river lake floodplain systems to quantify the hydrological and hydrodynamic effects of cumulative

6047,machine learning and data driven models have achieved a favorable reputation in the field of advanced geospatial modeling particularly for models of groundwater aquifer potential over large areas such models built using standalone machine learning techniques retain some uncertainty including errors associated with the modeling process sampling approach and input hyper parameters some of these techniques cannot be applied in data scarce regions because high bias and variance can lead to oversimplification therefore in the current study we developed and validated a novel ensemble multi

function mohammady et al 2012 and tree based model was proposed to create the groundwater potential map naghibi et al 2019 the development of ensemble models has allowed the integration of a base learner approach with a prime algorithm to achieve more robust models that can be applied over large study areas where data coverage can be inconsistent naghibi et al 2017 however the application of hybrid models should be explored for different regions to determine the optimum model in terms of accuracy robustness overfitting and sensitivity to scarce data rahmati et al 2018 to reduce these modeling uncertainties we coupled a multi adaptive boosting hybrid model multiadaboosting based on a decision committee technique that combines adaptive boosting adaboost with wagging with logistic regression lr a robust model with strict expectations prior to training pradhan 2010 to develop the ensemble mablr model although multiadaboosting is one of the powerful adaptive boosting classifiers that can classify multiple classes on both basic and complex recognition problems yet it can be sensitive to the existence of the outliers in the dataset which is very common in groundwater domain as well as over fitting problems naghibi et al 2016 therefore we integrated lr with multiadaboosting to overcome the model over fitting and outlier sensitivity problems by producing a highly certain ensemble classifier with less dependency on modification of hyper parameters or settings our main goal was to evaluate the ability of mablr to assess the morphological parameters of groundwater aquifer potential zones in south korea and compare its results to those of support vector machine svm multiple layer perception mpl and standalone lr models specifically we optimized the contributing factors for lr groundwater modeling spatially modeled groundwater aquifer potential using the ensemble mablr machine learning model and compared the results to those of other constituent machine learning models including mlp svm and lr assessed the strength of machine learning model hyper parameters using a fuzzy logic supervised fls approach and compared the performance of mablr and other

farmland and 32 6 km2 2 7 of rivers the yearly average temperature is 11 c and it is a cold and dry region with very little precipitation due to its geographical nature as an inland basin situated between taebaek and sobaek mountain ranges it rains an average of 92 days annually the average precipitation is 960 mm which shows the shortage of rainfall compared to the korean mean of precipitation amount 1250 mm http www usc go kr eng about uiseong introduction location we identified 169 rock aquifers within the study area and recorded specific capacity and transmissivity information for each well in the region based on field surveys rock aquifer data indicate that the maximum range for aquifer groundwater is about 955 41 m3 h in winter declining to a minimum of 0 0005 m3 h in summer well inventory points were randomly separated into two classes of 70 118 wells for model training and 30 51 wells for model testing based on the transmissivity t characteristics of each individual well the well inventory was divided into two groups productive yield 40 m3 h and unproductive yield 40 m3 h according to the criteria of sameen et al 2018 to create an effective well inventory for use in the machine learning models productive and unproductive samples were assigned values of 1 and 0 respectively fig 1 shows the locations of the groundwater wells within the study area we examined the effects of 12 contributing morphological factors these factors were extracted using the arcgis 10 6 software in raster format at a spatial resolution of 10 m 10 m and statistically analyzed using

national geographic information institute we developed and calibrated the mablr model to map groundwater potential in the basin through the following steps first significant contributing factors were selected then we modeled groundwater aquifer potential using the calibrated mablr model and compared the results to those of other well known machine learning models finally we evaluated the model

parameters were identified and retained in the model twi tri spi tpi mvbf slope aspect sl distance from the river distance from fault profile curvature plane curvature altitude lulc and geology fig 3 elevation is among the most significant parameters used in groundwater analyses groundwater aquifer potential in highly elevated areas approaches zero botzen et al 2013 surface runoff flows from highly elevated areas toward lower regions consequently groundwater potential is higher in low altitude or flat terrains slope and aspect are topographical factors with important applications as hydrology parameters due to their effects on runoff accumulation and the velocity of excess rainfall rizeei et al 2017 an increase in slope decreases the amount of time available for surface infiltration increasing the amount of water entering drainage networks that will later be retrievable from groundwater aquifers aspect also can be influential parameters particularly in a hilly area north and east face aspect have exposed by the long duration of sun radiation where vegetation coverage is not as dense as west and south face aspect in korean region hence the rainfall drops cannot penetrate the bare soil where soil pores are more likely to get blocked by intense rainfall due to lack of enough vegetation coverage as a result the probability of groundwater is more on west or south face aspect rather east and north ones plan and profile curvature also contribute significantly to physical groundwater models these parameters consist of raster data ranging from negative concave to positive convex values and must be classified before becoming model input pixels with a value of zero are assigned to flat regions tpi indicates the position of each cell and is calculated as follows de reu et al 2013 guisan et al 1999 1 tpi e pixel e surrounding where e p i x e l is the altitude of the cell and e s u r r o u n d i n g is the mean altitude of the neighboring pixels high tpi values indicate upper slopes while low values of tpi show lower slopes where the potential of the groundwater aquifer is high the mvbf index links between size and flatness of valley bottoms which was incorporated into the algorithm by reducing the slope threshold zero value specifies erosional terrain with less possibility of groundwater aquifer while values above 1 indicating areas of deposition with much productive groundwater aquifer the mvbf index reflects the valley bottom characteristics of flatness and lowness flatness is measured using the inverse of the slope and lowness is measured using ranking elevation with respect to a circular surrounding area these two measures both scaled from 0 to 1 are combined by multiplication and can be interpreted as fuzzy set membership functions gallant and dowling 2003 kaufmann 1975 ls is a combination of slope gradient s and slope length l we adopted an extensively used method for calculating ls as follows 2 ls a s 22 13 0 4 sin β

productive groundwater aquifer spi and twi are water related parameters calculated as follows gokceoglu et al 2005 3 s p i a s t a n β 4 t w i l n a s t a n β where a s is the catchment area or flow accumulation m2 m 1 and β is the local slope gradient measured in degrees spi indicates the erosive power of water flow twi represents the effects of topography on runoff generation and the amount of flow accumulation at any location within the river catchment gokceoglu et al 2005 the accuracy of a topographic index can be estimated with respect to grid spacing and terrain roughness by comparing the relationship between the topographic index surface and reference data tri is another morphological parameter widely used in groundwater analyses it is calculated in this study as follows 5 t r i a b s m a x 2 m i n 2 where max and min represent the largest and smallest values of cells in nine rectangular neighborhoods of altitude values lulc types are also primary factors that strongly contribute to groundwater potential modeling a detailed understanding of lulcs bears extreme significance for environmental and natural hazards rizeei et al 2016 lithology and geology are also important parameters used to detect sensitive groundwater aquifer areas soil type directly affects the drainage process via characteristics such as texture permeability degree and structure lithological information regarding the permeability of rocks is also required the study area contained rocks from 142 different lithology classes variation in the factors contributing to the behavior and activity of groundwater cause ambiguity in the overlaying process therefore all factors were normalized to a common scale in the feature raster before overlaying youssef et al 2015 mojaddadi et al 2017 fanos and pradhan 2019 2 2 model optimization hyper parameters affect the quality and robustness of machine learning models and must therefore be selected to achieve the highest model performance liao et al 2012 once all significant hyper parameters were selected domain values were assigned for each individual hyper parameter these values indicate the range of probable values for each parameter because the optimal value for single hyper parameters should be coordinated with other hyper parameters finding the most effective domain value of hyper parameters for a model is a time consuming procedure without optimization systems woo et al 2007 in this study we specified six classes for each domain to cover its effective range following domain selection we applied an fls technique to optimize the hyper parameters zhang et al 2010 the fls optimized the hyper parameters of the mablr svm mlp and lr models by assigning an optimal predictive value for all involved hyper parameters within their domains to limit the degree of redundancy between them values of hyper parameters that were exceptionally associated with the model and with low inter correlations were selected on the basis of discrepancy evaluation tong and murray 2012 the fls evaluated hyper parameters by a search run iteratively from a random vertex that calculated the ideal value among the available domain after all runs were assessed the optimal hyper parameter configuration was selected within 184 iterations according to evaluation metrics the optimal hyper parameters for all proposed models are summarized in table 1 2 3 theory of the lr svm mlp and mablr models lr is a widely used multivariate statistical model that can be applied to continuous or discrete data of any distribution or raster format lee and sambath 2006a b it was proposed by mcfadden 1974 to measure probability of occurrence depending on contributing parameters lr can be used to evaluate relationships among binary dependent variables over nominal and scalar values of independent variables shirzadi et al 2012 svm was designed on the basis of statistical learning theory to minimize operational uncertainty yao et al 2008 this process converts nonlinear structures into linear structures according to hyperplane creation tehrany et al 2014 a separate hyperplane is created for the original space with n coordinates among points within two different categories marjanović et al 2011 the hyperplane separates training datasets based on a kernel function of the svm support vectors are recognized as neighboring training vertices of the ideal hyperplane the goal of the svm model is to recognize the ideal separating hyperplane range the mlp algorithm is a feed forward artificial neural network nn that uses nodes linked by input signals and numeric weights to produce layers that receive process and display output harun et al 2010 back propagation is applied to reduce errors accumulated via the repetitive approach nns have successfully been utilized in remote sensing applications limitations of the mlp model include high computational costs and overlearning mia and dhar 2016 multiadaboosting merges adaboost with wagging to produce a decision committee model webb 2000 bui et al 2016 that reduces both variance and bias although it cannot be applied for committees of 10 members multiadaboosting exhibits greater error reduction than all other relative committed algorithms kotsiantis et al 2007 in comparison mablr uses lr for classifier based learning to generate decision committees with less error than either wagging or multiadaboosting even for a large cross section of datasets webb 2000 mablr is more efficient than multiadaboosting due to its matching parallel execution algorithms the steps of mablr implementation are shown in fig 4 all classifiers determined by wagging are independent from all others permitting parallel multiplication and creating uncertainty in the multiadaboosting model at the sub committee class mablr improves error reduction compared to other approaches including bagging decision trees wagging and multiadaboosting particularly at t 10 when variance is amplified thus reducing the frequency at which the central tendency is created and therefore reducing its ability to contribute to uncertainty 2 4 evaluation methods the following evaluation metrics were applied to assess the accuracy of groundwater potential models rmse κ coefficient roc and prc the κ coefficient measures the overall accuracy of the model among all correctly assigned samples on a diagonal basis in the error matrix allocated by the full dataset ridd and liu 1998 the κ coefficient is calculated as follows 6 k m i 1 r x ii i 1 r x i x i m 2 i 1 r x i x i where r reflects the total number of rows in the error matrix xii is observation i xi and x 1 are the minimal totals and m is the set of observations roc curves are designed to evaluate and visualize the performance of an analytical model they indicate sensitivity or a true positive rate tp associated with a decision threshold on the y axis and specificity or false positive rate fp on the x axis fawcett 2006 thus representing the positive and negative probability respectively that a pixel is classified correctly the area under the roc curve estimates the overall accuracy of the model nampak et al 2014 pradhan 2010 however evaluation of the model solely by visual interpretation of roc can be misleading thus the precision recall curve prc is a complementary evaluation metric that is useful for imbalanced datasets the prc shows the correlation between the positive predictive value ppv or precision and sensitivity for all possible pixels from which tp and fp can be calculated the prc graph can be plotted by dividing sensitivity by ppv the x axis represents recall or sensitivity and the y axis represents precision each point on the prc graph thus represents a selected cut off a perfect model will have a roc and prc of 1 whereas a value approaching 0 indicates an inaccurate model rmse is used to evaluate differences between the observed sample values and predicted model values rmsd is the square root of the second trial or the quadratic mean of the deviations from observed values to predicted values hyndman and koehler 2006 rmse was calculated as follows 7 rmse i 1 n x test x train 2 n where x test is the set of testing values and x train is the set of training values at i 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater potential mapping groundwater aquifer potential was modeled using four machine learning techniques mablr mlp sav and lr maps based on these models are shown in fig 5 we focused mainly on the development of the mablr ensemble model because this study is the first to implement it to determine groundwater probability therefore the optimization processes are discussed in detail the models were assessed according to four accuracy metrics groundwater potential aquifer maps were created on the basis of predicted probability ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no probable pixels and 1 indicates 100 probability of occurrence to create thematic zoning maps which are more easily understood by end users and decision makers we used the quantile technique in the gis platform to reclassify the probability index into five classes very high high moderate low and very low high potential areas were located in low elevation zones near riverbanks and low potential areas were found in high elevation areas with steep slopes these findings were common among all groundwater potential aquifer maps clearly riparian areas and some upstream areas are expected to have the potential for groundwater yield in particular mablr results indicated that locations with the highest groundwater aquifer potential were mainly situated in the western and southwestern regions of the study area fig 5 by contrast very low groundwater potential was assigned to eastern and northwestern regions of the study area among a total of 59 productive wells 47 were assigned to very high and high groundwater aquifer potential zones indicating the high precision of the mablr model the mablr model was used to extract the degree of contribution of each factor fig 6 the most effective parameter in determining groundwater potential was spi with a weight of 4 844 variation in spi can directly increase or decrease groundwater potential plane curvature and mvbf were the second and third most influential factors with weights of 4 315 and 4 240 respectively these factors significantly affected runoff behavior and further delineated areas of groundwater concentration other hydrological and morphological factors including tpi tri and sl also contributed greatly to groundwater potential zones with weights of 3 076 3 039 and 2 537 respectively altitude index twi and profile curvature made moderate contributions weights 1 189 0 996 0 955 and 0 481 respectively however mablr defined slope aspect geology distance from fault and lulc as the least influential factors for this study area with weights 0 2 most of the artificial intelligence based models contain multiple hyper parameters that must be precisely defined to achieve ideal results their interactions must also be considered for model optimization dehnavi et al 2015 zare et al 2013 the trial and error methods used by machine learning models to retrieve optimal hyper parameter values are time consuming and can introduce errors particularly if the number of hyper parameters exceeds four and the range of their domains is very wide mojaddadi rizeei et al 2019 hence automating this selection process is useful for decreasing computational time and increasing the accuracy of the final output by considering the full range of possible interactions among hyper parameters we adopted fls optimization which refines the parameter configuration at each iteration until convergence however increasing the number of iterations does not necessarily result in enhanced configuration fls determined optimal hyper parameter values within 184 iterations table 1 lists the feasible and optimal hyper parameters of the implemented models examined in this study as determined by the fls approach the mablr model was calibrated using four hyper parameters including weight threshold seed number the number of subcommittees and batch size the well calibrated mablr ensemble model achieved greater bias and error reduction than multiadaboost particularly at small committee sizes 3 2 evaluation of the groundwater potential models the models examined in this study were evaluated by rmse κ coefficient roc and prc which reflect the efficiency accuracy and validity of the resulting groundwater potential aquifer maps the greatest difference between roc and prc is that the roc graph produces a greater number of true negative results table 2 the assessment was divided into two parts goodness of fit success and validation prediction a training sample of well locations which represented 70 of the total inventory was used to assess the success of the model and the testing sample included the remaining 30 of data not used during the modeling process all metrics indicated a considerable correlation between the model results and observed data however the trained data were not used in the validation process the success rate goodness of fit and prediction rate validation results are shown in table 2 the rmse results indicated that mablr had lower error than all other models with values of 0 2483 and 0 3003 for goodness of fit and validation assessment respectively the predictive performance of mablr was also greater for goodness of fit and validation assessment in terms of κ coefficient 0 8191 and 0 7814 respectively roc 0 917 and 0 838 and prc 0 931 and 0 872 fig 7 by reducing bias and variance in the dataset due to integrated with lr the ensemble mablr reduced outlier negative effects and sampling patterns more than other implemented models also it showed the best capability to minimize the overfitting problem due to optimized hyper parameters of the multiadaboosting which showed a stable accuracy variation from goodness of fit to validation which is a common issue among ensemble model the mlp results for goodness of fit included a κ coefficient of 0 6954 roc of 0 843 and prc of 0 924 slightly lower values were obtained for validation 0 6697 0 823 and 0 851 respectively rmse error values indicated that the mlp model had the second highest success rate 0 2385 and the third highest validation rate 0 435 among all models the svm model yielded κ coefficient roc and prc values of 0 6853 and 0 6801 0 834 and 0 813 and 0 883 and 0 791 for goodness of fit and validation assessment respectively svm placed third among all accuracy assessment metrics svm rmse values indicated the highest error in terms of success rate 0 3119 and the second lowest error in terms of validation rate 0 3217 lr showed the lowest accuracy among all models with κ coefficient roc and prc values of 0 5569 0 822 and 0 8685 respectively in terms of goodness of fit and 0 5401 0 745 and 0 8116 in terms of validation rmse values indicated that lr had a slightly higher success rate 0 2937 than the svm and the worst performance among all models 0 4704 in general all models examined in this study had an acceptable amount of uncertainty and high goodness of fit the well calibrated ensemble mablr model exhibited the highest performance for modeling groundwater aquifer potential 4 conclusion sustainable groundwater aquifer management requires precise modeling to accurately and reliably simulate conditions in nature modeling groundwater aquifer potential is a delicate process involving the estimation of several morphological and hydrological parameters several techniques have been proposed for groundwater potential mapping however not all can be applied in data scarce regions where bias and variance are high as they tend toward oversimplification although multiadaboosting is one of the powerful adaptive boosting classifiers that can classify multiple classes even on complex recognition problems yet it is sensitive to the existence of the outliers in the dataset which is very common in groundwater domain as well as overfitting problems therefore we proposed the ensemble mablr which reduces bias and variance in the dataset in the gyeongsangbuk do basin of south korea the integrated multiadaboosting with the actual function of lr caused less sensitivity on outliers training distribution that resulted in a tangible reduction of overfitting problem with less dependency on modification of hyper parameters several contributing factors were assessed using a dataset of specific capacity and transmissivity for 169 well locations initially we applied a forward stepwise lr algorithm to identify 15 significantly contributing morphological factors twi tri spi tpi mrvbf slope aspect sl distance from the river distance from fault profile curvature plane curvature altitude lulc and geology then we developed a new robust ensemble method coupling lr with the multiadaboosting technique to construct the mablr model which showed higher performance than other well known machine learning methods including mpl svm and standalone lr we applied fls to successfully retrieve optimal hyper parameter values for the implemented models the model results showed that mablr had the best accuracy and efficiency based on evaluation by rmse κ coefficient roc and prc the most influential contributing factors were identified as spi plan curvature and mrvbf visual interpolation of high groundwater aquifer potential areas showed that they were located in low elevation zones near riverbanks whereas low potential areas were located in high elevation areas with steep slopes our results will be valuable for evaluating groundwater studies and successive model development to further reduce uncertainties and consider the morphological factors that influence the precision of groundwater potential modeling the main barrier of this research was using the contributing factors with a moderate spatial resolution which reduced the quality of groundwater mapping thus it is suggested to use the 1 meter spatial resolution to leverage the final map precision since the proposed model has the capability of modeling the functions with scare input data it is also recommended being experimented on other probability application such as landslide that has a smaller number of inventory datasets however the proposed model should be implemented in multiple regions to test its transferability and reliability before it can be applied to assess the vulnerability of wells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6047,machine learning and data driven models have achieved a favorable reputation in the field of advanced geospatial modeling particularly for models of groundwater aquifer potential over large areas such models built using standalone machine learning techniques retain some uncertainty including errors associated with the modeling process sampling approach and input hyper parameters some of these techniques cannot be applied in data scarce regions because high bias and variance can lead to oversimplification therefore in the current study we developed and validated a novel ensemble multi adaptive boosting logistic regression mablr model for groundwater aquifer potential mapping this model was validated in a large area of the gyeongsangbuk do basin in south korea and the results were compared to those of different types of machine learning models including multiple layer perception mpl logistic regression lr and support vector machine svm models a forward stepwise lr technique was implemented to assess the importance of contributing morphological factors we found 15 factors that contributed significantly topographic wetness index twi topographic roughness index tri stream power index spi topographic position index tpi multi resolution valley bottom flatness mvbf slope aspect slope length ls distance from the river distance from the fault profile curvature plane curvature altitude land use land cover lulc and geology we optimized the mablr model using a fuzzy logic supervised fls approach with 184 iterations and then validated the results using accuracy assessment metrics including the κ coefficient root mean square error rmse receiver operating characteristics roc and the precision recall curve prc our model had superior predictive performance among the models tested with higher overall goodness of fit and validation values according to the κ coefficient 0 819 and 0 781 respectively roc 0 917 and 0 838 and prc 0 931 and 0 872 our experimental results demonstrate that mablr is more effective at reducing bias and variance error than other constituent machine learning methods keywords machine learning groundwater aquifer potential multi adaptive

applications as a non renewable natural resource groundwater quality effects the vulnerability of soil to pollution drinking water quality temperature modulation environmental sensitivity and local climate change manap et al 2013 one third of the global population depends on groundwater for their daily needs oh et al 2011 the development of groundwater is a key issue for the storage of fresh drinking water jothibasu and anbazhagan 2016 therefore it is important to investigate the behavior and characteristics of groundwater groundwater transmissivity is determined by several factors including geological physiographical morphological parameters hydrological conditions and climate variation kumar et al 2015 and the availability and activity of groundwater can be affected by topography lithology geological structure slope and many other factors oh et al 2011 the creation of a comprehensive model that can effectively consider all possible contributing factors for groundwater mapping is essential hydrogeological lab tests sample drilling and geospatial models are tools often used for mapping groundwater although these methods provide detailed recognition of subsurface hydrogeological structures helaly 2017 they can be time consuming and costly nampak et al 2014 the development of geographic information systems gis statistical techniques machine learning

aquifer sustainability factor smith et al 2010 in most cases statistical and machine learning models perform well however if the training sample size is inadequate these models tend to oversimplify reality different sources of uncertainties related to groundwater modeling can include the modeling process input parameters and sampling approach refsgaard et al 2007 the ensemble evidential belief function mohammady et al 2012 and tree based model was proposed to create the groundwater potential map naghibi et al 2019 the development of ensemble models has allowed the integration of a base learner approach with a prime algorithm to achieve more robust models that can be applied over large study areas where data coverage can be inconsistent naghibi et al 2017 however the application of hybrid models should be explored for different regions to determine the optimum model in terms of accuracy robustness overfitting and sensitivity to scarce data rahmati et al 2018 to reduce these modeling uncertainties we coupled a multi adaptive boosting hybrid model multiadaboosting based on a decision committee technique that combines adaptive boosting adaboost with wagging with logistic regression lr a robust model with strict expectations prior to training pradhan 2010 to develop the ensemble mablr model although multiadaboosting is one of the powerful adaptive boosting classifiers that can classify multiple classes on both basic and complex recognition problems yet it can be sensitive to the existence of the outliers in the dataset which is very common in groundwater domain as well as over fitting problems naghibi et al 2016 therefore we integrated lr with multiadaboosting to overcome the model over fitting and outlier sensitivity problems by producing a highly certain ensemble classifier with less dependency on modification of hyper parameters or settings our main goal was to evaluate the ability of mablr to assess the morphological parameters of groundwater aquifer potential zones in south korea and compare its results to those of support vector machine svm multiple layer perception mpl and standalone lr models specifically we optimized the contributing factors for lr groundwater modeling spatially modeled groundwater aquifer potential using the ensemble mablr machine learning model and compared the results to those of other constituent machine learning models including mlp svm and lr assessed the strength of machine learning model hyper parameters using a fuzzy logic supervised fls approach and compared the performance of mablr and other machine learning models the study site was the ulseong county in south korea and covers an area of about 1175 2 km2 fig 1 the ulseong county comprise of 831 0 km2 70 7 of forest land 214 6 km2 18 2 of farmland and 32 6 km2 2 7 of rivers the yearly average temperature is 11 c and it is a cold and dry region with very little precipitation due to its geographical nature as an inland basin situated between taebaek and sobaek mountain ranges it rains an average of 92 days annually the average precipitation is 960 mm which shows the shortage of rainfall compared to the korean mean of precipitation amount 1250 mm http www usc go kr eng about uiseong introduction location we identified 169 rock aquifers within the study area and recorded specific capacity and transmissivity information for each well in the region based on field surveys rock aquifer data indicate that the maximum range for aquifer groundwater is about 955 41 m3 h in winter declining to a minimum of 0 0005 m3 h in summer well inventory points were randomly separated into two classes of 70 118 wells for model training and 30 51 wells for model testing based on the transmissivity t characteristics of each individual well the well inventory was divided into two groups productive yield 40 m3 h and unproductive yield 40 m3 h according to the criteria of sameen et al 2018 to create an effective well inventory for use in the machine learning models productive and unproductive samples were assigned values of 1 and 0 respectively fig 1 shows the locations of the groundwater wells within the study area we examined the effects of 12 contributing morphological factors these factors were extracted using the arcgis 10 6 software in raster format at a spatial resolution of 10 m 10 m and statistically analyzed using waikato environment for knowledge analysis weka v 3 9 2 topographic indices were derived from a digital elevation model that was originally surveyed as a 1 5000 scale topographic map by the korean national geographic information institute we developed and calibrated the mablr model to map groundwater potential in the basin through the following steps first significant contributing factors were selected then we modeled groundwater aquifer potential using the calibrated mablr model and compared the results to those of other well known machine learning models finally we evaluated the model results using the κ coefficient root mean square error rmse receiver operating characteristics roc curve and the precision recall curve prc fig 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater conditioning parameters we performed probability analyses to examine the correlation among conditioning factors that can influence groundwater potential model results tehrany et al 2013 and groundwater aquifer productivity this requires training related parameters pradhan and lee 2010 aghdam et al 2016 hong et al 2017 rizeei et al 2018a which can affect model precision we selected the following groundwater conditioning factors for their potential contribution to the groundwater model topographic wetness index twi topographic roughness index tri stream power index spi specific catchment area sca topographic position index tpi multiresolution valley bottom flatness mvbf multiresolution ridge top flatness mrtf the convergence index ci melton ruggedness number mrn slope aspect slope length sl distance from the river distance from the fault profile curvature plane curvature altitude land use land cover lulc soil and geology to determine which contributing parameters were significantly correlated with groundwater aquifer productivity a forward stepwise lr was applied using the weka software the lr assessed the degree of functional correlation among all contributing parameters and spring locations which affect aquifer expansion hosmer et al 2013 ozdemir 2011 effective contributing parameters were defined as those with p 0 05 rahmati et al 2018 a total of 15 contributing parameters were identified and retained in the model twi tri spi tpi mvbf slope aspect sl distance from the river distance from fault profile curvature plane curvature altitude lulc and geology fig 3 elevation is among the most significant parameters used in groundwater analyses groundwater aquifer potential in highly elevated areas approaches zero botzen et al 2013 surface runoff flows from highly elevated areas toward lower regions consequently groundwater potential is higher in low altitude or flat terrains slope and aspect are topographical factors with important applications as hydrology parameters due to their effects on runoff accumulation and the velocity of excess rainfall rizeei et al 2017 an increase in slope decreases the amount of time available for surface infiltration increasing the amount of water entering drainage networks that will later be retrievable from groundwater aquifers aspect also can be influential parameters particularly in a hilly area north and east face aspect have exposed by the long duration of sun radiation where vegetation coverage is not as dense as west and south face aspect in korean region hence the rainfall drops cannot penetrate the bare soil where soil pores are more likely to get blocked by intense rainfall due to lack of enough vegetation coverage as a result the probability of groundwater is more on west or south face aspect rather east and north ones plan and profile curvature also contribute significantly to physical groundwater models these parameters consist of raster data ranging from negative concave to positive convex values and must be classified before becoming model input pixels with a value of zero are assigned to flat regions tpi indicates the position of each cell and is calculated as follows de reu et al 2013 guisan et al 1999 1 tpi e pixel e surrounding where e p i x e l is the altitude of the cell and e s u r r o u n d i n g is the mean altitude of the neighboring pixels high tpi values indicate upper slopes while low values of tpi show lower slopes where the potential of the groundwater aquifer is high the mvbf index links between size and flatness of valley bottoms which was incorporated into the algorithm by reducing the slope threshold zero value specifies erosional terrain with less possibility of groundwater aquifer while values above 1 indicating areas of deposition with much productive groundwater aquifer the mvbf index reflects the valley bottom characteristics of flatness and lowness flatness is measured using the inverse of the slope and lowness is measured using ranking elevation with respect to a circular surrounding area these two measures both scaled from 0 to 1 are combined by multiplication and can be interpreted as fuzzy set membership functions gallant and dowling 2003 kaufmann 1975 ls is a combination of slope gradient s and slope length l we adopted an extensively used method for calculating ls as follows 2 ls a s 22 13 0 4 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where a is the accumulated flow of the unit stream power theory which considers sediments and water and β is the slope in degrees basically a low value of ls is more probable for a productive groundwater aquifer spi and twi are water related parameters calculated as follows gokceoglu et al 2005 3 s p i a s t a n β 4 t w i l n a s t a n β where a s is the catchment area or flow accumulation m2 m 1 and β is the local slope gradient measured in degrees spi indicates the erosive power of water flow twi represents the effects of topography on runoff generation and the amount of flow accumulation at any location within the river catchment gokceoglu et al 2005 the accuracy of a topographic index can be estimated with respect to grid spacing and terrain roughness by comparing the relationship between the topographic index surface and reference data tri is another morphological parameter widely used in groundwater analyses it is calculated in this study as follows 5 t r i a b s m a x 2 m i n 2 where max and min represent the largest and smallest values of cells in nine rectangular neighborhoods of altitude values lulc types are also primary factors that strongly contribute to groundwater potential modeling a detailed understanding of lulcs bears extreme significance for environmental and natural hazards rizeei et al 2016 lithology and geology are also important parameters used to detect sensitive groundwater aquifer areas soil type directly affects the drainage process via characteristics such as texture permeability degree and structure lithological information regarding the permeability of rocks is also required the study area contained rocks from 142 different lithology classes variation in the factors contributing to the behavior and activity of groundwater cause ambiguity in the overlaying process therefore all factors were normalized to a common scale in the feature raster before overlaying youssef et al 2015 mojaddadi et al 2017 fanos and pradhan 2019 2 2 model optimization hyper parameters affect the quality and robustness of machine learning models and must therefore be selected to achieve the highest model performance liao et al 2012 once all significant hyper parameters were selected domain values were assigned for each individual hyper parameter these values indicate the range of probable values for each parameter because the optimal value for single hyper parameters should be coordinated with other hyper parameters finding the most effective domain value of hyper parameters for a model is a time consuming procedure without optimization systems woo et al 2007 in this study we specified six classes for each domain to cover its effective range following domain selection we applied an fls technique to optimize the hyper parameters zhang et al 2010 the fls optimized the hyper parameters of the mablr svm mlp and lr models by assigning an optimal predictive value for all involved hyper parameters within their domains to limit the degree of redundancy between them values of hyper parameters that were exceptionally associated with the model and with low inter correlations were selected on the basis of discrepancy evaluation tong and murray 2012 the fls evaluated hyper parameters by a search run iteratively from a random vertex that calculated the ideal value among the available domain after all runs were assessed the optimal hyper parameter configuration was selected within 184 iterations according to evaluation metrics the optimal hyper parameters for all proposed models are summarized in table 1 2 3 theory of the lr svm mlp and mablr models lr is a widely used multivariate statistical model that can be applied to continuous or discrete data of any distribution or raster format lee and sambath 2006a b it was proposed by mcfadden 1974 to measure probability of occurrence depending on contributing parameters lr can be used to evaluate relationships among binary dependent variables over nominal and scalar values of independent variables shirzadi et al 2012 svm was designed on the basis of statistical learning theory to minimize operational uncertainty yao et al 2008 this process converts nonlinear structures into linear structures according to hyperplane creation tehrany et al 2014 a separate hyperplane is created for the original space with n coordinates among points within two different categories marjanović et al 2011 the hyperplane separates training datasets based on a kernel function of the svm support vectors are recognized as neighboring training vertices of the ideal hyperplane the goal of the svm model is to recognize the ideal separating hyperplane range the mlp algorithm is a feed forward artificial neural network nn that uses nodes linked by input signals and numeric weights to produce layers that receive process and display output harun et al 2010 back propagation is applied to reduce errors accumulated via the repetitive approach nns have successfully been utilized in remote sensing applications limitations of the mlp model include high computational costs and overlearning mia and dhar 2016 multiadaboosting merges adaboost with wagging to produce a decision committee model webb 2000 bui et al 2016 that reduces both variance and bias although it cannot be applied for committees of 10 members multiadaboosting exhibits greater error reduction than all other relative committed algorithms kotsiantis et al 2007 in comparison mablr uses lr for classifier based learning to generate decision committees with less error than either wagging or multiadaboosting even for a large cross section of datasets webb 2000 mablr is more efficient than multiadaboosting due to its matching parallel execution algorithms the steps of mablr implementation are shown in fig 4 all classifiers determined by wagging are independent from all others permitting parallel multiplication and creating uncertainty in the multiadaboosting model at the sub committee class mablr improves error reduction compared to other approaches including bagging decision trees wagging and multiadaboosting particularly at t 10 when variance is amplified thus reducing the frequency at which the central tendency is created and therefore reducing its ability to contribute to uncertainty 2 4 evaluation methods the following evaluation metrics were applied to assess the accuracy of groundwater potential models rmse κ coefficient roc and prc the κ coefficient measures the overall accuracy of the model among all correctly assigned samples on a diagonal basis in the error matrix allocated by the full dataset ridd and liu 1998 the κ coefficient is calculated as follows 6 k m i 1 r x ii i 1 r x i x i m 2 i 1 r x i x i where r reflects the total number of rows in the error matrix xii is observation i xi and x 1 are the minimal totals and m is the set of observations roc curves are designed to evaluate and visualize the performance of an analytical model they indicate sensitivity or a true positive rate tp associated with a decision threshold on the y axis and specificity or false positive rate fp on the x axis fawcett 2006 thus representing the positive and negative probability respectively that a pixel is classified correctly the area under the roc curve estimates the overall accuracy of the model nampak et al 2014 pradhan 2010 however evaluation of the model solely by visual interpretation of roc can be misleading thus the precision recall curve prc is a complementary evaluation metric that is useful for imbalanced datasets the prc shows the correlation between the positive predictive value ppv or precision and sensitivity for all possible pixels from which tp and fp can be calculated the prc graph can be plotted by dividing sensitivity by ppv the x axis represents recall or sensitivity and the y axis represents precision each point on the prc graph thus represents a selected cut off a perfect model will have a roc and prc of 1 whereas a value approaching 0 indicates an inaccurate model rmse is used to evaluate differences between the observed sample values and predicted model values rmsd is the square root of the second trial or the quadratic mean of the deviations from observed values to predicted values hyndman and koehler 2006 rmse was calculated as follows 7 rmse i 1 n x test x train 2 n where x test is the set of testing values and x train is the set of training values at i 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater potential mapping groundwater aquifer potential was modeled using four machine learning techniques mablr mlp sav and lr maps based on these models are shown in fig 5 we focused mainly on the development of the mablr ensemble model because this study is the first to implement it to determine groundwater probability therefore the optimization processes are discussed in detail the models were assessed according to four accuracy metrics groundwater potential aquifer maps were created on the basis of predicted probability ranging from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no probable pixels and 1 indicates 100 probability of occurrence to create thematic zoning maps which are more easily understood by end users and decision makers we used the quantile technique in the gis platform to reclassify the probability index into five classes very high high moderate low and very low high potential areas were located in low elevation zones near riverbanks and low potential areas were found in high elevation areas with steep slopes these findings were common among all groundwater potential aquifer maps clearly riparian areas and some upstream areas are expected to have the potential for groundwater yield in particular mablr results indicated that locations with the highest groundwater aquifer potential were mainly situated in the western and southwestern regions of the study area fig 5 by contrast very low groundwater potential was assigned to eastern and northwestern regions of the study area among a total of 59 productive wells 47 were assigned to very high and high groundwater aquifer potential zones indicating the high precision of the mablr model the mablr model was used to extract the degree of contribution of each factor fig 6 the most effective parameter in determining groundwater potential was spi with a weight of 4 844 variation in spi can directly increase or decrease groundwater potential plane curvature and mvbf were the second and third most influential factors with weights of 4 315 and 4 240 respectively these factors significantly affected runoff behavior and further delineated areas of groundwater concentration other hydrological and morphological factors including tpi tri and sl also contributed greatly to groundwater potential zones with weights of 3 076 3 039 and 2 537 respectively altitude index twi and profile curvature made moderate contributions weights 1 189 0 996 0 955 and 0 481 respectively however mablr defined slope aspect geology distance from fault and lulc as the least influential factors for this study area with weights 0 2 most of the artificial intelligence based models contain multiple hyper parameters that must be precisely defined to achieve ideal results their interactions must also be considered for model optimization dehnavi et al 2015 zare et al 2013 the trial and error methods used by machine learning models to retrieve optimal hyper parameter values are time consuming and can introduce errors particularly if the number of hyper parameters exceeds four and the range of their domains is very wide mojaddadi rizeei et al 2019 hence automating this selection process is useful for decreasing computational time and increasing the accuracy of the final output by considering the full range of possible interactions among hyper parameters we adopted fls optimization which refines the parameter configuration at each iteration until convergence however increasing the number of iterations does not necessarily result in enhanced configuration fls determined optimal hyper parameter values within 184 iterations table 1 lists the feasible and optimal hyper parameters of the implemented models examined in this study as determined by the fls approach the mablr model was calibrated using four hyper parameters including weight threshold seed number the number of subcommittees and batch size the well calibrated mablr ensemble model achieved greater bias and error reduction than multiadaboost particularly at small committee sizes 3 2 evaluation of the groundwater potential models the models examined in this study were evaluated by rmse κ coefficient roc and prc which reflect the efficiency accuracy and validity of the resulting groundwater potential aquifer maps the greatest difference between roc and prc is that the roc graph produces a greater number of true negative results table 2 the assessment was divided into two parts goodness of fit success and validation prediction a training sample of well locations which represented 70 of the total inventory was used to assess the success of the model and the testing sample included the remaining 30 of data not used during the modeling process all metrics indicated a considerable correlation between the model results and observed data however the trained data were not used in the validation process the success rate goodness of fit and prediction rate validation results are shown in table 2 the rmse results indicated that mablr had lower error than all other models with values of 0 2483 and 0 3003 for goodness of fit and validation assessment respectively the predictive performance of mablr was also greater for goodness of fit and validation assessment in terms of κ coefficient 0 8191 and 0 7814 respectively roc 0 917 and 0 838 and prc 0 931 and 0 872 fig 7 by reducing bias and variance in the dataset due to integrated with lr the ensemble mablr reduced outlier negative effects and sampling patterns more than other implemented models also it showed the best capability to minimize the overfitting problem due to optimized hyper parameters of the multiadaboosting which showed a stable accuracy variation from goodness of fit to validation which is a common issue among ensemble model the mlp results for goodness of fit included a κ coefficient of 0 6954 roc of 0 843 and prc of 0 924 slightly lower values were obtained for validation 0 6697 0 823 and 0 851 respectively rmse error values indicated that the mlp model had the second highest success rate 0 2385 and the third highest validation rate 0 435 among all models the svm model yielded κ coefficient roc and prc values of 0 6853 and 0 6801 0 834 and 0 813 and 0 883 and 0 791 for goodness of fit and validation assessment respectively svm placed third among all accuracy assessment metrics svm rmse values indicated the highest error in terms of success rate 0 3119 and the second lowest error in terms of validation rate 0 3217 lr showed the lowest accuracy among all models with κ coefficient roc and prc values of 0 5569 0 822 and 0 8685 respectively in terms of goodness of fit and 0 5401 0 745 and 0 8116 in terms of validation rmse values indicated that lr had a slightly higher success rate 0 2937 than the svm and the worst performance among all models 0 4704 in general all models examined in this study had an acceptable amount of uncertainty and high goodness of fit the well calibrated ensemble mablr model exhibited the highest performance for modeling groundwater aquifer potential 4 conclusion sustainable groundwater aquifer management requires precise modeling to accurately and reliably simulate conditions in nature modeling groundwater aquifer potential is a delicate process involving the estimation of several morphological and hydrological parameters several techniques have been proposed for groundwater potential mapping however not all can be applied in data scarce regions where bias and variance are high as they tend toward oversimplification although multiadaboosting is one of the powerful adaptive boosting classifiers that can classify multiple classes even on complex recognition problems yet it is sensitive to the existence of the outliers in the dataset which is very common in groundwater domain as well as overfitting problems therefore we proposed the ensemble mablr which reduces bias and variance in the dataset in the gyeongsangbuk do basin of south korea the integrated multiadaboosting with the actual function of lr caused less sensitivity on outliers training distribution that resulted in a tangible reduction of overfitting problem with less dependency on modification of hyper parameters several contributing factors were assessed using a dataset of specific capacity and transmissivity for 169 well locations initially we applied a forward stepwise lr algorithm to identify 15 significantly contributing morphological factors twi tri spi tpi mrvbf slope aspect sl distance from the river distance from fault profile curvature plane curvature altitude lulc and geology then we developed a new robust ensemble method coupling lr with the multiadaboosting technique to construct the mablr model which showed higher performance than other well known machine learning methods including mpl svm and standalone lr we applied fls to successfully retrieve optimal hyper parameter values for the implemented models the model results showed that mablr had the best accuracy and efficiency based on evaluation by rmse κ coefficient roc and prc the most influential contributing factors were identified as spi plan curvature and mrvbf visual interpolation of high groundwater aquifer potential areas showed that they were located in low elevation zones near riverbanks whereas low potential areas were located in high elevation areas with steep slopes our results will be valuable for evaluating groundwater studies and successive model development to further reduce uncertainties and consider the morphological factors that influence the precision of groundwater potential modeling the main barrier of this research was using the contributing factors with a moderate spatial resolution which reduced the quality of groundwater mapping thus it is suggested to use the 1 meter spatial resolution to leverage the final map precision since the proposed model has the capability of modeling the functions with scare input data it is also recommended being experimented on other probability application such as landslide that has a smaller number of inventory datasets however the proposed model should be implemented in multiple regions to test its transferability and

6048,the single fracture seepage model is important for fracture network seepage models and underground engineering but the existing knowledge is insufficient for the roles of the high hydraulic pressure joint surface destruction gouge material and the anisotropy of flow regime in the single fracture seepage model during shear process in this study coupled shear flow tests were conducted at 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mpa hydraulic pressure with radial fluid flow and then 3d simulation models were established by using comsol multiphysics 5 2a with the reynolds averaged navier stokes k ε turbulence model for initial and peak shear conditions results showed that the radial flow cubic law diverged from experimental results seriously and non darcy flow behaviour was remarkable during tests high hydraulic pressure decreased the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law dramatically by increasing the influence of inertia force and the accuracy was sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure the flow regime and velocity were varied and influenced by the anisotropic tortuosity ratio maximum inclination angle and the uneven distribution of aperture the absolute values of velocity vertical to the radial distance reduced with decreasing roughness the roughness tortuosity ratio and maximum inclination angle of the fracture joint reduced dynamically with destruction of the joint surface and formation of gouge material leading to a significant change in the relationship between mechanical and hydraulic apertures moreover the radial flow cubic law was modified on the basis of the relationship of mechanical and hydraulic aperture with hydraulic gradient this study may serve as a basis to establish fracture network seepage model and other similar tests keywords coupled shear

the fluid flow rock mass play a pivotal role in underground water supply water reservoir engineering and other fluid flow related engineering javadi et al 2010 rong et al 2017 wang et al 2009 olayiwola and dejam 2019 in a rock mass fluid flow mainly concentrates in fractures thus the study of seepage in a single fracture is rapidly becoming a key instrument in rock mass engineering xiong et al 2011 mashayekhizadeh et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zhang et al 2019a javadi et al 2010 and the single fracture seepage theory is fundamental to the fracture network seepage simulation model huang et al 2019 dejam et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b tan et al 2019 the navier stokes n s equations are widely used to describe fluid flow behaviour and analyse fluid structure interaction javadi et al 2014 azarmanesh et al 2019 however the n s equations are difficult to apply to rock mass with countless fractures and the main case of this problem is the inertia force item cannot be efficiently solved wang et al 2015 rong et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 cao et al 2018 thus the use of simplified seepage equations such as the stokes and reynolds equations and the most widely used cubic law is proposed in the exploration of fluid flow evolution in a single fracture and evaluation of fracture hydraulic conductivity javadi et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 li et al 2008 the cubic law shows that flow rate is linear with hydraulic pressure and the cube of aperture as shown in fig 1 a the cubic law assumes the joint surfaces are smooth and parallel and the fluid flow in fracture obeys darcy s law however for natural fracture fig 1 b the joint surfaces are always rough the contact areas are ubiquitous in fracture the effective seepage channels are narrowed by vortexes and gouge material and the flow path is usually tortuous in addition the flow regime is easy to be turbulent with high hydraulic pressure thus the cubic law cannot provide adequate support when applied to natural aperture zhou et al 2015 many researchers have shown increasing interest in the flow behaviour in a single fracture with complex conditions and in improving the accuracy of the single fracture seepage model experiments and numerical simulation play important roles in addressing the difficult issues recent experiments have included confining stress flow tests chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2017 and shear flow tests esaki et al 1999 javadi et al 2010 olsson and barton 2001 rong et al 2016 xiong et al 2011 yin et al 2017 numerical simulation models were usually established with the reynolds equation the stokes equation the n s equations and turbulence models zhang et al 2019a javadi et al 2010 wang et al 2015 xiong et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 experimental and numerical studies aimed at investigating the influence of the factors in fig 1 b in the cubic law and modifying the cubic law other non linear seepage models such as forchheimer or lzbash laws have also been widely used in recent years li et al 2008 reported that increased contact ratio evidently reduces the hydraulic conductivity of fracture and the distribution of contact areas is another factor that influences fluid flow in a fracture the contact ratio of fracture varies during shear xiao et al 2016 established a contact algorithm of artificial marble fracture during shear by performing laboratory tests and using charge coupled device cameras and found remarkable changes in contact ratio and mean aperture the algorithm helps build the seepage model but neglects the influence of gouge materials from crushed asperities and may overestimate the hydraulic conductivity of a fracture when fluid flow bypasses contact areas and asperities or climbs over asperities the seepage path becomes tortuous thus the actual path for fluid flow is always larger than the straight line distance and flow velocity changes frequently flow velocity the hydraulic conductivity of fracture and energy loss are diverse results from anisotropic roughness zhang et al 2019a reported how the shape and density of roughness elements affect fluid flow in a regular single roughness fracture and found the remarkable influence of vortex caused when fluid flow bypasses the roughness elements however the anisotropy of flow regime cannot be considered because the simulation models in the study of zhang et al 2019a were 2d after using numerical simulations thompson and brown 1991 found that the important directional characteristic of joint surfaces is degree roughness and that the direction of fluid flow and tha the groove of asperities are influencing factors employing experiments and simulation method auradou et al 2006 found that fluid flow velocity and fracture hydraulic conductivity perpendicular to shear are larger than those parallel to shear resulting from the change in aperture and the contact of void space and the displacement of joint surfaces considerably contributes to the effect by solving reynolds equation vilarrasa et al 2011 indicated that the flow rate and particle travel velocity in the direction perpendicular to shear direction greatly increase because the connectivity of void space changes during shear and fluid flow easily passes through the region of fracture with excellent connectivity and low energy loss matsuki et al 2010 argued the difference in angles between shear macroscopic fluid flow directions and provided the formula of mechanical aperture e m and hydraulic aperture e h with angle most experimental results showed that darcy flow is infrequent in fracture with rough joint surfaces especially under complex conditions zhang and nemcik 2013 found that darcy s law applies only to the mated rough fracture because the small aperture and high tortuosity of the flow pathway resist fluid flow severely and reduce flow velocity and the behaviour of non darcy flow for all non mated fractures is remarkable in the experiments by zhang and nemcik 2013 the non darcy flow behaviour is more obvious in high roughness fracture zhang et al 2017 showed that the local darcy and non darcy flow are concomitant in some conditions because of the inhomogeneous aperture and flow distribution and the linear and non linear seepage models need to be applied simultaneously the external stress exerts a strong influence on flow behaviour especially when the confining stress is increased chen et al 2019 found that the non darcy behaviour of fluid flow increases with the reduction of the hydraulic pressure and the various distributions of the interconnected void areas some studies javadi et al 2014 rong et al 2016 showed that the non darcy behaviour of fluid flow decrease with shear process because of the decreasing influence of roughness but the other factors are unclear for the boundedness of the cubic law above several researchers aimed to modify the cubic law and the most widely used approach is establishing the relation between e m and e h by considering different conditions li et al 2016 olsson and barton 2001 proposed the empirical engineering model for the hydromechanical coupling of rock joints by considering joint roughness coefficient jrc and mobilized jrc during shear the model indicated that the relation between e m and e h is nonlinear and separated by the peak shear displacement considering aperture as 3d distribution zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 established the relation between e m and the standard deviation σ apert of aperture and then calculated e h with e m σ apert and contact ratio during shear xiong et al 2011 specified that results are only approximate when the σ apert e m ratio in zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 s model approaches 0 816 xiong et al 2011 added the standard deviation of local fracture slope and reynolds number reflecting the effect of inertia force from the side from zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 s model to describe the relationship between e m and e h xie et al 2015 also used σ apert to describe the relation between e m and e h and explained the change in σ apert the distribution of the absolute velocity and pressure drop under constant pressure gradient during shear is then obtained the results of the abovementioned studies indicated that e m is always larger than e h which implies that the cubic law overstates the fracture hydraulic conductivity and can be modified by replacing e h with e m by contrast wang et al 2015 modified the cubic law directly by considering local tortuosity and roughness after indicating the validity of the modified cubic law wang et al 2015 found that the arithmetic mean of effective errors for the studied fracture is reduced from 40 8 to 3 7 compared with local cubic law in this study we investigated the flow regime in a single fracture with joint surface destruction gouge material high hydraulic pressure and anisotropic roughness and analysed the difference between the cubic law and experimental results during shear process firstly the coupled shear flow tests were presented in artificial single fractures at a constant normal stress of 1 91 mpa and different high hydraulic pressures of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mpa with radial fluid flow then 3d simulation models were established by using comsol multiphysics 5 2a comsol multiphysics 2016 with the reynolds averaged n s k ε turbulence model for initial and peak shear conditions the radial flow cubic law was modified by establishing the relationship of mechanical and hydraulic aperture with hydraulic gradient 2 materials and methods 2 1 specimens and fracture sample preparation to guarantee the repeatability of the tests and reduce costs we built the test specimens with plaster water and retardant at a weight ratio of 1 0 25 0 005 table 1 shows the physico mechanical properties of the specimen the upper and lower specimens are shown in fig 2 cao et al 2018 all the specimens were 200 mm in diameter and 75 mm in height and the surfaces of the specimens were regular dentate with 30 along the shear direction as shown in fig 2 b an injection hole 8 mm in diameter in the centre of the lower specimen was installed thus the fluid flow was transported radially through the fracture between the upper and lower specimens 2 2 experimental test method the test apparatus tjxw 600 microprocessor control coupled shear flow test system was used in this paper the side view of the apparatus is shown in fig 3 cao et al 2018 the apparatus can provide the shear and normal loads of up to 600 kn by the hydraumatic servo oil source and the maximum hydraulic pressure can reach 3 mpa normal and shear displacement were measured by using a cable displacement meter the data of normal displacement normal stress shear displacement shear stress and aperture flow rate can be collected during shear the initial setting parameter was stable and the shear box sealing property was assured during test as shown in fig 2 c the boundary of the side and bottom of the upper and lower specimens was no slip boundary and the shear process was achieved by fixing the lower specimen and moving the upper specimen for the tests normal stress condition was constant normal load cnl boundary at 1 91 mpa the boundary of the water inlet and outlet was at constant hydraulic pressure boundaries of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 normal stress started to increase at the beginning of the test and the inlet hydraulic pressure initially increased when normal stress reached 0 6 mpa when the hydraulic pressure increased to the set value steadily and the shear process was operated and the tests terminated when shear displacement δ reached 32 mm 2 3 numerical simulation method to investigate the distribution of streamlines and flow velocity before shear was broken we established 3d seepage simulation models for initial and peak shear conditions with comsol multiphysics 5 2a comsol multiphysics 2016 referring to zhang et al 2019a s study we simulated the fluid flow in small aperture with the k ε turbulence model comsol multiphysics 5 2a provides the reynolds averaged n s k ε modules and the governing equations are shown as follows comsol multiphysics 2016 1 ρ u u ρ i μ μ t u u t f 2 ρ u 0 3 ρ u k μ μ t σ k k p k ρ ε 4 ρ u ε μ μ t σ ε ε c ε 1 ε k p k c ε 2 ρ ε 2 k 5 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε 6 p k μ t u u u t where ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity tensor i is the unit tensor μ is the viscous coefficient μ t is the turbulent viscous coefficient f is the body force tensor k is the turbulent kinetic energy σ k is the turbulent prandtl number of turbulent kinetic energy p k is the turbulent energy generated by average velocity gradient ε is the dissipation rate σε is the turbulent prandtl number of dissipation rate and cε 1 cε 2 and cμ are the calculated coefficients as the default constant in comsol multiphysics 5 2a cε 1 1 44 cε 2 1 92 and cμ 0 09 the model range contained the interspace between the upper and lower specimens in initial and peak shear conditions the boundary condition of water inlet was flow velocity boundary and the values were calculated with the flow rate from the experimental results and the area of the simulation models water outlet was the pressure boundary and the values were 0 in all simulation models the joint surfaces were the wall boundary fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the distribution of aperture of simulation models in which e 0 is the initial mechanical aperture and δu n is the normal displacement of aperture due to shear stress considering that the contact areas between the lower and upper joint surfaces and e 0 cannot be measured during tests we neglected the contact areas and assumed that e 0 was distributed equally everywhere as shown in fig 4 a by comparing the flow rates of initial shear condition models and experimental results e 0 can be back calculated through the least square method and the value was 0 201 mm for coupled shear flow tests e m can be confirmed using the following equation esaki et al 1999 7 e m e 0 u n δ u n where u n is the normal displacement of aperture due to normal stress for eq 7 u n was equal to 0 under cnl boundary xiong et al 2011 thus the aperture of the peak shear condition model can be determined by adding e 0 and δu n 0 481 0 492 0 474 and 0 475 respective at the peak shear displacement δ p fig 4 b the calculation parameters of the initial and peak shear condition models are shown in table 2 as shown in fig 5 the flow rate results of the simulation models were close to experiments thus the value of e 0 we calculated was usable 3 results versus cubic law 3 1 cubic law the radial flow cubic law assumes that the joint surfaces of fracture are smooth and paralleled the fluid flow state is laminar and distributes axisymmetric and can be described as follows zhang and nemcik 2013 8 q 2 π g 12 υ ln r i r o δ h e 3 where q is the flow rate in fracture g is the gravitational acceleration υ is the fluid kinematic viscosity r o is the water inlet radius r i is the joint surface outer radius δh is the difference in the pressure head of water inlet and outlet and e is the fracture aperture when eq 8 was used to calculate the flow rate of a fracture e e m was applied and the result was denoted as q c when eq 8 was used to identify e h q q e was obtained by applying e e h 3 2 estimated and measured flow rates for shear tests the change in δu n measured flow rate q e and q c during shear tests are shown in figs 6 and 7 as shown in figs 6 and 7 a δu n increased signally before δ p and then changed slightly q e had a remarkable increment before δ p and hydraulic pressure had a strong influence in q e but did not change δu n combining the calculated e 0 we can change eq 7 to the following equation to confirm e m 9 e m 0 201 δ u n where the length unit in eq 9 is mm as shown in fig 7 b the q c q e ratio was much larger than 1 during shear process with different hydraulic pressure which indicated that the radial flow cubic law seriously deviated from the experiments and overstated the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture at the entire process of shear the change in q c q e ratio indicated that the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law reduced dramatically before δ p then the difference between the radial flow cubic law and experimental results stabilised because of the joint surface destruction 3 3 dependency of flow rate on hydraulic pressure as shown in fig 7 b higher hydraulic pressure obviously contributed to the accuracy loss of the radial flow cubic law the increment in q c q e ratio was different when the hydraulic pressure increased by 0 2 mpa and the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law was more sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure the radial flow cubic law is a linear equation simplified from the n s equations after disregarding inertial forces and assumes that the fluid flow in the fracture is darcy flow in our study as shown in fig 8 when we added the origin of coordinates which represented that q e 0 when the hydraulic pressure equalled to 0 the relationship between pressure gradient and q e was nonlinear and fitted with forchheimer law as follows zhang and nemcik 2013 10 p a q e b q e 2 where p is the pressure gradient and a and b are model coefficients as shown in fig 8 the relationship between p and q e could be described by non linear forchheimer law accurately thus the non darcy flow behaviour was remarkable in this study and the flow regime did not satisfy the assumption of the radial flow cubic law the influence intension of inertial forces of fluid flow can be estimated by using the reynolds number which represents the specific value of inertial and viscous forces thus a high reynolds number would cause non darcy flow and reynolds number increases proportionally with flow velocity hence the high hydraulic pressure increases the nonlinear behaviour of fluid flow and simultaneously reduces the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law and the fluid flow with high hydraulic pressure does not obey darcy s law 3 4 nonaxisymmetry of streamlines and flow velocity the distribution of streamlines with 0 6 mpa hydraulic pressure of initial and peak shear condition models is shown in fig 9 the streamlines distribution with other hydraulic pressure is shown in appendix a figs a1 and a2 as shown in figs 9 a1 and a2 results showed that the distribution of streamlines was nonaxisymmetric with water inlet which deviated from the assumption of the radial flow cubic law in addition the streamlines were tortuous when bypassed by the dentate aperture and close to groove through the water inlet given the uneven distribution of aperture the stream line of the peak shear condition model was untidy and sparse to investigate the absolute values of flow velocity distribution of different flow directions we divided the joint surface into 11 flow directions as shown in fig 10 a fig 10 b shows the results of tortuosity ratio τ which is the actual seepage path relative to the radius of joint surface walsh and brace 1984 and the maximum inclination angle θ max of asperities in different flow directions as shown in fig 10 b τ distributed symmetrically with the 90 flow direction and the flow directions with the same τ had different θ max values both τ and θ max were strongly affected by the shape and density of roughness elements the absolute values of flow velocity of the initial and peak shear condition models with 0 6 mpa hydraulic pressure are shown in fig 11 the flow velocity results of other hydraulic pressure are shown in appendix a figs a3 and a4 as shown in figs 11 a3 and a4 the flow velocity of different flow directions was diverse in the initial and peak shear condition models and the values of flow velocity reduced with increased radial distance because of the energy loss and fluid flow expansion in addition the values of flow velocity reduced with increasing τ at the same radius because the seepage path was extended with increase in τ and the energy loss was remarkable when fluid flow impacted joint surface and bypassed asperities the flow velocity evolution curve became more fluctuant and the frequency and amplitude of the curves were augmented with the increase in τ the minimal value points of the curves appeared in the peak and valley parts in fig 4 in the flow directions with the same τ large θ max advanced the phase of the flow velocity evolution curve the results agreed with the study of zhang et al 2019a where the increased roughness elements density reduced the hydraulic conductivity of fracture and the flow velocity and the energy loss became drastic the shape of roughness elements exerted strong influence in the velocity and regime of flow fluid the waveform of the flow velocity evolution curves with the same flow direction were more undulating and complex in peak shear condition models resulting from the uneven distribution of aperture fig 4 b and the flow velocity was reduced drastically in the void space with large aperture moreover high hydraulic pressure increased the flow velocity of all flow directions and slightly influenced the distribution of streamlines thus the inertia force of fluid flow increased in all sides when the flow velocity was divided to the radial velocity rv and the velocity vertical to the radial distance vvr taking the 0 90 and 180 flow directions of the initial and peak shear condition models with 0 6 mpa for example the absolute values of rv and vvr results are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the values of rv were larger than the values of vvr in both initial and peak shear condition models for the 90 flow direction the values of vvr were dinky comparing with rv thus the values of vvr reduced with decreasing roughness moreover the value difference between rv and vvr was strongly influenced by τ and θ max 4 discussion 4 1 impact of joint surface destruction as shown in fig 7 b the change in q c q e ratio stabilized after δ p which indicated that the destruction of joint surfaces strongly influenced the fluid flow regime and the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law the destruction of joint surfaces and the forms of gouge material in the peak and final shear conditions is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the joint surfaces were destructed completely after δ p and the gouge material buried the regular dentate asperities completely in the final shear condition in addition the forms of the gouge material changed during the shear tests at the peak shear condition the gouge material was massive and then the volume and distribution of the gouge material were reduced and rearranged with shear destruction the gouge material was ground to small granular and powdery in the final shear condition the jrc of the fracture reduced immediately after δ p because of the destruction of joint surfaces and the distribution of gouge material with different forms the contact areas τ and θ max of the upper and lower joint surfaces were changed dynamically at the same time fig 14 shows the schematic of the distribution of the gouge material in the peak and final shear conditions after δ p the seepage channels of fracture increased and became complex and the τ and θ max of different flow directions became more diverse than before δ p the contact areas of fracture were decided by the forms of the gouge material and the distribution of aperture was greater even when compared with the initial to peak shear conditions moreover fluid flow could transport through the small granular and powdery gouge material which may be treated as a porous medium these results could be used to explain the reason for the steady trend of q c q e ratio after δ p and the non darcy flow behaviour decrease in the studies by javadi et al 2014 and rong et al 2016 thus the influence of surfaces destruction and gouge material in single fracture seepage model during shear especially the continuous destruction of joint surfaces and gouge material needs to be investigated 4 2 modification of the cubic law according to results above the radial flow cubic law deviated from the experiments seriously and must be modified when applied to experiments or the natural fractures particularly with high hydraulic pressure for the tests in this paper we modified the radial flow cubic law by replacing e h with e m in two stages separated by δ p according to the experimental results the relation between e m and e h with different hydraulic pressures is shown in fig 15 and can be described with the following equation 11 e h α β e m δ δ p e h α e β e m δ δ p where α and β are the fitting coefficients as shown in fig 15 e m was much larger than e h because the effective seepage channels were reduced and the reduction of e m was limited by the gouge material in addition e h had a linear relationship with e m before δ p and then translated to an exponential relationship resulting from the joint surface destruction and gouge material eq 11 shows that e h 0 when e m 0 before and after δ p which indicated that no matter how small the fracture aperture was the fluid flow could transport though the fracture in the tests of this paper many connected seepage channels appeared in the closed fracture because the fracture with rough joint surfaces could not completely close durham and bonner 1994 reported that fluid flow could transport though the closed fracture even when normal stress reaches 160 mpa the change in α and β with different hydraulic gradients j is shown in fig 16 where j represents the theoretical value calculated by the corresponding hydraulic and the radius of fracture and is a dimensionless number before δ p α and β changed with j linearly after δ p α and β had power function relationships with j thus in this paper the radial flow cubic law can be modified by combining eqs 8 and 11 and the relation among α β and j 4 3 comparison to similar existing studies many studies investigated the seepage model of a single fracture with complex conditions comparing to similar existing studies we focused on the influence of high hydraulic pressure joint surface destruction gouge material and anisotropy of flow regime fractures with tens to hundreds of metre of water head is common in nature and engineering because the limit of test apparatus in most coupled shear flow tests is reported with low j 0 117 rong et al 2016 2 16 7 javadi et al 2014 0 120 yin et al 2017 0 5 10 li et al 2008 and 0 21 olsson and barton 2001 other experiments zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2019 with high j were carried out with confining stress and concentrated on the nonlinear relationship between hydraulic gradient and flow rate by using forchheimer or lzbash laws which cannot reflect the relationship between aperture and flow rate and were hard to apply to fracture network seepage models in the present study we investigated the influence of high hydraulic pressure in the accuracy of radial flow cubic law and the relationship between e h and e m during shear process and then modified the radial flow cubic law with j single fracture flow tests were mainly conducted under confining or shear stress for the confining stress flow tests chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2017 the aperture of fracture was only influenced by confining stress the relative position and geometrical morphology of joint surfaces the aperture did not change during tests for the shear flow tests esaki et al 1999 javadi et al 2010 olsson and barton 2001 rong et al 2016 xiong et al 2011 yin et al 2017 the fracture aperture and the relative position of joint surfaces changed with shear process for most stress flow tests the fracture joints were unbroken but in nature it is common for the destruction of fracture joints with complex stress condition and gouge material is widespread in some fracture thus we analysed the influence of joint surface destruction and gouge material in the geometrical morphology of fracture accuracy of radial flow and the relationship between e m and e h although the analysis of joint surface destruction and gouge material in our study was primary we thought it was potential for other similar studies we also investigated the distribution of streamlines and flow velocity in different flow directions and found obvious anisotropy of flow regime caused by anisotropic joint surfaces indicating that the seepage model for a settled fracture should be adjusted according to fluid flow direction although the anisotropy of flow regime and flow velocity was analysed with artificial fracture in this study we thought it was common in natural fracture however few studies discussed about this issue thus further experiments or simulation works are suggested 4 4 limitation remarks despite the meticulous care we have taken the following limitations were not avoided in our study 1 coupled shear flow tests similar to most shear flow tests the shear box was sealed and invisible in our tests we cannot observe the destruction of joint surfaces the distribution of gouge material with different forms and the change in joint surface jrc τ and θ max during shear process at any time the change in these factors changed dynamically during shear tests and determined the establishment of seepage model 2 simulation model the simulation models we used cannot consider the destruction of joint surfaces and the form change of the gouge material especially the coupling between fluid flow and gouge material further numerical analysis is suggested to investigate the dynamic changes in the existing factors in the single fracture seepage model 3 joint surfaces of fracture coupled shear flow tests were conducted on artificial joint with regular dentate asperities because the influence of joint surfaces destruction and gouge material were remarkable and transparently with regular dentate joint in our study but the distribution of roughness and aperture of natural joint was spatial and arbitrarily thus when the results of our study were applied to natural fracture the geometrical morphological relationship between the different joint surfaces needs be established according to the suggestion of mirzaghorbanali et al 2014 we can extend the results of this study to natural fracture by mapping the joint surface geometry with fourier transformation or fractal methods given these limitations relevant works are suggested to perform in single fracture shear flow studies with experimental and numerical methods that consider the influence of joint surface destruction gouge material anisotropy of flow regime and high hydraulic pressure 5 summary and conclusions this study aimed to investigate the fluid flow regime in single fracture during shear process influenced by high hydraulic pressure joint surface destruction gouge material and anisotropy of flow regime coupled shear flow tests were conducted with 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 hydraulic pressure and 3d simulation models were established by using comsol multiphysics 5 2a with reynolds averaged n s k ε turbulence model the main summaries and conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the accuracy of radial flow cubic law decreased dramatically before peak shear displacement and then tended to be steady resulting from shear broken high hydraulic pressure decreased the accuracy by increasing the influence of inertia force and the accuracy was more sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure 2 joint surfaces destruction and gouge material exerted remarkable influence on the fracture geometrical morphology and flow regime because of joint surface destruction and gouge material the roughness tortuosity ratio and maximum inclination angle of joint surfaces decreased dynamically during shear process and the distribution of aperture and effective seepage channels became unpredictable the difference between cubic law and experimental results and flow regime became steady because of the joint surface destruction and gouge material especially the forms of gouge material 3 the non darcy flow behaviour was obvious in our study because of the high hydraulic pressure and complex geometrical morphology of joint surfaces the anisotropic behaviour of fluid flow was serious and the streamlines and flow velocity were varied in different flow directions resulting from the anisotropic roughness of the joint both tortuosity ratio and maximum inclination angle had strong influence in the change in flow velocity and the absolute values of velocity vertical to the radial distance reduced with decreasing roughness 4 the radial flow cubic law was modified by establishing the empirical equation between mechanical and hydraulic aperture with different hydraulic gradient mechanical and hydraulic aperture showed a linear relationship before peak shear displacement and tended to be non linear because of joint surface destruction and gouge material declaration of

6048,the single fracture seepage model is important for fracture network seepage models and underground engineering but the existing knowledge is insufficient for the roles of the high hydraulic pressure joint surface destruction gouge material and the anisotropy of flow regime in the single fracture seepage model during shear process in this study coupled shear flow tests were conducted at 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mpa hydraulic pressure with radial fluid flow and then 3d simulation models were established by using comsol multiphysics 5 2a with the reynolds averaged navier stokes k ε turbulence model for initial and peak shear conditions results showed that the radial flow cubic law diverged from experimental results seriously and non darcy flow behaviour was remarkable during tests high hydraulic pressure decreased the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law dramatically by increasing the influence of inertia force and the accuracy was sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure the flow regime and velocity were varied and influenced by the anisotropic tortuosity ratio maximum inclination angle and the uneven distribution of aperture the absolute values of velocity vertical to the radial distance reduced with decreasing roughness the roughness tortuosity ratio and maximum inclination angle of the fracture joint reduced dynamically with destruction of the joint surface and formation of gouge material leading to a significant change in the relationship between mechanical and hydraulic apertures moreover the radial flow cubic law was modified on the basis of the relationship of mechanical and hydraulic aperture with hydraulic gradient this study may serve as a basis to establish fracture network seepage model and other similar tests keywords coupled shear

the fluid flow rock mass play a pivotal role in underground water supply water reservoir engineering and other fluid flow related engineering javadi et al 2010 rong et al 2017 wang et al 2009 olayiwola and dejam 2019 in a rock mass fluid flow mainly concentrates in fractures thus the study of seepage in a single fracture is rapidly becoming a key instrument in rock mass engineering xiong et al 2011 mashayekhizadeh et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zhang et al 2019a javadi et al 2010 and the single fracture seepage theory is fundamental to the fracture network seepage simulation model huang et al 2019 dejam et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b tan et al 2019 the navier stokes n s equations are widely used to describe fluid flow behaviour and analyse fluid structure interaction javadi et al 2014 azarmanesh et al 2019 however the n s equations are difficult to apply to rock mass with countless fractures and the main case of this problem is the inertia force item cannot be efficiently solved wang et al 2015 rong et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 cao et al 2018 thus the use of simplified seepage equations such as the stokes and reynolds equations and the most widely used cubic law is proposed in the exploration of fluid flow evolution in a single fracture and evaluation of fracture hydraulic conductivity javadi et al 2014 xiao et al 2016 li et al 2008 the cubic law shows that flow rate is linear with hydraulic pressure and the cube of aperture as shown in fig 1 a the cubic law assumes the joint surfaces are smooth and parallel and the fluid flow in fracture obeys darcy s law however for natural fracture fig 1 b the joint surfaces are always rough the contact areas are ubiquitous in fracture the effective seepage channels are narrowed by vortexes and gouge material and the flow path is usually tortuous in addition the flow regime is easy to be turbulent with high hydraulic pressure thus the cubic law cannot provide adequate support when applied to natural aperture zhou et al 2015 many researchers have shown increasing interest in the flow behaviour in a single fracture with complex conditions and in improving the accuracy of the single fracture seepage model experiments and numerical simulation play important roles in addressing the difficult issues recent experiments have included confining stress flow tests chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2017 and shear flow tests esaki et al 1999 javadi et al 2010 olsson and barton 2001 rong et al 2016 xiong et al 2011 yin et al 2017 numerical simulation models were usually established with the reynolds equation the stokes equation the n s equations and turbulence models zhang et al 2019a javadi et al 2010 wang et al 2015 xiong et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 experimental and numerical studies aimed at investigating the influence of the factors in fig 1 b in the cubic law and modifying the cubic law other non linear seepage models such as forchheimer or lzbash laws have also been widely used in recent years li et al 2008 reported that increased contact ratio evidently reduces the hydraulic conductivity of fracture and the distribution of contact areas is another factor that influences fluid flow in a fracture the contact ratio of fracture varies during shear xiao et al 2016 established a contact algorithm of artificial marble fracture during shear by performing laboratory tests and using charge coupled device cameras and found remarkable changes in contact ratio and mean aperture the algorithm helps build the seepage model but neglects the influence of gouge materials from crushed asperities and may overestimate the hydraulic conductivity of a fracture when fluid flow bypasses contact areas and asperities or climbs over asperities the seepage path becomes tortuous thus the actual path for fluid flow is always larger than the straight line distance and flow velocity changes frequently flow velocity the hydraulic conductivity of fracture and energy loss are diverse results from anisotropic roughness zhang et al 2019a reported how the shape and density of roughness elements affect fluid flow in a regular single roughness fracture and found the remarkable influence of vortex caused when fluid flow bypasses the roughness elements however the anisotropy of flow regime cannot be considered because the simulation models in the study of zhang et al 2019a were 2d after using numerical simulations thompson and brown 1991 found that the important directional characteristic of joint surfaces is degree roughness and that the direction of fluid flow and tha the groove of asperities are influencing factors employing experiments and simulation method auradou et al 2006 found that fluid flow velocity and fracture hydraulic conductivity perpendicular to shear are larger than those parallel to shear resulting from the change in aperture and the contact of void space and the displacement of joint surfaces considerably contributes to the effect by solving reynolds equation vilarrasa et al 2011 indicated that the flow rate and particle travel velocity in the direction perpendicular to shear direction greatly increase because the connectivity of void space changes during shear and fluid flow easily passes through the region of fracture with excellent connectivity and low energy loss matsuki et al 2010 argued the difference in angles between shear macroscopic fluid flow directions and provided the formula of mechanical aperture e m and hydraulic aperture e h with angle most experimental results showed that darcy flow is infrequent in fracture with rough joint surfaces especially under complex conditions zhang and nemcik 2013 found that darcy s law applies only to the mated rough fracture because the small aperture and high tortuosity of the flow pathway resist fluid flow severely and reduce flow velocity and the behaviour of non darcy flow for all non mated fractures is remarkable in the experiments by zhang and nemcik 2013 the non darcy flow behaviour is more obvious in high roughness fracture zhang et al 2017 showed that the local darcy and non darcy flow are concomitant in some conditions because of the inhomogeneous aperture and flow distribution and the linear and non linear seepage models need to be applied simultaneously the external stress exerts a strong influence on flow behaviour especially when the confining stress is increased chen et al 2019 found that the non darcy behaviour of fluid flow increases with the reduction of the hydraulic pressure and the various distributions of the interconnected void areas some studies javadi et al 2014 rong et al 2016 showed that the non darcy behaviour of fluid flow decrease with shear process because of the decreasing influence of roughness but the other factors are unclear for the boundedness of the cubic law above several researchers aimed to modify the cubic law and the most widely used approach is establishing the relation between e m and e h by considering different conditions li et al 2016 olsson and barton 2001 proposed the empirical engineering model for the hydromechanical coupling of rock joints by considering joint roughness coefficient jrc and mobilized jrc during shear the model indicated that the relation between e m and e h is nonlinear and separated by the peak shear displacement considering aperture as 3d distribution zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 established the relation between e m and the standard deviation σ apert of aperture and then calculated e h with e m σ apert and contact ratio during shear xiong et al 2011 specified that results are only approximate when the σ apert e m ratio in zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 s model approaches 0 816 xiong et al 2011 added the standard deviation of local fracture slope and reynolds number reflecting the effect of inertia force from the side from zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 s model to describe the relationship between e m and e h xie et al 2015 also used σ apert to describe the relation between e m and e h and explained the change in σ apert the distribution of the absolute velocity and pressure drop under constant pressure gradient during shear is then obtained the results of the abovementioned studies indicated that e m is always larger than e h which implies that the cubic law overstates the fracture hydraulic conductivity and can be modified by replacing e h with e m by contrast wang et al 2015 modified the cubic law directly by considering local tortuosity and roughness after indicating the validity of the modified cubic law wang et al 2015 found that the arithmetic mean of effective errors for the studied fracture is reduced from 40 8 to 3 7 compared with local cubic law in this study we investigated the flow regime in a single fracture with joint surface destruction gouge material high hydraulic pressure and anisotropic roughness and analysed the difference between the cubic law and experimental results during shear process firstly the coupled shear flow tests were presented in artificial single fractures at a constant normal stress of 1 91 mpa and different high hydraulic pressures of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mpa with radial fluid flow then 3d simulation models were established by using comsol multiphysics 5 2a comsol multiphysics 2016 with the reynolds averaged n s k ε turbulence model for initial and peak shear conditions the radial flow cubic law was modified by establishing the relationship of mechanical and hydraulic aperture with hydraulic gradient 2 materials and methods 2 1 specimens and fracture sample preparation to guarantee the repeatability of the tests and reduce costs we built the test specimens with plaster water and retardant at a weight ratio of 1 0 25 0 005 table 1 shows the physico mechanical properties of the specimen the upper and lower specimens are shown in fig 2 cao et al 2018 all the specimens were 200 mm in diameter and 75 mm in height and the surfaces of the specimens were regular dentate with 30 along the shear direction as shown in fig 2 b an injection hole 8 mm in diameter in the centre of the lower specimen was installed thus the fluid flow was transported radially through the fracture between the upper and lower specimens 2 2 experimental test method the test apparatus tjxw 600 microprocessor control coupled shear flow test system was used in this paper the side view of the apparatus is shown in fig 3 cao et al 2018 the apparatus can provide the shear and normal loads of up to 600 kn by the hydraumatic servo oil source and the maximum hydraulic pressure can reach 3 mpa normal and shear displacement were measured by using a cable displacement meter the data of normal displacement normal stress shear displacement shear stress and aperture flow rate can be collected during shear the initial setting parameter was stable and the shear box sealing property was assured during test as shown in fig 2 c the boundary of the side and bottom of the upper and lower specimens was no slip boundary and the shear process was achieved by fixing the lower specimen and moving the upper specimen for the tests normal stress condition was constant normal load cnl boundary at 1 91 mpa the boundary of the water inlet and outlet was at constant hydraulic pressure boundaries of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 normal stress started to increase at the beginning of the test and the inlet hydraulic pressure initially increased when normal stress reached 0 6 mpa when the hydraulic pressure increased to the set value steadily and the shear process was operated and the tests terminated when shear displacement δ reached 32 mm 2 3 numerical simulation method to investigate the distribution of streamlines and flow velocity before shear was broken we established 3d seepage simulation models for initial and peak shear conditions with comsol multiphysics 5 2a comsol multiphysics 2016 referring to zhang et al 2019a s study we simulated the fluid flow in small aperture with the k ε turbulence model comsol multiphysics 5 2a provides the reynolds averaged n s k ε modules and the governing equations are shown as follows comsol multiphysics 2016 1 ρ u u ρ i μ μ t u u t f 2 ρ u 0 3 ρ u k μ μ t σ k k p k ρ ε 4 ρ u ε μ μ t σ ε ε c ε 1 ε k p k c ε 2 ρ ε 2 k 5 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε 6 p k μ t u u u t where ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity tensor i is the unit tensor μ is the viscous coefficient μ t is the turbulent viscous coefficient f is the body force tensor k is the turbulent kinetic energy σ k is the turbulent prandtl number of turbulent kinetic energy p k is the turbulent energy generated by average velocity gradient ε is the dissipation rate σε is the turbulent prandtl number of dissipation rate and cε 1 cε 2 and cμ are the calculated coefficients as the default constant in comsol multiphysics 5 2a cε 1 1 44 cε 2 1 92 and cμ 0 09 the model range contained the interspace between the upper and lower specimens in initial and peak shear conditions the boundary condition of water inlet was flow velocity boundary and the values were calculated with the flow rate from the experimental results and the area of the simulation models water outlet was the pressure boundary and the values were 0 in all simulation models the joint surfaces were the wall boundary fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the distribution of aperture of simulation models in which e 0 is the initial mechanical aperture and δu n is the normal displacement of aperture due to shear stress considering that the contact areas between the lower and upper joint surfaces and e 0 cannot be measured during tests we neglected the contact areas and assumed that e 0 was distributed equally everywhere as shown in fig 4 a by comparing the flow rates of initial shear condition models and experimental results e 0 can be back calculated through the least square method and the value was 0 201 mm for coupled shear flow tests e m can be confirmed using the following equation esaki et al 1999 7 e m e 0 u n δ u n where u n is the normal displacement of aperture due to normal stress for eq 7 u n was equal to 0 under cnl boundary xiong et al 2011 thus the aperture of the peak shear condition model can be determined by adding e 0 and δu n 0 481 0 492 0 474 and 0 475 respective at the peak shear displacement δ p fig 4 b the calculation parameters of the initial and peak shear condition models are shown in table 2 as shown in fig 5 the flow rate results of the simulation models were close to experiments thus the value of e 0 we calculated was usable 3 results versus cubic law 3 1 cubic law the radial flow cubic law assumes that the joint surfaces of fracture are smooth and paralleled the fluid flow state is laminar and distributes axisymmetric and can be described as follows zhang and nemcik 2013 8 q 2 π g 12 υ ln r i r o δ h e 3 where q is the flow rate in fracture g is the gravitational acceleration υ is the fluid kinematic viscosity r o is the water inlet radius r i is the joint surface outer radius δh is the difference in the pressure head of water inlet and outlet and e is the fracture aperture when eq 8 was used to calculate the flow rate of a fracture e e m was applied and the result was denoted as q c when eq 8 was used to identify e h q q e was obtained by applying e e h 3 2 estimated and measured flow rates for shear tests the change in δu n measured flow rate q e and q c during shear tests are shown in figs 6 and 7 as shown in figs 6 and 7 a δu n increased signally before δ p and then changed slightly q e had a remarkable increment before δ p and hydraulic pressure had a strong influence in q e but did not change δu n combining the calculated e 0 we can change eq 7 to the following equation to confirm e m 9 e m 0 201 δ u n where the length unit in eq 9 is mm as shown in fig 7 b the q c q e ratio was much larger than 1 during shear process with different hydraulic pressure which indicated that the radial flow cubic law seriously deviated from the experiments and overstated the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture at the entire process of shear the change in q c q e ratio indicated that the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law reduced dramatically before δ p then the difference between the radial flow cubic law and experimental results stabilised because of the joint surface destruction 3 3 dependency of flow rate on hydraulic pressure as shown in fig 7 b higher hydraulic pressure obviously contributed to the accuracy loss of the radial flow cubic law the increment in q c q e ratio was different when the hydraulic pressure increased by 0 2 mpa and the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law was more sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure the radial flow cubic law is a linear equation simplified from the n s equations after disregarding inertial forces and assumes that the fluid flow in the fracture is darcy flow in our study as shown in fig 8 when we added the origin of coordinates which represented that q e 0 when the hydraulic pressure equalled to 0 the relationship between pressure gradient and q e was nonlinear and fitted with forchheimer law as follows zhang and nemcik 2013 10 p a q e b q e 2 where p is the pressure gradient and a and b are model coefficients as shown in fig 8 the relationship between p and q e could be described by non linear forchheimer law accurately thus the non darcy flow behaviour was remarkable in this study and the flow regime did not satisfy the assumption of the radial flow cubic law the influence intension of inertial forces of fluid flow can be estimated by using the reynolds number which represents the specific value of inertial and viscous forces thus a high reynolds number would cause non darcy flow and reynolds number increases proportionally with flow velocity hence the high hydraulic pressure increases the nonlinear behaviour of fluid flow and simultaneously reduces the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law and the fluid flow with high hydraulic pressure does not obey darcy s law 3 4 nonaxisymmetry of streamlines and flow velocity the distribution of streamlines with 0 6 mpa hydraulic pressure of initial and peak shear condition models is shown in fig 9 the streamlines distribution with other hydraulic pressure is shown in appendix a figs a1 and a2 as shown in figs 9 a1 and a2 results showed that the distribution of streamlines was nonaxisymmetric with water inlet which deviated from the assumption of the radial flow cubic law in addition the streamlines were tortuous when bypassed by the dentate aperture and close to groove through the water inlet given the uneven distribution of aperture the stream line of the peak shear condition model was untidy and sparse to investigate the absolute values of flow velocity distribution of different flow directions we divided the joint surface into 11 flow directions as shown in fig 10 a fig 10 b shows the results of tortuosity ratio τ which is the actual seepage path relative to the radius of joint surface walsh and brace 1984 and the maximum inclination angle θ max of asperities in different flow directions as shown in fig 10 b τ distributed symmetrically with the 90 flow direction and the flow directions with the same τ had different θ max values both τ and θ max were strongly affected by the shape and density of roughness elements the absolute values of flow velocity of the initial and peak shear condition models with 0 6 mpa hydraulic pressure are shown in fig 11 the flow velocity results of other hydraulic pressure are shown in appendix a figs a3 and a4 as shown in figs 11 a3 and a4 the flow velocity of different flow directions was diverse in the initial and peak shear condition models and the values of flow velocity reduced with increased radial distance because of the energy loss and fluid flow expansion in addition the values of flow velocity reduced with increasing τ at the same radius because the seepage path was extended with increase in τ and the energy loss was remarkable when fluid flow impacted joint surface and bypassed asperities the flow velocity evolution curve became more fluctuant and the frequency and amplitude of the curves were augmented with the increase in τ the minimal value points of the curves appeared in the peak and valley parts in fig 4 in the flow directions with the same τ large θ max advanced the phase of the flow velocity evolution curve the results agreed with the study of zhang et al 2019a where the increased roughness elements density reduced the hydraulic conductivity of fracture and the flow velocity and the energy loss became drastic the shape of roughness elements exerted strong influence in the velocity and regime of flow fluid the waveform of the flow velocity evolution curves with the same flow direction were more undulating and complex in peak shear condition models resulting from the uneven distribution of aperture fig 4 b and the flow velocity was reduced drastically in the void space with large aperture moreover high hydraulic pressure increased the flow velocity of all flow directions and slightly influenced the distribution of streamlines thus the inertia force of fluid flow increased in all sides when the flow velocity was divided to the radial velocity rv and the velocity vertical to the radial distance vvr taking the 0 90 and 180 flow directions of the initial and peak shear condition models with 0 6 mpa for example the absolute values of rv and vvr results are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the values of rv were larger than the values of vvr in both initial and peak shear condition models for the 90 flow direction the values of vvr were dinky comparing with rv thus the values of vvr reduced with decreasing roughness moreover the value difference between rv and vvr was strongly influenced by τ and θ max 4 discussion 4 1 impact of joint surface destruction as shown in fig 7 b the change in q c q e ratio stabilized after δ p which indicated that the destruction of joint surfaces strongly influenced the fluid flow regime and the accuracy of the radial flow cubic law the destruction of joint surfaces and the forms of gouge material in the peak and final shear conditions is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the joint surfaces were destructed completely after δ p and the gouge material buried the regular dentate asperities completely in the final shear condition in addition the forms of the gouge material changed during the shear tests at the peak shear condition the gouge material was massive and then the volume and distribution of the gouge material were reduced and rearranged with shear destruction the gouge material was ground to small granular and powdery in the final shear condition the jrc of the fracture reduced immediately after δ p because of the destruction of joint surfaces and the distribution of gouge material with different forms the contact areas τ and θ max of the upper and lower joint surfaces were changed dynamically at the same time fig 14 shows the schematic of the distribution of the gouge material in the peak and final shear conditions after δ p the seepage channels of fracture increased and became complex and the τ and θ max of different flow directions became more diverse than before δ p the contact areas of fracture were decided by the forms of the gouge material and the distribution of aperture was greater even when compared with the initial to peak shear conditions moreover fluid flow could transport through the small granular and powdery gouge material which may be treated as a porous medium these results could be used to explain the reason for the steady trend of q c q e ratio after δ p and the non darcy flow behaviour decrease in the studies by javadi et al 2014 and rong et al 2016 thus the influence of surfaces destruction and gouge material in single fracture seepage model during shear especially the continuous destruction of joint surfaces and gouge material needs to be investigated 4 2 modification of the cubic law according to results above the radial flow cubic law deviated from the experiments seriously and must be modified when applied to experiments or the natural fractures particularly with high hydraulic pressure for the tests in this paper we modified the radial flow cubic law by replacing e h with e m in two stages separated by δ p according to the experimental results the relation between e m and e h with different hydraulic pressures is shown in fig 15 and can be described with the following equation 11 e h α β e m δ δ p e h α e β e m δ δ p where α and β are the fitting coefficients as shown in fig 15 e m was much larger than e h because the effective seepage channels were reduced and the reduction of e m was limited by the gouge material in addition e h had a linear relationship with e m before δ p and then translated to an exponential relationship resulting from the joint surface destruction and gouge material eq 11 shows that e h 0 when e m 0 before and after δ p which indicated that no matter how small the fracture aperture was the fluid flow could transport though the fracture in the tests of this paper many connected seepage channels appeared in the closed fracture because the fracture with rough joint surfaces could not completely close durham and bonner 1994 reported that fluid flow could transport though the closed fracture even when normal stress reaches 160 mpa the change in α and β with different hydraulic gradients j is shown in fig 16 where j represents the theoretical value calculated by the corresponding hydraulic and the radius of fracture and is a dimensionless number before δ p α and β changed with j linearly after δ p α and β had power function relationships with j thus in this paper the radial flow cubic law can be modified by combining eqs 8 and 11 and the relation among α β and j 4 3 comparison to similar existing studies many studies investigated the seepage model of a single fracture with complex conditions comparing to similar existing studies we focused on the influence of high hydraulic pressure joint surface destruction gouge material and anisotropy of flow regime fractures with tens to hundreds of metre of water head is common in nature and engineering because the limit of test apparatus in most coupled shear flow tests is reported with low j 0 117 rong et al 2016 2 16 7 javadi et al 2014 0 120 yin et al 2017 0 5 10 li et al 2008 and 0 21 olsson and barton 2001 other experiments zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2019 with high j were carried out with confining stress and concentrated on the nonlinear relationship between hydraulic gradient and flow rate by using forchheimer or lzbash laws which cannot reflect the relationship between aperture and flow rate and were hard to apply to fracture network seepage models in the present study we investigated the influence of high hydraulic pressure in the accuracy of radial flow cubic law and the relationship between e h and e m during shear process and then modified the radial flow cubic law with j single fracture flow tests were mainly conducted under confining or shear stress for the confining stress flow tests chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zhang and nemcik 2013 zhou et al 2015 rong et al 2017 the aperture of fracture was only influenced by confining stress the relative position and geometrical morphology of joint surfaces the aperture did not change during tests for the shear flow tests esaki et al 1999 javadi et al 2010 olsson and barton 2001 rong et al 2016 xiong et al 2011 yin et al 2017 the fracture aperture and the relative position of joint surfaces changed with shear process for most stress flow tests the fracture joints were unbroken but in nature it is common for the destruction of fracture joints with complex stress condition and gouge material is widespread in some fracture thus we analysed the influence of joint surface destruction and gouge material in the geometrical morphology of fracture accuracy of radial flow and the relationship between e m and e h although the analysis of joint surface destruction and gouge material in our study was primary we thought it was potential for other similar studies we also investigated the distribution of streamlines and flow velocity in different flow directions and found obvious anisotropy of flow regime caused by anisotropic joint surfaces indicating that the seepage model for a settled fracture should be adjusted according to fluid flow direction although the anisotropy of flow regime and flow velocity was analysed with artificial fracture in this study we thought it was common in natural fracture however few studies discussed about this issue thus further experiments or simulation works are suggested 4 4 limitation remarks despite the meticulous care we have taken the following limitations were not avoided in our study 1 coupled shear flow tests similar to most shear flow tests the shear box was sealed and invisible in our tests we cannot observe the destruction of joint surfaces the distribution of gouge material with different forms and the change in joint surface jrc τ and θ max during shear process at any time the change in these factors changed dynamically during shear tests and determined the establishment of seepage model 2 simulation model the simulation models we used cannot consider the destruction of joint surfaces and the form change of the gouge material especially the coupling between fluid flow and gouge material further numerical analysis is suggested to investigate the dynamic changes in the existing factors in the single fracture seepage model 3 joint surfaces of fracture coupled shear flow tests were conducted on artificial joint with regular dentate asperities because the influence of joint surfaces destruction and gouge material were remarkable and transparently with regular dentate joint in our study but the distribution of roughness and aperture of natural joint was spatial and arbitrarily thus when the results of our study were applied to natural fracture the geometrical morphological relationship between the different joint surfaces needs be established according to the suggestion of mirzaghorbanali et al 2014 we can extend the results of this study to natural fracture by mapping the joint surface geometry with fourier transformation or fractal methods given these limitations relevant works are suggested to perform in single fracture shear flow studies with experimental and numerical methods that consider the influence of joint surface destruction gouge material anisotropy of flow regime and high hydraulic pressure 5 summary and conclusions this study aimed to investigate the fluid flow regime in single fracture during shear process influenced by high hydraulic pressure joint surface destruction gouge material and anisotropy of flow regime coupled shear flow tests were conducted with 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 hydraulic pressure and 3d simulation models were established by using comsol multiphysics 5 2a with reynolds averaged n s k ε turbulence model the main summaries and conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the accuracy of radial flow cubic law decreased dramatically before peak shear displacement and then tended to be steady resulting from shear broken high hydraulic pressure decreased the accuracy by increasing the influence of inertia force and the accuracy was more sensitive to the increase in lower hydraulic pressure 2 joint surfaces destruction and gouge material exerted remarkable influence on the fracture geometrical morphology and flow regime because of joint surface destruction and gouge material the roughness tortuosity ratio and maximum inclination angle of joint surfaces decreased dynamically during shear process and the distribution of aperture and effective seepage channels became unpredictable the difference between cubic law and experimental results and flow regime became steady because of the joint surface destruction and gouge material especially the forms of gouge material 3 the non darcy flow behaviour was obvious in our study because of the high hydraulic pressure and complex geometrical morphology of joint surfaces the anisotropic behaviour of fluid flow was serious and the streamlines and flow velocity were varied in different flow directions resulting from the anisotropic roughness of the joint both tortuosity ratio and maximum inclination angle had strong influence in the change in flow velocity and the absolute values of velocity vertical to the radial distance reduced with decreasing roughness 4 the radial flow cubic law was modified by establishing the empirical equation between mechanical and hydraulic aperture with different hydraulic gradient mechanical and hydraulic aperture showed a linear relationship before peak shear displacement and tended to be non linear because of joint surface destruction and gouge material declaration of

6049,in this paper 1017 rainfall events from 2008 to 2017 are used to identify the rainfall threshold that produces upland erosion at the masse central italy and sparacia southern italy experimental stations the rainfall events are classified into three classes non erosive interrill only and rill the threshold values for separating as correctly as possible the erosive rains case i and the rill rains case ii are derived solely from the hyetograph each threshold value is obtained by imposing that the long term erosivity of the events above the threshold is equal to the long term erosivity of all erosive events case i or only rill events case ii the performances of selective criteria based on 31 threshold variables are compared and those most effective in separating erosive and rill events are identified the identification of the best criterion depends on the aim of the analysis it could be required to provide the greatest accuracy for separating erosive and rill events or the lowest error in the prediction of long term erosivity in general the results clearly show that the best variables are those that quantify the characteristics of rainfall patterns such as rain showers periods of continuous rain and the deviations in the rain records over a truncation level these results are especially significant for the operational estimation of rainfall erosivity and for identifying the trigger of the erosion process and rill development by using only a hyetograph this is obtained by relatively simple field measurements and is also widely available on a global scale the most effective variables are potentially usable in water erosion prediction models as proxies of variables that are more rarely available and or more difficult to measure keywords soil erosion soil loss rainfall pattern rainfall hyetograph rainfall thresholds rainfall erosivity interrill usle rusle 1 introduction the determining of practical thresholds for separating erosive from non erosive rainfall events or rill from interrill only events is of considerable importance from both a practical and a scientific perspective xie et al 2016 2002 dunkerley 2008 poesen et al 2003 in the last few decades the meaning of erosive event has been much debated renard et al 1997 xie et al 2002 dunkerley 2008 2010 in most analyses e g efthimiou 2018 porto 2016 borrelli et al 2016 panagos et al 2016 2015 vallebona et al 2015 meusburger et al 2012 grauso et al 2010 todisco et al 2010 angulo martínez et al 2009 the criterion for identifying erosive rainfall events is that derived by wischmeier and smith 1978 according to this criterion rainfalls of less than 12 7 mm were omitted in rainfall erosivity computations unless at least 6 4 mm of rain fell in 15 min the reason for selecting these values was not given nor was their influence on the accuracy of estimating rainfall erosivity evaluated originally non erosive rainfalls were routinely omitted because this made the calculation of rainfall erosivity enormously easier the use of computers and digital data has by now eliminated the difficulty in analyzing rainfall intensity data this raises the question of whether storms with small rainfall amounts should still be excluded we know that some included storms above the threshold may not result in measurable runoff and soil loss whereas some omitted storms below the threshold may cause erosion cooley et al 1988 showed a 28 59 increase in the long period rainfall erosivity in the western united states by including all storms in the calculation rather than only storms with a rainfall over 12 7 mm renard et al 1997 also reported an increase in the long period total rainfall erosivity in a us watershed ranging from 28 to 59 mcgregor et al 1995 showed a 3 6 increase in erosivity in the eastern united states and yu 1999 reported an average increase of 4 5 in the tropical region of australia therefore it is clear that this screening process between erosive and non erosive rainfalls is important especially for mapping rainfall erosivity or estimating soil loss further thresholds have been derived based on overall rainfall characteristics alone such as total rainfall depth and duration mean intensity and maximum intensity over various intra storm time periods in rhodesia hudson 1971 considered erosive the storms with intensities greater than 1 in h 25 mm h in belgium sinzot et al 1989 found that erosion recorded on experimental plots shows the closest correlation to rainfall if a value greater than or equal to 8 mm and a maximum intensity over 15 min were considered in côte d ivoire roose and godefroy 1977 included all rains greater than 10 mm in the computation of erosivity in the rusle renard et al 1997 the same erosive threshold indicated in wischmeier and smith 1978 was used in calculating erosivity in the eastern generally more humid part of the united states whereas all storms were used in the western drier part of the country yin et al 2017 hudson 1995 morgan and nearing 2016 morgan 1980 poesen et al 2003 xie et al 2002 developed a practical method for identifying the threshold that distinguishes erosive from non erosive storms the method applies to the values of the individual storm erosion index wischmeier and smith 1978 ei30 in which e mj mm ha 1 h 1 event rainfall kinetic energy and i30 mm h maximum rainfall intensity over 30 min observed during the event the ei30 values of the storms that generate runoff but are omitted from the calculation are balanced by those of the storms that do not cause runoff but are included in the calculation they provided an event rainfall threshold of 12 mm a mean rainfall intensity of 2 4 mm h and other thresholds for maximum intensity over various intra storm time periods e g i30 13 3 mm h this method was recently used at an experimental station in the yellow river basin in china obtaining an event rainfall threshold of 12 mm and a daily rainfall threshold of 9 7 mm yin et al 2017 however a generally accepted criterion to determine a rainfall threshold above which erosion begins is still lacking threshold values based on relationships between rainfall and soil loss or surface runoff have been studied in a recent paper stumpf et al 2017 estimated the direct runoff for similar initial soil moisture conditions todisco et al 2015 selected events which exhibited direct runoff and an associated erosive response and rejected those where a distinct attribution of direct runoff to a rainfall event was impossible because of inadequate separation between direct runoff and baseflow zheng and cheng 2017 also used a runoff threshold to determine erosive rainfall events it should be pointed out that the measurement of the event runoff is not straightforward or widely available furthermore studies aimed at defining practical thresholds for selecting rill events from rainfall events are lacking the critical condition for rill initiation is generally identified in terms of soil critical shear stress and flow velocity yao et al 2008 nearing et al 1991 govers 1992 soil shear strength torri et al 1987 slope gradient and inflow rate the impacts of climate warming on soil erosion have been noticed since the 1940s zhiying and haiyan 2016 in particular the direct impacts are mainly caused by changes in rainfall amount rainfall intensity roderick et al 2019 and rainfall spatial temporal distributional patterns with precipitations which are expected to become both more intense and spatially concentrated in a warming climate wasko et al 2016 these direct impacts affect adversely soil erosion by increasing rainfall erosivity as an example bazzoffi and pellegrini 1992 found that in tuscany italy the mean over 9 years ei30 value changed since the 1960s with a major variation of i30 values indicating precipitations with more stormy characteristics these findings were confirmed by crisci et al 2002 torri et al 2006 the phenomenology and the extent of soil water erosion processes are closely linked to both the overall rain characteristics and the characteristics of rainfall patterns in todisco 2014 a detailed analysis of the rains recorded along with soil loss at the masse station central italy has clearly shown that non erosive and erosive rains differ due to some rainfall pattern characteristics an event is certainly erosive if the duration de 24 h or the rainfall depth pe 20 mm or the number of positive deviations of the rainfall is above a truncation value run n runs 3 i e three separate periods with rainfall greater than 0 8 mm or run durations are longer than 10 min furthermore the shapes of the rainfall time distribution for erosive and non erosive events show similarities only in the initial part of the event in the second half of the event the non erosive data are typically placed below or more seldom within the first quartile of the erosive storms the rainfall depth of non erosive storms falls almost entirely within the continuous rain shower called a burst with the maximum run erosive events instead focus on the burst with the maximum run in the median at about 30 of the rainfall depth rainfall characteristics have also been analyzed by bagarello et al 2015 at the sparacia station southern italy where both the longest tmax and mean tmean durations of a continuous rain shower during an erosive event were generally short and soil loss per unit area had a scattered but detectable increasing trend with both tmax and tmean the detachment impact erosion and superficial runoff and transport splash rill and interrill only erosion processes and therefore the sediment particle size distribution and the sediment concentration in the runoff are also highly influenced by the rainfall pattern characteristics kinnell 2005 leguédois and le bissonnais 2004 he et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the latter have a noticeable effect on the dynamics of the soil surface characteristics during an erosive event such as surface roughness zobeck and onstad 1987 vinci et al submitted crust formation stability of the soil aggregates and surface detention and retention as well as on the process of surface runoff generation and evolution torri et al 1999 moreover we must not forget that all rainfall runoff models use the rainfall pattern as input and that rainfalls with similar overall characteristics can produce or not produce runoff depending essentially on the rainfall pattern characteristics todisco 2014 since the measurement of event runoff is not straightforward and the energy data are difficult to measure the hyetograph is the event characteristic which is most widely available the general objective of the paper is to classify rains in three classes non erosive interrill only and rill erosion rains solely on the basis of the hyetograph the specific aim is to determine thresholds of variables describing the rainfall or the rainfall patterns todisco 2014 in order to separate as correctly as possible i the erosive rains regardless of the erosion component rill interrill only and ii the rill rains using these two thresholds a rainfall event is classified as interrill only when it is erosive but not rill threshold values were derived according to the procedure proposed by xie et al 2002 and were evaluated on the basis of efficiency indices the analysis was performed on the database of the masse central italy and sparacia southern italy experimental stations 2 materials and methods data for this investigation were collected at the masse central italy and sparacia southern italy experimental stations for soil loss measurement where bare plots were established the characteristics of the two stations have been described in detail in other papers e g todisco 2014 todisco et al 2015 todisco et al 2012 bagarello et al 2011a b 2013 2015 and are only summarized here for the sake of brevity all plots considered were maintained in a cultivated fallow and rills were obliterated by hand tools at the end of each erosive event the masse experimental station for soil erosion measurement of the university of perugia was established in 2007 it is located 20 km south of perugia in the region of umbria the station includes ten plots four 8 22 m2 plots two 4 22 m2 plots two 4 11 m2 plots and two 2 11 m2 plots all plots are oriented parallel to a 16 slope the area has a characteristic mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall of 900 mm the soil can be classified as a calcaric cambisol according to the world reference base for soil resources wrb and the soil texture based on the united states department of agriculture classification is silt clay loam clay 34 silt 59 and sand 7 the gravel content is negligible and the organic matter content is about 1 the soil structure is massive when wet and after drying breaks into weak fine subangular blocks the meteorological data are monitored by a weather station located within the experimental site and are recorded at a time resolution of 5 min the sparacia experimental station for soil erosion measurement of the university of palermo is located in western sicily approximately 100 km south of palermo it includes two 8 44 m2 plots two 8 33 m2 plots six 8 22 m2 plots two 2 22 m2 plots two 4 11 m2 plots and two 2 11 m2 plots all these plots were installed on a 14 9 slope two 6 22 m2 plots were also established on a 22 0 slope and two other 6 22 m2 plots were installed on a 26 0 slope the area has a typical mediterranean semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall of approximately 700 mm the soil has a clay texture clay 62 silt 33 and sand 5 with a massive consistency when it is wet and fully swollen a polygonal pattern of surface shrinkage cracks develops as the soil dries the meteorological data are monitored by two pluviographs located within the experimental site and are recorded at a time resolution of 1 min di stefano et al 2015 at the masse and sparacia sites total runoff is stored in one to three 1 m3 storage tanks depending on the plot size which are sampled for measuring event plot soil loss bagarello et al 2018 after each sampling the storage tanks are emptied according to the definition by wischmeier and smith 1978 a rainfall event is an individual storm preceded and followed by 6 h or more of no rain if only one rainfall event occurred between the emptying of the tanks and the subsequent sampling it was classified as individual i non erosive if it did not produce measurable soil loss ii interrill only if only interrill erosion was detected and iii rill if rills were detected in the plot i e both the rill and interrill components of the erosion process were detected sometimes a sequence of individual rainfall events occurs between the emptying of the tanks and the subsequent sampling due to the impossibility of measuring soil loss if they are close to one another therefore the measured runoff and soil loss is associated with multiple hyetographs and it is not known which one of the rainfall events in the sequence actually produced runoff and soil loss however the thresholds to separate as correctly as possible i all the erosive events interrill only or rill and ii the rill events are intended to be applied to the rainfall records in the absence of information on the associated soil loss i e to the individual rainfall events and consequently the determining of these thresholds must be based on the analysis of the largest possible database of individual events the datasets used in the following analysis include all non erosive interrill only and rill rains recorded as individual events all the events of a sequence are included in each dataset as individual events and are classified as non erosive erosive if the rainfall depth is lower higher than the minimum depth of an individual interrill only rain if the erosive event is recorded within a sequence which produced rills and its rainfall depth is higher than the minimum one recorded for an individual rill rain the event is classified as individual rill event all events with cumulated rainfall depth pe 1 mm have been excluded from the datasets the dataset analyzed for the masse station includes 528 rainfall events 370 non erosive 150 interrill only and 8 rill the statistics of the main variables are reported in table 1 for sparacia the dataset includes 489 events 391 non erosive 81 interrill only and 17 rill the statistics of the main variables are shown in table 2 for this latter station the rainfall data were aggregated at 5 min time steps to be homogeneous with those of the masse station the sparacia data include rainfall events that occurred on plots having three different slopes ranging from 14 9 to 26 the threshold values to be exceeded for erosion rill erosion to occur are expected to decrease as plot steepness increases indeed it can be supposed that a slope increase implies more runoff energy higher probability of detachment and transport of sediments by overland flow and more opportunities for rill development however a single database was developed for sparacia in order to determine average thresholds for that site the six steps of the procedure for determining thresholds for separating i erosive events and ii rill events were 1 calculation of the values of rainfall erosivity ei30 for each event using the method described by wischmeier and smith 1978 with rainfall energy calculated as a function of rainfall intensity as suggested in rusle renard et al 1997 2 summing of the ei30 values for the i erosive events or ii rill events the sum of these ei30 values which is named ei30 t and is the long term rainfall erosivity for i all erosive events or ii rill events was the target value used to determine the thresholds in other words these two long term rainfall erosivities take into account the ei30 values measured for all erosive and rill events respectively during the entire monitoring period and were defined as target values with the meaning specified at the following point five of the procedure in case i the objective was to select practical thresholds for separating erosive both rill and interrill only and non erosive storms in this case the threshold was determined by setting the target value ei30 t equal to the sum of all ei30 values calculated for all erosive events ei30 e in case ii the objective was to select practical thresholds for detecting rill events in this case the threshold was determined by setting ei30 t equal to the sum of all ei30 values calculated for rill events ei30 r 3 selection of a variable from a list of 31 variables describing the overall rainfall characteristics or rainfall pattern a sketch of a hyetograph is given as an example in fig 1 and all the variables are listed in table 3 4 listing of all events case i or of erosive events only case ii in decreasing order of the selected variable along with the corresponding ei30 values 5 summing of the ei30 values from the highest value of the selected variable up to the one where the cumulative value ei30 c equals or approximates by excess the target ei30 t with ei30 t ei30 e in case i and ei30 t ei30 r in case ii the approximation by excess can include the first discarded event if it is erosive case i or rill case ii 6 this last value was identified as the threshold value of that variable rainfall events characterized by values of the variable higher than the corresponding threshold were chosen as erosive in case i and as rill in case ii while the events characterized by values of the variable below the selected threshold were not chosen as erosive in case i and as rill in case ii in other words the terms chosen and not chosen refer to whether or not the rainfall erosivity of a given event was used for calculating ei30 c in table 4 steps 4 6 of the procedure are applied to an illustrative database and the threshold for separating erosive and non erosive events for the variable rainfall depth was pe 36 6 mm i e all the rainfalls with pe 36 6 mm are considered erosive events and included in the calculation of long term erosivity ei30 c 3571 mj mm ha 1 h 1 according to this procedure some erosive events are incorrectly not chosen while some non erosive events are incorrectly chosen and balance those omitted with reference to table 4 events nos 1026 1565 1295 715 were incorrectly not chosen and events nos 1079 1107 1212 were incorrectly chosen under ideal conditions the thresholds would completely separate the three classes non erosive interrill only rill and consequently the ei30 t value would be unaffected by the values that are below the threshold in practice a perfect separation is impossible because of the complexity of rainfall characteristics and the temporal variations in the system response in terms of runoff and soil loss however according to xie et al 2002 if the cumulative value of the individual storm erosion index ei30 c of the chosen rainfall events is equal to ei30 t then the aim of determining the threshold is achieved in table 4 for example events nos 1026 1565 1295 and 715 have pe 36 6 mm therefore they were not chosen and are excluded from the ei30 c calculation at the same time events nos 1079 1107 and 1212 were chosen because they have pe 36 6 mm even if they are non erosive however their erosivity 142 3 107 7 55 4 305 4 balances quite well that of the erosive events not chosen 134 7 71 8 45 51 9 314 4 lastly the ei30 c of the selection 3571 0 is very close to the target 3569 1 mj mm ha 1 h 1 hence the aim of correctly determining the long term erosivity is achieved as stated above it is impossible to completely separate erosive or rill rainfalls using a single threshold in the example given in table 4 four erosive events lie below the threshold pe 36 6 mm evidently this circumstance was also noted by wischmeier and smith 1978 who proposed the widely known selective compound criterion based on a double threshold pe 12 7 mm or at least 6 4 mm of rain fell in 15 min which is able to include a larger number of erosive events in this paper as well the threshold established with the described procedure was coupled with a companion threshold obtained by applying procedure steps 3 6 to the database of the not chosen events when the first variable coincided with the companion variable the criterion resulted in the extension of the selection carried out for that variable further events were included in the selection until the cumulative value ei30 c for the pair of thresholds equals or approximates by excess ei30 t increased by 10 also in this case the approximation by excess can include the first discarded event if it is erosive case i or rill case ii for practical reasons the companion threshold was derived only for the ten variables that were the most effective in selecting the highest number of erosive rill events high csi with the lowest number of incorrect selections low wsi the ten most effective variables have csi and wsi pairs that when plotted in a cartesian system with csi as the x axis and wsi as the y axis have the smallest euclidian distances from the perfect selection point this point csi 100 and wsi 0 corresponds to the condition for which all the erosive events and only the erosive events are selected the two indexes csi and wsi are statistically uncorrelated and thus provided independent and complementary information the use of a second threshold almost inevitably worsens the wsi index a low wsi for the first threshold is therefore necessary to have a number of selection errors still acceptable for the compound thresholds for example in table 4 p max burst 8 5 mm is the companion threshold of pe 36 6 mm in other words the events with pe 36 6 mm or p max burst 8 5 mm are chosen and included in the calculation of the long term erosivity ei30 c 3937 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the thresholds in estimating ei30 t and in detecting i erosive events and ii rill events the following indices proposed by xie et al 2002 were used relative error index rei which represents the accuracy of the estimated erosivity compared to the true value i e ei30 t and is computed as the ratio between the absolute deviation in the erosivity estimation ei30 c ei30 t and the target value ei30 t 1 rei ei 30 c ei 30 t ei 30 t the minimum value of rei is zero which is obtained when the calculated erosivity ei30 c is equal to the target the procedure for determining thresholds is applied imposing a nominal rei value reinominal which is zero for the single thresholds and 10 for compound thresholds see the example in table 4 efficiency index eff which accounts for the reduction in time and work for the computation of long term erosivity gained by neglecting small rainfalls it is calculated as the ratio between the number nnc of not chosen events and the total number of rainfall events n 2 eff n nc n in addition to those proposed by xie et al 2002 the following indices were also used correct selection index csi which represents the effectiveness of the thresholds in the detection of erosive rill events and is the ratio between the total number nce of correctly chosen events and the total number ne of the erosive rill events 3 csi n ce n e the csi assumes the maximum value of 100 when all erosive rill events are chosen wrong selection index wsi is the ratio between the total number ncn of incorrectly chosen events and the total number nc of chosen events 4 wsi n cn n c the wsi assumes the minimum value of 0 when all the chosen events are correct the reliability of a selective criterion based on the threshold increases as rei and wsi decrease and eff and csi increase an example of calculation of the indices is given in table 4 the actual rei 0 1 is very close to the reinominal 0 denoting a good balance between chosen non erosive events and not chosen erosive events which allows a good estimation accuracy of long term erosivity for each rainfall event the 31 selected variables can be grouped into three categories table 3 the overall variables which quantify the general characteristics of the rainfall event the burst variables which account for the continuous rain showers during a rainfall event called bursts fig 1 and the run variables which account for periods with rainfall deviations above a truncation value called runs fig 1 todisco 2014 as stated by todisco 2014 in comparison with non erosive rainfall time series erosive rainfall time series are characterized by several sequences of positive deviations from a threshold value which are also of long duration based on the procedure proposed by todisco 2014 a truncation level p0 is chosen to identify and quantify positive runs fig 1 the identification of the truncation level p0 was based on the analysis of the cumulative empirical frequency distribution of the rainfall records by excluding zero values the selected p0 value is that corresponding to a cumulative frequency of 95 todisco 2014 which gives p0 0 8 mm in 5 min 9 6 mm h for masse according to todisco 2014 and p0 1 0 mm in 5 min 12 0 mm h for sparacia 3 results 3 1 single thresholds for separating erosive rill interrill only and non erosive storms the use of the descriptive statistics of the rainfall events listed in tables 1 and 2 does not allow us to clearly distinguish the three classes non erosive interrill only and rill events indeed there is a partial overlap between the domains of the overall variables in the two databases where both erosive and non erosive events can occur in such cases the different erosion processes might be attributed to the specific characteristics of the event according to the first two steps of the procedure described above it follows that ei30 t ei30 e 10130 00 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at masse and ei30 t ei30 e 7950 00 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at sparacia these target values were used to determine the thresholds that are listed along with the corresponding effectiveness indices in table 5 for masse and in table 6 for sparacia in any case the effectiveness of the thresholds for erosivity calculation was very high in particular at masse rei 1 7 clearly it is unlikely that the nominal value reinominal 0 occurs because the erosivity of the non erosive events incorrectly chosen almost never perfectly balances the erosivity of the rejected erosive events the csi and wsi pairs are plotted in fig 2 for masse and in fig 3 for sparacia in these figures the pairs corresponding to the top ten variables are enclosed in a portion of the plane delimited by a curved line located in the lower right area of the point clouds shown in figs 2 and 3 and are also indicated as selected in tables 5 and 6 some of the top variables are characterized by low effectiveness in the selection of erosive events low csi but also by a low selection error low wsi at the masse station fig 2 table 5 the top ten variables belong to all three categories overall 5 burst 3 and run 2 the csi index varies from 53 2 to 86 7 most of the thresholds also select 20 to 40 of non erosive events while the wsi is higher than 50 only in a few cases moreover some variables listed in table 5 are characterized by very high csi values and therefore they are very effective in selecting erosive events but they are not among the top ten variables because of the associated high number of incorrectly classified events demonstrated by high wsi values the max p pre burst is the most effective variable for distinguishing erosive events fig 2 by using its threshold value 10 6 mm 74 7 of the erosive events are selected and 28 0 of the chosen events are incorrectly classified the p max burst variable also shows a high effectiveness in detecting erosive events by using its threshold value 7 6 mm 65 2 of the erosive events are selected while 20 2 of chosen events are incorrectly classified another burst variable with a satisfactory performance is max d burst with a threshold value of 0 8 h which makes it possible to detect 76 6 of the erosive events while 40 7 of the selected events are non erosive among the overall variables pe e i40 i50 and i60 are the most effective the threshold pe 14 4 mm allows us to select 62 0 of the erosive events while 24 6 of the chosen rains are non erosive a similar performance was found for e 2 4 mj ha 1 but with a lower percentage csi 57 0 of selected erosive events and a lower percentage wsi 20 4 of selection errors the best result in terms of maximum intensity ix is obtained for the duration of 60 min i60 7 2 mm h with the lowest percentage 18 4 of wrong selections and 58 9 of selected erosive events in general the performances of the criteria based on the run variables are worse compared to those of the overall and the burst variables the only two top run variables are d run and max p pre run which allow us to identify 57 6 and 72 2 of the erosive events and lead to an incorrect classification of 23 5 and 36 7 of the chosen events respectively at sparacia the results obtained for the 31 analyzed variables are similar to those obtained at masse the csi index varies from 37 8 to 92 9 fig 3 table 6 which is a wider range than that obtained for masse furthermore according to the results obtained for masse wsi is lower than 40 for most of the thresholds and is higher than 50 only in a few cases also for the sparacia database some variables with high csi values are not among the top ten because of the associated high wsi values for sparacia as well the top ten variables belong to all three categories overall 5 burst 3 and run 2 and are often coincident with those selected for the masse station the variable max p pre burst is the most effective for distinguishing erosive events fig 3 its threshold value 15 0 mm allows us to select 73 5 of the erosive events while 20 9 of the chosen events are incorrectly classified according to the results obtained for masse other burst variables with satisfactory performances are max d burst whose threshold value 0 7 h allows us to identify 78 6 of the erosive events while 45 4 of the selected events are non erosive and p max burst which with a threshold of 11 mm shows a low percentage of incorrectly classified events wsi 20 but allows us to select only 44 9 of the erosive events among the overall variables re and in agreement with the results obtained for masse pe e i50 and i60 are the most effective using the threshold pe 18 8 mm 59 2 of erosive events are chosen and 17 1 of the chosen events are non erosive the selective criteria based on the thresholds e 3 8 mj ha 1 and re 52 4 mj mm ha 1h 1 have similar performances but with a lower percentage of selected erosive events 46 9 and 39 8 respectively the best result in terms of maximum intensity ix is obtained for the duration of 50 min i50 10 3 mm h with the lowest percentage 23 1 of incorrect selections and 40 8 of selected erosive events very similar results are obtained with the threshold i60 9 4 mm h the only two top run variables are d run as for masse and n run which allow us to detect 49 and 65 3 of the erosive events and lead to an incorrect classification of 28 4 and 36 6 of the chosen events respectively 3 2 compound thresholds for separating erosive rill interrill only and non erosive storms the results of the extension of the selection carried out for each top variable are shown in bold in the diagonal of the upper lines of tables 7 and 8 for the two stations obviously all the threshold values decrease as a consequence of the extension of the selection for example for masse the threshold pe 14 4 mm changes to pe 12 0 mm the thresholds for the compound criteria are also reported in tables 7 and 8 as an example for the masse station table 7 the rainfall event is classified as erosive when p max burst 7 6 mm or pe 14 mm fig 4 a for masse and fig 5 a for sparacia show the csi and wsi pairs corresponding to the 10 31 pairs of variables used for the compound criteria it can be observed that the points are arranged according to a concave upward trend with a minimum close to csi 80 at masse and csi 60 at sparacia a fixed top variable provides very different results depending on the companion variable for a given csi some compound criteria clearly perform worse than others because they are characterized by higher wsi values the best compound criterion can be identified exactly by the radar plot in fig 4b for masse and fig 5b for sparacia where the results in terms of distance between each csi and wsi pair and the perfect selection point are plotted the pair of variables represented by the vertex of the broken line closest to the center of the radar plot provides the best compound criterion in the rest of this paper for brevity of notation the companion variables will be indicated by their codes see table 3 at masse p max burst coupled with v28 provides the best criterion this selective criterion establishes that events with a rain shower depth higher than 7 6 mm or with cumulative rainfall before the run higher than 5 8 mm table 7 are erosive this criterion allows the selection of 81 6 of the erosive events of the masse database with a selection error of 25 fig 4a very similar results are also obtained when p max burst is coupled with v4 v10 v11 v24 or v34 fig 4b the extended selection based on max p pre burst v34 and the compound criteria based on the following pairs of variables i60 v6 max p pre burst coupled with v4 v10 v11 v12 v17 v18 or v32 pe coupled withv4 or v32 e v4 and i50 v6 also provide very similar results in most cases use of the companion variable pe v4 improves the reliability of the criterion based on a single variable the compound criteria using d run i40 max p pre run or max d burst as the first variable provide the worst results on the other hand a selection with csi 100 regardless of the wsi value could also be considered suitable because the rei nominal value is set a priori at the low level of 10 fig 4c shows the csi index values to be compared with the selection given by csi 100 center of the radar plot in this case max p pre run or max d burst coupled with v5 provide the best results fig 4c at sparacia the top variable max p pre burst in combination with v28 provides the best criterion this selective criterion establishes that events with a cumulative rainfall before a burst higher than 15 0 mm or with cumulative rainfall before the run higher than 8 8 mm table 8 are erosive this criterion allows the selection of 82 6 of the erosive events with a selection error of 23 6 fig 5a very similar results are also obtained with max p pre burst and all the variables from v8 to v30 or pe coupled with v24 fig 5b for the selection expressed by csi 100 the top variables max p pre burst n run and max d burst fig 5a coupled with v5 v6 v7 or v31 fig 5c make it possible to select almost 100 of the erosive events fig 5c 3 3 single and compound thresholds for separating rill storms according to the first two steps of the procedure for determining thresholds it follows that ei30 t ei30 r 1492 0 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at masse and ei30 t ei30 r 4228 0 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at sparacia these target values were used to determine the single threshold values that are listed in table 9 a for masse and in table 9b for sparacia along with the top variables indicated in the tables as selected the csi and wsi pairs are plotted in fig 6 a and b for masse and sparacia respectively in the figures the top variables are indicated with a specific symbol while the other variables are represented with a grey diamond symbol the data scattering is very low compared to that detected in the analysis of the thresholds discriminating erosive events the csi index varies from 0 to 37 5 at masse and from 23 5 to 52 9 at sparacia the low maximum percentage of correctly chosen events denotes for both stations a limited effectiveness of a single threshold in detecting rill events due to the small sample size for rill events both for sparacia 17 rill events table 2 and even more so for masse 8 rill events table 1 unitary variations in the number of chosen rill events induce significant variations of the corresponding csi values 12 5 1 8 table 1 for masse and 5 9 1 17 table 2 for sparacia consequently there are only four csi values at masse and five at sparacia with a high number of variables having the same csi the small sample size also influences the rei values table 9 which in many cases are considerably higher than the nominal value reinominal 0 i e ei30 c ei30 r 0 actually ei30 c is computed by excess with respect to ei30 r and the erosivity of each further selected event can lead to a significant increase in ei30 c which implies an ei30 c ei30 r value very different from zero for the masse station the results cannot be considered particularly significant due to the small size of the database 8 rill events while for the sparacia station a larger database is available 17 rill events and the results are more significant in any case for masse the best result in terms of the percentage of chosen rill events maximum csi fig 6a is obtained by the criterion p max burst 33 6 mm which allows us to detect 37 5 3 out of 8 of the rill events table 9 followed by the criterion re 359 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 which allows us to identify 2 out of 8 rill events lastly p run 19 9 mm allows the identification of only 1 out of 8 rill events furthermore table 9a shows the high error in the estimate of the long term erosivity rei which for the top ten variables varies from 0 1 to 18 5 the results obtained for sparacia table 9b clearly show the importance of the variables that quantify the rainfall intensity in the detection of rill events by using only the hyetograph in particular the average intensity of the event ie allows us to identify 52 9 of the rill events 9 out of 17 while the intensities ix with x 30 20 25 40 50 60 min allow us to identify 41 2 of rill events 7 out of 17 the same csi value is also obtained with the variables p run p max run ie wet and max i burst for sparacia the rei value for the top variables is always very low 3 2 table 9b fig 7 a for masse and b for sparacia show the csi and wsi pairs corresponding to the 10 31 pairs of variables used for the compound criteria it can be observed that the points are arranged in classes with a maximum csi 50 at masse and 60 at sparacia the csi wsi point corresponding to the best performance for each of the top variables is plotted in fig 7 with a specific symbol while all the other points are plotted with a grey diamond symbol for the masse station the best compound criteria are obtained with the top variables p max burst i60 and re see fig 7a the compound thresholds for these variables are given in table 10 in particular the criterion based on p max burst 33 6 mm or i10 74 4 mm h allows us to detect 50 of the rill events while 50 of chosen events are incorrectly classified fig 7a however as in the single threshold case rei exceeds 10 and is equal to 37 9 by coupling the variable i60 with v4 v9 v10 v11 v32 v33 or v34 37 5 of the rill events are identified fig 7a in all these cases wsi is equal to 40 and rei is around 32 2 instead the pairs re v13 and re v27 identify 37 5 of rill events with 40 of errors wsi and rei 14 7 which is the closest to reinominal 10 for the sparacia station fig 7b the best results are obtained by the extended selection based on ie wet which gives a threshold of ie wet 15 mm h and by the compound criterion ie wet 21 6 mm h or ie 11 2 mm h table 10 these two criteria allow us to select 58 8 of rill events from the entire rill database with 37 5 and 41 2 of incorrect selections respectively the compound criteria based on i30 i20 and i25 coupled with v22 or v25 allow us to identify 52 9 of the rill events the same results are obtained both for p max run coupled with v22 or v25 and for ix with x 40 50 60 min coupled with v22 overall the effectiveness of compound criteria in detecting rill events is also limited because only 37 5 50 of rill events are selected for masse and 52 9 58 8 are selected for sparacia 4 discussion the identification of the best thresholds among those analyzed must be carried out on the basis of the following observations the importance of the different effectiveness indices depends on the aims of the analysis in particular the rei index is helpful if the goal is to calculate the erosivity factor related to a certain time period in a specific area e g the annual erosivity in this regard it should be noted that by increasing the rei value the performances in terms of csi or wsi improve considerably for example in the case of a single threshold in which reinominal 0 for masse csi ranges from 55 to 89 fig 2 whereas for reinominal 10 csi ranges from 66 to 96 fig 4a similar improvements occur for the sparacia station figs 3 and 5a therefore the results can be compared only for the same rei value and this rei value should be as close as possible to zero the eff index accounts for the rejected events whose rainfall data will not be processed currently the use of computers and digital data makes the cost of processing non erosive storm data negligible therefore only low eff values are of interest because they signal that rainfall events have been almost entirely selected and this means that the threshold is not very useful in this case the number of selected erosive events csi is high and the number of incorrect classifications wsi is also expected to be high in the discussion of the results and for indicating what the best criterion is for selecting the erosive events at the two stations and in the corresponding geographical areas a comparison with the universally most widespread criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 cannot be disregarded according to these authors an erosive rainfall is identified by the compound criterion of pe 12 7 mm or i15 6 35 mm in 15 min applying this criterion to the databases of the two stations satisfactory results were generally obtained in particular for masse csi is 74 6 and wsi is 26 7 in addition the corresponding rei value of 5 0 is much lower than 23 which is obtained at masse without using thresholds i e considering all events as erosive for sparacia a high percentage of correctly selected erosion events csi 89 8 is obtained but at the same time there is a relatively high percentage of incorrectly classified events wsi 29 6 in addition the rei value is high 20 0 but lower than that 33 obtained without using thresholds to carry out a suitable comparison with the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 the thresholds of the variables used for the compound criteria were re determined by imposing reinominal 5 0 at masse and reinominal 20 at sparacia the corresponding csi and wsi pairs are shown together with those obtained with the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 in figs 8 a and 9a respectively as previously noted as the reinominal for determining the threshold increases the csi also increases in fact for the sparacia station all the points plotted in fig 9 a for which reinominal 20 are located farther to the right compared to the points plotted in fig 5a for which reinominal 10 consistently with these results for the masse station and for reinominal 5 the points are clearly translated to the left fig 8a compared to those plotted in fig 4a reinominal 10 it has been verified that assuming reinominal 20 also for the masse station the csi values would also increase ranging from 86 to 100 and the wsi values would be greater than or equal to 40 due to the dependence on the rei index the results shown in figs 8a and 9a are neither comparable nor useful for the selection of the best criterion but are only useful for the comparison with those obtained with the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 both at masse fig 8a and sparacia fig 9a the point corresponding to the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 is placed in the lower right area of the graph the performance of this criterion is good compared to the best ones in terms of distance from the perfect selection point characterized by the same wsi value very similar performances are also obtained assuming reinominal 5 for the masse database fig 8b c and reinominal 20 for the sparacia database fig 9b c using other compound criteria the values of the threshold variables are given in tables 7 and 8 as regards the thresholds for separating erosive and non erosive events the great presence of the burst variables among the best performing ones is of great interest for the interpretation of the erosive process the top variables are rainfall depth p max burst and the duration max d burst of a continuous rain shower period along with the variables accounting for the rainfall depth that precedes the occurrence of a burst or a run such as max p pre burst or max p pre run these variables are of particular interest because for the occurrence of an erosive event they highlight the importance not only of the rain shower characteristics but also of the cumulative rain fallen before a rain shower or a high intensity rainfall period indeed the cumulative rainfall depth from the beginning of the rain to a burst or a run has a decisive effect not only on the soil moisture but also on the soil surface characteristics when the burst or the run occurs such as roughness zobeck and onstad 1987 vinci et al submitted sealing leguédois and le bissonnais 2004 and presence of detached material by drop impact splash erosion torri and poesen 1992 as a consequence these variables control both runoff formation and sediment concentration and therefore they could be used in soil erosion models as a proxy of soil moisture soil conditions or surface runoff moreover the detected reliability of the selective criteria based on d run and n run shows the importance of short periods with high rainfall intensity for the occurrence of surface runoff and the associated soil erosion regarding the thresholds for selecting rill events the variables that quantify the event average intensity ie and the maximum intensity over durations of more than 20 min ix x 30 20 25 40 50 60 min are very effective for the sparacia station the average intensity in the wet period ie wet whose threshold value is obtained extending the selection of ei30 values up to 1 1 times ei30 r is the most effective variable with csi 58 8 10 selected rill events out of 17 the presence of run variables among the top variables is also noticeable these quantify the deviations in the hyetograph above a truncation level the ability of these variables to identify rill events is of great interest both for the applications and for the correct interpretation of the rill erosion process as they clearly demonstrate that even periods that are short but with high rainfall depth are typical for rill events and therefore presumably trigger canalized erosion processes for a fixed variable the threshold values for selecting erosive events are much lower than those for selecting rill events this result is consistent with the phenomenology of the rill process according to which rill erosion is typically triggered by severe rainfall the threshold values for distinguishing erosive and non erosive events at masse are generally lower than those obtained at sparacia this means that the rainfall events causing erosion are characterized by lower cumulative rainfalls intensities and rain shower characteristics on the contrary the threshold values for selecting rill events at masse are generally higher than those obtained at sparacia differences between the two sites are attributable to soils and plot steepness the soil erodibility defined as in the context of usle family empirical models i e the susceptibility of the soil to be detached and transported by the erosive agent is different and varies with the severity in terms of soil loss of the erosion event see fig 6 of bagarello et al 2018 more specifically for severe events which include rill events the soil erodibility at masse is lower than at sparacia while the opposite occurs for small events moreover the plot steepness at masse is lower than the mean plot steepness at sparacia taking into account that threshold values are expected to decrease as soil erodibility and plot steepness increase the result concerning the thresholds for selecting rill events is explained by the concordant effect of soil and steepness whereas in the case of thresholds for distinguishing erosive and non erosive events the soil effect prevails over that of steepness the circumstance that the top variables are often coincident induces one to consider that the construction of a set of rainfall variables usable in different areas is possible this would require extending the analysis presented here to data from different sites however taking into account the results obtained at masse and sparacia and those found in the literature differences between the site specific thresholds are expected for a given variable these differences may be attributable to soil characteristics such as erodibility discussed above soil infiltration capacity and soil sealing crusting susceptibility which governs the actual infiltration rate and the runoff production accordingly all these aspects could determine changes in the rainfall based thresholds for both erosion and rill formation however a quantitative evaluation of the effect of the soil characteristics on the proposed thresholds is not straightforward for example the threshold for rill formation should generally increase with the clay content smerdon and beasley 1961 but in some circumstances e g soils with high exchangeable sodium percentage or sodium absorption ratio clays can completely change behavior and be very susceptible to erosive processes due to the poor structure and slacking of aggregates therefore the rainfall thresholds proposed in this paper can be considered a general guidance based only on the climatic component for a more general applicability of the aforementioned procedure to bare plots maintained in a cultivated fallow it should be further developed for taking into account possible adjustment factors related to soil and topographic factors in accordance with the usle scheme lastly for the variables not directly dependent on the rainfall energy value the threshold values are independent of the equation adopted for the energy calculation instead for the variables directly dependent on the energy value such as re and e the threshold values obtained here are applicable using the intensity energy equation included in the rusle 5 conclusions soil erosion processes depend both on the overall rain characteristics and the characteristics of rainfall patterns and they are affected adversely by the global warming which has been recognized to produce increase in storm intensities and reduced spatial extent of extreme storms in this paper a method was applied for determining practical thresholds to detect rainfalls which cause erosive and rill events rainfall data from the masse and sparacia stations in italy with a 5 min resolution were used to develop a database of 1017 erosive interrill only rill and non erosive events each threshold value was obtained by imposing that the total erosivity of the selected events was equal to the total erosivity of all erosive events or only rill events the values of 31 variables were calculated for each rainfall event by applying the procedure developed by todisco 2014 for the lowest number of incorrect selections ranging from 15 to 30 the best criteria to distinguish erosive events were pe 14 4 mm at masse 62 of erosive events selected and 18 8 mm at sparacia 59 2 of erosive events selected max p pre burst 10 6 mm at masse 74 7 of erosive events selected and 15 0 mm at sparacia 73 5 of erosive events selected and p max burst 7 6 mm at masse 65 2 of erosive events selected and 11 0 mm at sparacia 44 9 of erosive events selected in addition other effective criteria were i60 7 2 mm h at masse 58 9 of erosive events selected and e 3 8 mj ha 1 at sparacia 46 9 of erosive events selected for values of incorrect selections higher than 30 other criteria were able to select a higher number of erosive events at masse the criterion pe 10 2 mm with reinominal 10 allowed us to identify 136 out of 158 i e 86 1 erosive events the compound criteria p max burst 7 6 mm or max p pre run 5 8 mm and e 2 4 mj ha 1 or pe 10 2 mm had similar performances increasing the number of incorrectly selected events up to 62 the variables max p pre run and max p pre burst used as the first variable of the compound criteria allowed us to identify as much as 150 out of 158 95 events at sparacia the most effective compound criterion for selecting erosive events max p pre burst 15 mm or n run 2 was able to identify 81 out of 98 83 erosive events the compound criterion pe 18 8 mm or n run 2 gave a similar performance with 75 erosive events selected out of 98 increasing the number of incorrectly selected events up to 50 n run max p pre burst and max d burst used as the first variable of the compound criteria allowed the selection of 96 out of 98 98 erosive events at masse the compound criterion pe 12 7 mm or i15 6 35 mm proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 distinguished 118 out of 158 74 6 erosive events with an rei value of around 5 the validity of this criterion was confirmed by its ability to obtain both a relatively high number of selected erosive events and a low number of selection errors at sparacia as well the criterion proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 allowed us to select a high number of erosive events 88 out of 98 i e 90 and to obtain a low number of selection errors although a high rei value of 20 was obtained in this case with reference to the practical thresholds to detect rill rainfalls the results for the masse station must be considered as preliminary results because of the small sample size of rill events the best criteria for distinguishing rill events were ie 8 9 mm h 52 9 of rill events selected for sparacia and p max burst 33 6 mm 37 5 of rill events selected for masse the two most effective criteria valid for both stations were re 359 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 25 of rill events selected for masse and 202 0 mj mm ha 1 h 1 35 3 of rill events selected for sparacia and p run 19 9 mm 12 5 of rill events selected for masse and 14 0 mm 41 2 of rill events selected for sparacia the best criteria for distinguishing rill events obtained by imposing reinominal 10 were ie wet 15 mm 58 8 of rill events selected for sparacia and p max burst 33 6 mm or i10 74 4 mm h with 50 of rill events selected for masse the present analysis mainly highlighted two considerable aspects of the problem concerning the detection of erosive rill events by using the hyetograph alone the first aspect is that the choice of the selective criterion depends on the desired accuracy in the estimation of the long term erosivity but also on the number of selection errors compatible with the purpose of the analysis to be carried out the second aspect concerns the noticeable effectiveness of the selection criteria based on variables describing the rainfall pattern i e the burst variables this result highlights the importance for the occurrence of an erosive event not only of the rain shower characteristics but also of the cumulative rain fallen before a rain shower or a high intensity rainfall period therefore they could be used in soil erosion models as a proxy of variables more rarely available and or more difficult to measure such as soil moisture and surface runoff which are strongly affected by this cumulative rainfall lastly thresholds to distinguish erosive and non erosive events at masse station were generally lower than those obtained at sparacia in agreement with the circumstance that soil erodibility at masse is higher than at sparacia for small events thresholds to select rill events at the masse station were generally higher than those obtained at sparacia and this result could be explained by the lower plot steepness and soil erodibility related to severe events the differences between the threshold values here determined for the two italian sites and available in the literature for different parts of the world emphasize that they are geographically dependent this dependence may be also explained by different soil characteristics despite these differences the construction of a set of variables usable at different sites does appear possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6049,in this paper 1017 rainfall events from 2008 to 2017 are used to identify the rainfall threshold that produces upland erosion at the masse central italy and sparacia southern italy experimental stations the rainfall events are classified into three classes non erosive interrill only and rill the threshold values for separating as correctly as possible the erosive rains case i and the rill rains case ii are derived solely from the hyetograph each threshold value is obtained by imposing that the long term erosivity of the events above the threshold is equal to the long term erosivity of all erosive events case i or only rill events case ii the performances of selective criteria based on 31 threshold variables are compared and those most effective in separating erosive and rill events are identified the identification of the best criterion depends on the aim of the analysis it could be required to provide the greatest accuracy for separating erosive and rill events or the lowest error in the prediction of long term erosivity in general the results clearly show that the best variables are those that quantify the characteristics of rainfall patterns such as rain showers periods of continuous rain and the deviations in the rain records over a truncation level these results are especially significant for the operational estimation of rainfall erosivity and for identifying the trigger of the erosion process and rill development by using only a hyetograph this is obtained by relatively simple field measurements and is also widely available on a global scale the most effective variables are potentially usable in water erosion prediction models as proxies of variables that are more rarely available and or more difficult to measure keywords soil erosion soil loss rainfall pattern rainfall hyetograph rainfall thresholds rainfall erosivity interrill usle rusle 1 introduction the determining of practical thresholds for separating erosive from non erosive rainfall events or rill from interrill only events is of considerable importance from both a practical and a scientific perspective xie et al 2016 2002 dunkerley 2008 poesen et al 2003 in the last few decades the meaning of erosive event has been much debated renard et al 1997 xie et al 2002 dunkerley 2008 2010 in most analyses e g efthimiou 2018 porto 2016 borrelli et al 2016 panagos et al 2016 2015 vallebona et al 2015 meusburger et al 2012 grauso et al 2010 todisco et al 2010 angulo martínez et al 2009 the criterion for identifying erosive rainfall events is that derived by wischmeier and smith 1978 according to this criterion rainfalls of less than 12 7 mm were omitted in rainfall erosivity computations unless at least 6 4 mm of rain fell in 15 min the reason for selecting these values was not given nor was their influence on the accuracy of estimating rainfall erosivity evaluated originally non erosive rainfalls were routinely omitted because this made the calculation of rainfall erosivity enormously easier the use of computers and digital data has by now eliminated the difficulty in analyzing rainfall intensity data this raises the question of whether storms with small rainfall amounts should still be excluded we know that some included storms above the threshold may not result in measurable runoff and soil loss whereas some omitted storms below the threshold may cause erosion cooley et al 1988 showed a 28 59 increase in the long period rainfall erosivity in the western united states by including all storms in the calculation rather than only storms with a rainfall over 12 7 mm renard et al 1997 also reported an increase in the long period total rainfall erosivity in a us watershed ranging from 28 to 59 mcgregor et al 1995 showed a 3 6 increase in erosivity in the eastern united states and yu 1999 reported an average increase of 4 5 in the tropical region of australia therefore it is clear that this screening process between erosive and non erosive rainfalls is important especially for mapping rainfall erosivity or estimating soil loss further thresholds have been derived based on overall rainfall characteristics alone such as total rainfall depth and duration mean intensity and maximum intensity over various intra storm time periods in rhodesia hudson 1971 considered erosive the storms with intensities greater than 1 in h 25 mm h in belgium sinzot et al 1989 found that erosion recorded on experimental plots shows the closest correlation to rainfall if a value greater than or equal to 8 mm and a maximum intensity over 15 min were considered in côte d ivoire roose and godefroy 1977 included all rains greater than 10 mm in the computation of erosivity in the rusle renard et al 1997 the same erosive threshold indicated in wischmeier and smith 1978 was used in calculating erosivity in the eastern generally more humid part of the united states whereas all storms were used in the western drier part of the country yin et al 2017 hudson 1995 morgan and nearing 2016 morgan 1980 poesen et al 2003 xie et al 2002 developed a practical method for identifying the threshold that distinguishes erosive from non erosive storms the method applies to the values of the individual storm erosion index wischmeier and smith 1978 ei30 in which e mj mm ha 1 h 1 event rainfall kinetic energy and i30 mm h maximum rainfall intensity over 30 min observed during the event the ei30 values of the storms that generate runoff but are omitted from the calculation are balanced by those of the storms that do not cause runoff but are included in the calculation they provided an event rainfall threshold of 12 mm a mean rainfall intensity of 2 4 mm h and other thresholds for maximum intensity over various intra storm time periods e g i30 13 3 mm h this method was recently used at an experimental station in the yellow river basin in china obtaining an event rainfall threshold of 12 mm and a daily rainfall threshold of 9 7 mm yin et al 2017 however a generally accepted criterion to determine a rainfall threshold above which erosion begins is still lacking threshold values based on relationships between rainfall and soil loss or surface runoff have been studied in a recent paper stumpf et al 2017 estimated the direct runoff for similar initial soil moisture conditions todisco et al 2015 selected events which exhibited direct runoff and an associated erosive response and rejected those where a distinct attribution of direct runoff to a rainfall event was impossible because of inadequate separation between direct runoff and baseflow zheng and cheng 2017 also used a runoff threshold to determine erosive rainfall events it should be pointed out that the measurement of the event runoff is not straightforward or widely available furthermore studies aimed at defining practical thresholds for selecting rill events from rainfall events are lacking the critical condition for rill initiation is generally identified in terms of soil critical shear stress and flow velocity yao et al 2008 nearing et al 1991 govers 1992 soil shear strength torri et al 1987 slope gradient and inflow rate the impacts of climate warming on soil erosion have been noticed since the 1940s zhiying and haiyan 2016 in particular the direct impacts are mainly caused by changes in rainfall amount rainfall intensity roderick et al 2019 and rainfall spatial temporal distributional patterns with precipitations which are expected to become both more intense and spatially concentrated in a warming climate wasko et al 2016 these direct impacts affect adversely soil erosion by increasing rainfall erosivity as an example bazzoffi and pellegrini 1992 found that in tuscany italy the mean over 9 years ei30 value changed since the 1960s with a major variation of i30 values indicating precipitations with more stormy characteristics these findings were confirmed by crisci et al 2002 torri et al 2006 the phenomenology and the extent of soil water erosion processes are closely linked to both the overall rain characteristics and the characteristics of rainfall patterns in todisco 2014 a detailed analysis of the rains recorded along with soil loss at the masse station central italy has clearly shown that non erosive and erosive rains differ due to some rainfall pattern characteristics an event is certainly erosive if the duration de 24 h or the rainfall depth pe 20 mm or the number of positive deviations of the rainfall is above a truncation value run n runs 3 i e three separate periods with rainfall greater than 0 8 mm or run durations are longer than 10 min furthermore the shapes of the rainfall time distribution for erosive and non erosive events show similarities only in the initial part of the event in the second half of the event the non erosive data are typically placed below or more seldom within the first quartile of the erosive storms the rainfall depth of non erosive storms falls almost entirely within the continuous rain shower called a burst with the maximum run erosive events instead focus on the burst with the maximum run in the median at about 30 of the rainfall depth rainfall characteristics have also been analyzed by bagarello et al 2015 at the sparacia station southern italy where both the longest tmax and mean tmean durations of a continuous rain shower during an erosive event were generally short and soil loss per unit area had a scattered but detectable increasing trend with both tmax and tmean the detachment impact erosion and superficial runoff and transport splash rill and interrill only erosion processes and therefore the sediment particle size distribution and the sediment concentration in the runoff are also highly influenced by the rainfall pattern characteristics kinnell 2005 leguédois and le bissonnais 2004 he et al 2018 wang et al 2017 the latter have a noticeable effect on the dynamics of the soil surface characteristics during an erosive event such as surface roughness zobeck and onstad 1987 vinci et al submitted crust formation stability of the soil aggregates and surface detention and retention as well as on the process of surface runoff generation and evolution torri et al 1999 moreover we must not forget that all rainfall runoff models use the rainfall pattern as input and that rainfalls with similar overall characteristics can produce or not produce runoff depending essentially on the rainfall pattern characteristics todisco 2014 since the measurement of event runoff is not straightforward and the energy data are difficult to measure the hyetograph is the event characteristic which is most widely available the general objective of the paper is to classify rains in three classes non erosive interrill only and rill erosion rains solely on the basis of the hyetograph the specific aim is to determine thresholds of variables describing the rainfall or the rainfall patterns todisco 2014 in order to separate as correctly as possible i the erosive rains regardless of the erosion component rill interrill only and ii the rill rains using these two thresholds a rainfall event is classified as interrill only when it is erosive but not rill threshold values were derived according to the procedure proposed by xie et al 2002 and were evaluated on the basis of efficiency indices the analysis was performed on the database of the masse central italy and sparacia southern italy experimental stations 2 materials and methods data for this investigation were collected at the masse central italy and sparacia southern italy experimental stations for soil loss measurement where bare plots were established the characteristics of the two stations have been described in detail in other papers e g todisco 2014 todisco et al 2015 todisco et al 2012 bagarello et al 2011a b 2013 2015 and are only summarized here for the sake of brevity all plots considered were maintained in a cultivated fallow and rills were obliterated by hand tools at the end of each erosive event the masse experimental station for soil erosion measurement of the university of perugia was established in 2007 it is located 20 km south of perugia in the region of umbria the station includes ten plots four 8 22 m2 plots two 4 22 m2 plots two 4 11 m2 plots and two 2 11 m2 plots all plots are oriented parallel to a 16 slope the area has a characteristic mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall of 900 mm the soil can be classified as a calcaric cambisol according to the world reference base for soil resources wrb and the soil texture based on the united states department of agriculture classification is silt clay loam clay 34 silt 59 and sand 7 the gravel content is negligible and the organic matter content is about 1 the soil structure is massive when wet and after drying breaks into weak fine subangular blocks the meteorological data are monitored by a weather station located within the experimental site and are recorded at a time resolution of 5 min the sparacia experimental station for soil erosion measurement of the university of palermo is located in western sicily approximately 100 km south of palermo it includes two 8 44 m2 plots two 8 33 m2 plots six 8 22 m2 plots two 2 22 m2 plots two 4 11 m2 plots and two 2 11 m2 plots all these plots were installed on a 14 9 slope two 6 22 m2 plots were also established on a 22 0 slope and two other 6 22 m2 plots were installed on a 26 0 slope the area has a typical mediterranean semi arid climate with an average annual rainfall of approximately 700 mm the soil has a clay texture clay 62 silt 33 and sand 5 with a massive consistency when it is wet and fully swollen a polygonal pattern of surface shrinkage cracks develops as the soil dries the meteorological data are monitored by two pluviographs located within the experimental site and are recorded at a time resolution of 1 min di stefano et al 2015 at the masse and sparacia sites total runoff is stored in one to three 1 m3 storage tanks depending on the plot size which are sampled for measuring event plot soil loss bagarello et al 2018 after each sampling the storage tanks are emptied according to the definition by wischmeier and smith 1978 a rainfall event is an individual storm preceded and followed by 6 h or more of no rain if only one rainfall event occurred between the emptying of the tanks and the subsequent sampling it was classified as individual i non erosive if it did not produce measurable soil loss ii interrill only if only interrill erosion was detected and iii rill if rills were detected in the plot i e both the rill and interrill components of the erosion process were detected sometimes a sequence of individual rainfall events occurs between the emptying of the tanks and the subsequent sampling due to the impossibility of measuring soil loss if they are close to one another therefore the measured runoff and soil loss is associated with multiple hyetographs and it is not known which one of the rainfall events in the sequence actually produced runoff and soil loss however the thresholds to separate as correctly as possible i all the erosive events interrill only or rill and ii the rill events are intended to be applied to the rainfall records in the absence of information on the associated soil loss i e to the individual rainfall events and consequently the determining of these thresholds must be based on the analysis of the largest possible database of individual events the datasets used in the following analysis include all non erosive interrill only and rill rains recorded as individual events all the events of a sequence are included in each dataset as individual events and are classified as non erosive erosive if the rainfall depth is lower higher than the minimum depth of an individual interrill only rain if the erosive event is recorded within a sequence which produced rills and its rainfall depth is higher than the minimum one recorded for an individual rill rain the event is classified as individual rill event all events with cumulated rainfall depth pe 1 mm have been excluded from the datasets the dataset analyzed for the masse station includes 528 rainfall events 370 non erosive 150 interrill only and 8 rill the statistics of the main variables are reported in table 1 for sparacia the dataset includes 489 events 391 non erosive 81 interrill only and 17 rill the statistics of the main variables are shown in table 2 for this latter station the rainfall data were aggregated at 5 min time steps to be homogeneous with those of the masse station the sparacia data include rainfall events that occurred on plots having three different slopes ranging from 14 9 to 26 the threshold values to be exceeded for erosion rill erosion to occur are expected to decrease as plot steepness increases indeed it can be supposed that a slope increase implies more runoff energy higher probability of detachment and transport of sediments by overland flow and more opportunities for rill development however a single database was developed for sparacia in order to determine average thresholds for that site the six steps of the procedure for determining thresholds for separating i erosive events and ii rill events were 1 calculation of the values of rainfall erosivity ei30 for each event using the method described by wischmeier and smith 1978 with rainfall energy calculated as a function of rainfall intensity as suggested in rusle renard et al 1997 2 summing of the ei30 values for the i erosive events or ii rill events the sum of these ei30 values which is named ei30 t and is the long term rainfall erosivity for i all erosive events or ii rill events was the target value used to determine the thresholds in other words these two long term rainfall erosivities take into account the ei30 values measured for all erosive and rill events respectively during the entire monitoring period and were defined as target values with the meaning specified at the following point five of the procedure in case i the objective was to select practical thresholds for separating erosive both rill and interrill only and non erosive storms in this case the threshold was determined by setting the target value ei30 t equal to the sum of all ei30 values calculated for all erosive events ei30 e in case ii the objective was to select practical thresholds for detecting rill events in this case the threshold was determined by setting ei30 t equal to the sum of all ei30 values calculated for rill events ei30 r 3 selection of a variable from a list of 31 variables describing the overall rainfall characteristics or rainfall pattern a sketch of a hyetograph is given as an example in fig 1 and all the variables are listed in table 3 4 listing of all events case i or of erosive events only case ii in decreasing order of the selected variable along with the corresponding ei30 values 5 summing of the ei30 values from the highest value of the selected variable up to the one where the cumulative value ei30 c equals or approximates by excess the target ei30 t with ei30 t ei30 e in case i and ei30 t ei30 r in case ii the approximation by excess can include the first discarded event if it is erosive case i or rill case ii 6 this last value was identified as the threshold value of that variable rainfall events characterized by values of the variable higher than the corresponding threshold were chosen as erosive in case i and as rill in case ii while the events characterized by values of the variable below the selected threshold were not chosen as erosive in case i and as rill in case ii in other words the terms chosen and not chosen refer to whether or not the rainfall erosivity of a given event was used for calculating ei30 c in table 4 steps 4 6 of the procedure are applied to an illustrative database and the threshold for separating erosive and non erosive events for the variable rainfall depth was pe 36 6 mm i e all the rainfalls with pe 36 6 mm are considered erosive events and included in the calculation of long term erosivity ei30 c 3571 mj mm ha 1 h 1 according to this procedure some erosive events are incorrectly not chosen while some non erosive events are incorrectly chosen and balance those omitted with reference to table 4 events nos 1026 1565 1295 715 were incorrectly not chosen and events nos 1079 1107 1212 were incorrectly chosen under ideal conditions the thresholds would completely separate the three classes non erosive interrill only rill and consequently the ei30 t value would be unaffected by the values that are below the threshold in practice a perfect separation is impossible because of the complexity of rainfall characteristics and the temporal variations in the system response in terms of runoff and soil loss however according to xie et al 2002 if the cumulative value of the individual storm erosion index ei30 c of the chosen rainfall events is equal to ei30 t then the aim of determining the threshold is achieved in table 4 for example events nos 1026 1565 1295 and 715 have pe 36 6 mm therefore they were not chosen and are excluded from the ei30 c calculation at the same time events nos 1079 1107 and 1212 were chosen because they have pe 36 6 mm even if they are non erosive however their erosivity 142 3 107 7 55 4 305 4 balances quite well that of the erosive events not chosen 134 7 71 8 45 51 9 314 4 lastly the ei30 c of the selection 3571 0 is very close to the target 3569 1 mj mm ha 1 h 1 hence the aim of correctly determining the long term erosivity is achieved as stated above it is impossible to completely separate erosive or rill rainfalls using a single threshold in the example given in table 4 four erosive events lie below the threshold pe 36 6 mm evidently this circumstance was also noted by wischmeier and smith 1978 who proposed the widely known selective compound criterion based on a double threshold pe 12 7 mm or at least 6 4 mm of rain fell in 15 min which is able to include a larger number of erosive events in this paper as well the threshold established with the described procedure was coupled with a companion threshold obtained by applying procedure steps 3 6 to the database of the not chosen events when the first variable coincided with the companion variable the criterion resulted in the extension of the selection carried out for that variable further events were included in the selection until the cumulative value ei30 c for the pair of thresholds equals or approximates by excess ei30 t increased by 10 also in this case the approximation by excess can include the first discarded event if it is erosive case i or rill case ii for practical reasons the companion threshold was derived only for the ten variables that were the most effective in selecting the highest number of erosive rill events high csi with the lowest number of incorrect selections low wsi the ten most effective variables have csi and wsi pairs that when plotted in a cartesian system with csi as the x axis and wsi as the y axis have the smallest euclidian distances from the perfect selection point this point csi 100 and wsi 0 corresponds to the condition for which all the erosive events and only the erosive events are selected the two indexes csi and wsi are statistically uncorrelated and thus provided independent and complementary information the use of a second threshold almost inevitably worsens the wsi index a low wsi for the first threshold is therefore necessary to have a number of selection errors still acceptable for the compound thresholds for example in table 4 p max burst 8 5 mm is the companion threshold of pe 36 6 mm in other words the events with pe 36 6 mm or p max burst 8 5 mm are chosen and included in the calculation of the long term erosivity ei30 c 3937 5 mj mm ha 1 h 1 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the thresholds in estimating ei30 t and in detecting i erosive events and ii rill events the following indices proposed by xie et al 2002 were used relative error index rei which represents the accuracy of the estimated erosivity compared to the true value i e ei30 t and is computed as the ratio between the absolute deviation in the erosivity estimation ei30 c ei30 t and the target value ei30 t 1 rei ei 30 c ei 30 t ei 30 t the minimum value of rei is zero which is obtained when the calculated erosivity ei30 c is equal to the target the procedure for determining thresholds is applied imposing a nominal rei value reinominal which is zero for the single thresholds and 10 for compound thresholds see the example in table 4 efficiency index eff which accounts for the reduction in time and work for the computation of long term erosivity gained by neglecting small rainfalls it is calculated as the ratio between the number nnc of not chosen events and the total number of rainfall events n 2 eff n nc n in addition to those proposed by xie et al 2002 the following indices were also used correct selection index csi which represents the effectiveness of the thresholds in the detection of erosive rill events and is the ratio between the total number nce of correctly chosen events and the total number ne of the erosive rill events 3 csi n ce n e the csi assumes the maximum value of 100 when all erosive rill events are chosen wrong selection index wsi is the ratio between the total number ncn of incorrectly chosen events and the total number nc of chosen events 4 wsi n cn n c the wsi assumes the minimum value of 0 when all the chosen events are correct the reliability of a selective criterion based on the threshold increases as rei and wsi decrease and eff and csi increase an example of calculation of the indices is given in table 4 the actual rei 0 1 is very close to the reinominal 0 denoting a good balance between chosen non erosive events and not chosen erosive events which allows a good estimation accuracy of long term erosivity for each rainfall event the 31 selected variables can be grouped into three categories table 3 the overall variables which quantify the general characteristics of the rainfall event the burst variables which account for the continuous rain showers during a rainfall event called bursts fig 1 and the run variables which account for periods with rainfall deviations above a truncation value called runs fig 1 todisco 2014 as stated by todisco 2014 in comparison with non erosive rainfall time series erosive rainfall time series are characterized by several sequences of positive deviations from a threshold value which are also of long duration based on the procedure proposed by todisco 2014 a truncation level p0 is chosen to identify and quantify positive runs fig 1 the identification of the truncation level p0 was based on the analysis of the cumulative empirical frequency distribution of the rainfall records by excluding zero values the selected p0 value is that corresponding to a cumulative frequency of 95 todisco 2014 which gives p0 0 8 mm in 5 min 9 6 mm h for masse according to todisco 2014 and p0 1 0 mm in 5 min 12 0 mm h for sparacia 3 results 3 1 single thresholds for separating erosive rill interrill only and non erosive storms the use of the descriptive statistics of the rainfall events listed in tables 1 and 2 does not allow us to clearly distinguish the three classes non erosive interrill only and rill events indeed there is a partial overlap between the domains of the overall variables in the two databases where both erosive and non erosive events can occur in such cases the different erosion processes might be attributed to the specific characteristics of the event according to the first two steps of the procedure described above it follows that ei30 t ei30 e 10130 00 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at masse and ei30 t ei30 e 7950 00 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at sparacia these target values were used to determine the thresholds that are listed along with the corresponding effectiveness indices in table 5 for masse and in table 6 for sparacia in any case the effectiveness of the thresholds for erosivity calculation was very high in particular at masse rei 1 7 clearly it is unlikely that the nominal value reinominal 0 occurs because the erosivity of the non erosive events incorrectly chosen almost never perfectly balances the erosivity of the rejected erosive events the csi and wsi pairs are plotted in fig 2 for masse and in fig 3 for sparacia in these figures the pairs corresponding to the top ten variables are enclosed in a portion of the plane delimited by a curved line located in the lower right area of the point clouds shown in figs 2 and 3 and are also indicated as selected in tables 5 and 6 some of the top variables are characterized by low effectiveness in the selection of erosive events low csi but also by a low selection error low wsi at the masse station fig 2 table 5 the top ten variables belong to all three categories overall 5 burst 3 and run 2 the csi index varies from 53 2 to 86 7 most of the thresholds also select 20 to 40 of non erosive events while the wsi is higher than 50 only in a few cases moreover some variables listed in table 5 are characterized by very high csi values and therefore they are very effective in selecting erosive events but they are not among the top ten variables because of the associated high number of incorrectly classified events demonstrated by high wsi values the max p pre burst is the most effective variable for distinguishing erosive events fig 2 by using its threshold value 10 6 mm 74 7 of the erosive events are selected and 28 0 of the chosen events are incorrectly classified the p max burst variable also shows a high effectiveness in detecting erosive events by using its threshold value 7 6 mm 65 2 of the erosive events are selected while 20 2 of chosen events are incorrectly classified another burst variable with a satisfactory performance is max d burst with a threshold value of 0 8 h which makes it possible to detect 76 6 of the erosive events while 40 7 of the selected events are non erosive among the overall variables pe e i40 i50 and i60 are the most effective the threshold pe 14 4 mm allows us to select 62 0 of the erosive events while 24 6 of the chosen rains are non erosive a similar performance was found for e 2 4 mj ha 1 but with a lower percentage csi 57 0 of selected erosive events and a lower percentage wsi 20 4 of selection errors the best result in terms of maximum intensity ix is obtained for the duration of 60 min i60 7 2 mm h with the lowest percentage 18 4 of wrong selections and 58 9 of selected erosive events in general the performances of the criteria based on the run variables are worse compared to those of the overall and the burst variables the only two top run variables are d run and max p pre run which allow us to identify 57 6 and 72 2 of the erosive events and lead to an incorrect classification of 23 5 and 36 7 of the chosen events respectively at sparacia the results obtained for the 31 analyzed variables are similar to those obtained at masse the csi index varies from 37 8 to 92 9 fig 3 table 6 which is a wider range than that obtained for masse furthermore according to the results obtained for masse wsi is lower than 40 for most of the thresholds and is higher than 50 only in a few cases also for the sparacia database some variables with high csi values are not among the top ten because of the associated high wsi values for sparacia as well the top ten variables belong to all three categories overall 5 burst 3 and run 2 and are often coincident with those selected for the masse station the variable max p pre burst is the most effective for distinguishing erosive events fig 3 its threshold value 15 0 mm allows us to select 73 5 of the erosive events while 20 9 of the chosen events are incorrectly classified according to the results obtained for masse other burst variables with satisfactory performances are max d burst whose threshold value 0 7 h allows us to identify 78 6 of the erosive events while 45 4 of the selected events are non erosive and p max burst which with a threshold of 11 mm shows a low percentage of incorrectly classified events wsi 20 but allows us to select only 44 9 of the erosive events among the overall variables re and in agreement with the results obtained for masse pe e i50 and i60 are the most effective using the threshold pe 18 8 mm 59 2 of erosive events are chosen and 17 1 of the chosen events are non erosive the selective criteria based on the thresholds e 3 8 mj ha 1 and re 52 4 mj mm ha 1h 1 have similar performances but with a lower percentage of selected erosive events 46 9 and 39 8 respectively the best result in terms of maximum intensity ix is obtained for the duration of 50 min i50 10 3 mm h with the lowest percentage 23 1 of incorrect selections and 40 8 of selected erosive events very similar results are obtained with the threshold i60 9 4 mm h the only two top run variables are d run as for masse and n run which allow us to detect 49 and 65 3 of the erosive events and lead to an incorrect classification of 28 4 and 36 6 of the chosen events respectively 3 2 compound thresholds for separating erosive rill interrill only and non erosive storms the results of the extension of the selection carried out for each top variable are shown in bold in the diagonal of the upper lines of tables 7 and 8 for the two stations obviously all the threshold values decrease as a consequence of the extension of the selection for example for masse the threshold pe 14 4 mm changes to pe 12 0 mm the thresholds for the compound criteria are also reported in tables 7 and 8 as an example for the masse station table 7 the rainfall event is classified as erosive when p max burst 7 6 mm or pe 14 mm fig 4 a for masse and fig 5 a for sparacia show the csi and wsi pairs corresponding to the 10 31 pairs of variables used for the compound criteria it can be observed that the points are arranged according to a concave upward trend with a minimum close to csi 80 at masse and csi 60 at sparacia a fixed top variable provides very different results depending on the companion variable for a given csi some compound criteria clearly perform worse than others because they are characterized by higher wsi values the best compound criterion can be identified exactly by the radar plot in fig 4b for masse and fig 5b for sparacia where the results in terms of distance between each csi and wsi pair and the perfect selection point are plotted the pair of variables represented by the vertex of the broken line closest to the center of the radar plot provides the best compound criterion in the rest of this paper for brevity of notation the companion variables will be indicated by their codes see table 3 at masse p max burst coupled with v28 provides the best criterion this selective criterion establishes that events with a rain shower depth higher than 7 6 mm or with cumulative rainfall before the run higher than 5 8 mm table 7 are erosive this criterion allows the selection of 81 6 of the erosive events of the masse database with a selection error of 25 fig 4a very similar results are also obtained when p max burst is coupled with v4 v10 v11 v24 or v34 fig 4b the extended selection based on max p pre burst v34 and the compound criteria based on the following pairs of variables i60 v6 max p pre burst coupled with v4 v10 v11 v12 v17 v18 or v32 pe coupled withv4 or v32 e v4 and i50 v6 also provide very similar results in most cases use of the companion variable pe v4 improves the reliability of the criterion based on a single variable the compound criteria using d run i40 max p pre run or max d burst as the first variable provide the worst results on the other hand a selection with csi 100 regardless of the wsi value could also be considered suitable because the rei nominal value is set a priori at the low level of 10 fig 4c shows the csi index values to be compared with the selection given by csi 100 center of the radar plot in this case max p pre run or max d burst coupled with v5 provide the best results fig 4c at sparacia the top variable max p pre burst in combination with v28 provides the best criterion this selective criterion establishes that events with a cumulative rainfall before a burst higher than 15 0 mm or with cumulative rainfall before the run higher than 8 8 mm table 8 are erosive this criterion allows the selection of 82 6 of the erosive events with a selection error of 23 6 fig 5a very similar results are also obtained with max p pre burst and all the variables from v8 to v30 or pe coupled with v24 fig 5b for the selection expressed by csi 100 the top variables max p pre burst n run and max d burst fig 5a coupled with v5 v6 v7 or v31 fig 5c make it possible to select almost 100 of the erosive events fig 5c 3 3 single and compound thresholds for separating rill storms according to the first two steps of the procedure for determining thresholds it follows that ei30 t ei30 r 1492 0 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at masse and ei30 t ei30 r 4228 0 mj mm ha 1 h 1 at sparacia these target values were used to determine the single threshold values that are listed in table 9 a for masse and in table 9b for sparacia along with the top variables indicated in the tables as selected the csi and wsi pairs are plotted in fig 6 a and b for masse and sparacia respectively in the figures the top variables are indicated with a specific symbol while the other variables are represented with a grey diamond symbol the data scattering is very low compared to that detected in the analysis of the thresholds discriminating erosive events the csi index varies from 0 to 37 5 at masse and from 23 5 to 52 9 at sparacia the low maximum percentage of correctly chosen events denotes for both stations a limited effectiveness of a single threshold in detecting rill events due to the small sample size for rill events both for sparacia 17 rill events table 2 and even more so for masse 8 rill events table 1 unitary variations in the number of chosen rill events induce significant variations of the corresponding csi values 12 5 1 8 table 1 for masse and 5 9 1 17 table 2 for sparacia consequently there are only four csi values at masse and five at sparacia with a high number of variables having the same csi the small sample size also influences the rei values table 9 which in many cases are considerably higher than the nominal value reinominal 0 i e ei30 c ei30 r 0 actually ei30 c is computed by excess with respect to ei30 r and the erosivity of each further selected event can lead to a significant increase in ei30 c which implies an ei30 c ei30 r value very different from zero for the masse station the results cannot be considered particularly significant due to the small size of the database 8 rill events while for the sparacia station a larger database is available 17 rill events and the results are more significant in any case for masse the best result in terms of the percentage of chosen rill events maximum csi fig 6a is obtained by the criterion p max burst 33 6 mm which allows us to detect 37 5 3 out of 8 of the rill events table 9 followed by the criterion re 359 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 which allows us to identify 2 out of 8 rill events lastly p run 19 9 mm allows the identification of only 1 out of 8 rill events furthermore table 9a shows the high error in the estimate of the long term erosivity rei which for the top ten variables varies from 0 1 to 18 5 the results obtained for sparacia table 9b clearly show the importance of the variables that quantify the rainfall intensity in the detection of rill events by using only the hyetograph in particular the average intensity of the event ie allows us to identify 52 9 of the rill events 9 out of 17 while the intensities ix with x 30 20 25 40 50 60 min allow us to identify 41 2 of rill events 7 out of 17 the same csi value is also obtained with the variables p run p max run ie wet and max i burst for sparacia the rei value for the top variables is always very low 3 2 table 9b fig 7 a for masse and b for sparacia show the csi and wsi pairs corresponding to the 10 31 pairs of variables used for the compound criteria it can be observed that the points are arranged in classes with a maximum csi 50 at masse and 60 at sparacia the csi wsi point corresponding to the best performance for each of the top variables is plotted in fig 7 with a specific symbol while all the other points are plotted with a grey diamond symbol for the masse station the best compound criteria are obtained with the top variables p max burst i60 and re see fig 7a the compound thresholds for these variables are given in table 10 in particular the criterion based on p max burst 33 6 mm or i10 74 4 mm h allows us to detect 50 of the rill events while 50 of chosen events are incorrectly classified fig 7a however as in the single threshold case rei exceeds 10 and is equal to 37 9 by coupling the variable i60 with v4 v9 v10 v11 v32 v33 or v34 37 5 of the rill events are identified fig 7a in all these cases wsi is equal to 40 and rei is around 32 2 instead the pairs re v13 and re v27 identify 37 5 of rill events with 40 of errors wsi and rei 14 7 which is the closest to reinominal 10 for the sparacia station fig 7b the best results are obtained by the extended selection based on ie wet which gives a threshold of ie wet 15 mm h and by the compound criterion ie wet 21 6 mm h or ie 11 2 mm h table 10 these two criteria allow us to select 58 8 of rill events from the entire rill database with 37 5 and 41 2 of incorrect selections respectively the compound criteria based on i30 i20 and i25 coupled with v22 or v25 allow us to identify 52 9 of the rill events the same results are obtained both for p max run coupled with v22 or v25 and for ix with x 40 50 60 min coupled with v22 overall the effectiveness of compound criteria in detecting rill events is also limited because only 37 5 50 of rill events are selected for masse and 52 9 58 8 are selected for sparacia 4 discussion the identification of the best thresholds among those analyzed must be carried out on the basis of the following observations the importance of the different effectiveness indices depends on the aims of the analysis in particular the rei index is helpful if the goal is to calculate the erosivity factor related to a certain time period in a specific area e g the annual erosivity in this regard it should be noted that by increasing the rei value the performances in terms of csi or wsi improve considerably for example in the case of a single threshold in which reinominal 0 for masse csi ranges from 55 to 89 fig 2 whereas for reinominal 10 csi ranges from 66 to 96 fig 4a similar improvements occur for the sparacia station figs 3 and 5a therefore the results can be compared only for the same rei value and this rei value should be as close as possible to zero the eff index accounts for the rejected events whose rainfall data will not be processed currently the use of computers and digital data makes the cost of processing non erosive storm data negligible therefore only low eff values are of interest because they signal that rainfall events have been almost entirely selected and this means that the threshold is not very useful in this case the number of selected erosive events csi is high and the number of incorrect classifications wsi is also expected to be high in the discussion of the results and for indicating what the best criterion is for selecting the erosive events at the two stations and in the corresponding geographical areas a comparison with the universally most widespread criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 cannot be disregarded according to these authors an erosive rainfall is identified by the compound criterion of pe 12 7 mm or i15 6 35 mm in 15 min applying this criterion to the databases of the two stations satisfactory results were generally obtained in particular for masse csi is 74 6 and wsi is 26 7 in addition the corresponding rei value of 5 0 is much lower than 23 which is obtained at masse without using thresholds i e considering all events as erosive for sparacia a high percentage of correctly selected erosion events csi 89 8 is obtained but at the same time there is a relatively high percentage of incorrectly classified events wsi 29 6 in addition the rei value is high 20 0 but lower than that 33 obtained without using thresholds to carry out a suitable comparison with the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 the thresholds of the variables used for the compound criteria were re determined by imposing reinominal 5 0 at masse and reinominal 20 at sparacia the corresponding csi and wsi pairs are shown together with those obtained with the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 in figs 8 a and 9a respectively as previously noted as the reinominal for determining the threshold increases the csi also increases in fact for the sparacia station all the points plotted in fig 9 a for which reinominal 20 are located farther to the right compared to the points plotted in fig 5a for which reinominal 10 consistently with these results for the masse station and for reinominal 5 the points are clearly translated to the left fig 8a compared to those plotted in fig 4a reinominal 10 it has been verified that assuming reinominal 20 also for the masse station the csi values would also increase ranging from 86 to 100 and the wsi values would be greater than or equal to 40 due to the dependence on the rei index the results shown in figs 8a and 9a are neither comparable nor useful for the selection of the best criterion but are only useful for the comparison with those obtained with the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 both at masse fig 8a and sparacia fig 9a the point corresponding to the criterion of wischmeier and smith 1978 is placed in the lower right area of the graph the performance of this criterion is good compared to the best ones in terms of distance from the perfect selection point characterized by the same wsi value very similar performances are also obtained assuming reinominal 5 for the masse database fig 8b c and reinominal 20 for the sparacia database fig 9b c using other compound criteria the values of the threshold variables are given in tables 7 and 8 as regards the thresholds for separating erosive and non erosive events the great presence of the burst variables among the best performing ones is of great interest for the interpretation of the erosive process the top variables are rainfall depth p max burst and the duration max d burst of a continuous rain shower period along with the variables accounting for the rainfall depth that precedes the occurrence of a burst or a run such as max p pre burst or max p pre run these variables are of particular interest because for the occurrence of an erosive event they highlight the importance not only of the rain shower characteristics but also of the cumulative rain fallen before a rain shower or a high intensity rainfall period indeed the cumulative rainfall depth from the beginning of the rain to a burst or a run has a decisive effect not only on the soil moisture but also on the soil surface characteristics when the burst or the run occurs such as roughness zobeck and onstad 1987 vinci et al submitted sealing leguédois and le bissonnais 2004 and presence of detached material by drop impact splash erosion torri and poesen 1992 as a consequence these variables control both runoff formation and sediment concentration and therefore they could be used in soil erosion models as a proxy of soil moisture soil conditions or surface runoff moreover the detected reliability of the selective criteria based on d run and n run shows the importance of short periods with high rainfall intensity for the occurrence of surface runoff and the associated soil erosion regarding the thresholds for selecting rill events the variables that quantify the event average intensity ie and the maximum intensity over durations of more than 20 min ix x 30 20 25 40 50 60 min are very effective for the sparacia station the average intensity in the wet period ie wet whose threshold value is obtained extending the selection of ei30 values up to 1 1 times ei30 r is the most effective variable with csi 58 8 10 selected rill events out of 17 the presence of run variables among the top variables is also noticeable these quantify the deviations in the hyetograph above a truncation level the ability of these variables to identify rill events is of great interest both for the applications and for the correct interpretation of the rill erosion process as they clearly demonstrate that even periods that are short but with high rainfall depth are typical for rill events and therefore presumably trigger canalized erosion processes for a fixed variable the threshold values for selecting erosive events are much lower than those for selecting rill events this result is consistent with the phenomenology of the rill process according to which rill erosion is typically triggered by severe rainfall the threshold values for distinguishing erosive and non erosive events at masse are generally lower than those obtained at sparacia this means that the rainfall events causing erosion are characterized by lower cumulative rainfalls intensities and rain shower characteristics on the contrary the threshold values for selecting rill events at masse are generally higher than those obtained at sparacia differences between the two sites are attributable to soils and plot steepness the soil erodibility defined as in the context of usle family empirical models i e the susceptibility of the soil to be detached and transported by the erosive agent is different and varies with the severity in terms of soil loss of the erosion event see fig 6 of bagarello et al 2018 more specifically for severe events which include rill events the soil erodibility at masse is lower than at sparacia while the opposite occurs for small events moreover the plot steepness at masse is lower than the mean plot steepness at sparacia taking into account that threshold values are expected to decrease as soil erodibility and plot steepness increase the result concerning the thresholds for selecting rill events is explained by the concordant effect of soil and steepness whereas in the case of thresholds for distinguishing erosive and non erosive events the soil effect prevails over that of steepness the circumstance that the top variables are often coincident induces one to consider that the construction of a set of rainfall variables usable in different areas is possible this would require extending the analysis presented here to data from different sites however taking into account the results obtained at masse and sparacia and those found in the literature differences between the site specific thresholds are expected for a given variable these differences may be attributable to soil characteristics such as erodibility discussed above soil infiltration capacity and soil sealing crusting susceptibility which governs the actual infiltration rate and the runoff production accordingly all these aspects could determine changes in the rainfall based thresholds for both erosion and rill formation however a quantitative evaluation of the effect of the soil characteristics on the proposed thresholds is not straightforward for example the threshold for rill formation should generally increase with the clay content smerdon and beasley 1961 but in some circumstances e g soils with high exchangeable sodium percentage or sodium absorption ratio clays can completely change behavior and be very susceptible to erosive processes due to the poor structure and slacking of aggregates therefore the rainfall thresholds proposed in this paper can be considered a general guidance based only on the climatic component for a more general applicability of the aforementioned procedure to bare plots maintained in a cultivated fallow it should be further developed for taking into account possible adjustment factors related to soil and topographic factors in accordance with the usle scheme lastly for the variables not directly dependent on the rainfall energy value the threshold values are independent of the equation adopted for the energy calculation instead for the variables directly dependent on the energy value such as re and e the threshold values obtained here are applicable using the intensity energy equation included in the rusle 5 conclusions soil erosion processes depend both on the overall rain characteristics and the characteristics of rainfall patterns and they are affected adversely by the global warming which has been recognized to produce increase in storm intensities and reduced spatial extent of extreme storms in this paper a method was applied for determining practical thresholds to detect rainfalls which cause erosive and rill events rainfall data from the masse and sparacia stations in italy with a 5 min resolution were used to develop a database of 1017 erosive interrill only rill and non erosive events each threshold value was obtained by imposing that the total erosivity of the selected events was equal to the total erosivity of all erosive events or only rill events the values of 31 variables were calculated for each rainfall event by applying the procedure developed by todisco 2014 for the lowest number of incorrect selections ranging from 15 to 30 the best criteria to distinguish erosive events were pe 14 4 mm at masse 62 of erosive events selected and 18 8 mm at sparacia 59 2 of erosive events selected max p pre burst 10 6 mm at masse 74 7 of erosive events selected and 15 0 mm at sparacia 73 5 of erosive events selected and p max burst 7 6 mm at masse 65 2 of erosive events selected and 11 0 mm at sparacia 44 9 of erosive events selected in addition other effective criteria were i60 7 2 mm h at masse 58 9 of erosive events selected and e 3 8 mj ha 1 at sparacia 46 9 of erosive events selected for values of incorrect selections higher than 30 other criteria were able to select a higher number of erosive events at masse the criterion pe 10 2 mm with reinominal 10 allowed us to identify 136 out of 158 i e 86 1 erosive events the compound criteria p max burst 7 6 mm or max p pre run 5 8 mm and e 2 4 mj ha 1 or pe 10 2 mm had similar performances increasing the number of incorrectly selected events up to 62 the variables max p pre run and max p pre burst used as the first variable of the compound criteria allowed us to identify as much as 150 out of 158 95 events at sparacia the most effective compound criterion for selecting erosive events max p pre burst 15 mm or n run 2 was able to identify 81 out of 98 83 erosive events the compound criterion pe 18 8 mm or n run 2 gave a similar performance with 75 erosive events selected out of 98 increasing the number of incorrectly selected events up to 50 n run max p pre burst and max d burst used as the first variable of the compound criteria allowed the selection of 96 out of 98 98 erosive events at masse the compound criterion pe 12 7 mm or i15 6 35 mm proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 distinguished 118 out of 158 74 6 erosive events with an rei value of around 5 the validity of this criterion was confirmed by its ability to obtain both a relatively high number of selected erosive events and a low number of selection errors at sparacia as well the criterion proposed by wischmeier and smith 1978 allowed us to select a high number of erosive events 88 out of 98 i e 90 and to obtain a low number of selection errors although a high rei value of 20 was obtained in this case with reference to the practical thresholds to detect rill rainfalls the results for the masse station must be considered as preliminary results because of the small sample size of rill events the best criteria for distinguishing rill events were ie 8 9 mm h 52 9 of rill events selected for sparacia and p max burst 33 6 mm 37 5 of rill events selected for masse the two most effective criteria valid for both stations were re 359 4 mj mm ha 1 h 1 25 of rill events selected for masse and 202 0 mj mm ha 1 h 1 35 3 of rill events selected for sparacia and p run 19 9 mm 12 5 of rill events selected for masse and 14 0 mm 41 2 of rill events selected for sparacia the best criteria for distinguishing rill events obtained by imposing reinominal 10 were ie wet 15 mm 58 8 of rill events selected for sparacia and p max burst 33 6 mm or i10 74 4 mm h with 50 of rill events selected for masse the present analysis mainly highlighted two considerable aspects of the problem concerning the detection of erosive rill events by using the hyetograph alone the first aspect is that the choice of the selective criterion depends on the desired accuracy in the estimation of the long term erosivity but also on the number of selection errors compatible with the purpose of the analysis to be carried out the second aspect concerns the noticeable effectiveness of the selection criteria based on variables describing the rainfall pattern i e the burst variables this result highlights the importance for the occurrence of an erosive event not only of the rain shower characteristics but also of the cumulative rain fallen before a rain shower or a high intensity rainfall period therefore they could be used in soil erosion models as a proxy of variables more rarely available and or more difficult to measure such as soil moisture and surface runoff which are strongly affected by this cumulative rainfall lastly thresholds to distinguish erosive and non erosive events at masse station were generally lower than those obtained at sparacia in agreement with the circumstance that soil erodibility at masse is higher than at sparacia for small events thresholds to select rill events at the masse station were generally higher than those obtained at sparacia and this result could be explained by the lower plot steepness and soil erodibility related to severe events the differences between the threshold values here determined for the two italian sites and available in the literature for different parts of the world emphasize that they are geographically dependent this dependence may be also explained by different soil characteristics despite these differences the construction of a set of variables usable at different sites does appear possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
