14120,worldwide the removal of organic effluent dyes from domestic water is of high need due to the lesser availability of drinking water in the present work we reported on the synthesis of partially exfoliated graphite from corn cob and its ability to adsorb halogenated organic dyes the synthesis of partially exfoliated graphene peg showed the ability to adsorb the organic dyes at a quick time of about 5 s even without any additional mechanical and radiation requirements the adsorptive behavior of partially exfoliated graphite was conducted in an ambient condition in the presence of halogenated organic dyes such as methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb as the adsorbate model from the uv vis absorption studies it was observed that 1 mg of this sample had the efficiency to adsorb 0 1 mg ml of mb and 0 01 mg ml of rhb with the adsorption efficacy of 45 and 75 respectively the adsorption performance was well fitted with non linear gaussian regression plot for mb r2 0 9841 and rhb r2 0 7781 the photoluminescence studies also show that decreases in the intensity from the initial concentration of the mb and rhb dyes the deconvoluted photoluminescence spectrum for both mb and rh b showed peak broadening with peak shift for mb and the merged peaks for rh b the results suggested that the partially exfoliated graphite can be utilized as an efficient low cost recyclable adsorbate for organic dye domestic effluent at low cost and also at a sustainable way the partially exfoliated graphite also observed the possibility of hydrogen evolution reaction and opens the option of metal doping for futuristic applications keywords corn cob partially exfoliated graphite adsorption methylene blue rhodamine b hydrogen evolution reaction 1 introduction organic dyes are widely used in the industries of pharmaceuticals food paper and pulp manufacturing additives for plastics dyeing of cloth leather treatment and printing industries during dying process a large amount of dye has been mixed as effluent in domestic water bodies 1 4 this caused lot of health issues such as skin irritation contact dermatitis permanent blindness acute tubular necrosis supervene vomiting gastritis hypertension vertigo and respiratory distress 5 some of these dyes are highly toxic to the environment as these highly concentrated colored dyes can inhibit the penetration of sunlight and oxygen this in turn alter the chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod values essential for aquatic life 6 in 2012 rio earth summit the topic of scarcity of non contaminated water and growing need of drinking water was taken as one of the main issue need to be addressed at the earliest 7 8 worldwide nearly 800 000 tons dyes were produced per year and out of this about 10 15 dyes are lost during processing in textile industry 9 removal of these kind of halogenated and non halogenated dyes from industrial wastewater is very essential but in most of the cases without neutralization it is often coming out in the form of an effluent and mixed with domestic water 10 11 hence it is a very essential point to consider this issue from an environmental and economical concern there are several approaches such as photocatalysis 12 thermal treatments and particulate based filtration adsorption 13 etc that led to eliminate these dyes mixing in domestic water 14 among these adsorption is the versatile efficient and cost effective methods for removal of these dyes from the wastewater effluents 15 17 the dyes adsorbed by adsorption techniques also have the possibility to recycle and reuse for future applications in general most of the dyes are man made organic chemical contaminants 18 which includes halogenated non halogenated and pharmaceutical contaminants the percentage of halogenated contaminants e g crystal violet eosin methylene blue safranin rhodamine b etc in textile effluents is higher compare to non halogenated and pharmaceutical contaminants 19 24 conventionally activated carbons are used for water purification for the particles in the range of 1 mm carbon based materials such as graphite graphene graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes are widely used in water purification due to its high surface area ease of chemical or physical modification excellent capacity for microbial disinfection and removal of both organic and inorganic contaminants 19 20 25 28 among these carbons based materials biomass derived graphene materials for removal of organic contaminants is less examined 29 30 some of the earlier reports on biomass include activated carbon production from corn cob 31 coconut shell coir 32 rice husk 33 34 and wheat bran 35 36 used as sorbents for removal of water contaminates the utilization of graphene based compounds from biomass paves a way to remove or denatures the particular contaminate at a cost effective technique 37 39 even though lot of literature are reported on graphene oxide synthesized from graphite source for removal of contaminated dyes 40 44 very less paper has reported on the property of partially exfoliated graphite peg partially exfoliated graphite can be synthesized at lesser cost lesser time and at higher yield compare to graphene oxide which needs additional reducing conditions herein we exemplified the possibilities of deriving partially exfoliated graphite corn cob worldwide each year more than 14 million metric tons of corn has been produced and the cob however it has been widely used for livestock with a limited application as manure and toilet papers after chemical modifications the peg obtained from corn cob has been employed to examine as a low cost absorbent for the removal of halogenated contaminant dye such as methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb 2 experimental techniques 2 1 synthesis of partially exfoliated graphite all the chemicals were purchased as an analytical grade and used without further purification in house prepared biochar of corn cob is used as source for synthesis of peg hydrochloric acid a r grade sulfuric acid a r grade nitric acid 69 orthophosphoric acid 88 hydrogen peroxide 30 and potassium permanganate 98 5 were procured from merck u s a corn was collected from the farming land of thiruvannamalai in india and was dried under sunlight once the kernels were dried it was removed and the corn cob was sliced into thin pieces and washed with double distilled water to eliminate the adhered particulates dried corn shell of 35 g was sliced and washed thrice with double distilled to remove the impurities later it was dried overnight at 100 c to remove the moisture and utilized to prepare graphite with a yielded of about 6 g in details the washed and dried corn cob was pyrolized at 900ºc for three hours in the presence of n2 ar atmospheric to eliminate any organic polymers and the resultant will be the graphite biochar fig 1 a 45 this graphite was used for synthesis of peg by improved hummers method 46 100 mg graphite was taken in 10 ml of 1 m hno3 at 75 c and stirred for 1 h the above mixture was then kept in an ice bath maintained at 10 c followed slow addition of 0 3 g of kmno4and 12 ml of h2so4 and this oxidizing reaction was allowed to happen for 30 min later 130 ml of h3po4 was added and maintained at the temperature of 60 c for 24 h this reaction was completed with addition of 100 ml of h2o2 quenching agent the resultant peg was washed with concentrated hcl to remove any unreacted compounds and wash with water until it reaches the ph 7 and dried at 120 c for 24 h the peg produced by this method has 75 yield percentage which is very high compare to other chemical method of preparing graphene oxide other important advantages of this method are simple protocol reduction of evolution of toxic gases during reaction and can able to synthesis at the commercial scale fig 1 b shows a schematic representation of synthesis of partially exfoliated graphite from biochar 2 2 characterization techniques raman spectroscopy labram laser wavelength 633 nm france was used to measure the formation of graphite and partially exfoliated graphite ftir spectra were recorded using ftir spectroscopy jasco ft ir 6600 u s a in between 4000 to 400 cm 1 to confirm the functional groups in the graphite and partially exfoliated graphene oxide the morphology of the samples was observed using scanning electron microscopy hitachi n3400 singapore prior to sem analysis the surface was coated with gold using ion sputtering technique about 7 s in order to obtain a secondary electron signal photoluminescence analysis was carried out using molecular devices spetramax equipment and the pl spectra were deconvoluted using fityk software electrocatalytic studies were carried out using cyclic voltammetry biologic instrument sp 300 france 2 3 dye adsorption experiments adsorption studies for both methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb dye were carried out by the addition of 1 mg of partially exfoliated graphene oxide to 2 ml of different concentration of dyes the concentration of mb dyes was prepared with two different concentrations one is1 mg of dye in 10 ml of double distilled water and another in 5 mg of dye and rhodamine b in 500 ml of double distilled water for rhodamine b 5 mg dye was dissolved in 500 ml of double distilled water the concentrations of dyes were measured using uv vis spectroscopy at the wavelength of maximum absorbance intensity the adsorption efficiency of the dye was calculated by the following equation 47 48 a d s o r p t i o n e f f i c i e n c y r c o c c o 100 where co and c denotes that the initial before adsorption and final after adsorption concentration of dyes in mg l 1 respectively 2 4 her activity studies to study on electrocatalysts the sample ink was prepared in the ratio of 1 1 1 water isopropyl alcohol nafion and then it was sonicated for 3 h from this 100 μl of prepared solution was added to prepare slurry into the presence of 5 mg of catalyst which was again sonicated for 30 min the prepared catalyst ink was then coated on the gce and followed by that the modified electrode was allowed to dry it at room temperature all the experiments were studied on the gce in the presence of 1 m of h2so4 solution using standard three electrode system at a slow scan rate 5 mv s 1 49 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural analysis raman spectroscopy is a sensitive fingerprint technique for the analysis of carbon and its derivate fig 2 a shows the raman spectrum of graphite and peg the characteristic d and g bands for graphite are at 1324 cm 1 and 1597 cm 1 and for peg the peaks are at 1340 cm 1 and 1593 cm 1 respectively the characteristic d band is attributed to the distortion of carbon structure or defect in layered graphite and the g band corresponds to ordered graphite layers the relative raman intensity id ig ratio for graphite and peg are 1 2 higher disorder defect density and 0 9 respectively this indicates that compare to graphite peg has graphitic nano sheets with increase in magnitude of graphitization by removal of functional group by exfoliation 50 51 the typical xrd spectrum of graphite and peg is shown in fig 2 b which indicates that graphite and peg consists of microcrystalline graphite with hexagonal structure jcpds 656212 it could be clearly shown there is two broad peaks at 21 8 and 43 7 for graphite and 23 7 and 42 3 for peg corresponding to 002 and 100 planes of graphene respectively 52 there is a shift in the 002 plane peak around 2 towards higher degree depicts that compare to graphite the exfoliated peg shows well arranged planner arrangement due to chemical and thermal treatments the graphite peak is also showing lesser intensity compare to peg and shows similar peak as graphene due to the production of graphite from the biomass fig 2 c represents the ftir spectrum of raw corn cob graphite and peg the raw corn cob spectrum has the band around 1628 cm 1 corresponds to the cellulose functional group the next band approximately at 1601 cm 1 1523 cm 1 and 1433 cm 1 refers to the aromatic skeletal vibration of lignin followed by the band around 1322 cm 1 1245 cm 1 1154 cm 1 and 1032 cm 1 are the evidences of hemicellulose the recorded band at 890 cm 1 corresponds to the β 1 4 glycosidic bands between the xylose units in the hemicellulose 45 53 the obtained graphite spectra possess quite a broad band around 1032 cm 1 to 1536 cm 1 is difficult to assign owing to several superimposed peaks the smaller peak at 1685 cm 1 is attributed to co vibration corresponds to the carbonyls and carboxylic group the synthesized peg has higher intense peak around 1708 cm 1 and 1582 cm 1 compared with graphite which is evidences the presence of higher oxygen functional groups the peak at 1572 cm 1 and 1712 cm 1 are attributed to cc stretches with highly conjugated carboxyl groups and co stretching with conjugated aromatics respectively 45 54 3 2 morphological studies the sem images of the raw corn graphite and partially exfoliated graphite is given in fig 3 the magnified surface of raw corn cob fig 3a shows wrinkled double gauze like structure the thermal treated graphite surface has a porous structure fig 3b these porous structures were formed due to the evaporation of cellulose which was confirmed from ftir and the breaking of carbon carbon bond between the cellulose structures during pyrolysis fig 3c confirms the formation of peg from graphite biochar from the repetitious wrinkles on the surface the elemental composition was confirmed from edax spectrum 3 e f which indicates that there exists only carbon in graphite and carbon with oxygen in peg 3 3 dye adsorption studies 3 3 1 adsorption of methylene blue dye the adsorption of organic dye in the presence of peg at various concentrations at room temperature was observed and given in fig 4 in this work adsorbent peg quantity was fixed as 1 mg 2 ml and the concentration of dyes methylene blue and rhodamine b were varied generally 10 mg 1 l i e 0 02 mg 2 ml concentration of dye was used in most of the literature for dye degradation studies 55 58 the measured quantity of the dye was added in the presence of peg and the uv spectra were observed at ambient condition at lower concentration there was visible absorption of dye with in few seconds 5 s and each reading with respect to the increasing in concentration was recorded and shown in fig 4a and c in order to compare our adsorption results with the degradation results of above mentioned concentration adsorption gradient studies with fixed adsorbate peg has been studied and given in fig 4a the calculated adsorption efficacy for the standard dye concentration 10 mg 1 l was found to be around 82 fig 4b which is very high compare to the photocatalytic based degradation studies 59 61 that too within quick adsorption time and without any external photon thermal activation in order to observe the maximum adsorption efficacy of peg the concentration was increased 10 times from 0 04 mg 2 mlto 0 19 mg 2 ml and its absorbance spectra fig 4c was observed and its respective adsorption efficacy fig 4d has been calculated even for higher concentration for 0 19 mg 2 ml the adsorption efficacy was found to be 35 which is very much higher compare to the earlier reports 59 61 at higher concentration the adsorption percentage reaches saturated due to accumulation of active sites in peg by methylene blue dye 3 3 2 adsorption of rhodamine b similar to adsorption studies of low concentration of mb with peg rhb was taken at the standard concentration of 10 mg 1 l i e 0 02 mg 2 ml shown in fig 5 the adsorption of rh b also occurred at quick time in ambient condition fig 5a however the adsorption percentage is lesser compare to mb the maximum adsorption percentage for 0 02 mg 2 ml is 74 with the maximum adsorption percentage reaches around 80 for low concentration of dyes shown in fig 5b even though the difference in the adsorption activity between these two dyes is only around 1 1 this small difference could be due to the interaction of the dyes with the peg active sites 3 3 3 photoluminescence studies of peg with organic dyes the photoluminescence emission spectra of mb dye 0 02 mg 2 ml mb dye 0 02 mg 2 ml with peg and mb dye 0 19 mg 2 ml excited at λ 625 nm is given in fig 6 the emission spectra were observed to be at 695 nm and 705 nm for pure mb and higher concentration of mb with peg respectively there is feeble emission peak for lower concentration mb is observed compare to pure and higher concentration of mb with peg further the deconvolution photoluminescence emission spectra of mb and mb higher conc with peg has shown two peaks with the χ2 1 for mb the maximum energy of the fitted peaks is at the region of 1 74 ev and 1 79 ev for mb with peg the peak values are at 1 73 ev and 1 78 ev this shows that the peaks are narrowed at higher concentration with shift in the energy level the photoluminescence emission spectra of rh b and rh b with peg excitation at λ 520nmis given in fig 7 the decreases in the emission intensity of rhb in presence of peg can be easily compared that of the earlier adsorption studies the deconvoluted spectra of pure rh b consist of seven peaks whereas for rh b with peg it shows only three peaks with the maximum energy at 2 15 ev 2 06 ev and 1 95 ev the decrease in the number of peaks may be due to the merging of peaks at lower intensity with peak broadening compare to the pure dye 3 3 4 ftir analysis of organic dye with peg fig 8 a shows the ftir spectrum of mb dye and mb with peg for pure mb the band around 2809 cm 1 and 2715 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of ch aromatic and ch3 methyl group respectively further the band at 1607 cm 1 to 1351 cm 1 attributed to the aromatic ring stretching in mb and the band corresponding to the cc skeleton of the aromatic ring were obtained at 1171 cm 1 62 for rh b the bands at 1594 cm 1 1414 cm 1 1395 cm 1 and 928 cm 1 confirms the presences of cc aromatic ch3 cn and ch aromatic vibrations respectively the absorption band around 1740 cm 1 and 1054 cm 1 ascribed to antisymmetric vibrations of carboxylic cooh group and stretching vibrations of oxygen contain alkoxy co group respectively is given in fig 8b 47 after adsorption of both the dyes by peg there is no variation in the band position of the dye molecule which confirms that the molecule does not degrade in the presence of peg and which can be utilized for further recycling process 3 4 hydrogen evaluation studies her the her catalytic studies carried out for the graphite and partially exfoliated graphite is shown in the fig 9 the lsv curves fig 9a of graphite and peg showed an onset potential of 0 44 v and 0 59 v respectively the comparison of her activity with earlier reports is given in table 1 the possible hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism is a combination of the following reactions as follows reaction mechanism i volmer reaction h3o e hads h2o heyrovsky reaction hads h3o h2 h2o reaction mechanism ii tafel reaction hads hads h2 the fitted tafel plot of graphite and peg with the tafel equation n a b log j where a is the constant b is the tafel slope and j is the current density is given in fig 9b the obtained tafel slopes are296 mv dec and 153 mv dec for the graphite and peg respectively from this the calculated over potential was 482 mv and 269 mv for the graphite and peg respectively hence from these results it is observed that peg samples have faster catalytic rate and evidenced for higher her activity compared to graphite during the electrochemical performance in peg owing to the nano regime size effect it provides higher active surface sites and hence there is an occurrence of unexpectedly continuous hydrogen evolution reaction 26 4 conclusion this work explores the new possibilities of low cost partially exfoliated graphite prepared from biomass corncob using improved hummers method at a higher yield the prepared partially exfoliated graphite also showed a potential ability as a cost effective adsorbent for the removal of halogenated organic dyes from domestic effluents without additional radiation the prepared peg adsorbent showed the excellent adsorbate efficiency of both dyes in water even in at higher concentration from the ftir results it was concluded that the dye was absorbed without any functional damage and hence opens the venture for the further extraction of dye from peg by proper chemical methods and can reuse for useful applications the photoluminescence studies of dye and dye with adsorbate was observed with respect to energy variation for the first time the prepared peg also opens the other possibility of utilizing as hydrogen generation by suitable combination with metal ions in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper

concentration was increased 10 times from 0 04 mg 2 mlto 0 19 mg 2 ml and its absorbance spectra fig 4c was observed and its respective adsorption efficacy fig 4d has been calculated even for higher concentration for 0 19 mg 2 ml the adsorption efficacy was found to be 35 which is very much higher compare to the earlier reports 59 61 at higher concentration the adsorption percentage reaches saturated due to accumulation of active sites in peg by methylene blue dye 3 3 2 adsorption of rhodamine b similar to adsorption studies of low concentration of mb with peg rhb was taken at the standard concentration of 10 mg 1 l i e 0 02 mg 2 ml shown in fig 5 the adsorption of rh b also occurred at quick time in ambient condition fig 5a however the adsorption percentage is lesser compare to mb the maximum adsorption percentage for 0 02 mg 2 ml is 74 with the maximum adsorption percentage reaches around 80 for low concentration of dyes shown in fig 5b even though the difference in the adsorption activity between these two dyes is only around 1 1 this small difference could be due to the interaction of the dyes with the peg active sites 3 3 3 photoluminescence studies of peg with organic dyes the photoluminescence emission spectra of mb dye 0 02 mg 2 ml mb dye 0 02 mg 2 ml with peg and mb dye 0 19 mg 2 ml excited at λ 625 nm is given in fig 6 the emission spectra were observed to be at 695 nm and 705 nm for pure mb and higher concentration of mb with peg respectively there is feeble emission peak for lower concentration mb is observed compare to pure and higher concentration of mb with peg further the deconvolution photoluminescence emission spectra of mb and mb higher conc with peg has shown two peaks with the χ2 1 for mb the maximum energy of the fitted peaks is at the region of 1 74 ev and 1 79 ev for mb with peg the peak values are at 1 73 ev and 1 78 ev this shows that the peaks are narrowed at higher concentration with shift in the energy level the photoluminescence emission spectra of rh b and rh b with peg excitation at λ 520nmis given in fig 7 the decreases in the emission intensity of rhb in presence of peg can be easily compared that of the earlier adsorption studies the deconvoluted spectra of pure rh b consist of seven peaks whereas for rh b with peg it shows only three peaks with the maximum energy at 2 15 ev 2 06 ev and 1 95 ev the decrease in the number of peaks may be due to the merging of peaks at lower intensity with peak broadening compare to the pure dye 3 3 4 ftir analysis of organic dye with peg fig 8 a shows the ftir spectrum of mb dye and mb with peg for pure mb the band around 2809 cm 1 and 2715 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of ch aromatic and ch3 methyl group respectively further the band at 1607 cm 1 to 1351 cm 1 attributed to the aromatic ring stretching in mb and the band corresponding to the cc skeleton of the aromatic ring were obtained at 1171 cm 1 62 for rh b the bands at 1594 cm 1 1414 cm 1 1395 cm 1 and 928 cm 1 confirms the presences of cc aromatic ch3 cn and ch aromatic vibrations respectively the absorption band around 1740 cm 1 and 1054 cm 1 ascribed to antisymmetric vibrations of carboxylic cooh group and stretching vibrations of oxygen contain alkoxy co group respectively is given in fig 8b 47 after adsorption of both the dyes by peg there is no variation in the band position of the dye molecule which confirms that the molecule does not degrade in the presence of peg and which can be utilized for further recycling process 3 4 hydrogen evaluation studies her the her catalytic studies carried out for the graphite and partially exfoliated graphite is shown in the fig 9 the lsv curves fig 9a of graphite and peg showed an onset potential of 0 44 v and 0 59 v respectively the comparison of her activity with earlier reports is given in table 1 the possible hydrogen evolution reaction mechanism is a combination of the following reactions as follows reaction mechanism i volmer reaction h3o e hads h2o heyrovsky reaction hads h3o h2 h2o reaction mechanism ii tafel reaction hads hads h2 the fitted tafel plot of graphite and peg with the tafel equation n a b log j where a is the constant b is the tafel slope and j is the current density is given in fig 9b the obtained tafel slopes are296 mv dec and 153 mv dec for the graphite and peg respectively from this the calculated over potential was 482 mv and 269 mv for the graphite and peg respectively hence from these results it is observed that peg samples have faster catalytic rate and evidenced for higher her activity compared to graphite during the electrochemical performance in peg owing to the nano regime size effect it provides higher active surface sites and hence there is an occurrence of unexpectedly continuous hydrogen evolution reaction 26 4 conclusion this work explores the new possibilities of low cost partially exfoliated graphite prepared from biomass corncob using improved hummers method at a higher yield the prepared partially exfoliated graphite also showed a potential ability as a cost effective adsorbent for the removal of halogenated organic dyes from domestic effluents without additional radiation the prepared peg adsorbent showed the excellent adsorbate efficiency of both dyes in water even in at higher concentration from the ftir results it was concluded that the dye was absorbed without any functional damage and hence opens the venture for the further extraction of dye from peg by proper chemical methods and can reuse for useful applications the photoluminescence studies of dye and dye with adsorbate was observed with respect to energy variation for the first time the prepared peg also opens the other possibility of utilizing as hydrogen generation by suitable combination with metal ions in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper

14121,this study was conducted to investigate the enhanced sono photo fenton like process spfp in the presence of persulfate as a method of advanced oxidation processes aops to generate oxidative radicals o2 oh so4 for the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions the removal performance of chromium and phenol by uv alone uv h2o2 uh uv h2o2 fe0 uhf uv h2o2 fe0 s2o8 uhfs and uv h2o2 fe0 s2o8 us uhfsu were estimated 12 5 6 5 35 1 31 52 5 66 1 74 9 79 1 and 100 100 respectively under selected conditions phenol chromium molar ratio 2 0 ph 3 0 h2o2 fe0 molar ratio 2

than that of the uv alone uh uhf and uhfs respectively the study of the energy consumption for the various processes indicated the uhfsu process compared with other processes has very low energy consumption kwh m 3 which proves the process justification economically the addition of the various scavengers ammonium oxalate 2 propanol and tert butanol was diminished the removal performance it clearly proved oxidative radicals o2 oh so4 plays a noticeable role in the removal of chromium and phenol keywords sono photo fenton like persulfate wastewater energy consumption kinetic 1 introduction heavy metals such as cr vi and refractory organic matter like phenol are commonly detected in industrial wastewater such as leather tanning textiles wood preservation electroplating car manufacturing petroleum refining and pharmaceuticals industries 1 entering these pollutants into aquatic environments without treatment with suitable methods cause serious aesthetic and pollution problems which will pose serious risks to the environment due to toxicity persistence as well as bioaccumulation phenolic compounds considered as a group of toxic priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency epa and the national pollutant release inventory npri of canada 2 cr vi species are known highly toxic carcinogenic and high environmental mobility that can be converted to the less mobile and less toxic cr iii 3 5 at present coexistence of organic pollutants and heavy metals in aquatic environments has been reported 6 7 in recent years the simultaneous removal of co existing multiple pollutants from contaminated waters have been received significant attention 8 9 advanced oxidation processes aops are one of the most effective and environmentally friendly processes that can improve the degradation mineralization efficiency of contaminants due to high performance toxicity reduction lack of selectivity and increasing biodegradability 10 11 photocatalytic technologies have also created great interest for the purification of contaminated water due to its ability to mineralize most of organic pollutants by using luminous energy 12 14 heterogeneous catalytic techniques hcts have been examined by researchers but some of the specific disadvantages including long retention time and higher electric energy consumption the need for excess catalyst 15 16 and oxidant and etc have limited their potential in factual systems thus for overcoming these limitations production of more radicals and faster degradation attaining better efficiencies should be noted 17 20 researchers have been successfully used a broad range of coupling methods such as ultraviolet uv light heat ultrasound us irradiation and electric current in the removal of pollutants 21 22 amongst these processes hcts systems coupled to uv light and us can be a good choice to the destruction of pollutants 23 ultrasound and uv irradiation processes are mainly responsible for the activation decomposition of oxidant 24 25 the use of ultrasound irradiation sonolysis for the degradation of pollutant is based on the formation of short lived radical species generated in violent cavitational bubble collapses these radicals can diffuse out of the bubble into the bulk fluid medium where they would react with solute molecules 26 27 to enhance degradation rate of target pollutants two oxidants including peroxide hydrogen h2o2 and persulfate ps s2o8 2 were chosen which expected to enhance generation rate of reactive species in system and consequently further degradation of pollutants 24 28 hereon oxidants decomposition due to ultrasound us and ultraviolet uv irradiations eq 1 29 and also occurrence of the reaction between oxidants and transition metal ions eqs 2 and 3 have been proposed as key routes to form further free radicals 30 1 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 u v o r u s o h s o 4 2 2 f e 0 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 2 c r 3 2 f e 2 7 h 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 o h s o 4 sulfate free radicals so4 e0 2 60 v are very strong oxidizing agents with a high solubility and wide operative ph range these radicals can be generated from persulfate ps and are an effective way for degradation of toxic resistant and non biodegradable contaminants 31 32 for activation of persulfate and increase its oxidation potential there are several ways like ultraviolet light irradiation microwave heat transition metal and etc 32 also in recent decades nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi owing to its advantages such as large specific surface area high reactivity high reductive capacity to reduce and stabilize different types of pollutants has been considered 33 these particles can be dispersed in aqueous slurries as stable suspensions for a time sufficient and thus directly injected into contaminated areas 34 with above background in this research we focused on combination of uv and us irradiations with a heterogeneous catalytic system for simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the prepared nano zero valent iron nzvi used in this study was purchased from us research nanomaterials us nano inc potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 potassium persulfate k2s2o8 and other chemicals obtained from the merck company germany all chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification all solutions were prepared with double distilled water 2 2 sono photo reactor a photoreactor equipped with a uvc lamp 11 w power and 254 nm wavelength and a quartz sleeve enclosure placed at the center of the reactor was applied to do the tests the intensity of the uv light radiation was measured by the uvc 512 light meter the reaction vessel photoreactor was placed in an ultrasound bath at a frequency of 35 khz and the output power was set between 60 and 960 w a water jacket water circulation was applied to prevention from the temperature influence on the process performance schematic view of the photoreactor placed in an ultrasound bath portrayed in fig 1 2 3 analytical methods and performance indices concentration of cr vi was analyzed using a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide dpc colorimetric method a uv vis spectrophotometer spectrophotometer hach was used for measurements of absorbance at 540 nm in acidic solution phenol concentration was measured by spectrophotometer at 510 nm by the 4 aminoantipyrine method the reactor was covered with a black cloth to prevent from any unnecessary light exposure the extent of removal performance was monitored by determining the residual concentration of phenol and cr vi based on standard methods to quantify the determined extent eq 4 was applied 4 the removal performance percentage of phenol and cr vi c0 ct c0 where c0 and ct refer to the initial concentration of phenol and cr vi mg l 1 and its concentration at time t respectively a pseudo first order kinetic due to being impossible determination of the photogenerated oxidative species in the solution was applied as a good indicator to evaluate the removal performance of phenol and cr vi by spfp eqs 5 7 5 d c pollutant dt k c pollutant c rs 6 c t c 0 e k obs t 7 r obs k obs c pollutant here kobs min 1 crs and robs mg l 1 min are the second order rate constant concentration of reactive species in the solution and the observed rate of phenol and cr vi removal by the spfp respectively also c0 and ct are influent and effluent concentrations of phenol and cr vi in the reactor respectively 2 4 experimental procedure in a typical procedure all batch experiments were done in duplicate in 300 ml batch reactor containing 150 ml solution of cr vi and phenol with molar ratios of phenol cr vi 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 then ph 3 11 was adjusted to adjust ph levels 0 1 m hcl and naoh solutions were used and subsequently h2o2 fe0 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 and s2o8 0 25 1 mm were added to the solution then solution was exposed to and radiations for a preset time the spfp process initiated by switching on the power supply uv 253 7 nm and us 35 khz next the reactor was mixed with a shaker with a rotation speed of 150 rpm at atmospheric pressure for a preset time finally a sample was taken from the solution centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the particles and analyzed by spectrophotometer also for comparison control experiments were done for uv alone uh uhf uhfs and uhfsu under similar conditions the quenching experimental quenchers of the oxidative agents including ammonium oxalate 2 propanol and tert butanol were done in order to investigate of the involvement of each specific reactive agent in the removal of cr vi and phenol and results were compared with condition without quencher 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency in order to compare the efficiency of different processes in simultaneous reduction of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions the rate of simultaneous removal of these pollutants from aqueous solutions by uv alone uh uhf uhfs and uhfsu was investigated and the results are portrayed in fig 2 in this comparison the performance of different processes in the simultaneous removal of two pollutants with a phenol cr vi molar ratio of 2 1 within 1 80 min and under the same conditions ph 3 0 h2o2 fe0 molar ratio 2 and s2o8 0 75 mm l 1 was investigated as shown in fig 2 uhfsu process with removal performance of cr vi and phenol of 100 and 100 respectively showed higher performance than the other processes within 4 min as the removal performances of cr vi and phenol for uv alone uh uhf and uhfs were 12 5 and 6 5 35 1 and 31 52 5 and 66 1 and 74 9 79 1 at the same time respectively the very low performance of processes in the absence of us can be due to two reasons 1 very low generation rate of free radicals in the absence of us 2 reduction of synergistic effect uv light coupled with us in the absence of us 35 the little removal performance of the only uv can be because of low cr vi and phenol inclination in uv absorption with wavelength 254 3 nm 36 kinetic studies were also performed to compare the efficiency of different processes and the kinetic information was tabulated in tables 1a and 1b according to tables 1a and 1b the kinetic information obtained also proves the superiority of uhfsu process than other processes 37 38 values of robs for uhfsu in the removal of cr vi and phenol were 11 7 and 9 87 mg l 1 min respectively so that value of robs for uhfsu process in the removal of cr vi and phenol was 14 62 30 84 10 4 7 67 2 47 and 3 2 1 3 times than that of the uv alone uh uhf and uhfs respectively the presented results in above indicate that among the tested techniques the uhfsu treatment due to the very high generation rate of free radicals the higher values of kobs and robs and also very low energy consumption 1 39 which is economically justified complete removal of pollutants in less time is the most appropriate method for simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions 3 2 role of ph in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu the batch experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the influence of ph in the over range from 3 0 11 on the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol phenol cr vi molar ratio 2 1 by uhfsu from aqueous solutions and results were presented in fig 3 as seen in fig 3 ph is one of the decisive factors on the uhfsu performance 24 40 41 as the complete removal of chromium and phenol was obtained in acidic ph after 4 min of reaction increase of ph from 4 0 11 resulted to decrease by 15 in the removal efficiency of cr vi although was no observed significant difference between acidic and alkaline conditions for the removal phenol by the uhfsu it reveals the uhfsu process has the better performance in the acidic condition it is well known influence of ph in controlling the catalytic activity stability of h2o2 and activity of iron species 42 43 as the previous conducted researches 43 44 in the acidic ph ferrous ions are produced from reaction between zero valent iron and h2o2 as the following equation 8 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o the ferrous ions produced can react with h2o2 s2o8 as eq 3 and resulted to generation of oh so 4 radicals thus the availability of the free radicals for the degradation of the pollutants is enhanced also in the acidic ph zero valent iron can reduces cr2o7 2 to cr3 as eq 2 and produced ferrous ions that in turn can reacts withh2o2 s2o8 as eq 3 24 45 with increase of ph above 5 the ferrous ions produced in the eqs 2 and 4 react with h2o2and is resulted to production of weaker oxidants such as ferryl ions e g feo2 as eq 9 that are more selective than oh so4 radicals 9 f e 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv e g fe o 2 h 2 o also decrease in oxidation performance of uhfsu in the ph above 5 can be related to decomposition of h2o2 and the deactivation of catalyst due to the precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide the formationof precipitates of fe oh 2 s and fe oh 3 s in the acidic condition so4 could be formed during the catalyzation and accelerate the removal of pollutants at the lower ph through the reaction between hydrogen ions and copper fe is generated as eq 10 that in turn reacts with s2o8 for production of so4 radicals as eq 11 24 10 2f e 0 2 h 2 2f e h 2 11 2f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 2 f e 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 3 3 role of h2o2 fe0 molar ratio in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu as it can be seen from fig 4 by increasing the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio from 0 5 to 2 0 in constant condition phenol cr vi molar ratio 2 1 ph 3 0 s2o8 0 75 mm l 1 time 1 4 min the simultaneous removal percentage of cr vi and phenol by uhfsu because of the produced more oh radicals based on the following equations eqs 12 15 46 was enhanced as the complete removal of the both cr vi and phenol pollutants were achieved in the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio of 2 0 so the efficiency was improved 47 48 12 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o h o h f e 3 13 o h f e 2 o h f e 3 feo h 2 14 h 2 o 2 2 o h 15 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h however by increasing the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio more than the optimum value from 2 to 4 the progress in the removal performance was not notable or even it was decreased because in the extra concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 acts as the consumer of hydroxyl radical the hydrogen peroxide acts as free radical scavenger and produces hydroperoxyl radicals ho 2 according to the following reaction eq 16 that have a less oxidizing ability 45 49 50 16 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o in addition due to the completely dependence of produced hydroxyl ions to the molar proportion of h2o2 fe0 so increase of h2o2 more than the optimum value leads to the auto decomposition of h2o2to water and oxygen as eqs 17 and 18 so h2o2 should be added at an optimum amount 17 h 2 o 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 18 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 many studies show that by increasing the iron concentration the rate of removal of pollutants due to reaction between fe2 with h2o2 and formation of more hydroxyl radicals is increased eq 8 thus an optimum value for fe0 is suggested this concentration is dependence on the molar proportion of h2o2 fe0 the reason is that in the extra values of fe0 more than the optimum value the solution was saturated with iron and thus ferrous iron reacted with hydroxyl radical and finally ferric ions was formed that in turn reacted with hydrogen peroxide and was produced ho2 with a less oxidizing ability eqs 19 and 20 11 51 52 19 f e 2 oh f e 3 o h 20 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h also it is possibility the creation of the brown turbidity in the solution at high dosages of ferrous ion that reduces the absorption of the uv light by solution resulting the recombination of oh radicals eq 16 the concentration of fe2 ions in solution was also determined using phenanthroline method according to the standard methods and it was found that during the different reaction times 93 97 of zero valent iron is converted to fe2 ions therefore it was proved the presence of fe2 ions in the solution in throughout the reaction 53 3 4 role of s2o8 concentration in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu fig 5 portraits the influence of s2o8 concentration on the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol as can be seen in fig 5 in the higher initial concentration of s2o8 removal performance increases dramatically that way with changing the initial s2o8 concentration from 0 25 mm l 1 to 0 75 mm l 1 the complete removal of cr vi and phenol was obtained within 4 min with increasing the concentration to 1 mm was no observed the significance influence in the removal performance this phenomenon can be related to the large amounts of generated radicals so4 due to a high dosage of s2o8 which was enough to complete removal of both pollutants target existing in aqueous solutions eqs 1 3 and 7 the generated radicals can be reacted with more selectively via electron transfer many studies have shown that in the excessive amounts of persulfate efficiency of the reaction will be reduced in which can be due to some reverse reactions side reactions and excessive oxidant eqs 21 24 resulting to a scavenging effect on so4 however no inhibition was observed in the present study since the oxidant dosage was below the inhibition point 54 56 21 s 2 o 8 2 o h o h s 2 o 8 22 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 23 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 24 s 2 o 8 2 2 o h 2hs o 5 3 5 role of phenol cr vi molar ratio in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu investigation of the efficiency of the process in industrial applications is an important issue inrelation to evaluate of process to this purpose the uhfsu performance was evaluated in the different phenol cr vi molar ratios 0 5 4 within 4 min fig 6 portraits the rate of the potential performance of uhfsu process in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenolin the different molar ratios as shown in fig 6 with increasing phenol cr vi molar ratio from 0 5 to 2 the removal efficiency increased as the complete removal of phenol and cr vi was observed in the phenol cr vi molar ratio of 2 after 4 min of the reaction of course complete removal of phenol was achieved at lower molar ratios but the simultaneous and complete removal of both pollutants was achieved at molar ratio 2 it was also observed that by increasing the molar ratio above 2 it caused a decrease in process performance this indicates that the phenol cr vi molar ratio in the aqueous solution plays a major role in the process efficiency 3 6 electrical energy consumption and the total cost of the system one of the important parameter that affected performance of aops processes is the amount of required electrical energy kw to diminish the content of a pollutant by 90 in 1 m3 of the contaminated solution and also the total cost of the system that is calculated by electric energy per mass removed eem in kwh kg as the following formula 1 25 e e m 38 4 p v k o b s where p is electrical power applied kw for the system uv lamp and v is the volume of pollutant in inside reactor l also eq 26 was applied to calculate the total cost of the system tcs m 3 57 58 26 tcs 1 45 e e o k w h m 3 p o w e r cos t k w h o x i d a n t cos t g 1 the values of eem and tcs for the various processes were calculated and tabulated in tables 2a and 2b as tabulated in tables 2a and 2b uhfsu process due to energy saving and the less total cost rather than other processes because of reduction of energy consumption can be a good cost effective alternative and can be more efficient process in the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol from aqueous solutions 3 7 effect of scavengers and possible degradation mechanism of uhfsu system to approve involvement of free radical species in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu various scavengers 0 1 mm including ammonium oxalate 2 propanol and tert butanol were added to the reactor and results were portrayed in fig 7 as portrayed in fig 7 upon addition of the scavengers specifically addition of tert butanol as a strong scavenger oh radical simultaneous removal performance of chromium and phenol reduced it can be concluded that process efficiency is highly dependent on the generated reaction radicals and oxidative radicals play a key role in the removal of both pollutants the reason for slightly decrease of uhfsu performance with addition of scavengers can be due to the low amount of scavengers added in solution 0 1 mm as it possibility the higher decrease of uhfsu performance in the higher amounts of scavengers 1 24 3 8 influence of humic acid and coexisting inorganic anions by introducing inorganic anions such nitrate carbonate bicarbonate sulfate chloride and fluoride in aquatic systems we could study how inorganic anions influence on the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol by uhfsu process the tap water was used to this purpose the inlet phenol cr vi molar ratio was 2 1 and reaction time set at 4 min ph 3 0 h2o2 fe0 molar ratio 2 1 the concentrations of carbonate bicarbonate nitrate sulfate chloride and fluoride at tap water analyzed according to the standard methods 53 and were determined 140 120 15 56 72 and 1 5 2 5 mg l 1 respectively as mentioned in the previous sections the removal efficiency of both phenol and chromium contaminants in distilled water and under the selected conditions was 100 the anions present in the tap water indicated the negligible influence on the reaction efficiency as removal efficiency for phenol and chromium reached from 100 at absence of anions distillated water to 96 3 and 94 8 respectively at the presence of different anions tap water however it is important to note that this slight decrease in efficiency may be due to the low amounts of anions present in the tap water and at higher levels of these anions the decrease in efficiency will be more significant the positive influence of anions present in the tap water on the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol can be explained on the basis of the salting out effect and thus the solute was pushed towards the highly reactive interface region of the cavitation bubble to facilitate the removal 1 also some humic acid 15 mg l 1 was added to the tap water and the reaction efficiency was re evaluated the reaction efficiency decreased further in the presence of humic acid and reached from 100 to 88 3 and 91 2 for chromium and phenol respectively this dramatic decrease in the removal efficiency in the presence of humic acid and anions simultaneously can be due to the complex structure of humic acid which can consumes hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals and affect the reaction efficiency 59 4 conclusion in the present study the performance of sono photo fenton like process spfp in the presence of persulfate to generate oxidative radicals o2 oh so4 for the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions the uhfsu process showed higher performance than the other processes uv alone uh uhf and uhfs within 4 min the kinetic information obtained also proves the superiority of uhfsu process than other processes it reveals the uhfsu process has the better performance in the acidic condition the complete removal of the both cr vi and phenol pollutants were achieved in the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio of 2 0 so the efficiency was improved although it is notable in the extra concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and fe0 they acts as the scavenger of hydroxyl radical it was observed 0 75 mm l 1 of s2o8was enough to complete removal of both pollutants target existing in aqueous solutions the results indicated that the phenol cr vi molar ratio in the aqueous solution plays a major role in the process efficiency as the complete removal of the both pollutants was obtained in the phenol cr vi molar ratio equal to 2 and by increasing the molar ratio above 2 it caused a decrease in process performance it was resulted uhfsu process due to energy saving and the less total cost rather than other processes because of reduction of energy consumption can be a good cost effective alternative and can be more efficient process in the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol from aqueous solutions upon addition of the scavengers simultaneous removal performance of chromium and phenol reduced it can be concluded that process efficiency is highly dependent on the generated reaction radicals and oxidative radicals play a key role in the removal of both pollutants finally it was found that the uhfsu process improved the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol from aqueous solutions authors contribution all authors have

introduction heavy metals such as cr vi and refractory organic matter like phenol are commonly detected in industrial wastewater such as leather tanning textiles wood preservation electroplating car manufacturing petroleum refining and pharmaceuticals industries 1 entering these pollutants into aquatic environments without treatment with suitable methods cause serious aesthetic and pollution problems which will pose serious risks to the environment due to toxicity persistence as well as bioaccumulation phenolic compounds considered as a group of toxic priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency epa and the national pollutant release inventory npri of canada 2 cr vi species are known highly toxic carcinogenic and high environmental mobility that can be converted to the less mobile and less toxic cr iii 3 5 at present coexistence of organic pollutants and heavy metals in aquatic environments has been reported 6 7 in recent years the simultaneous removal of co existing multiple pollutants from contaminated waters have been received significant attention 8 9 advanced oxidation processes aops are one of the most effective and environmentally friendly processes that can improve the degradation mineralization efficiency of contaminants due to high performance toxicity reduction lack of selectivity and increasing biodegradability 10 11 photocatalytic technologies have also created great interest for the purification of contaminated water due to its ability to mineralize most of organic pollutants by using luminous energy 12 14 heterogeneous catalytic techniques hcts have been examined by researchers but some of the specific disadvantages including long retention time and higher electric energy consumption the need for excess catalyst 15 16 and oxidant and etc have limited their potential in factual systems thus for overcoming these limitations production of more radicals and faster degradation attaining better efficiencies should be noted 17 20 researchers have been successfully used a broad range of coupling methods such as ultraviolet uv light heat ultrasound us irradiation and electric current in the removal of pollutants 21 22 amongst these processes hcts systems coupled to uv light and us can be a good choice to the destruction of pollutants 23 ultrasound and uv irradiation processes are mainly responsible for the activation decomposition of oxidant 24 25 the use of ultrasound irradiation sonolysis for the degradation of pollutant is based on the formation of short lived radical species generated in violent cavitational bubble collapses these radicals can diffuse out of the bubble into the bulk fluid medium where they would react with solute molecules 26 27 to enhance degradation rate of target pollutants two oxidants including peroxide hydrogen h2o2 and persulfate ps s2o8 2 were chosen which expected to enhance generation rate of reactive species in system and consequently further degradation of pollutants 24 28 hereon oxidants decomposition due to ultrasound us and ultraviolet uv irradiations eq 1 29 and also occurrence of the reaction between oxidants and transition metal ions eqs 2 and 3 have been proposed as key routes to form further free radicals 30 1 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 u v o r u s o h s o 4 2 2 f e 0 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 2 c r 3 2 f e 2 7 h 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 s 2 o 8 2 f e 2 o h s o 4 sulfate free radicals so4 e0 2 60 v are very strong oxidizing agents with a high solubility and wide operative ph range these radicals can be generated from persulfate ps and are an effective way for degradation of toxic resistant and non biodegradable contaminants 31 32 for activation of persulfate and increase its oxidation potential there are several ways like ultraviolet light irradiation microwave heat transition metal and etc 32 also in recent decades nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi owing to its advantages such as large specific surface area high reactivity high reductive capacity to reduce and stabilize different types of pollutants has been considered 33 these particles can be dispersed in aqueous slurries as stable suspensions for a time sufficient and thus directly injected into contaminated areas 34 with above background in this research we focused on combination of uv and us irradiations with a heterogeneous catalytic system for simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the prepared nano zero valent iron nzvi used in this study was purchased from us research nanomaterials us nano inc potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 potassium persulfate k2s2o8 and other chemicals obtained from the merck company germany all chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification all solutions were prepared with double distilled water 2 2 sono photo reactor a photoreactor equipped with a uvc lamp 11 w power and 254 nm wavelength and a quartz sleeve enclosure placed at the center of the reactor was applied to do the tests the intensity of the uv light radiation was measured by the uvc 512 light meter the reaction vessel photoreactor was placed in an ultrasound bath at a frequency of 35 khz and the output power was set between 60 and 960 w a water jacket water circulation was applied to prevention from the temperature influence on the process performance schematic view of the photoreactor placed in an ultrasound bath portrayed in fig 1 2 3 analytical methods and performance indices concentration of cr vi was analyzed using a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide dpc colorimetric method a uv vis spectrophotometer spectrophotometer hach was used for measurements of absorbance at 540 nm in acidic solution phenol concentration was measured by spectrophotometer at 510 nm by the 4 aminoantipyrine method the reactor was covered with a black cloth to prevent from any unnecessary light exposure the extent of removal performance was monitored by determining the residual concentration of phenol and cr vi based on standard methods to quantify the determined extent eq 4 was applied 4 the removal performance percentage of phenol and cr vi c0 ct c0 where c0 and ct refer to the initial concentration of phenol and cr vi mg l 1 and its concentration at time t respectively a pseudo first order kinetic due to being impossible determination of the photogenerated oxidative species in the solution was applied as a good indicator to evaluate the removal performance of phenol and cr vi by spfp eqs 5 7 5 d c pollutant dt k c pollutant c rs 6 c t c 0 e k obs t 7 r obs k obs c pollutant here kobs min 1 crs and robs mg l 1 min are the second order rate constant concentration of reactive species in the solution and the observed rate of phenol and cr vi removal by the spfp respectively also c0 and ct are influent and effluent concentrations of phenol and cr vi in the reactor respectively 2 4 experimental procedure in a typical procedure all batch experiments were done in duplicate in 300 ml batch reactor containing 150 ml solution of cr vi and phenol with molar ratios of phenol cr vi 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 then ph 3 11 was adjusted to adjust ph levels 0 1 m hcl and naoh solutions were used and subsequently h2o2 fe0 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 4 1 and s2o8 0 25 1 mm were added to the solution then solution was exposed to and radiations for a preset time the spfp process initiated by switching on the power supply uv 253 7 nm and us 35 khz next the reactor was mixed with a shaker with a rotation speed of 150 rpm at atmospheric pressure for a preset time finally a sample was taken from the solution centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the particles and analyzed by spectrophotometer also for comparison control experiments were done for uv alone uh uhf uhfs and uhfsu under similar conditions the quenching experimental quenchers of the oxidative agents including ammonium oxalate 2 propanol and tert butanol were done in order to investigate of the involvement of each specific reactive agent in the removal of cr vi and phenol and results were compared with condition without quencher 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency in order to compare the efficiency of different processes in simultaneous reduction of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions the rate of simultaneous removal of these pollutants from aqueous solutions by uv alone uh uhf uhfs and uhfsu was investigated and the results are portrayed in fig 2 in this comparison the performance of different processes in the simultaneous removal of two pollutants with a phenol cr vi molar ratio of 2 1 within 1 80 min and under the same conditions ph 3 0 h2o2 fe0 molar ratio 2 and s2o8 0 75 mm l 1 was investigated as shown in fig 2 uhfsu process with removal performance of cr vi and phenol of 100 and 100 respectively showed higher performance than the other processes within 4 min as the removal performances of cr vi and phenol for uv alone uh uhf and uhfs were 12 5 and 6 5 35 1 and 31 52 5 and 66 1 and 74 9 79 1 at the same time respectively the very low performance of processes in the absence of us can be due to two reasons 1 very low generation rate of free radicals in the absence of us 2 reduction of synergistic effect uv light coupled with us in the absence of us 35 the little removal performance of the only uv can be because of low cr vi and phenol inclination in uv absorption with wavelength 254 3 nm 36 kinetic studies were also performed to compare the efficiency of different processes and the kinetic information was tabulated in tables 1a and 1b according to tables 1a and 1b the kinetic information obtained also proves the superiority of uhfsu process than other processes 37 38 values of robs for uhfsu in the removal of cr vi and phenol were 11 7 and 9 87 mg l 1 min respectively so that value of robs for uhfsu process in the removal of cr vi and phenol was 14 62 30 84 10 4 7 67 2 47 and 3 2 1 3 times than that of the uv alone uh uhf and uhfs respectively the presented results in above indicate that among the tested techniques the uhfsu treatment due to the very high generation rate of free radicals the higher values of kobs and robs and also very low energy consumption 1 39 which is economically justified complete removal of pollutants in less time is the most appropriate method for simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions 3 2 role of ph in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu the batch experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the influence of ph in the over range from 3 0 11 on the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol phenol cr vi molar ratio 2 1 by uhfsu from aqueous solutions and results were presented in fig 3 as seen in fig 3 ph is one of the decisive factors on the uhfsu performance 24 40 41 as the complete removal of chromium and phenol was obtained in acidic ph after 4 min of reaction increase of ph from 4 0 11 resulted to decrease by 15 in the removal efficiency of cr vi although was no observed significant difference between acidic and alkaline conditions for the removal phenol by the uhfsu it reveals the uhfsu process has the better performance in the acidic condition it is well known influence of ph in controlling the catalytic activity stability of h2o2 and activity of iron species 42 43 as the previous conducted researches 43 44 in the acidic ph ferrous ions are produced from reaction between zero valent iron and h2o2 as the following equation 8 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o the ferrous ions produced can react with h2o2 s2o8 as eq 3 and resulted to generation of oh so 4 radicals thus the availability of the free radicals for the degradation of the pollutants is enhanced also in the acidic ph zero valent iron can reduces cr2o7 2 to cr3 as eq 2 and produced ferrous ions that in turn can reacts withh2o2 s2o8 as eq 3 24 45 with increase of ph above 5 the ferrous ions produced in the eqs 2 and 4 react with h2o2and is resulted to production of weaker oxidants such as ferryl ions e g feo2 as eq 9 that are more selective than oh so4 radicals 9 f e 2 h 2 o 2 fe iv e g fe o 2 h 2 o also decrease in oxidation performance of uhfsu in the ph above 5 can be related to decomposition of h2o2 and the deactivation of catalyst due to the precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide the formationof precipitates of fe oh 2 s and fe oh 3 s in the acidic condition so4 could be formed during the catalyzation and accelerate the removal of pollutants at the lower ph through the reaction between hydrogen ions and copper fe is generated as eq 10 that in turn reacts with s2o8 for production of so4 radicals as eq 11 24 10 2f e 0 2 h 2 2f e h 2 11 2f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 2 f e 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 3 3 role of h2o2 fe0 molar ratio in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu as it can be seen from fig 4 by increasing the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio from 0 5 to 2 0 in constant condition phenol cr vi molar ratio 2 1 ph 3 0 s2o8 0 75 mm l 1 time 1 4 min the simultaneous removal percentage of cr vi and phenol by uhfsu because of the produced more oh radicals based on the following equations eqs 12 15 46 was enhanced as the complete removal of the both cr vi and phenol pollutants were achieved in the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio of 2 0 so the efficiency was improved 47 48 12 h 2 o 2 f e 2 o h o h f e 3 13 o h f e 2 o h f e 3 feo h 2 14 h 2 o 2 2 o h 15 h 2 o 2 h v 2 o h however by increasing the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio more than the optimum value from 2 to 4 the progress in the removal performance was not notable or even it was decreased because in the extra concentrations of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 acts as the consumer of hydroxyl radical the hydrogen peroxide acts as free radical scavenger and produces hydroperoxyl radicals ho 2 according to the following reaction eq 16 that have a less oxidizing ability 45 49 50 16 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o in addition due to the completely dependence of produced hydroxyl ions to the molar proportion of h2o2 fe0 so increase of h2o2 more than the optimum value leads to the auto decomposition of h2o2to water and oxygen as eqs 17 and 18 so h2o2 should be added at an optimum amount 17 h 2 o 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 18 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 many studies show that by increasing the iron concentration the rate of removal of pollutants due to reaction between fe2 with h2o2 and formation of more hydroxyl radicals is increased eq 8 thus an optimum value for fe0 is suggested this concentration is dependence on the molar proportion of h2o2 fe0 the reason is that in the extra values of fe0 more than the optimum value the solution was saturated with iron and thus ferrous iron reacted with hydroxyl radical and finally ferric ions was formed that in turn reacted with hydrogen peroxide and was produced ho2 with a less oxidizing ability eqs 19 and 20 11 51 52 19 f e 2 oh f e 3 o h 20 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h also it is possibility the creation of the brown turbidity in the solution at high dosages of ferrous ion that reduces the absorption of the uv light by solution resulting the recombination of oh radicals eq 16 the concentration of fe2 ions in solution was also determined using phenanthroline method according to the standard methods and it was found that during the different reaction times 93 97 of zero valent iron is converted to fe2 ions therefore it was proved the presence of fe2 ions in the solution in throughout the reaction 53 3 4 role of s2o8 concentration in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu fig 5 portraits the influence of s2o8 concentration on the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol as can be seen in fig 5 in the higher initial concentration of s2o8 removal performance increases dramatically that way with changing the initial s2o8 concentration from 0 25 mm l 1 to 0 75 mm l 1 the complete removal of cr vi and phenol was obtained within 4 min with increasing the concentration to 1 mm was no observed the significance influence in the removal performance this phenomenon can be related to the large amounts of generated radicals so4 due to a high dosage of s2o8 which was enough to complete removal of both pollutants target existing in aqueous solutions eqs 1 3 and 7 the generated radicals can be reacted with more selectively via electron transfer many studies have shown that in the excessive amounts of persulfate efficiency of the reaction will be reduced in which can be due to some reverse reactions side reactions and excessive oxidant eqs 21 24 resulting to a scavenging effect on so4 however no inhibition was observed in the present study since the oxidant dosage was below the inhibition point 54 56 21 s 2 o 8 2 o h o h s 2 o 8 22 s 2 o 8 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 s 2 o 8 23 s o 4 s o 4 s 2 o 8 2 24 s 2 o 8 2 2 o h 2hs o 5 3 5 role of phenol cr vi molar ratio in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu investigation of the efficiency of the process in industrial applications is an important issue inrelation to evaluate of process to this purpose the uhfsu performance was evaluated in the different phenol cr vi molar ratios 0 5 4 within 4 min fig 6 portraits the rate of the potential performance of uhfsu process in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenolin the different molar ratios as shown in fig 6 with increasing phenol cr vi molar ratio from 0 5 to 2 the removal efficiency increased as the complete removal of phenol and cr vi was observed in the phenol cr vi molar ratio of 2 after 4 min of the reaction of course complete removal of phenol was achieved at lower molar ratios but the simultaneous and complete removal of both pollutants was achieved at molar ratio 2 it was also observed that by increasing the molar ratio above 2 it caused a decrease in process performance this indicates that the phenol cr vi molar ratio in the aqueous solution plays a major role in the process efficiency 3 6 electrical energy consumption and the total cost of the system one of the important parameter that affected performance of aops processes is the amount of required electrical energy kw to diminish the content of a pollutant by 90 in 1 m3 of the contaminated solution and also the total cost of the system that is calculated by electric energy per mass removed eem in kwh kg as the following formula 1 25 e e m 38 4 p v k o b s where p is electrical power applied kw for the system uv lamp and v is the volume of pollutant in inside reactor l also eq 26 was applied to calculate the total cost of the system tcs m 3 57 58 26 tcs 1 45 e e o k w h m 3 p o w e r cos t k w h o x i d a n t cos t g 1 the values of eem and tcs for the various processes were calculated and tabulated in tables 2a and 2b as tabulated in tables 2a and 2b uhfsu process due to energy saving and the less total cost rather than other processes because of reduction of energy consumption can be a good cost effective alternative and can be more efficient process in the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol from aqueous solutions 3 7 effect of scavengers and possible degradation mechanism of uhfsu system to approve involvement of free radical species in the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol by the uhfsu various scavengers 0 1 mm including ammonium oxalate 2 propanol and tert butanol were added to the reactor and results were portrayed in fig 7 as portrayed in fig 7 upon addition of the scavengers specifically addition of tert butanol as a strong scavenger oh radical simultaneous removal performance of chromium and phenol reduced it can be concluded that process efficiency is highly dependent on the generated reaction radicals and oxidative radicals play a key role in the removal of both pollutants the reason for slightly decrease of uhfsu performance with addition of scavengers can be due to the low amount of scavengers added in solution 0 1 mm as it possibility the higher decrease of uhfsu performance in the higher amounts of scavengers 1 24 3 8 influence of humic acid and coexisting inorganic anions by introducing inorganic anions such nitrate carbonate bicarbonate sulfate chloride and fluoride in aquatic systems we could study how inorganic anions influence on the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol by uhfsu process the tap water was used to this purpose the inlet phenol cr vi molar ratio was 2 1 and reaction time set at 4 min ph 3 0 h2o2 fe0 molar ratio 2 1 the concentrations of carbonate bicarbonate nitrate sulfate chloride and fluoride at tap water analyzed according to the standard methods 53 and were determined 140 120 15 56 72 and 1 5 2 5 mg l 1 respectively as mentioned in the previous sections the removal efficiency of both phenol and chromium contaminants in distilled water and under the selected conditions was 100 the anions present in the tap water indicated the negligible influence on the reaction efficiency as removal efficiency for phenol and chromium reached from 100 at absence of anions distillated water to 96 3 and 94 8 respectively at the presence of different anions tap water however it is important to note that this slight decrease in efficiency may be due to the low amounts of anions present in the tap water and at higher levels of these anions the decrease in efficiency will be more significant the positive influence of anions present in the tap water on the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol can be explained on the basis of the salting out effect and thus the solute was pushed towards the highly reactive interface region of the cavitation bubble to facilitate the removal 1 also some humic acid 15 mg l 1 was added to the tap water and the reaction efficiency was re evaluated the reaction efficiency decreased further in the presence of humic acid and reached from 100 to 88 3 and 91 2 for chromium and phenol respectively this dramatic decrease in the removal efficiency in the presence of humic acid and anions simultaneously can be due to the complex structure of humic acid which can consumes hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals and affect the reaction efficiency 59 4 conclusion in the present study the performance of sono photo fenton like process spfp in the presence of persulfate to generate oxidative radicals o2 oh so4 for the simultaneous removal of chromium and phenol from aqueous solutions the uhfsu process showed higher performance than the other processes uv alone uh uhf and uhfs within 4 min the kinetic information obtained also proves the superiority of uhfsu process than other processes it reveals the uhfsu process has the better performance in the acidic condition the complete removal of the both cr vi and phenol pollutants were achieved in the h2o2 fe0 molar ratio of 2 0 so the efficiency was improved although it is notable in the extra concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and fe0 they acts as the scavenger of hydroxyl radical it was observed 0 75 mm l 1 of s2o8was enough to complete removal of both pollutants target existing in aqueous solutions the results indicated that the phenol cr vi molar ratio in the aqueous solution plays a major role in the process efficiency as the complete removal of the both pollutants was obtained in the phenol cr vi molar ratio equal to 2 and by increasing the molar ratio above 2 it caused a decrease in process performance it was resulted uhfsu process due to energy saving and the less total cost rather than other processes because of reduction of energy consumption can be a good cost effective alternative and can be more efficient process in the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol from aqueous solutions upon addition of the scavengers simultaneous removal performance of chromium and phenol reduced it can be concluded that process efficiency is highly dependent on the generated reaction radicals and oxidative radicals play a key role in the removal of both pollutants finally it was found that the uhfsu process improved the simultaneous removal of cr vi and phenol from aqueous solutions authors contribution all authors have

slightly higher anionic dyes and significantly superior salt removal efficiencies furthermore the optimal go pcs membrane also exhibited better antifouling property for achieving the outstanding flux decline ratio of 8 67 and especially irreversible fouling ratio of only 0 17 to direct black 38 keywords phosphorylated chitosan nanofiltration membrane surface functionalization graphene oxide dye antifouling performance 1 introduction with increasing content of anthropogenic pollutants flowing into the water supplies obtaining adequate qualified drinking or industrial water is being severely affected for the growing worldwide inhabitants 1 3 thereinto the wastewater with annual output of about 7 105 m3 from dye and textile industries usually contains carcinogenic and teratogenic synthetic compounds as well as a certain amount of micromolecular intermediates as promoters of dyes synthesis like nacl naso4 4 7 etc with the emergence of new technologies many efforts have been devoted to identify appropriate treatment of dye salt mixtures to be used in the discharge up to standard water purification and dye salt recovery compared with representative advanced oxidation processes yet with an inherent disadvantage of expensive cost in large scale industrial production for eliminating many nonbiodegradable synthetic dyes nanofiltration nf membrane with pore sizes around 1 nm and surface charge features possesses incomparable advantages such as selective separation of one solute over another controlled precisely by both steric and electrostatic effects automatic operation convenient maintenance easy to scale up little or no chemical consumption 8 12 there is now substantial research showing that the development of nanocomposite membranes with enhanced perm selectivity and antifouling property is still a perpetual challenge for highly efficient separation and recycling of these organic solute salt mixture 13 15 to accomplish this apart from focusing on channel structural control strategy such as regulating the pore size porosity and thickness accurately of the selective layer polymer nf membrane surface with appropriate wettability roughness and charge characteristics by surface functionalization has also been arousing researchers strong interests 16 18 in general an increase in the modified nf membrane surface hydrophilicity smoothness and charge could all improve its fouling resistance while solely or partially enhance its permeability and selectivity when treating the same kind of charged organic dyestuff aqueous solution 19 21 for instance through continuous grafting sulfated group from dextran sulfate sodium and sulfur trioxide trimethylamine to chitosan monomer followed by surface coating and chemical cross linking processes ye et al 6 fabricated a novel complex nf membrane with additional intrinsic aggregation structure showing superior surface hydrophilicity roughness and charge decreasing to 8 3 4 45 nm and 49 5 mv respectively endowing it with high rejection of methyl blue 99 9 na2so4 93 4 selectivity for nacl na2so4 13 1 flux recovery ratio 96 8 but a relatively low permeate flux 38 5 l m2 h zhu et al 22 functionalized go with zwitterionic poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma and obtained go psbma nanocomposite embedded loose nf membranes it was found that when the go psbma content increased from 0 to 0 22 wt the hybrid membrane accompanying with contact angle ca roughness and charge declined about 29 2 14 4 nm and 11 7 mv showed the dye reactive black 5 rejection water permeability and flux recovery ratio increasing by 7 8 151 and 68 8 respectively on the expense of na2so4 rejection collapsed by 41 8 by incorporating of hydrophilic polytriethylene glycol dimethacrylate ptegdma and breaking the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds in chitosan cs casting solution shen et al 23 prepared the optimized cs polyethylene oxide ptegdma composite nf membrane ca and zeta potential dropping around 16 5 and 12 4 mv exhibiting superior anionic dye reactive black 5 separation with permeate flux of 118 l m2 h and high rejection of 87 8 as well as excellent flux recovery ratio of 96 0 after 3 runs for 18 h these studies show that when additional chemical reaction occurs in the casting solution to functionalize the membrane surface with desired characteristic features it may also compact or loosen permeability channels of the active layer inevitably arising from the microscopic changes of monomer internal structure after polymer functionalization undoubtedly in order to efficiently separate or reuse salt containing dyes from aqueous solutions it is necessary for the surface functionalized nanocomposite membranes endowing not merely improved surface hydrophilicity smoothness charge consistent with the target dyes and multivalent ions but also regularly increased the effective porosity in the skin layer internal structure if possible as a derivative of the environment friendly chitosan c6h11no4 n phosphorylated chitosan pcs with high degree of substitution of phosphate group preferentially occurring at hydroxyl on c 6 position due to steric effect and electroaffinity has been proved to be successful in fabricating a novel nf membrane with excellent surface negative charge 51 8 mv and wettability 53 1 as described in our previous study 21 simultaneously in spite of its shortcomings like hard to integrate with polymer highly hydrophilic and negatively charged graphene oxide go riched in oxygenic groups on the surface still provides possibilities for the reactions with amino groups 18 24 25 such as based on ring opening polymerization between amino groups of o carboxymethyl chitosan ocmc active layer and epoxy groups of go nanosheets wang et al 18 successfully prepared a new kind of go ocmc nf membrane and observed that the endowing more smoothness wettability and negative charge were directly relevant to the enhanced desalting properties therefore it is worth looking forward to fabricating a novel pcs nf membrane surface functionalized with go nanosheets that used for high efficient treatment of the abundant organic dyes salt mixture current work is an exhaustive study evaluating the effects of covalently binding go nanosheets to pcs chains on skin characteristics and porosity of the resultant separation layer as well as performance of go pcs

amounts of go nanosheets were elucidated in depth secondly the performance superiority of the go pcs membrane compared with the virgin membrane and other recently reported nanocomposite nf membranes

these nf membranes were observed with atomic force microscopy afm multimode 8 bruker america and field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem su8010 hitachi japan at an accelerated voltage of 5 kv respectively each membrane sample scanned in the range of 8 μm 8 μm in scanasyst mode was sputter coated with gold before observation contact angle goniometer ca theta attension biolin sweden was used for analysis of hydrophilicity of the prepared nf membranes three different positions of each membrane were measured by the sessile drop method to obtain an average value at 25 c the porosity was measured using an autopore 9500 mercury intrusion porosimetry micromeritics inc usa the streaming potential on each membrane surface was measured by using a self made laboratory scale tangential streaming potential test system which could be used to calculate zeta potential on account of the fairbrother mastin equation and the gouy chapman double electric layer theory 10 zeta potential measurement of the dye solution was determined by zeta potential analyzer nano zs90 malvern usa 2 4 performance testing for go pcs membranes 2 4 1 separating performance evaluation the cross flow permeation test was conducted by a nf membrane performance evaluation device with an effective membrane area of 113 cm2 to assess the permeate flux electrolytes and dyes removal efficiencies of the prepared nf membranes at constant inlet cross flow velocity of 0 068 m s feed temperature of 25 0 3 c feed ph of 6 5 0 1 operating pressure of 0 60 0 05 mpa before the test the membrane was compacted with deionized water by pressurization at 1 0 mpa for 2 h to ensure the stability of performance in the subsequent process single component permeation experiment was carried out using 500 mg l of nacl or naso4 as a representative monovalent or divalent salt solution or anionic dye direct black 38 ponceau s or xylenol orange solution at a same content of 100 mg l as feeding solution respectively water flux was obtained by calculating the ratio of directly measuring permeate flow to effective membrane area l m2 h solute rejection was calculated by the percentage of dividing the rejected solute content by the solute concentration in feed concentrations of nacl and naso4 as well as different dyes in aqueous solution before and after permeation were determined by conductivity meter dds 307a inesa china and uv spectrophotometer uv 3600plus shimadzu japan respectively permeate samples for flux measurements and rejection evaluations were collected at intervals of 0 5 h and the average data were used 2 4 2 dye antifouling evaluation the antifouling property of nf0 and nf2 membranes was assessed using 100 mg l direct black 38 which was chosen as the representative organic dye foulant model dynamic dye filtration experiment was carried out for time duration 32 h at fixed operating conditions similar with dye removals in the initial stage namely the pure water flux of the pre compacted membrane was estimated every 1 h for 8 h and labeled as original permeate flux jw1 by averaging then the permeate flux jp after filtrating direct black 38 solution for additional 16 h was obtained afterwards the fouled membranes were flushed immediately by pure water for another 8 h to remove those washable contaminants completely and re measured permeate flux jw2 the flux recovery

skin layers fig 2 shows the atr ftir spectra of a virgin supporting layer with mere the pcs coating a and with the cross linked but different amount of go nanosheets named nf0 nf1 nf2 nf3 membranes b e respectively in fig 2a the distinct peak at 2930 cm 1 corresponds to secondary and tertiary ch stretching vibration and the peak at 1550 cm 1 is attributed to nh in plane bending vibration of fatty primary amine for pcs ga membrane the ch stretching at 2930 cm 1 became slightly stronger which could be ascribed to the introduction of a certain amount of ch2 rooted from the intramolecular chain of employed crosslinking agent at the same time most of the nh stretching at 1550 cm 1 disappeared which also confirmed that the cross linking reaction between nh2 and ga happened as shown in fig 2 c e the intensity of the co stretching vibration band at 1665 cm 1 gradually increased with the increase of go addition which was mainly due to the extra and increasing amide reaction between go and pcs indicating that pristine pcs membrane was successfully surface functionalized with go nanosheets the near surface element composition of pan nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes was further analyzed by xps spectrum fig 3 clearly a new weak xps characteristic signal at 132 ev p 2p was observed in all membranes except for pan substrate symbolizing the successful fabrication of pcs membrane via coating method the intensities of the characteristic peaks for n 1s decreased apparently and c 1s decreased slightly while o 1s peak was more and more intensive with the enlargement of go content indicating again that the resultant membrane surface was functionalized with go nanosheets riched in oxygen containing groups specifically it can be found from table 2 that the ratio of o to n or c to n increased appreciably from 0 34 and 3 84 for nf0 membrane to 0 36 0 46 and 1 64 3 97 4 08 and 6 69 for nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes respectively the tendencies of which were basically consistent with that of the added quantity of go nanosheets 3 1 2 surface morphologies of go pcs membranes surface morphologies of the prepared membranes were visualized by sem and afm respectively and the results were presented in figs 4 and 5 in comparison with the skin layer of the bare pcs membrane nf0 that showed typical porous and rougher structure fig 4a the surfaces of nf1 and nf2 with go nanosheets content of 2 and 10 mg l became relatively dense and smooth structures with small pits fig 4 b and c however with continued increase of the value to 100 mg l several large irregular and hyaline aggregated clusters deposited on the surface of nf3 membrane fig 4d caused by the excess and unreacted go agglomeration possibly because of the π π conjugate interaction among the free surface π electrons 30 31 this result indicates that the proper amount of go nanosheets incorporated in the pcs coating contributes to reducing the formation of ridge and valley morphology on the modified membrane surface fig 5 shows the 3d afm surface images of these fabricated membranes before and after incorporating go nanosheets overall nf0 membrane exhibited the highest roughness with numerous ridges and valleys seen in fig 5a which might be due to polymer pcs itself generally accompanying a potential of instantaneous demixing and then resulting in a high roughness value and a decline in uniformity after surface modified with go nanosheets most of the sharp peaks gradually disappeared in the initial stage and thereafter an additional large plateau occurred ultimately the root mean square roughness r q of these involved membranes declined dramatically from 25 9 18 7 nm along with go nanosheets content increasing from 0 to 10 mg l as would be expected it suggested that a limited number of amino group on c 2 position of pcs monomers as active sites only allowed tiny quantities of go nanosheets reacting covalently bonded to polymer coating surface layer decreasing the swelling of pcs and the surface roughness of go pcs membrane but then r q value for nf3 membrane ascended to 22 6 nm rapidly at go content of 100 mg l presumably an excess amount of and unreacted go nanosheets would be reunited on the local coating surface which was also confirmed by the sem image of fig 4d 3 1 3 surface wetting and charge properties of these membranes the measured water static and dynamic cas of the bare pcs membrane and go pcs membranes are depicted in fig 6 it was impressive that the static water ca decreased from 53 1 remarkably to 41 9 with the enlargement of go content from 0 to 10 mg l even though the corresponding roughness results of decreasing dramatically see fig 5 at this stage had suppressed this trend hereafter membrane surface hydrophilicity was improved subtly after adding many times of go nanosheets undoubtedly this could be attributed to the combination of go nanosheets containing many oxygen containing groups and pcs functional layer in the initial until the agglomeration of excess and unreacted go nanosheets suppresses the quick improvement of go pcs membrane hydrophilicity generally advancing ca reflects the wettability of the hydrophobic part on the membrane surface and receding ca is closely related to the hydrophilic component 32 33 compared with 31 4 decline for advancing ca from nf0 to nf3 there is an obviously higher receding ca reduction of 42 1 during this period which further confirmed the improved hydrophilicity of the modified pcs membrane functionalized with go nanosheets similarly in contrast to nf1 membrane with water ca becoming 40 after 73 s the slightly more hydrophilic nf2 and nf3 membranes only needed 36 s and 14 s accomplishing the goal respectively the results of both the measured streaming potential versus pressure drop and the calculated zeta potential versus ph for these candidate membranes are depicted in fig 7 generally the composite pcs membrane surface incorporated with moderate amounts of go nanosheets becomes slightly more negative charged one is that the slope of fitting straight between streaming potential and pressure drop using 1 mmol l kcl aqueous solution at ph 7 0 decreased from 0 449 mv kpa for nf0 membrane to 0 484 mv kpa 0 516 mv kpa for nf1 nf2 membranes respectively moreover the isoelectric points of pcs 2 mg l go pcs 10 mg l go pcs membranes decreased gradually from 3 47 to 3 32 3 14 owing to the introduction of more carboxyl and hydroxyl groups with the addition of go increasing the characteristic zeta potential curves of these membrane surfaces behaving a positive charge at low ph and a more negative charge at higher ph could be attributed to the protonation deprotonation of both acidic oxygen containing groups in go pcs mixed matrix and basic functional unsubstituted amino group in pcs groups the final decline of nf3 membrane surface charge performance was quite consistent with the aforementioned interpretation and inference that excess go nanosheets didn t react with pcs but reoccurred self agglomeration and partly covered those more negatively charged go pcs mixed matrix 3 2 performance of go pcs membranes 3 2 1 filtration performance of membranes effect of the content of go nanosheets on the resultant nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes performance is examined involving a series of electrolyte and anionic dye solutions and the results are depicted in figs 8 and 9 thereinto desalting effort of the resultant membranes was evaluated with 500 mg l nacl and naso4 solutions at 0 60 0 05 mpa see fig 8 it appeared that compared with bare pcs membrane permeate flux and salt rejection for both na2so4 and nacl solutions of go pcs membranes concurrently enhanced with the amount of go nanosheets modestly increasing when the content of additive go nanosheets increased to 10 mg l nf2 membrane exhibited the highest salt rejection of 56 8 and 93 6 for nacl and naso4 and the maximum permeate fluxes of 79 2 and 76 4 l m2 h respectively this finding could be explained that the presence of multiple oxygen containing functional groups on go nanosheets causes a more negative charge on membrane surface armed with nanoscale go nanosheets interlayer spacing of 7 20 å which strengthens the electrostatic and steric resistance effects of go pcs modified membranes and inevitably hinders the passage of inorganic ions 34 an always higher rejection for na2so4 84 7 93 6 than for nacl 40 1 56 8 is mainly due to the latter s faster diffusion coefficient and smaller hydration diameter simultaneously the increase of hydrophilicity of go pcs skin layer and the decrease of permeability resistance contributed to the increase of permeate flux but with go nanosheets continuing to increase to 100 mg l permeate flux and rejection to na2so4 and nacl of nf4 membrane were reduced by around 9 21 4 93 and 1 49 respectively compared to those maximum values the relatively significant decrease in permeate flux might be interpreted as the increasing thickness of 100 mg l go pcs membrane skin layer caused by the excess and unreacted go agglomeration as shown above further investigation of go effect on the nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes separation performance for anionic dyes including direct black 38 ponceau s and xylenol orange was implemented with nf2 membrane as example the changing trends of uv vis absorbance for all dye solutions before and after permeation as well as the actual sample pictures are displayed in fig 9a not surprisingly the colours of the related permeate samples were faded distinctly in different levels especially for direct black 38 as shown in fig 9b permeate flux increased with the appropriate go content while dyes rejection rates relevant to their respective characteristic peak absorption values changed slightly the increase in membrane permeability would be ascribed to the additional pathways offered by go and increased skin layer free volume manifested as nanoporous structure porosity increasing by 16 8 compared with nf0 membrane see table 2 by incorporating layered rigid go to disrupt pcs chain packing as well as the enhanced hydrophilicity of membrane surface 35 36 meanwhile the last factor also directly contributed to a slight increase in organic dye removals because the more hydrophilic membrane surface is apt to promote the dissolution and diffusion of water molecules than those less polar micro molecular organics moreover a slightly more negative charged nf membrane surface will also increase the electrostatic repulsive forces to anion dyes it could also be seen among the resultant membranes nf2 membrane has a highest average permeate flux of 71 6 l m2 h and the optimal retention rates for all three dyes following the order of direct black 38 99 7 xylenol orange 97 5 and ponceau s 93 4 respectively since the strongest steric hindrance effect for direct black 38 exclusive rigid angular shape and electrostatic repulsion effect for xylenol orange with highest density of electron donating groups and maximum zeta potential seen in table 1 were involved in addition with the gradual enhancement of membrane surface charge from nf0 to nf2 it was surprisingly found that the removal efficiency of xylenol orange revealed the strongest sensitivity and growing rate δrmax 1 4 which verified the successful incorporation of negatively charged go nanosheets into the pcs skin layer in turn 3 2 2 antifouling performance of membranes logically the fouling resistance of nf membrane should be reduced with improving its surface properties and structure hence the antifouling performance of the bare pcs and the optimal go pcs membranes was carried out by dynamic dye filtration for a full cycle as depicted in fig 10 both nf0 and nf2 membranes showed permeate flux decline and recovery after direct black 38 filtration for 16 h and subsequent hydraulic cleaning more specifically for nf2 and nf0 membranes fdr increased from 8 67 to 39 2 while frr decreased inversely from 99 8 75 4 significantly reduced fdr and increased frr values for nf2 membrane suggested that its dye adsorption resistance and physical cleaning efficiency markedly improved what s more the further calculated rir decreased sharply from 24 6 for nf0 membrane to 0 17 of the nf2 membrane compared with a relatively minor decline for rr during this process this is mainly because the strong hydration layer for nf2 membrane surface functionalized with an appropriate amount of go nanosheets provided with smooth surface and improved surface negative charge could observably mitigate hydrophobic interaction between anionic dye and membrane surface 37 38 which ultimately restrains the adsorption or deposition of dye molecules to sum up compared with many other nanocomposite membranes presented in table 3 the prepared go pcs nf membrane in this work exhibited superior performance in terms of membrane permeability and separation efficiency as well as anti fouling resistance to a series of anionic dyes and electrolytes aqueous solutions 4 conclusions this study has been demonstrated a convenient pcs nf membrane fabrication method via surface functionalization with go nanosheets through forming covalent bonds it is interesting to find that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of go nanosheets has effectively improved both skin features hydrophilicity smoothness and negative charge and nanoporous loose body porosity of membranes separation layer which greatly benefits for highly efficient treatment of anionic dye and salt solutions when applied to separation of direct black 38 xylenol orange ponceau s nacl and na2so4 the flux and rejection of the resultant membranes magnified simultaneously with increasing the amounts of active go nanosheets participation in reaction moreover the removal efficiency of xylenol orange possessing the highest density of electron donating groups revealed the strongest sensitivity and growing rate δrmax 1 4 in the above process at optimized condition 10 mg l go pcs membrane also exhibited better antifouling property achieving the outstanding flux decline ratio of 8 67 and especially irreversible fouling ratio of only 0 17 to direct black 38 in short the pcs nf membrane surface functionalized with go nanosheets shows promise in salt containing anionic dye solution treatment owing to high flux and good separation properties as well as excellent antifouling performance declaration of competing interest all of our authors declare no conflict of interest for the manuscript entitled efficient removal and fouling resistant of

14122,to validate the feasibility of designing composite nanofiltration nf with separation layer composed of desired both skin features and loose body by one step process in this work a novel phosphorylated chitosan pcs nf membrane was fabricated via surface functionalization with an appropriate amount of graphene oxide go nanosheets through forming covalent bonds it demonstrated superior surface hydrophilicity roughness and negative charge decreasing to 41 9 18 7 nm and 56 4 mv respectively and showed good anionic dye and salt separation performance due to the disruption of the packing of polymer chains with the two dimensional layered rigid go nanoplates porosity of its surface layer increased by 16 8 concurrently compared with the bare pcs membrane the permeate fluxes of nf2 membrane to aqueous solutions dissolved with direct black 38 xylenol orange ponceau s nacl and na2so4 under steady state were higher by 58 8 76 3 75 1 83 1 and 78 8 respectively also it exhibited slightly higher anionic dyes and significantly superior salt removal efficiencies furthermore the optimal go pcs membrane also exhibited better antifouling property for achieving the outstanding flux

antifouling performance 1 introduction with increasing content of anthropogenic pollutants flowing into the water supplies obtaining adequate qualified drinking or industrial water is being severely affected for the growing worldwide inhabitants 1 3 thereinto the wastewater with annual output of about 7 105 m3 from dye and textile industries usually contains carcinogenic and teratogenic synthetic compounds as well as a certain amount of micromolecular intermediates as promoters of dyes synthesis like nacl naso4 4 7 etc with the emergence of new technologies many efforts have been devoted to identify appropriate treatment of dye salt mixtures to be used in the discharge up to standard water purification and dye salt recovery compared with representative advanced oxidation processes yet with an inherent disadvantage of expensive cost in large scale industrial production for eliminating many nonbiodegradable synthetic dyes nanofiltration nf membrane with pore sizes around 1 nm and surface charge features possesses incomparable advantages such as selective separation of one solute over another controlled precisely by both steric and electrostatic effects automatic operation convenient maintenance easy to scale up little or no chemical consumption 8 12 there is now substantial research showing that the development of nanocomposite membranes with enhanced perm selectivity and antifouling property is still a perpetual challenge for highly efficient separation and recycling of these organic solute salt mixture 13 15 to accomplish this apart from focusing on channel structural control strategy such as regulating the pore size porosity and thickness accurately of the selective layer polymer nf membrane surface with appropriate wettability roughness and charge characteristics by surface functionalization has also been arousing researchers strong interests 16 18 in general an increase in the modified nf membrane surface hydrophilicity smoothness and charge could all improve its fouling resistance while solely or partially enhance its permeability and selectivity when treating the same kind of charged organic dyestuff aqueous solution 19 21 for instance through continuous grafting sulfated group from dextran sulfate sodium and sulfur trioxide trimethylamine to chitosan monomer followed by surface coating and chemical cross linking processes ye et al 6 fabricated a novel complex nf membrane with additional intrinsic aggregation structure showing superior surface hydrophilicity roughness and charge decreasing to 8 3 4 45 nm and 49 5 mv respectively endowing it with high rejection of methyl blue 99 9 na2so4 93 4 selectivity for nacl na2so4 13 1 flux recovery ratio 96 8 but a relatively low permeate flux 38 5 l m2 h zhu et al 22 functionalized go with zwitterionic poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma and obtained go psbma nanocomposite embedded loose nf membranes it was found that when the go psbma content increased from 0 to 0 22 wt the hybrid membrane accompanying with contact angle ca roughness and charge declined about 29 2 14 4 nm and 11 7 mv showed the dye reactive black 5 rejection water permeability and flux recovery ratio increasing by 7 8 151 and 68 8 respectively on the expense of na2so4 rejection collapsed by 41 8 by incorporating of hydrophilic polytriethylene glycol dimethacrylate ptegdma and breaking the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds in chitosan cs casting solution shen et al 23 prepared the optimized cs polyethylene oxide ptegdma composite nf membrane ca and zeta potential dropping around 16 5 and 12 4 mv exhibiting superior anionic dye reactive black 5 separation with permeate flux of 118 l m2 h and high rejection of 87 8 as well as excellent flux recovery ratio of 96 0 after 3 runs for 18 h these studies show that when additional chemical reaction occurs in the casting solution to functionalize the membrane surface with desired characteristic features it may also compact or loosen permeability channels of the active layer inevitably arising from the microscopic changes of monomer internal structure after polymer functionalization undoubtedly in order to efficiently separate or reuse salt containing dyes from aqueous solutions it is necessary for the surface functionalized nanocomposite membranes endowing not merely improved surface hydrophilicity smoothness charge consistent with the target dyes and multivalent ions but also regularly increased the effective porosity in the skin layer internal structure if possible as a derivative of the environment friendly chitosan c6h11no4 n phosphorylated chitosan pcs with high degree of substitution of phosphate group preferentially occurring at hydroxyl on c 6 position due to steric effect and electroaffinity has been proved to be successful in fabricating a novel nf membrane with excellent surface negative charge 51 8 mv and wettability 53 1 as described in our previous study 21 simultaneously in spite of its shortcomings like hard to integrate with polymer highly hydrophilic and negatively charged graphene oxide go riched in oxygenic groups on the surface still provides possibilities for the reactions with amino groups 18 24 25 such as based on ring opening polymerization between amino groups of o carboxymethyl chitosan ocmc active layer and epoxy groups of go nanosheets wang et al 18 successfully prepared a new kind of go ocmc nf membrane and observed that the endowing more smoothness wettability and negative charge were directly relevant to the enhanced desalting properties therefore it is worth looking forward to fabricating a novel pcs nf membrane surface functionalized with go nanosheets that used for high efficient treatment of the abundant organic dyes salt mixture current work is an exhaustive study evaluating the effects of covalently binding go nanosheets to pcs chains on skin characteristics and porosity of the resultant separation layer as well as performance of go pcs membrane firstly the possible incentives for the improved membrane wettability smoothness and negative charge characteristics and the enhanced porosity by surface functionalization with different amounts of go nanosheets were elucidated in depth secondly the performance superiority of the go pcs membrane compared with the virgin membrane and other recently reported nanocomposite nf membranes

crosslinking between ga and pcs coating at 50 c for 1 5 h which was termed hereinafter as nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 respectively the carboxyl groups in go nanosheets were covalently bonded to amino groups in pcs coated membrane by dehydration condensation reaction finally the resultant membrane was thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove excessive go and ga for further characterization the membrane was preserved in 1 0 wt nahso3 aqueous solution to prevent contamination 2 3 characterization the chemical structure of prepared go nanosheets was characterized by x ray

the intensity of the co stretching vibration band at 1665 cm 1 gradually increased with the increase of go addition which was mainly due to the extra and increasing amide reaction between go and pcs indicating that pristine pcs membrane was successfully surface functionalized with go nanosheets the near surface element composition of pan nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes was further analyzed by xps

method the intensities of the characteristic peaks for n 1s decreased apparently and c 1s decreased slightly while o 1s peak was more and more intensive with the enlargement of go content indicating again that the resultant membrane surface was functionalized with go nanosheets riched in oxygen containing groups specifically it can be found from table 2 that the ratio of o to n or c to n increased appreciably from 0 34 and 3 84 for nf0 membrane to 0 36 0 46 and 1 64 3 97 4 08 and 6 69 for nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes respectively the tendencies of which were basically consistent with

electrons 30 31 this result indicates that the proper amount of go nanosheets incorporated in the pcs coating contributes to reducing the formation of ridge and valley morphology on the modified membrane surface fig 5 shows the 3d afm surface images of these fabricated membranes before and after incorporating go nanosheets overall nf0 membrane exhibited the highest roughness with numerous ridges and valleys seen in fig 5a which might be due to polymer pcs itself generally accompanying a potential of instantaneous demixing and then resulting in a high roughness value and a decline in uniformity after surface modified with go nanosheets most of the sharp peaks gradually disappeared in the initial stage and thereafter an additional large plateau occurred ultimately the root mean square roughness r q of these involved membranes declined dramatically from 25 9 18 7 nm along with go nanosheets content increasing from 0 to 10 mg l as would be expected it suggested that a limited number of amino group on c 2 position of pcs monomers as active sites only allowed tiny quantities of go nanosheets reacting covalently bonded to polymer coating surface layer decreasing the swelling of pcs and the surface roughness of go pcs membrane but then r q value for nf3 membrane ascended to 22 6 nm rapidly at go content of 100 mg l presumably an excess amount of and unreacted go nanosheets would be reunited on the local coating surface which was also confirmed by the sem image of fig 4d 3 1 3 surface wetting and charge properties of these membranes the measured water static and dynamic cas of the bare pcs membrane and go pcs membranes are depicted in fig 6 it was impressive that the static water ca decreased from 53 1 remarkably to 41 9 with the enlargement of go content from 0 to 10 mg l even though the corresponding roughness results of decreasing dramatically see fig 5 at this stage had suppressed this trend hereafter membrane surface hydrophilicity was improved subtly after adding many times of go nanosheets undoubtedly this could be attributed to the combination of go nanosheets containing many oxygen containing groups and pcs functional layer in the initial until the agglomeration of excess and unreacted go nanosheets suppresses the quick improvement of go pcs membrane hydrophilicity generally advancing ca reflects the wettability of the hydrophobic part on the membrane surface and receding ca is closely related to the hydrophilic component 32 33 compared with 31 4 decline for advancing ca from nf0 to nf3 there is an obviously higher receding ca reduction of 42 1 during this period which further confirmed the improved hydrophilicity of the modified pcs membrane functionalized with go nanosheets similarly in contrast to nf1 membrane with water ca becoming 40 after 73 s the slightly more hydrophilic nf2 and nf3 membranes only needed 36 s and 14 s accomplishing the goal respectively the results of both the measured streaming potential versus pressure drop and the calculated zeta potential versus ph for these candidate membranes are depicted in fig 7 generally the composite pcs membrane surface incorporated with moderate amounts of go nanosheets becomes slightly more negative charged one is that the slope of fitting straight between streaming potential and pressure drop using 1 mmol l kcl aqueous solution at ph 7 0 decreased from 0 449 mv kpa for nf0 membrane to 0 484 mv kpa 0 516 mv kpa for nf1 nf2 membranes respectively moreover the isoelectric points of pcs 2 mg l go pcs 10 mg l go pcs membranes decreased gradually from 3 47 to 3 32 3 14 owing to the introduction of more carboxyl and hydroxyl groups with the addition of go increasing the characteristic zeta potential curves of these membrane surfaces behaving a positive charge at low ph and a more negative charge at higher ph could be attributed to the protonation deprotonation of both acidic oxygen containing groups in go pcs mixed matrix and basic functional unsubstituted amino group in pcs groups the final decline of nf3 membrane surface charge performance was quite consistent with the aforementioned interpretation and inference that excess go nanosheets didn t react with pcs but reoccurred self agglomeration and partly covered those more negatively charged go pcs mixed matrix 3 2 performance of go pcs membranes 3 2 1 filtration performance of membranes effect of the content of go nanosheets on the resultant nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes performance is examined involving a series of electrolyte and anionic dye solutions and the results are depicted in figs 8 and 9 thereinto desalting effort of the resultant membranes was evaluated with 500 mg l nacl and naso4 solutions at 0 60 0 05 mpa see fig 8 it appeared that compared with bare pcs membrane permeate flux and salt rejection for both na2so4 and nacl solutions of go pcs membranes concurrently enhanced with the amount of go nanosheets modestly increasing when the content of additive go nanosheets increased to 10 mg l nf2 membrane exhibited the highest salt rejection of 56 8 and 93 6 for nacl and naso4 and the maximum permeate fluxes of 79 2 and 76 4 l m2 h respectively this finding could be explained that the presence of multiple oxygen containing functional groups on go nanosheets causes a more negative charge on membrane surface armed with nanoscale go nanosheets interlayer spacing of 7 20 å which strengthens the electrostatic and steric resistance effects of go pcs modified membranes and inevitably hinders the passage of inorganic ions 34 an always higher rejection for na2so4 84 7 93 6 than for nacl 40 1 56 8 is mainly due to the latter s faster diffusion coefficient and smaller hydration diameter simultaneously the increase of hydrophilicity of go pcs skin layer and the decrease of permeability resistance contributed to the increase of permeate flux but with go nanosheets continuing to increase to 100 mg l permeate flux and rejection to na2so4 and nacl of nf4 membrane were reduced by around 9 21 4 93 and 1 49 respectively compared to those maximum values the relatively significant decrease in permeate flux might be interpreted as the increasing thickness of 100 mg l go pcs membrane skin layer caused by the excess and unreacted go agglomeration as shown above further investigation of go effect on the nf0 nf1 nf2 and nf3 membranes separation performance for anionic dyes including direct black 38 ponceau s and xylenol orange was implemented with nf2 membrane as example the changing trends of uv vis absorbance for all dye solutions before and after permeation as well as the actual sample pictures are displayed in fig 9a not surprisingly the colours of the related permeate samples were faded distinctly in different levels especially for direct black 38 as shown in fig 9b permeate flux increased with the appropriate go content while dyes rejection rates relevant to their respective characteristic peak absorption values changed slightly the increase in membrane permeability would be ascribed to the additional pathways offered by go and increased skin layer free volume manifested as nanoporous structure porosity increasing by 16 8 compared with nf0 membrane see table 2 by incorporating layered rigid go to disrupt pcs chain packing as well as the enhanced hydrophilicity of membrane surface 35 36 meanwhile the last factor also directly contributed to a slight increase in organic dye removals because the more hydrophilic membrane surface is apt to promote the dissolution and diffusion of water molecules than those less polar micro molecular organics moreover a slightly more negative charged nf membrane surface will also increase the electrostatic repulsive forces to anion dyes it could also be seen among the resultant membranes nf2 membrane has a highest average permeate flux of 71 6 l m2 h and the optimal retention rates for all three dyes following the order of direct black 38 99 7 xylenol orange 97 5 and ponceau s 93 4 respectively since the strongest steric hindrance effect for direct black 38 exclusive rigid angular shape and electrostatic repulsion effect for xylenol orange with highest density of electron donating groups and maximum zeta potential seen in table 1 were involved in addition with the gradual enhancement of membrane surface charge from nf0 to nf2 it was surprisingly found that the removal efficiency of xylenol orange revealed the strongest sensitivity and growing rate δrmax 1 4 which verified the successful incorporation of negatively charged go nanosheets into the pcs skin layer in turn 3 2 2 antifouling performance of membranes logically the fouling resistance of nf membrane should be reduced with improving its surface properties and structure hence the antifouling performance of the bare pcs and the optimal go pcs membranes was carried out by dynamic dye filtration for a full cycle as depicted in fig 10 both nf0 and nf2 membranes showed permeate flux decline and recovery after direct black 38 filtration for 16 h and subsequent hydraulic cleaning more specifically for nf2 and nf0 membranes fdr increased from 8 67 to 39 2 while frr decreased inversely from 99 8 75 4 significantly reduced fdr and increased frr values for nf2 membrane suggested that its dye adsorption resistance and physical cleaning efficiency markedly improved what s more the further calculated rir decreased sharply from 24 6 for nf0 membrane to 0 17 of the nf2 membrane compared with a relatively minor decline for rr during this process this is mainly because the strong hydration layer for nf2 membrane surface functionalized with an appropriate amount of go nanosheets provided with smooth surface and improved surface negative charge could observably mitigate hydrophobic interaction between anionic dye and membrane surface 37 38 which ultimately restrains the adsorption or deposition of dye molecules to sum up compared with many other nanocomposite membranes presented in table 3 the prepared go pcs nf membrane in this work exhibited superior performance in terms of membrane permeability and separation efficiency as well as anti fouling resistance to a series of anionic dyes and electrolytes aqueous solutions 4 conclusions this study has been demonstrated a convenient pcs nf membrane fabrication method via surface functionalization with go nanosheets through forming covalent bonds it is interesting to find that the incorporation of an appropriate amount of go nanosheets has effectively improved both skin features hydrophilicity smoothness and negative charge and nanoporous loose body porosity of membranes separation layer which greatly benefits for highly efficient treatment of anionic dye and salt solutions when applied to separation of direct black 38 xylenol orange ponceau s nacl and na2so4 the flux and rejection of the resultant membranes magnified simultaneously with increasing the amounts of active go nanosheets participation in reaction moreover the removal efficiency of xylenol orange possessing the highest density of electron donating groups revealed the strongest sensitivity and growing rate δrmax 1 4 in the above process at optimized condition 10 mg l go pcs membrane also exhibited better antifouling property achieving the outstanding flux decline ratio of 8 67 and especially irreversible fouling ratio of only 0 17 to direct black 38 in short the pcs nf membrane surface functionalized with go nanosheets shows promise in salt containing anionic dye solution treatment owing to high flux and good separation properties as well as excellent antifouling performance declaration of competing interest all of our authors declare no conflict of interest for the manuscript entitled efficient removal and fouling resistant of

14123,we report the preparation of flower shaped zno bunches with the α fe2o3 photocatalyst using the sonochemical method followed by the photodeposition of ag nanoparticles the ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst was utilized for the removal of the environmental pollutant methylene blue mb dye from our results it was found that the ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic activity when compared to zno α fe2o3 with the addition of h2o2 moreover the higher plasmon resonance activity of the ag with a photocatalyst degraded the mb dye within 30 min in the presence of h2o2 the different ph and the molar ratio of h2o2 were influenced by the degradation performance in addition the zno α fe2o3 and ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalysts were used for the generation of the oh radicals and the formation of formaldehyde and co2 as analyzed by diffuse reflectance infra red transmission drift spectroscopy keywords nanocomposites zno α fe2o3 photocatalysis photo fenton dye degradation 1 introduction currently the burning of fossil fuels remains one of the most important sources of energy in the world but it is also one of the chief sources of pollutants and a contributor to climate change however due to global warming the search for alternate energy sources and ways to eliminate organic pollutants and convert them into useable forms such as co2 and h2o has become a top concern 1 2 many techniques to produce renewable energy without the emission of carbon have been developed for example the process of water splitting was evaluated under sunlight and various semiconductor materials have been studied because of their direct bandgap and physiochemical properties 3 based on such superior properties researchers have focused on the development of semiconductor nanomaterials with the high surface area and effective plasmonic resonance performance which are crucial for novel applications such as in energy devices 4 and for the removal of organic pollutants 5 6 further a better material for application in the visible light region utilizing a wide range of the solar energy spectrum is much needed many semiconductors have been successfully created from a variety of materials including wo3 7 fe2o3 8 cafe2o4 9 and tio2 10 for the degradation of organic pollutants and their conversion into formate species during the reduction process among these semiconductor materials α fe2o3 is one of the most attractive with excellent optical properties that extend from uv to the visible light spectrum 11 12 its nano sized hematite particles are highly active for the electron transfer that is used for the degradation of organic pollutants besides α fe2o3 zno is another of the most attractive n type semiconductors having many potential applications 13 14 efforts are being made to improve the characteristic of zno to allow it to perform as a visible light photocatalyst by doping with transition metals or combining it with other narrowband semiconductors such as fe2o3 and wo3 15 17 many studies have used zno and α fe2o3 as heterojunctions for hydrogenation with a low bandgap and the ability to stimulate the photo response of electrons and holes 17 19 the literature includes many reports of significant organic degradation observed by visible light absorption using materials decorated with noble metals 20 21 nevertheless it is still essential to improve these visible light photocatalysts to achieve the necessary photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol for conversion into useful species by solar energy 22 the noble metals such as ag au and pt are responsible for the surface plasmon response which makes them good standard materials for photocatalysis 23 25 interestingly silver has recently proven to be one of the best materials for combining with semiconductors to function as a visible light photocatalyst as it has demonstrated excellent performance in many applications such as co2 reduction 26 h2 evaluation 27 and the degradation of organic pollutants 28 in addition ag nanoparticles are effectively able to absorb light with a strong attachment to the semiconductor materials as well as being able to enrich the reduction and oxidation reactions 29 further it has been demonstrated that surface plasmon resonance spr is employed in the transfer of interfacial charge carriers on the semiconductor surface 30 31 it has been found that n type semiconductors with ag metal demonstrated improved photoabsorption and faster exciton generation in the conduction band depending on the structure and size of the particles 32 there are various methods which can be utilized for the evaluation of photocatalytic activity such as the sol gel 33 hydrothermal 34 sonochemical 35 36 and chemical vapor methods 37 of these the sonochemical method is appropriate for the generation of nanoparticles based on acoustic cavitation it can be used for the synthesis of many nanocomposites and for the treatment of wastewater the major advantage of ultrasonication is the control of the hydrolysis reaction which is formed from a homogeneous solution that leads to the formation of the seed nuclei in the solution 38 this method is both efficient and simple and creates physical attraction between the materials to improve the photocatalytic properties 39 in our work we ultrasonically synthesized bunches of zno flowers with α fe2o3 nanocomposites to act as a visible light photocatalyst the influence of various ultrasonication times of the zno α fe2o3 composites was investigated ag metal was photodeposited on the flower shaped zno α fe2o3 composite that showed excellent morphology and extended the visible light response the degradation of mb dye was analyzed by observations at regular intervals of time and it was concluded that faster catalytic activity was achieved with h2o2 than without the h2o2 solution to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the systematic study of the photooxidation of ethanol was performed by ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst the in situ drift spectra results confirm that oh plays a dynamic role in photooxidation 2 experimental method 2 1 preparation of zno bunches of flowers with the α fe2o3 photocatalyst zinc acetate and ferric nitrate precursors were used for the preparation of the bunch of flower composites 0 3 mol of zinc acetate and 0 1 mol of ferric nitrate were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water the ph of the above solution was maintained at 1 5 by adding a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution the reaction solution was sonicated an ultrasonic probe xinzhi co china jy92 2d ti horn 100 w 40 khz 10 mm diameter for different time intervals of 1 2 and 3 h at 25 c then the separation of zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites was done by centrifugation finally the separated materials were washed with water and ethanol and heated in an oven at 60 c for six hours in order to achieve good crystallinity of the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites the samples were annealed at 450 c for four hours the three different sonication times i e 1 2 and 3 h samples are referred to as 1s 2s and 3s respectively 2 2 photodeposition of ag on zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composite the photodeposition of ag nanoparticles on the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composite was as follows 100 mg 2s sample was dispersed in 20 ml of 1 1 ethanol water mixer aliquot of ag ions was prepared by dissolving silver nitrate in deionized water the 5 wt ag concentration solution is calculated in relation to the weight of the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites the ag solution was added into the above zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites suspension and this solution was kept under uv light for 1 h the ag deposited on the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composite was cleaned using water and ethanol lastly the synthesized materials were heated in an oven at 60 c for six hours this sample is referred to as ag 2s 2 3 in situ diffuse reflectance infrared transmittance study the photooxidation of ethanol was analyzed with a ft ir perkin elmer using an mct detector the caf2 window was used for the ft ir measurement with 64 scans for each spectrum with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the photocatalytic oxidation performance of the zno α fe2o3 and ag zno α fe2o3 composites was observed with different visible light irradiation times of 1 3 6 9 12 and 15 min the values of the ir absorbance intensity a measured with single beam intensity isb and reference beam intensity i0 were calculated from the equation 1 a log i0 isb 2 4 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic process of as synthesized nanocomposites was studied for the removal of mb dye a 350 w mercury xenon lamp xe350 prosper technology taiwan with intensity of 380 8 μw cm2 at a wavelength of 380 nm was used as the visible light source for this photodegradation process 30 mg of the as prepared photocatalysts were added to 50 ml of a 5 ppm mb dye aqueous solution then the mixing solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min under dark to ensure the absorption desorption condition after 30 min the light source was introduced into the photocatalyst solution and sample solutions were taken every 5 min to monitor the degradation rate the clear collected solution was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer the percentage of dye removal was calculated using the following equation 2 dye removal co ce co x 100 where co is the concentration of the dye under dark and ce is the concentration of the dye at equilibrium to carry out photo fenton experiments the 0 5 ml of h2o2 was mixed into the photocatalyst solution the photo fenton reaction was monitored using pl measurement with various time intervals 2 5 characterization the x ray diffraction results were measured analytical x pert 246

the 1s 2s 3s and ag 2s photocatalyst samples prepared with different sonication times at 1 h sonication zno and α fe2o3 peaks with very low intensity were observed at 2θ values of 31 15 33 21 and 35 20 as shown in fig 1 a 40 41 after 1 h of sonication we can see that the crystallization of zno attributed to high intensity peaks at 30 98 35 45 and 38 25 with α fe2o3 peaks at 33 29 and 49 89 which confirms the growth of α fe2o3 nanoparticles on the zno bunches of flowers 42 at 3 h sonication the peak intensities were observed to be low when compared with the 2 h sonication this suggests that a long sonication time 3 h leads to diminishing the growth of zno and α fe2o3 after photodeposition of ag the 2θ peaks observed at 40 27 and 46 68 prove the existence of ag nanoparticles on the bunch of flower nanocomposites 43 fe sem images of the 1s 2s 3s and ag 2s photocatalysts are shown in fig 2 after 1 h we observed the formation of nanosheet like shapes which might be the base for the growing bunch of flowers as shown in fig 2 a furthermore it was found that the surface morphology of the as prepared 2 h sonication displayed the flower like bunches of zno with α fe2o3 nanoparticles present on them as shown in fig 2 c the pure zno flower structure is shown in s2 after two hours of sonication the zno bunches of flowers were visible as illustrated in fig 2 d however after 3 h the zno α fe2o3 flowers could not be clearly seen because the zno flowers were broken up by the longer sonication time as illustrated in fig 2 b the structure indicates the growth of zno combined with α fe2o3 bunches of flowers after sonication at 2 h with the addition of ag nanoparticles as shown in fig 2 e h fig 2 e h indicates the flower petals structures with nanoparticles embedded in a bunch of zno α fe2o3 the photo deposition of ag metal on the zno α fe2o3 flowers photocatalyst yielded small sized ag nanoparticles the diffraction values of 0 302 and 0 259 nm confirm the presence of ag 44 and α fe2o3 45 nanoparticles respectively on the zno flowers from hr tem the mapping result shows the clear identification of uniform assemblies of ag α fe2o3 and zno bunches of flowers edx observation indicates the existence of zn ag o and fe elements in the ag deposited zno fe2o3 bunch of flower nanocomposites the uv vis spectra were collected to measure the optical absorption of the 1s 2s 3s and ag 2s bunch of flower photocatalysts as shown in fig 3 for 1 h sonication it exhibited only a zno absorption peak at 375 nm in the uv region further increasing the sonication time it extends to the visible region from 450 to 550 nm which might have resulted from the α fe2o3 46 after adding ag nanoparticles the high absorbance peak indicates the interaction between ag and zno α fe2o3 nanocomposites due to the spr effect 47 these results explain that the ag zno α fe2o3 bunch of flowers photocatalyst significantly enhances the visible light absorption the pl measurements of the 1s 2s and 3s and ag 2s bunch of flowers photocatalysts are shown in fig 4 all the samples show emission at 408 and 465 nm which confirms the electron excitation from the vb to the cb 48 we can observe the following order of the high intensity emission peaks 1s 3s 2s 2s ag as illustrated in fig 4 the strong peak for 1s is derived from the large population of electrons and holes recombination rate with low efficiency charge carriers after increasing the sonication to 2 h the electron recombination rate is reduced but still yields the emission at 408 and 465 nm compared to 1s and 3s the 2s bunch of flower nanoparticles show a synergistic effect between zno and α fe2o3 that can increase the photogenerated electrons and holes which enhance the photocatalytic activity in addition the reduced emission peak indicates that the ag acts to trap photogenerated electrons leading to higher activity in ag zno α fe2o3 28 this reduction in peak intensity produces the lowest recombination rate and results in more oxygen radicals the xps survey spectra reveal the elemental composition of the zno 2s and ag 2s bunch of flower composites as illustrated in fig 5 a in fig 5 b the o1s peak at 531 ev can be attributed to the o2 in the zno catalyst the binding energy of the oxygen in 2s shifted to a lower level when compared with the zno which confirms the formation of zn o and fe o 49 50 it should be noted that the addition of α fe2o3 to zno leads to changes in the energy levels of the oxygen vacancies which favor the photogeneration of electrons and holes between zno and α fe2o3 as shown in fig 5 b in the spectral analysis the exhibited peaks at 1022 16 and 1045 07 ev correspond to the phase of 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 from zn as shown in fig 5 c 51 in addition the peaks at 724 5 ev and 710 66 ev can be attributed to fe3 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 confirming the presence of α fe2o3 nanoparticles on the bunches of zno flowers 52 the binding energies of the peaks at 367 1 and 373 3 ev correspond to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 and this is associated with the interaction between ag and the bunches of zno flowers with α fe2o3 nanoparticles and is in good agreement with other reports 53 3 2 photo fenton degradation fig 6 a shows the photo fenton degradation performance of mb dye using the photodeposited ag 2s photocatalyst the absorption peak from the dye shows an intensive peak at 664 nm the intensity of this peak decreases with increased irradiation time thus confirming the removal of mb dye the remaining amount of mb dye in the photocatalyst solution using zno 1s 2s 3s and the ag 2s photocatalyst with h2o2 is shown in fig 6 b the shorter degradation time is observed for ag 2s when compared with 1s 2s and 3s at the ph of 3 the different experimental conditions such as ph and the molar ratio of h2o2 was optimized for the mb degradation with various time intervals as shown in fig 6 c and d the low ph value of 3 confirms higher degradation when compared with the other ph values the degradation performance was increased to 99 3 from 63 43 which observe the effect of the ph in the photo fenton reaction the ag 2s nanocomposite shows little influence on the degradation of mb dye when varying the concentration of the h2o2 as illustrated in fig 6 d fig 7 a shows the comparison of mb degradation for all the catalysts with and without h2o2 solution these results proved that after introducing the h2o2 solution the degradation percentage was increased more when compared without h2o2 during the photo fenton reaction a greater number of hydroxyl radicals are produced with h2o2 the degradation percentage obtained using the 1s nanocomposite was 47 without h2o2 after h2o2 was mixed into the solution the degradation percentage increased to 68 at 30 min identical results were detected for the 3s photocatalyst with and without h2o2 showing the degradation ability for mb dye of 50 2 and 75 respectively at 30 min for the ag 2s bunch of flower photocatalyst with h2o2 almost complete degradation 99 8 was achieved within 30 min whereas without h2o2 about 77 degradation was observed even at 30 min to confirm the reactive species of the hydroxyl radicals oh we used terephthalic acid ta as a scavenger solution and measure the flouresence spectra when ag zno α fe2o3 catalyst in the presence of h2o2 more oh radicals are generated when compared with no h2o2 which prevents the recombination rate of electron hole pairs 54 in this reaction ta does not respond with o2 or h2o2 and the fluorescent ta activated with hydroxyl radicals oh which are transformed into active 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid hta fig 7 b shows the pl intensities of hta with h2o2 at different time intervals and compared without h2o2 the inset figure shows the pl spectra of hta at 443 nm with the corresponding irradiation time the fluorescence peak progressively increased corresponding to the reaction time this may be due to the development of the hta molecules concerning degradation time and confirmed with the detection of hta by fluorescence measurements the results indicate that the ag deposited on the flower shaped zno α fe2o3 composites with h2o2 produced more oh radicals than without h2o2 and this mechanism helps to understand the increasing number of oh radicals during photocatalytic reactions 55 the as prepared nanocomposite catalyst was examined to evaluate its reusability as shown in fig 7 c even after the 3rd consecutive photo catalytic experiment the degradation efficiency was still as high as 93 these results reveal that the composite possesses good photo stability a schematic diagram of the growth process is shown in fig 8 during the growth process the initial 1 h of ultrasonication is not enough to form the flower shaped bunches of zno but only helps to grow the nanosheet base for the bunches of flowers the zno nanosheet acts as a nucleation site for the zn2 that leads to the growth of flower shaped bunches of zno during the photocatalytic reaction the heterojunction and light absorption is the important parameter responsible for transport and degradation of the dye molecules also it should be noted that the vb band of zno is more positive and the cb of α fe2o3 is slightly negative 56 58 when ag zno α fe2o3 nanocomposites is irradiated with visible light α fe2o3 could act as a sensitizer to absorb the visible light rather than zno 59 as a narrow bandgap semiconductor electrons in α fe2o3 nanoparticles can easily be excited by visible light and transferred to zno the integration of ag particles on zno α fe2o3 composites surfaces which increases the electron transfer rate and produces superoxide radicals also spr increased the photon absorption and excited more electrons to move to the zno and α fe2o3 heterojunctions under visible light 57 generally ag is used as an electron collector in the semiconductor heterojunctions with effective spr thus extending the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons this was confirmed by the uv vis measurements which showed the band shift in the visible region moreover the addition of h2o2 influences the photocatalytic activity of the materials the h2o2 can directly react with excited electrons to produce highly reactive species such as oh radicals eqns 3 4 60 furthermore it is expected that at lower ph hetero fenton reactions occurred with α fe2o3 and h2o2 in the presence of visible light eqs 5 7 56 61 3 ag zno α fe2o3 hv zno α fe2o3 e cb h vb 4 h2o2 ads e cb oh oh 5 fe3 h2o2 ho2 fe2 h 6 fe3 ho2 o2 fe2 h 7 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh mb degradation takes place in the presence of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radical anions o2 during dye degradation the holes in the valence band oxidized water molecule to generate oh radicals which also enhance the photocatalytic activity as displayed in table 1 our ag 2s photocatalyst took a shorter time to complete the degradation process using photo fenton reaction than previously reported work 28 41 62 68 also we used congo red cr dye as a pollutant to confirm that the ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst can efficiently degrade the organic pollutant within 50 min as shown in s1 a this result showed that after introducing a h2o2 solution the degradation percentage increased more when compared without h2o2 we observed that the degradation of cr for the 3s photocatalyst with and without h2o2 was 99 8 and 60 respectively for the ag 2s bunch of flowers photocatalyst with h2o2 almost complete degradation 99 8 was achieved within 50 min whereas without h2o2 about 77 degradation was observed at 50 min as illustrated in s1 b a faster degradation rate of the mb dye was also observed at 30 min when compared with the cr dye as shown in s1 c 3 3 gas phase analysis of hydroxyl radicals by drift in order to confirm the photogeneration mechanism drift analysis was used to identify the gas phase oxidation of ethanol and to subsequently understand the progress of intermediate products which play a vital role in a catalytic reaction here ethanol acts as a donor or sacrificial species to be oxidized by oh radicals for the generation of photoelectrons which are then converted to formaldehyde or co2 during the oxidation the photogenerated reaction can be recognized from the oh and h species and the holes are formed by the irradiated light which reacts with h2o to produce oh radicals 69 70 the combination of electrons and surface oxygen on the heterojunctions of the nanocomposites produce o2 radicals which further react with h2o to produce oh fig 9 a shows the drift measurement of the 2s photocatalyst after irradiation of 1 15 min under irradiation of light at o2 atmosphere here we discuss the charge separation sites by the hydroxyl groups that are responsible for the adsorption of ethanol and initiate the photooxidation reaction the drift results show the broader absorption centered at 3490 cm 1 which is due to the oh groups from stronger hydrogen bonding 71 further acetate peaks occurred around 2934 and 2971 cm 1 which replicate the ch stretching vibration of ethanol reflecting the adsorption ability of ethanol on the bunch of zno α fe2o3 nanoflowers this ch bond decreased after the irradiation time was increased in direct proportion to the formation of reactant products and the deformation of molecular ethanol on the nanocomposites surface the sharp peaks at 1047 and 1097 cm 1 also decreased based on the amounts of co groups in the ethanol reacting with oh radicals this is due to the fact that the co bond of ethanol was the most active band and was easily attacked by the oh group it is worth noting that the coo symmetric stretching at 1371 cm 1 indicates the formation of carbonyl of monodentate acetate species further the peaks for coo symmetric stretching after irradiation by light from 1 15 min was observed which confirms the combination of ethanol and oh groups on the catalyst leading to the generation of acetate moreover the band at 1453 and 1581 cm 1 indicative of asymmetrical vibration of methyl generates the cc which confirms the formation of bidentate acetate species from adsorbed ethanol 72 73 this process was started with ethanol adsorption on the catalyst through its hydroxyl group in the form of ethoxy species and rearranged with acetaldehyde finally acetaldehyde is converted into a gas phase of co2 fig 9 a does not show the main products of co2 at 2342 cm 1 and it only observes the acetaldehyde intermediate products suggesting that partial oxidation was observed on the 2s sample fig 9 b shows the ag zno α fe2o3 nanoflowers with different irradiation times after one min irradiation the gas phase of co2 occurred on the ag deposited zno α fe2o3 nanoflowers the peak was detected in the region at 2319 and 2359 cm 1 which shows the photocatalytic reaction between the zno α fe2o3 heterojunction and the ag metal these results are consistent with the observation of co2 within the gaseous effluent stream during photo oxidation of ethanol under irradiation of visible light when increasing the light irradiation from 1 15 min the ethanol deformation was observed and converted into co2 formation with the help of surface oxygen as can be seen the high intensity of vcc and vco stretching at 1047 and 1097 cm 1 of ethanol was suppressed which suggests that ethanol is completely converted in the reaction products further the infrared absorption shows the peak positions at 1371 due to coo stretching of hcoo and it is gradually consumed after decreasing the irradiation from 1 15 min the asymmetric vibration peak at 1459 and 1535 cm 1 which generates the cc formation of bidentate acetate species was greatly reduced as illustrated in fig 9 b these peaks indicate that the surface ethoxy species of ag 2s was converted into bidentate acetate using surface oxygen and was then further converted into co2 the ag 2s photocatalyst underwent a strong oxidation reaction with adsorbed molecular ethanol and was converted into the main product of the co2 the photooxidation processes generate highly oxidizing radicals mainly hydroxyl radicals oh that are involved in the conversion of highly toxic compounds into less harmful compounds of co2 similarly in the photocatalytic reaction the ag 2s photocatalyst is found to be more efficient when compared with the 2s photocatalyst thus leading to the higher rate of conversion of toxic compounds to the non toxic small molecules and better photodegradation of mb dye 4 conclusions the photodeposition of ag nanoparticles on the sonochemical synthesized

14123,we report the preparation of flower shaped zno bunches with the α fe2o3 photocatalyst using the sonochemical method followed by the photodeposition of ag nanoparticles the ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst was utilized for the removal of the environmental pollutant methylene blue mb dye from our results it was found that the ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst exhibited higher photocatalytic activity when compared to zno α fe2o3 with the addition of h2o2 moreover the higher plasmon resonance activity of the ag with a photocatalyst degraded the mb dye within 30 min in the presence of h2o2 the different ph and the molar ratio of h2o2 were influenced by the degradation performance in addition the zno α fe2o3 and ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalysts were used for the generation of the oh radicals and the formation of formaldehyde and co2 as analyzed by diffuse reflectance infra red transmission drift spectroscopy keywords nanocomposites zno α fe2o3 photocatalysis photo fenton dye degradation 1 introduction currently the burning of fossil fuels remains one of the most important sources of energy in the world but it is also one of the chief sources of pollutants and a contributor to climate change however due to global warming the search for alternate energy sources and ways to eliminate organic pollutants and convert them into useable forms such as co2 and h2o has become a top concern 1 2 many techniques to produce renewable energy without the emission of carbon have been developed for example the process of water splitting was evaluated under sunlight and various semiconductor materials have been studied because of their direct bandgap and physiochemical properties 3 based on such superior properties researchers have focused on the development of semiconductor nanomaterials with the high surface area and effective plasmonic resonance performance which are crucial for novel applications such as in energy devices 4 and for the removal of organic pollutants 5 6 further a better material for application in the visible light region utilizing a wide range of the solar energy spectrum is much needed many semiconductors have been successfully created from a variety of materials including wo3 7 fe2o3 8 cafe2o4 9 and tio2 10 for the degradation of organic pollutants and their conversion into formate species during the reduction process among these semiconductor materials α fe2o3 is one of the most attractive with excellent optical properties that extend from uv to the visible light spectrum 11 12 its nano sized hematite particles are highly active for the electron transfer that is used for the degradation of organic pollutants besides α fe2o3 zno is another of the most attractive n type semiconductors having many potential applications 13 14 efforts are being made to improve the characteristic of zno to allow it to perform as a visible light photocatalyst by doping with transition metals or combining it with other narrowband semiconductors such as fe2o3 and wo3 15 17 many studies have used zno and α fe2o3 as heterojunctions for hydrogenation with a low bandgap and the ability to stimulate the photo response of electrons and holes 17 19 the literature includes many reports of significant organic degradation observed by visible light absorption using materials decorated with noble metals 20 21 nevertheless it is still essential to improve these visible light photocatalysts to achieve the necessary photocatalytic oxidation of ethanol for conversion into useful species by solar energy 22 the noble metals such as ag au and pt are responsible for the surface plasmon response which makes them good standard materials for photocatalysis 23 25 interestingly silver has recently proven to be one of the best materials for combining with semiconductors to function as a visible light photocatalyst as it has demonstrated excellent performance in many applications such as co2 reduction 26 h2 evaluation 27 and the degradation of organic pollutants 28 in addition ag nanoparticles are effectively able to absorb light with a strong attachment to the semiconductor materials as well as being able to enrich the reduction and oxidation reactions 29 further it has been demonstrated that surface plasmon resonance spr is employed in the transfer of interfacial charge carriers on the semiconductor surface 30 31 it has been found that n type semiconductors with ag metal demonstrated improved photoabsorption and faster exciton generation in the conduction band depending on the structure and size of the particles 32 there are various methods which can be utilized for the evaluation of photocatalytic activity such as the sol gel 33 hydrothermal 34 sonochemical 35 36 and chemical vapor methods 37 of these the sonochemical method is appropriate for the generation of nanoparticles based on acoustic cavitation it can be used for the synthesis of many nanocomposites and for the treatment of wastewater the major advantage of ultrasonication is the control of the hydrolysis reaction which is formed from a homogeneous solution that leads to the formation of the seed nuclei in the solution 38 this method is both efficient and simple and creates physical attraction between the materials to improve the photocatalytic properties 39 in our work we ultrasonically synthesized bunches of zno flowers with α fe2o3 nanocomposites to act as a visible light photocatalyst the influence of various ultrasonication times of the zno α fe2o3 composites was investigated ag metal was photodeposited on the flower shaped zno α fe2o3 composite that showed excellent morphology and extended the visible light response the degradation of mb dye was analyzed by observations at regular intervals of time and it was concluded that faster catalytic activity was achieved with h2o2 than without the h2o2 solution to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the systematic study of the photooxidation of ethanol was performed by ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst the in situ drift spectra results confirm that oh plays a dynamic role in photooxidation 2 experimental method 2 1 preparation of zno bunches of flowers with the α fe2o3 photocatalyst zinc acetate and ferric nitrate precursors were used for the preparation of the bunch of flower composites 0 3 mol of zinc acetate and 0 1 mol of ferric nitrate were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water the ph of the above solution was maintained at 1 5 by adding a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution the reaction solution was sonicated an ultrasonic probe xinzhi co china jy92 2d ti horn 100 w 40 khz 10 mm diameter for different time intervals of 1 2 and 3 h at 25 c then the separation of zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites was done by centrifugation finally the separated materials were washed with water and ethanol and heated in an oven at 60 c for six hours in order to achieve good crystallinity of the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites the samples were annealed at 450 c for four hours the three different sonication times i e 1 2 and 3 h samples are referred to as 1s 2s and 3s respectively 2 2 photodeposition of ag on zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composite the photodeposition of ag nanoparticles on the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composite was as follows 100 mg 2s sample was dispersed in 20 ml of 1 1 ethanol water mixer aliquot of ag ions was prepared by dissolving silver nitrate in deionized water the 5 wt ag concentration solution is calculated in relation to the weight of the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites the ag solution was added into the above zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composites suspension and this solution was kept under uv light for 1 h the ag deposited on the zno α fe2o3 nanoflower composite was cleaned using water and ethanol lastly the synthesized materials were heated in an oven at 60 c for six hours this sample is referred to as ag 2s 2 3 in situ diffuse reflectance infrared transmittance study the photooxidation of ethanol was analyzed with a ft ir perkin elmer using an mct detector the caf2 window was used for the ft ir measurement with 64 scans for each spectrum with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the photocatalytic oxidation performance of the zno α fe2o3 and ag zno α fe2o3 composites was observed with different visible light irradiation times of 1 3 6 9 12 and 15 min the values of the ir absorbance intensity a measured with single beam intensity isb and reference beam intensity i0 were calculated from the equation 1 a log i0 isb 2 4 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic process of as synthesized nanocomposites was studied for the removal of mb dye a 350 w mercury xenon lamp xe350 prosper technology taiwan with intensity of 380 8 μw cm2 at a wavelength of 380 nm was used as the visible light source for this photodegradation process 30 mg of the as prepared photocatalysts were added to 50 ml of a 5 ppm mb dye aqueous solution then the mixing solution was magnetically stirred for 30 min under dark to ensure the absorption desorption condition after 30 min the light source was introduced into the photocatalyst solution and sample solutions were taken every 5 min to monitor the degradation rate the clear collected solution was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer the percentage of dye removal was calculated using the following equation 2 dye removal co ce co x 100 where co is the concentration of the dye under dark and ce is the concentration of the dye at equilibrium to carry out photo fenton experiments the 0 5 ml of h2o2 was mixed into the photocatalyst solution the photo fenton reaction was monitored using pl measurement with various time intervals 2 5 characterization the x ray diffraction results were measured analytical x pert 246

the 1s 2s 3s and ag 2s photocatalyst samples prepared with different sonication times at 1 h sonication zno and α fe2o3 peaks with very low intensity were observed at 2θ values of 31 15 33 21 and 35 20 as shown in fig 1 a 40 41 after 1 h of sonication we can see that the crystallization of zno attributed to high intensity peaks at 30 98 35 45 and 38 25 with α fe2o3 peaks at 33 29 and 49 89 which confirms the growth of α fe2o3 nanoparticles on the zno bunches of flowers 42 at 3 h sonication the peak intensities were observed to be low when compared with the 2 h sonication this suggests that a long sonication time 3 h leads to diminishing the growth of zno and α fe2o3 after photodeposition of ag the 2θ peaks observed at 40 27 and 46 68 prove the existence of ag nanoparticles on the bunch of flower nanocomposites 43 fe sem images of the 1s 2s 3s and ag 2s photocatalysts are shown in fig 2 after 1 h we observed the formation of nanosheet like shapes which might be the base for the growing bunch of flowers as shown in fig 2 a furthermore it was found that the surface morphology of the as prepared 2 h sonication displayed the flower like bunches of zno with α fe2o3 nanoparticles present on them as shown in fig 2 c the pure zno flower structure is shown in s2 after two hours of sonication the zno bunches of flowers were visible as illustrated in fig 2 d however after 3 h the zno α fe2o3 flowers could not be clearly seen because the zno flowers were broken up by the longer sonication time as illustrated in fig 2 b the structure indicates the growth of zno combined with α fe2o3 bunches of flowers after sonication at 2 h with the addition of ag nanoparticles as shown in fig 2 e h fig 2 e h indicates the flower petals structures with nanoparticles embedded in a bunch of zno α fe2o3 the photo deposition of ag metal on the zno α fe2o3 flowers photocatalyst yielded small sized ag nanoparticles the diffraction values of 0 302 and 0 259 nm confirm the presence of ag 44 and α fe2o3 45 nanoparticles respectively on the zno flowers from hr tem the mapping result shows the clear identification of uniform assemblies of ag α fe2o3 and zno bunches of flowers edx observation indicates the existence of zn ag o and fe elements in the ag deposited zno fe2o3 bunch of flower nanocomposites the uv vis spectra were collected to measure the optical absorption of the 1s 2s 3s and ag 2s bunch of flower photocatalysts as shown in fig 3 for 1 h sonication it exhibited only a zno absorption peak at 375 nm in the uv region further increasing the sonication time it extends to the visible region from 450 to 550 nm which might have resulted from the α fe2o3 46 after adding ag nanoparticles the high absorbance peak indicates the interaction between ag and zno α fe2o3 nanocomposites due to the spr effect 47 these results explain that the ag zno α fe2o3 bunch of flowers photocatalyst significantly enhances the visible light absorption the pl measurements of the 1s 2s and 3s and ag 2s bunch of flowers photocatalysts are shown in fig 4 all the samples show emission at 408 and 465 nm which confirms the electron excitation from the vb to the cb 48 we can observe the following order of the high intensity emission peaks 1s 3s 2s 2s ag as illustrated in fig 4 the strong peak for 1s is derived from the large population of electrons and holes recombination rate with low efficiency charge carriers after increasing the sonication to 2 h the electron recombination rate is reduced but still yields the emission at 408 and 465 nm compared to 1s and 3s the 2s bunch of flower nanoparticles show a synergistic effect between zno and α fe2o3 that can increase the photogenerated electrons and holes which enhance the photocatalytic activity in addition the reduced emission peak indicates that the ag acts to trap photogenerated electrons leading to higher activity in ag zno α fe2o3 28 this reduction in peak intensity produces the lowest recombination rate and results in more oxygen radicals the xps survey spectra reveal the elemental composition of the zno 2s and ag 2s bunch of flower composites as illustrated in fig 5 a in fig 5 b the o1s peak at 531 ev can be attributed to the o2 in the zno catalyst the binding energy of the oxygen in 2s shifted to a lower level when compared with the zno which confirms the formation of zn o and fe o 49 50 it should be noted that the addition of α fe2o3 to zno leads to changes in the energy levels of the oxygen vacancies which favor the photogeneration of electrons and holes between zno and α fe2o3 as shown in fig 5 b in the spectral analysis the exhibited peaks at 1022 16 and 1045 07 ev correspond to the phase of 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 from zn as shown in fig 5 c 51 in addition the peaks at 724 5 ev and 710 66 ev can be attributed to fe3 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 confirming the presence of α fe2o3 nanoparticles on the bunches of zno flowers 52 the binding energies of the peaks at 367 1 and 373 3 ev correspond to ag 3d5 2 and ag 3d3 2 and this is associated with the interaction between ag and the bunches of zno flowers with α fe2o3 nanoparticles and is in good agreement with other reports 53 3 2 photo fenton degradation fig 6 a shows the photo fenton degradation performance of mb dye using the photodeposited ag 2s photocatalyst the absorption peak from the dye shows an intensive peak at 664 nm the intensity of this peak decreases with increased irradiation time thus confirming the removal of mb dye the remaining amount of mb dye in the photocatalyst solution using zno 1s 2s 3s and the ag 2s photocatalyst with h2o2 is shown in fig 6 b the shorter degradation time is observed for ag 2s when compared with 1s 2s and 3s at the ph of 3 the different experimental conditions such as ph and the molar ratio of h2o2 was optimized for the mb degradation with various time intervals as shown in fig 6 c and d the low ph value of 3 confirms higher degradation when compared with the other ph values the degradation performance was increased to 99 3 from 63 43 which observe the effect of the ph in the photo fenton reaction the ag 2s nanocomposite shows little influence on the degradation of mb dye when varying the concentration of the h2o2 as illustrated in fig 6 d fig 7 a shows the comparison of mb degradation for all the catalysts with and without h2o2 solution these results proved that after introducing the h2o2 solution the degradation percentage was increased more when compared without h2o2 during the photo fenton reaction a greater number of hydroxyl radicals are produced with h2o2 the degradation percentage obtained using the 1s nanocomposite was 47 without h2o2 after h2o2 was mixed into the solution the degradation percentage increased to 68 at 30 min identical results were detected for the 3s photocatalyst with and without h2o2 showing the degradation ability for mb dye of 50 2 and 75 respectively at 30 min for the ag 2s bunch of flower photocatalyst with h2o2 almost complete degradation 99 8 was achieved within 30 min whereas without h2o2 about 77 degradation was observed even at 30 min to confirm the reactive species of the hydroxyl radicals oh we used terephthalic acid ta as a scavenger solution and measure the flouresence spectra when ag zno α fe2o3 catalyst in the presence of h2o2 more oh radicals are generated when compared with no h2o2 which prevents the recombination rate of electron hole pairs 54 in this reaction ta does not respond with o2 or h2o2 and the fluorescent ta activated with hydroxyl radicals oh which are transformed into active 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid hta fig 7 b shows the pl intensities of hta with h2o2 at different time intervals and compared without h2o2 the inset figure shows the pl spectra of hta at 443 nm with the corresponding irradiation time the fluorescence peak progressively increased corresponding to the reaction time this may be due to the development of the hta molecules concerning degradation time and confirmed with the detection of hta by fluorescence measurements the results indicate that the ag deposited on the flower shaped zno α fe2o3 composites with h2o2 produced more oh radicals than without h2o2 and this mechanism helps to understand the increasing number of oh radicals during photocatalytic reactions 55 the as prepared nanocomposite catalyst was examined to evaluate its reusability as shown in fig 7 c even after the 3rd consecutive photo catalytic experiment the degradation efficiency was still as high as 93 these results reveal that the composite possesses good photo stability a schematic diagram of the growth process is shown in fig 8 during the growth process the initial 1 h of ultrasonication is not enough to form the flower shaped bunches of zno but only helps to grow the nanosheet base for the bunches of flowers the zno nanosheet acts as a nucleation site for the zn2 that leads to the growth of flower shaped bunches of zno during the photocatalytic reaction the heterojunction and light absorption is the important parameter responsible for transport and degradation of the dye molecules also it should be noted that the vb band of zno is more positive and the cb of α fe2o3 is slightly negative 56 58 when ag zno α fe2o3 nanocomposites is irradiated with visible light α fe2o3 could act as a sensitizer to absorb the visible light rather than zno 59 as a narrow bandgap semiconductor electrons in α fe2o3 nanoparticles can easily be excited by visible light and transferred to zno the integration of ag particles on zno α fe2o3 composites surfaces which increases the electron transfer rate and produces superoxide radicals also spr increased the photon absorption and excited more electrons to move to the zno and α fe2o3 heterojunctions under visible light 57 generally ag is used as an electron collector in the semiconductor heterojunctions with effective spr thus extending the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons this was confirmed by the uv vis measurements which showed the band shift in the visible region moreover the addition of h2o2 influences the photocatalytic activity of the materials the h2o2 can directly react with excited electrons to produce highly reactive species such as oh radicals eqns 3 4 60 furthermore it is expected that at lower ph hetero fenton reactions occurred with α fe2o3 and h2o2 in the presence of visible light eqs 5 7 56 61 3 ag zno α fe2o3 hv zno α fe2o3 e cb h vb 4 h2o2 ads e cb oh oh 5 fe3 h2o2 ho2 fe2 h 6 fe3 ho2 o2 fe2 h 7 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh mb degradation takes place in the presence of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radical anions o2 during dye degradation the holes in the valence band oxidized water molecule to generate oh radicals which also enhance the photocatalytic activity as displayed in table 1 our ag 2s photocatalyst took a shorter time to complete the degradation process using photo fenton reaction than previously reported work 28 41 62 68 also we used congo red cr dye as a pollutant to confirm that the ag zno α fe2o3 photocatalyst can efficiently degrade the organic pollutant within 50 min as shown in s1 a this result showed that after introducing a h2o2 solution the degradation percentage increased more when compared without h2o2 we observed that the degradation of cr for the 3s photocatalyst with and without h2o2 was 99 8 and 60 respectively for the ag 2s bunch of flowers photocatalyst with h2o2 almost complete degradation 99 8 was achieved within 50 min whereas without h2o2 about 77 degradation was observed at 50 min as illustrated in s1 b a faster degradation rate of the mb dye was also observed at 30 min when compared with the cr dye as shown in s1 c 3 3 gas phase analysis of hydroxyl radicals by drift in order to confirm the photogeneration mechanism drift analysis was used to identify the gas phase oxidation of ethanol and to subsequently understand the progress of intermediate products which play a vital role in a catalytic reaction here ethanol acts as a donor or sacrificial species to be oxidized by oh radicals for the generation of photoelectrons which are then converted to formaldehyde or co2 during the oxidation the photogenerated reaction can be recognized from the oh and h species and the holes are formed by the irradiated light which reacts with h2o to produce oh radicals 69 70 the combination of electrons and surface oxygen on the heterojunctions of the nanocomposites produce o2 radicals which further react with h2o to produce oh fig 9 a shows the drift measurement of the 2s photocatalyst after irradiation of 1 15 min under irradiation of light at o2 atmosphere here we discuss the charge separation sites by the hydroxyl groups that are responsible for the adsorption of ethanol and initiate the photooxidation reaction the drift results show the broader absorption centered at 3490 cm 1 which is due to the oh groups from stronger hydrogen bonding 71 further acetate peaks occurred around 2934 and 2971 cm 1 which replicate the ch stretching vibration of ethanol reflecting the adsorption ability of ethanol on the bunch of zno α fe2o3 nanoflowers this ch bond decreased after the irradiation time was increased in direct proportion to the formation of reactant products and the deformation of molecular ethanol on the nanocomposites surface the sharp peaks at

stretching after irradiation by light from 1 15 min was observed which confirms the combination of ethanol and oh groups on the catalyst leading to the generation of acetate moreover the band at 1453 and 1581 cm 1 indicative of asymmetrical vibration of methyl generates the cc which confirms the formation of bidentate acetate species from adsorbed ethanol 72 73 this process was started with ethanol adsorption on the catalyst through its hydroxyl group in the form of ethoxy species and rearranged with acetaldehyde finally acetaldehyde is converted into a gas phase of co2 fig 9 a does not show the main products of co2 at 2342 cm 1 and it only observes the acetaldehyde intermediate products suggesting that partial oxidation was observed on the 2s sample fig 9 b shows the ag zno α fe2o3 nanoflowers with different irradiation times after one min irradiation the gas phase of co2 occurred on the ag deposited zno α fe2o3 nanoflowers the peak was detected in the region at 2319 and 2359 cm 1 which shows the photocatalytic reaction between the zno α fe2o3 heterojunction and the ag metal these results are consistent with the observation of co2 within the gaseous effluent stream during photo oxidation of ethanol under irradiation of visible light when increasing the light irradiation from 1 15 min the ethanol deformation was observed and converted into co2 formation with the help of

at 1459 and 1535 cm 1 which generates the cc formation of bidentate acetate species was greatly reduced as illustrated in fig 9 b these peaks indicate that the surface ethoxy species of ag 2s was

14124,calcium phosphates cps are excellent sorbents with hydroxyapatite being the most commonly used for heavy metal removal from ecological samples the use of more acidic brushite as a cp sorbent can be justified by its greater ph compatibility with particular types of soil such as soil in the areas of high rainfall but also iron containing soil prone to oxidative weathering and soil nitrified

penetrate even the least permeable biological barriers these heavy ions are considered a severe threat to human life and the timely treatment of wastewaters and contaminated soils for the removal of these metals is a crucial factor for enabling sustainable industrial development 1 lead pb is a highly toxic metal and its release to the environment is tied to a number of technological processes including armor production storage battery manufacturing metal mining and smelting and others moreover because of its non biodegradable nature its residence time in the environment is extremely long even for geological timescales 1 2 therefore the efficient environmental remediation of pb ii is a serious challenge and a precondition for the preservation of safe water and soil of the ecosystem a plethora of methodologies have been used before for the heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions such as electrochemical treatments chemical precipitation ion exchange polymeric resins and membrane technology 3 however most of these technologies are costly and time consuming the development of an efficient cheap fast and eco friendly sorbent material is one of the most sought goals on the road to sustainable development that does not relinquish the promises of high technologies 4 solid sorbents for elimination of toxic metals from wastewaters have included activated carbons metal oxides such as al2o3 and tio2 clay graphene and various polymeric materials 5 calcium phosphates cps have attracted the interest of developers of sorbents due to their thermal and chemical stability low cost of manufacture and low solubility in water 6 at the same time they have been used in biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility and in agriculture as nano fertilizers 4 this hints at the dual role possible to fulfill with the use of cps beneficial for the environmental flora and the microbial biome of the soil and eliminatory for the toxic ions contaminating them the most commonly applied cp phase for environmental remediation applications has been hydroxyapatite hap hap has been widely known for its excellent sorption characteristics which were used earlier to immobilize heavy metals 7 radionuclides 8 and organic contaminants 9 in the form of nanoparticles hap has been utilized extensively for the treatment of wastewaters and for the removal of heavy metals such as cd ii pb ii zn ii cu ii and others 10 jing et al for example used nano hap and found out that the adsorption capacities were 3289 3150 3061 and 2784 mg g for pb ii zn ii ni ii and cd ii respectively 11 in some cases as for cd ii where there is a high similarity with the charge and the size of the calcium ion 95 pm vs 100 pm respectively ionic exchange is the dominant sequestration mechanism for other ions such as pb ii the removal mechanism involves an additional precipitation of a new phase on the cp surface composites containing cp as one of the components oftentimes show a better sorption profile than pure cps hap supplemented with a magnetic phase for example exhibits a higher removal capacity than pure hap for ions such as cd ii and zn ii 10 addition of 500 mg l fulvic acid to dispersions of nano hap also increased the elution rate of soil cd ii from 2 8 to 8 5 12 the efficiency of removal of pb ii using hap carbon embedded in the sugarcane stem structure was also relatively high at 210 69 mg g at the concentration of 200 mg l of pb ii with the removal mechanism involving ionic exchange between the structural ca ii ions and hydrated pb ii ions 13 zhang et al investigated the removal of pb ii from aqueous solutions using hap calcium silicate hydrate and concluded that pb ii adsorption capacity is slightly dependent on the ionic strength and strongly dependent on ph 1 wang et al studied hap biochar nanocomposites for the removal of pb ii cu ii and zn ii from their aqueous solutions and showed that the adsorption isotherm followed langmuir s model for pb ii and freundlich s model for cu ii and zn ii 14 moreover hao et al studied the effect of the hap particle morphology on the removal of pb ii and found out that the maximum adsorption capacity of 819 7 mg g was achieved for the dandelion like shape of hap 15 in contrast to hap which is the major cp phase forming by chemical precipitation in alkaline conditions brushite is the major cp phase forming by precipitation in the acidic conditions because of this brushite is usually associated with the final or intermediate forms of cp in pathological calcification deposits 16 also because of its lesser stability and also lesser propensity for ionic exchange brushite has been less explored for sequestration of toxic heavy metals from contaminated environments a simple web of science search turns up hundreds of studies on the sorption of heavy metals using hap but less than a dozen on the use of brushite for the same application and none on the use of brushite composites however rare reports comparing its ability to sequester pb ii show that it can be considerably higher than that of hap exceeding sorption capacities of 1000 mg g 17 one reason for this may be a possible difference in the sorption mechanism between brushite and hap accordingly in addition to the accommodation of heavy metal ions inside the lattice vacancies and as calcium ion substitutions a mechanism that is known to proceed effectively in brushite 18 pb ii also gets deposited on brushite through the epitaxial formation of the surface lead phosphate phase in a process that is intensely concentration dependent 19 for this reason the pretreatment of adsorbents with phosphates is known to increase the immobilization of pb ii on a number of mineral surfaces as much as the pretreatment with pb ii increases the sorption of phosphates 20 the adsorption of proteins can also be higher by a whole order of magnitude on as precipitated brushite than on as precipitated and sintered hap 21 this suggests that surface energetics and surface speciation may significantly favor the sorption on brushite compared to hap for a number of sorbates last but not least brushite decomposes at room temperature to mildly acidic products 22 as opposed to hap whose decomposition alkalizes the environment from this standpoint the use of brushite instead of hap as an environmental sorbent can be justified by its greater ph compatibility with particular types of soil such as soils in the areas of high rainfall due to incorporation of co2 in the form of carbonates but also soils nitrified by the use of ammonium fertilizers iron containing soils prone to oxidative weathering and soils laden with characteristic bacterial biomes in this study we synthesize composites comprising two different metal phosphates brushite and vivianite at different concentrations of the two phases these novel brushite vivianite composites are subsequently analyzed for their crystal structure particle morphology porosity surface topography thermal stability and mechanical performance in the next and the final step we have studied the removal efficiency of heavy metal ions including pb ii and cr vi from aqueous solutions with a particular emphasis on tuning the phase composition of the composite material for the most optimal performance in environmental remediation applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials synthesis brushite vivianite composites with the general chemical formula fexca1 x hpo4 2h2o 0 x 1 with the steps of 0 2 were synthesized via co precipitation method adapted from an earlier study by el dek et al 23 pure brushite x 0 0 was synthesized as follows aqueous solutions of 0 1 m of cacl2 2h2o merck and 0 1 m of nh4 2hpo4 were prepared separately the ph of ca solution was adjusted to 5 0 0 1 using dropwise addition of hcl then the phosphate solution was added dropwise to the ca solution continuously stirred to prepare composites containing vivianite ca solutions were supplemented with different concentrations of fecl2 4h2o including 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m while simultaneously decreasing the concentration of ca so that the total concentration of calcium and iron chloride in the solution equaled 0 1 m the yielded gels were aged for 24 h and then they were filtered and washed several times using doubly distilled water finally the samples were dried in air at 50 60 c 2 2 crystal structure analysis x ray diffraction was performed to identify the phases in the composite analytical x pert pro cu kα1 target λ 1 504 å 45 kv 40 ma netherlands the samples were scanned in the range of 4 2θ 70 with the step size of 0 02 and the scan time of 0 5 s structures were refined using maud software 24 25 2 3 surface morphology and roughness surface morphology was investigated via a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quantafeg 250 netherlands coupled to an energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopic probe the as synthesized powder samples were sputtered with gold for 60 s and inserted on a holder into the fesem instrument to be investigated the boundaries of each micrograph were cropped and processed via gwyddion 2 45 software to investigate their roughness 26 27 3d micrographs were obtained for each sample and the resolution of the micrographs was fixed at 1450 900 pixels the graphed edges were eliminated to avoid unwanted boundaries finally the roughness parameters were computed using the same software in nm 2 4 particle size distribution particle size distribution was investigated via a high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem jeol jme 2100 japan operated at the electron accelerating voltage of 200 kv the as synthesized powder samples were ultra sonicated in doubly distilled water for 20 min the copper grid was dipped into the suspension for approximately 30 s and then left to dry for 5 min after which it was inserted into the hrtem apparatus to be investigated 2 5 ftir spectra fourier transformed infrared ftir spectra were scanned using an ftir spectrometer perkin elmer 2000 in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 with the resolution of 0 5 cm 1 an automated routine co added 7200 interferograms collected at the given resolution and the resultant interferograms were fourier transformed 2 6 surface area analysis specific surface areas of the powdered samples were measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet technique nova 2000 series quantachrome usa 2 7 heavy metal removal adsorption of heavy metal ions was studied as a function of ph and contact time in the solution brushite vivianite powders in the amount of 0 1 g were added to 100 ml of the metal ion solutions with the standard concentration of 2 ppm lead nitrate and chromium nitrate solutions were used in the experiments the solutions were stirred on an electric shaker for 1 h at different ph values in the range of 2 8 the effect of the contact time variation on removal efficiency was studied by adding 0 2

collected at certain times throughout the 24 h incubation period to measure the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi species the atomic absorption spectra were collected on a perkinelmer aanalyst 100 device germany the removal efficiency was calculated according to the following expression 28 30 1 r e m o v a l a d s o r p t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c f c 0 100 where co and cf are initial and final concentrations mg l of lead ions in the solution respectively 2 8 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga was carried out from the room temperature up to 700 c in a thermal analyzer dtg 60h shimadzu japan using the air flow rate of 100 ml min the heating rate was 10 c min thermodynamic parameters for brushite vivianite and their thermal decomposition were estimated from the dynamic tga curves two theoretical models were utilized to process the kinetic parameters of reactions including coats redfern cr and horowitz metzger hm methods 31 the coats redfern cr model follows the formula 27 5 l n l n 1 α t 2 l n a r β e e r t where r is the universal gas constant α is the powder fraction that decomposes at time t e is the activation energy a is the arrhenius pre exponential factor and β dt dt which is the heating rate therefore if l n l n 1 α t 2 was plotted versus 1000 t the slope will be e 1000 r after e is estimated the intercept a could be calculated in addition horowitz metzger hm formula is the following 28 7 l n l n 1 α e θ r t s 2 where θ t ts and t is the given temperature and ts is the reaction step temperature obtained from the dtg curve here l n l n 1 α is plotted versus θ after which the slope e r t s 2 a β e x p e r t s enthalpy δh entropy δs and free energy of activation δg were all calculated after deriving e and a from cr and hm models specifically δs δh and δg were determined from the following eyring s expressions 31 6a δ h e r t 6b δ s r l n h a k t 6c δ g δ h t δ s 2 9 mechanical measurements the unit cell volume for brushite and vivianite crystals was calculated using the formula 8 ω a b c sin β where a b c and β are lattice parameters of hap unit cell also ω is unit cell volume represented in å3 to measure the contribution of each crystalline phase on the composite properties the modified theoretical density was 27 9 t d x b d x 1 v d x 2 where b and v represent the relative contribution fractions of brushite and vivanite respectively the experimental density ρ was measured using archimedes technique 32 33 while the relative porosity was computed as a ratio between the measured and calculated density dx using the formula 34 10 p 1 ρ d x 100 mechanical properties were investigated using the ultrasonic technique longitudinal and shear wave velocities vl and vs were calculated by measuring of the travelling time of sound waves across the sample volume using an ultrasonic flow detector krautkramer usn60 experiments were carried out using two longitudinal wave transducers 6 mhz karl deutsch

crystal structure of the brushite phase at 0 x 0 8 in order to thoroughly study and understand the effects of each component in brushite vivianite composites on their physicochemical properties and sorption capacity a series of composites with different phase compositions was synthesized their general chemical formula was fexca1 x hpo4 2h2o with 0 x 1 in steps of 0 2 fig 1 a e shows the refined xrd patterns of the given series of brushite vivianite structures including pure brushite x 0 and pure vivianite x 1 fig 2 a f meanwhile illustrates the output crystal structures expected from the refined data brushite x 0 0 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with the space group of c2 m fig 2a the brushite unit cell could be divided to two parts along the b axis each part has two ca and two p ions if the ca ions were counted from the upper left corner of the cell counterclockwise they are called ca 1 ca 2 ca 3 and ca 4 fig 2a the distance between ca 1 and ca 3 is 8 152 å one ca ion from both sides is connected to eight oxygen ions six of which are bonded to p ions while the residual two oxygens belong to the structural water molecules while the ca 1 ca 2 distance is 3 660 å it reaches 6 596 å for ca 3 ca 4 the angle of c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ is 108 148 while the angle c a 1 c a 2 c a 3 ˆ is 101 393 in addition there are two pairs of protons on both far sides along the b axis and the distance between them is identical for both pairs 4 904 å the distance between the protons could reach 14 962 å in which case they belong to the water molecules fig 2b illustrates the structure of the brushite phase at x 0 2 the distance between ca 1 and ca 2 is lower than in the pure phase x 0 0 indicating shrinkage along the c axis in contrast ca 3 and ca 4 move away from each other to compensate for the crystal charge redistribution thus while ca 1 ca 2 distance is 4 020 å it reaches 5 688 å for ca 3 ca 4 the distance between ca 1 and ca 3 is 8 133 å while the angle of c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ is 115 737 fig 2c shows the structure of the brushite phase at x 0 4 with ca 1 and ca 4 partially protruding out of the unit cell on both sides of the bc plane ca 5 and ca 6 are introduced to the same plane to preserve the charge neutrality the ca 1 ca 5 and ca 4 c 6 distances resulting from this perturbation are the same 5 818 å in addition the distance between ca 5 and ca 6 is 12 607 å while the ca 1 ca 3 distance is equal to the ca 2 ca 4 distance of 8 138 å and the c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ angle reverts to 105 940 in addition ca 1 ca 2 and ca 3 ca 4 distances are identical 3 961 å the brushite phase at x 0 6 is shown in fig 2d the two aforementioned segments of the unit cell here appear to be asymmetric specifically the ca 1 ca 3 distance equals the ca 2 ca 4 distance of 8 1455 å while c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ angle decreased to 95 256 this could be assigned to the contraction of the ca 3 ca 4 distance to 3 886 å and the expansion of the ca 1 ca 2 distance to 5 603 å at x 0 8 fig 2e the crystal structure of brushite does not only tend to simulate the x 0 0 structure but it also takes the same parameters including the ca 1 ca 3 and ca 2 ca 4 distances which are both equal at 8 150 å while the angle between c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ is 106 712 ca 1 ca 2 and ca 3 ca 4 distances are 3 607 å and 5 431 å respectively 3 1 2 crystal structure of the vivianite phase at 0 2 x 1 0 fig 3 a e displays the refined structure of the vivianite phase at different phase contents defined by the parameter x vivianite first appears in the system at x 0 2 as seen from fig 2a fe here possesses two inequivalent coordination sites namely fe 1 and fe 2 fe 1 is located in the center of the unit cell and is surrounded octahedrally by 6 oxygen ions 4 of which are parts of structural water molecules the bond lengths between fe 1 and the adjacent o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 ions are 3 2016 3 2016 3 267 and 3 367 å respectively fe 2 in contrast is coordinated to two oxygen ions o 4 and o 5 which belong to the water molecules with the bond length of 2 125 å along the b axis fe 2 forms pairs and the separation between them is 2 716 å similar distances equaling 2 902 å 36 and 2 850 å 37 were calculated earlier this pair of fe 2 ions is connected together via an oxygen bridge with the angle of 75 518 while fe 1 and fe 2 lie on the surface of the unit cell the po4 ion is embedded deep into its subsurface as a result the distance between fe 1 and p from the same side is 3 644 å fig 3b illustrates the vivianite phase at x 0 4 fe 1 here is coordinated to four oxygen ions namely o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 with the bond lengths of 4 332 4 332 2 519 and 2 519 å respectively the bond of fe 2 o 5 and fe 2 o 6 is 2 275 å while the separation of fe 1 fe 2 along the b axis reaches 2 885 å which is very close to the former value recorded by mori et al 37 in addition the angle of f e 2 o f e 2 ˆ is 76 322 the bond lengths between fe 1 and the surrounding o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 are 3 2016 3 2016 3 267 and 3 367 å respectively the configuration of vivianite at x 0 6 is shown in fig 3c fe 1 here is again connected to 6 oxygen ions and the bond lengths of fe 1 o 1 6 are 2 411 1 655 2 411 2 411 1 655 and 2 411 å respectively the angle of o 3 f e 1 o 4 ˆ and o 1 f e 1 o 6 ˆ is 112 202 while the angle between the other arms equals 96 870 along the a axis fe 2 is connected to o 7 and o 8 with the bond length of 3 152 å along the b axis fe ions are separated by a distance that does not exceed 3 011 å in addition p forms six triangular bonds along a and b axes these triangles are orientated up or down with respect to the c direction as a result the p o 9 and p o 11 bond lengths are 1 283 å while the p o 10 bond length is 1 124 å fig 3d illustrates the vivianite structure at x 0 8 where the central fe 1 is found on the top of a pyramidal configuration this pyramid has a triangular base the bond lengths for fe 1 o 1 fe 1 o 2 2 220 å while the fe 1 o 3 bond length is 2 030 å this variation of the bond lengths is accompanied by o 3 being bonded to the p ion with the bond length of 1 565 å in addition the head angles of the pyramid are 90 508 for o 1 f e 1 o 2 ˆ and 89 54 for o 1 f e 1 o 3 ˆ and o 2 f e 1 o 3 ˆ the fe 1 pyramid also relates to an inverse pyramid on the opposite side of the unit cell where the distance between f 1 fe 1 is 4 716 å on the other hand fe 2 is configured in a similar pyramidal configuration with o 4 o 5 and o 6 ions and the bond lengths of 2 148 2 103 and 2 160 å for fe 2 o 4 fe 2 o 5 and fe 2 o 6 respectively the following angles were also derived o 4 f e 2 o 5 ˆ at 93 429 o 5 f e 2 o 6 ˆ at 85 981 and o 6 f e 2 o 4 ˆ at 89 133 this inhomogeneity of angles and bond lengths in the case of fe 2 pyramids is accompanied by both o 5 and o 6 being bonded to p pyramids with bond lengths of 1 542 and 1 528 å also the separation of fe 2 ions lying along the b axis is 2 966 å finally fig 3e shows the configuration of vivianite at x 1 0 the phase composition at which it exists as a pure phase unmixed with brushite the similarity between x 1 0 and 0 8 is obvious nevertheless both bond lengths and angle values are different specifically the bond lengths forming the central pyramid between fe 1 o 1 o 2 and o 3 are 2 201 2 201 and 2 024 å respectively while the angles of o 1 f e 1 o 2 o 1 f e 1 o 3 ˆ and o 2 f e 1 o 3 ˆ are 94 092 86 056 and 86 056 respectively consequently the bond lengths and angles are lower than their respective values at x 0 8 the separation between the heads of fe 1 fe 1 pyramids is 4 697 å on the other hand fe 2 is surrounded by o 4 o 5 and o 6 with the bond lengths of 2 158 2 177 2 284 å respectively and the angles of o 4 f e 2 o 5 ˆ o 5 f e 2 o 6 ˆ and o 6 f e 2 o 4 ˆ equaling 94 217 88 540 and 90 668 respectively the fe 2 fe 2 separation along the b axis does not exceed 3 045 å while the f e 2 o f e 2 ˆ angle is 83 603 3 1 3 cumulative phase composition effects on the unit cell parameters table 1 shows selected bond lengths in the brushite phase at different phase contents defined by the parameter x overall it could be seen that the ca 1 ca 2 bond length starts from 3 661 å at x 0 0 then increases to 4 020 å at x 0 2 and achieves its highest value of 5 603 å at x 0 6 the ca 3 ca 4 bond follows the same trend but only from x 0 0 to x 0 4 after which it plunges down to 3 886 å at x 0 6 this bond length has a significant effect on the lattice parameter c at the same time the ca 1 ca 3 bond length shows the same values as that of the ca 2 ca 4 bond which supports the stability of the crystal in spite of the dramatic changes happening primarily along the b axis due to variations in the phase content table 2 displays selected bond lengths of the vivianite phase at different phase contents overall the oo distance along the a axis fluctuates as a function of x reaching its lowest value of 2 760 å at x 0 4 the separation of fe 2 fe 2 that affects the b axis length increases from 2 716 å at x 0 2 and reaches the highest value of 3 045 å at x 1 0 on the other hand the central separation of fe 1 fe 1 which equals the distance of fe 2 fe 2 along the a axis tends to decrease slightly with the parameter x starting from 4 749 å at x 0 0 and reaching 4 697 å at x 1 0 regarding the variation in the unit cell dimensions pure brushite x 0 0 is widest along the b axis while a and c axes are less than half of the b axis values namely 5 848 and 6 267 å respectively as the contribution of the brushite phase was lowered its a axis decreased slightly down to 5 818 å at x 0 4 after which it grew again the same trend was followed by the b and c axes which also achieved their lowest values at x 0 4 overall the b axis followed the trend of change in the ca 1 ca 3 bond length while the c axis followed the trend of change in the ca 3 ca 4 bond length as it is shown in fig 4 a b table 3 shows the lattice parameters of both brushite and vivianite at different values of the parameter x from which it is observable that the former bond lengths represent a crucial factor in determining the trend followed by lattice parameters concerning the lattice parameters of vivianite the a axis starts from 10 085 å at x 0 2 and then it grows to 10 121 å at x 0 4 which represents it highest value the trend in the lattice parameter a tends to follow that of the oo bond length as it is shown in fig 4c in contrast the b axis starts from 13 484 å at x 0 2 and then it increases to 13 500 å at x 0 6 after which it deteriorates the lattice parameter b follows the trend in the separation of fe 2 fe 2 ions which act as a spring along this same b axis up to x 0 8 in addition the β angle follows the trend of oo separation as it is shown in fig 4d a change in the lattice parameter c shows an overlapping trend with a change in the separation of fe 1 fe 1 and fe 2 fe 2 ions which lie approximately parallel to the c axis and which may be classifiable as surface ions the lattice distortion ε recorded its highest value at x 0 0 after which it drastically deteriorated overall these data indicate a significant crystallographic influence of the two phases brushite and vivianite on each other this mutual effect is largely dependent on the phase composition in the material and can be varied by controlling the ca fe molar ratio in the synthesis stage 3 2 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of composites at different values of the parameter x are shown in fig 5 they demonstrate that the characteristic infrared bands of pure brushite i e x 0 0 composition are detectable at 527 and 574 cm 1 and are attributable to the bending mode of pop whereas the band at 790 1 cm 1 is assigned to water libration 38 39 the bands at 870 and 998 cm 1 indicate the ν 1 stretching vibrational modes of p o h and po respectively 38 the band at 1131 cm 1 in the spectrum of pure brushite x 0 0 represents the ν 3 stretching vibration mode of po 38 this stretching mode of the po group can also be detected as bands at 1064 and 1131 cm 1 40 the reversal of this frequency splitting detected for x 0 2 compositions indicates that the po mode is coordinated to the vibrational mode of fe2 41 the band at 1645 cm 1 could be attributed to the bending mode of the hoh group constituting structural water molecules while the broad band extending from 2839 to 3488 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching mode of h o belonging to the same water molecules of brushite 40 on the other hand the bands at 3488 and 3484 cm 1 in the spectra of x 0 4 and x 0 6 compositions could be assigned to the oh stretch belonging to the fe3 oh group indicating the partial oxidation of fe2 fe3 41 table 4 lists the characteristic ftir bands detected in the composites 3 3 microstructural and morphological properties fig 6 a e shows the hrtem micrographs of brushite vivianite materials at different values of the parameter x nanoparticles comprising the x 0 2 composition were of an ellipsoidal shape with the average dimensions of 40 48 nm fig 6 a b high magnification images of the particles revealed that there were two distinct crystallographic orientations representing the two constitutive phases fig 6b thus shows two different regions in a nanoparticle each displaying crystallographic distances matching the different phases specifically the a axis direction for brushite and c axis for vivianite the mismatch angle between these crystallites was 56 this high degree of anisotropy may be attributed to the lowering of the crystal symmetry for both phases due to their monoclinic structure also the misalignment between the two textures may induce a significant variation in properties such as the elastic modulus or electrical conductivity an increase in the vivianite content in the composites up to x 0 6 increased the ellipticity of the particles with their average dimension now being 50 75 nm fig 6 c d fig 6e shows the x 0 8 composition wherefrom it is obvious that the two phases are represented by different shapes the fiber network with diameters in the 14 17 nm range here represents the vivianite phase while the spherical domains with around 30 nm in diameter scattered through this network represent the brushite phase fig 7 a h displays the micrographs obtained with the use of fesem along with the results of the edx elemental analysis a typical brushite platelet possesses a semi rectangular shape with dimensions of 0 9 3 5 4 μm given as thickness width height in contrast the agglomerated particles surrounding the brushite leaves are attributed to vivianite endowing the structure with a relatively high porosity interesting for a number of applications a micrograph of the x 0 6 composition is displayed in fig 7e showing that at this high of the vivianite content this phase has begun to cover the leaflets of the brushite phase a micrograph of the x 0 8 composition fig 7g shows the increase in the dimensions of the rectangular brushite structures to 0 45 4 7 25 μm vivianite grains at this point tend to exfoliate the brushite platelets by filling up the pores between them which may increase the surface area with direct benefits for the heavy metal removing applications in other words vivianite phase here tends to induce an almost graphene like flattening of the brushite phase albeit on the microscale based on the results of the edx elemental analysis the ca p atomic ratio was 1 06 at x 0 0 which conforms to the stoichiometric ca p atomic ratio in brushite cahpo4 x 2h2o i e 1 with an increase in the vivianite content the atomic fe content increased too the roughness of brushite vivianite materials of different compositions is illustrated in fig 8 a d and table 5 the roughness average ra fluctuates with the phase composition being 22 1 nm and 23 8 nm at x 0 0 and 0 2 respectively then deteriorating to 9 6 nm at x 0 6 and then getting partially recovered to 13 5 nm at x 0 8 the same trend was observed for the root mean square roughness rq and the maximum height of the roughness rt this trend could be explained by supposing that the brushite leaves contribute more to the surface roughness than vivianite therefore at the high contents of brushite the brushite platelets are dominant on the surface where they induce relatively high roughness at x 0 6 however vivianite tends to partially cover the brushite platelets and reduce their effect one effect conforming to the higher roughness exhibited by brushite than by vivianite is that the variation in the lattice parameters was more radical for the former phase than for the latter one table 6 shows that the cumulative pore size calculated from the bjh model displays the same profile for both adsorption and desorption albeit with higher values in the adsorption regimen the pore size increased with the vivianite contribution up to x 0 8 after which it decreased in contrast to the cumulative pore size the total pore volume displayed higher values in the desorption mode than in the adsorption mode it also increased with the vivianite content to 137 5 10 4 and 149 1 10 4 cm3 g for adsorption and desorption respectively at x 0 8 after which it plunged significantly as it could be seen in fig 9 regarding the specific surface area of micropores it started off from 1 01 m2 g at x 0 0 after which it increased and reached 13 30 m2 g at x 0 8 this effect is explained by the greater surface to volume ratio of finer vivianite nanospheres compared to larger brushite microsheets likewise the bet surface area was 0 82 m2 g at x 0 0 and then it increased to 12 53 m2 g at x 0 8 this increase in microporosity and surface area with the vivianite content also increases the concentration of active sites available for physical and chemical interaction with the heavy metal adsorbates it also exemplifies a relatively simple strategy for boosting the efficacy of the removal of metallic contaminants along the way the excessive magnetism which might bind the particles onto unintended surfaces during decontamination but also minimize their surface area due to aggregation effects is avoided with the use of vivianite a nonmagnetic iron compound consequently these compositions can be considered for heavy metal removal applications especially at relatively high contents of vivianite and were tested next in the course of this study 3 4 heavy metal removal the removal of hydrated and solvated pb ii and cr vi heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions was investigated via a batch experiment using brushite vivianite composites of different compositions as adsorbents contact times and ph values of the solution were varied to delineate the most optimal kinetic conditions for interaction between the adsorbates and the adsorbents 42 3 4 1 analysis of the effect of ph on the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi most atoms in nanostructures especially those lying on their surfaces possess higher free energies compared to their ideal bulk states for which reason they have a comparatively high propensity for binding to other atoms as a result nanoparticles are characterized by high adsorption capacities and relatively rapid adsorption processes 42 the efficiency of pb ii and cr vi removal from aqueous solutions at different ph values and the contact time of 1 h is shown in fig 10 a b a slight increase in the immobilization efficiency for all the brushite vivianite compositions is noted as ph increased from 2 to 6 after which a rapid increase is noted as ph further increased from 6 to 8 43 this could be explained by supposing that the alkalinity acidity of the medium affects the hydroxylation protonation of the surface fe ii species in vivianite and ca ii and p v species in brushite depending on the ph specifically fe ii species transform from fe oh to f e o h 2 0 to f e o h 3 as ph is increased whereas ca ii and p v species transform from ca oh2 to ca oh to ca o and from poh to p o respectively thus decreasing the favorability of electrostatic attraction to heavy metals cations the ratio of these surface species changes with a variation in the ph involving different surface charges and electrostatic forces of different sign and magnitude during the adsorption process the supposed neutrality of the surface at ph 7 explains why the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi at this ph was not investigated 44 from this perspective the lower uptake of heavy metals at lower ph values may be explained by the competition between heavy metal ions pb ii and cr vi and h for the adsorbent active sites as well as by the higher mobility of h3o than that of the metal ions 45 however as ph of the aqueous solution increases the protonation of the hydroxyl groups diminishes and more active sites of the adsorbent become available for the removal of heavy metals from the solution 46 at the same time the speciation effects in the solution affect the adsorption with cr vi increasingly transforming from hcro4 and cr2o7 2 to lighter cro4 2 and cr oh 3 species 47 and pb ii from positively charged pb2 to more neutral and partially soluble pb oh and pb oh 2 complexes 48 any further increase in ph causes the metal ions to precipitate owing to their connection with the hydroxyl ions and this effect is not favorable for adsorption 49 therefore the optimal ph value for vivianite containing compositions 0 2 x 1 0 appears to be 6 for pure brushite compositions however ph 8 appears to be the most favorable one way of explaining this is through the phase transformation brushite undergoes at this ph brushite is known to transform partially or completely to apatite under alkaline conditions 50 and this sudden increase in the sorption capacity as ph is increased from 6 to 8 may be explained by the greater surface content of apatite fig 10 a b shows a remarkable almost an order of magnitude increase in the adsorption capacity of the material with the addition of vivianite to it that is with the transition from x 0 0 to x 0 2 this evidences the crucial effect that this phase has on the adsorption properties as already anticipated during the surface area analyses elaborated in sec 3 3 the increased presence of iron domains on the surface as well as the significantly larger pore volume and specific surface area are responsible for this effect the maximal removal efficiency is detected for the x 0 8 composition for which over 98 of pb ii and over 85 of cr vi ions were removed from the solution how this efficiency compares with similar synthetic materials currently in the research stage is illustrated in table 7 most materials reported in the literature in the past two years and listed in table 7 display comparable levels of the maximal wastewater removal efficiency with respect to pb ii and cr vi as brushite vivianite composites described here here it should be mentioned however that the current study did not optimize this efficiency to the concentration of heavy metal ions in the solution which normally exhibits a shaped dependence increasing with concentration but only up to the point when the active sites on the adsorbent reach saturation after which the removal efficiency begins to decrease 3 4 2 analysis of the effect of the contact time on the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi to study the relation between the pb ii and cr vi removal efficiency and the contact time spent by brushite vivianite in the solution ph was adjusted to its optimal value of 6 at this ph the highest removal efficiency was observed for the mixed brushite vivianite compositions without precipitating the metallic ions under alkaline conditions the results of this analysis are presented in fig 11 a b all the compositions regardless of the brushite vivianite ratio followed the same trend which was a continuous increase in the heavy metal ion immobilization in the first 5 h of the contact time this suggests gradual saturation of the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent after a sufficiently long contact time all the active sites have become occupied and the removal efficiency reaches a fixed value which typically does not change up to 10 h or longer 51 52 by changing the heavy metal ion identity the removal efficiency changes too therefore as shown in fig 11 a b the cr vi removal efficiency was lower than that for pb ii for all the compositions this may be attributed to a difference in the affinity of the ions for a particular pore size chemical structure of the adsorbent topography and the particle size the highest efficiency of immobilization of both ions was observed for the x 0 8 composition however even then the removal of pb ii ions upon saturation was higher than that of cr vi ions 98 2 vs 84 9 respectively considering both the ph and the contact time analyses it was concluded that the best removal efficiency of both pb ii and cr vi ions is reached at x 0 8 and at ph 6 after the contact time 6 h 3 5 thermal analysis the tga dtg curves of brushite vivianite materials at different phase contents defined by the parameter x are presented in fig 12 the weight loss at temperatures lower than 200 c is attributed to the surface bound and structural water content present in all the compositions the dehydration propensity of the composite powders increases with the vivianite content because of the more intimate role water plays in structurally stabilizing brushite namely brushite layers are held together via hydrogen bonds 2 but also because the smaller particle size of vivianite directly correlates with a lower dehydration capacity the thermal decomposition of brushite proceeds at temperatures far lower than its melting point tga profiles show a multistep weight loss fig 12 a f that changes depending on the vivianite content in the material thus while pure brushite x 0 0 exhibited decomposition caused weight loss in practically one single step with ts 464 c compositions containing vivianite x 0 2 1 0 show an overlapping typically two step weight loss the endothermic weight loss due to dehydration equals 13 5 18 8 18 18 5 and 17 for x 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 respectively as reported in table 8 which indicates a relatively large percentage of surface and structural water the loss of this water transforms hydrous brushite to anhydrous monetite the weight loss due to decomposition decreases exponentially with temperature up to 500 c 53 fig 12a shows that the lowest total weight loss due to elimination of gaseous species is 7 6 upon heating to 700 c for the ironless sample x 0 0 for vivianite containing samples this amount increases to 24 7 23 4 23 8 and 23 7 for x 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 respectively the second step in the endothermic sequential decomposition may represent the loss of the proton attached to the phosphate group of monetite to form γ ca2p2o7 400 c while heating to higher temperatures produces β ca2p2o7 700 c compositions with x 0 2 show endothermic changes around 460 c which represent the largest weight loss step table 8 shows that increasing the vivianite content in the material causes a sharp decrease in its stability for which reason the most stable compound is assigned to x 0 0 hence the cumulative weight loss starts from 7 6 at x 0 0 then it increases and reaches the highest loss of 24 1 at x 0 4 after which it remains nearly constant at 23 8 at x 1 0 3 5 1 kinetics of thermal dehydration and decomposition the difference in the thermal curve characteristics depending on the brushite vivianite content allowed for the assessment of the potential difference in their kinetic properties correlations between the reaction extent α and temperature obtained using cr and hw models are reported in figs 13 and 14 while the thermodynamic properties computed from them are presented in tables 9 and 10 in general because of the different mathematical treatment the hm method yielded kinetic parameter values somewhat higher than those obtained using the cr integral method regarding the transition step 1 that is dehydration as it seen in table 9 the activation energy per the cr model starts from 84 11 kj mol 1 for x 0 0 and then it decreases with x down to 38 29 kj mol 1 at x 1 0 very similar values were obtained from the hm model based on which the activation energy is at 93 02 kj mol 1 the highest for x 0 0 after which it drops with the addition of vivianite reaching 37 61 kj mol 1 for the pure vivianite phase x 1 0 this reduction in the activation energy due to the presence of vivianite is in agreement with the aforementioned more intimate role structural water plays in stabilizing brushite than vivianite the greater density of intracrystalline hydrogen and covalent bonds in brushite directly translates to a higher energy expense for sublimating this water at elevated temperatures also while dehydration during the transition step 1 induces a phase transition from brushite to monetite no such phase transformation occurs in the vivianite phase which explains the lowering of the activation energy in vivianite containing compositions this however does not explain a rather rapid drop in the activation energy as soon as vivianite appears in the system x 0 2 and little subsequent changes at higher x this effect hints at an additional microstructural effect present in all vivianite containing compositions regardless of the content of this phase enthalpy calculations show that δh starts from 80 61 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 after which it decreases down to 29 7 kj mol 1 at x 0 6 and gets partially restored to 35 3 at x 1 0 in the cr model whereas the values are slightly higher in the hm model but with the same trend higher enthalpy values here refer to a slower dehydration rate and the spread of the reaction over broader temperature ranges finally the calculated values for δg consistently decreased with x and the positive sign of δg for the compositions confesses that the reaction is nonspontaneous concerning the transition step 2 that is thermal decomposition as it is reported in table 10 the activation energy per the cr model decreases significantly with x starting from 321 2 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 dropping down to 45 70 kj mol 1 at x 1 0 and reaching its lowest value of only 22 00 kj mol 1 at x 0 8 the results from the hm model follow the same trend but with somewhat higher values of 347 28 kj mol 1 and 55 27 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 and 1 0 respectively this is to say that the activation energy for the decomposition of pure brushite is 7 times higher than that of pure vivianite which gives an idea about the ratio of stability between them also the highest value of the activation energy obtained from the cr model for the 2nd transition step is 3 82 times higher than the highest value obtained for the 1st transition step in the same model which illustrates that the decomposition of monetite to calcium pyrophosphate ca2p2o7 is a more energetic process than the release of water molecules from brushite vivianite crystals enthalpy calculations illustrate a wide range of values decreasing from 315 1 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 down to 134 7 kj mol 1 at x 0 2 and 41 1 kj mol 1 at x 1 0 this dramatic reduction of enthalpy parallels a significant change in the decomposition rate which is very slow in pure brushite but rapidly gains speed at x 0 2 and higher vivianite contents as it could be seen from the dtg curves in fig 12 a f the entropy also exhibited a steady drop with the vivianite content in the system indicating that the decomposition reaction produces a lesser disorder in the system when taking into account both the structural changes in the material and the liberation of the decomposed fragments at high temperatures 3 6 mechanical properties it could be noticed from table 11 that the total theoretical density increases dramatically with the vivianite content due to the heavier weight of iron atoms relative to calcium the measured density followed the same trend as that predicted by the theoretical one with the porosity decreasing from 32 48 at x 0 0 2 29 at x 0 4 which represented the lowest value attained before it increased to 14 45 at x 1 0 this low porosity had a high impact on the mechanical behavior of the material table 12 correspondingly presents the values obtained for mechanical properties studied using the ultrasound technique it could be seen that poisson s ratio ν varied from its lowest value of 0 085 at x 0 8 to the highest value of 0 273 at x 0 2 young s modulus e and shear modulus g showed the same trend with the highest values of 3 29 and 1 45 gpa respectively achieved at x 0 6 both of these properties exhibit dependence on the vivianite content and get enhanced by it up to x 0 6 after which they deteriorate hardness also improved with the vivianite content and increased up to 0 32 gpa at x 0 8 after which it dropped here it should be noted that the achieved hardness is less than the reported experimental values due to the specificity of the hardness derivation via the ultrasonic technique 54 namely as ultrasonic waves propagate across the sample volume they become mitigated by fluctuations around the regions of grain boundaries and pore edges as a result of this only a trend in the change of hardness should be taken into consideration instead of the literal quantitative values 4 conclusion brushite vivianite composites were synthesized and characterized for their crystallographic spectroscopic microstructural morphological porosimetric mechanical and thermal properties at different concentrations of the respective phases x 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 in fexca1 xhpo4 2h2o before being tested for the efficacy of removal of toxic heavy metals from contaminated aqueous solutions x ray diffraction data were refined and used to investigate the effect of changes in the phase composition on the crystallographic features of both phases brushite and vivianite investigation of the crystal structure of brushite vivianite at different concentrations of the respective phases through structural refinement showed that the weight ratio between the two phases had a high impact on their crystallographic ordering among other effects brushite crystals extended along the b axis as the content of vivianite in the material increased while vivianite crystals dilated along the c axis these changes were accompanied by the shortening of ca 1 ca 3 and fe 1 fe 1 bond lengths respectively ca 1 ca 2 and ca 3 ca 4 bond lengths extending in the direction of the crystallographic c axis in brushite crystals varied more erratically as a function of the brushite vivianite weight ratio in the material than ca 1 ca 3 and ca 2 ca 4 bond lengths extending in the direction of the crystallographic b axis in contrast the oo bond length extending in the direction of the crystallographic a axis in vivianite crystals varied as a function of the brushite vivianite weight ratio more erratically than fe 1 fe 1 and fe 2 fe 2 bond lengths extending in the directions of the crystallographic c axis the mutual crystallographic influence of the two phases on each other was significant and largely dependent on the phase composition in the material specifically the stoichiometric ratio of ca to fe surface roughness of the material decreased significantly with the addition of vivianite reaching the lowest value of 9 6 nm in the x 0 6 composition the thermal stability of the material with respect to both dehydration and thermal decomposition was reduced with the substitution of brushite with vivianite even at the lowest amounts of the latter phase this was partly because of the lower extent of the dehydration induced transformation of brushite to monetite and decomposition induced transformation of monetite to calcium pyrophosphate but also because of other microstructural effects produced in the material upon the introduction of vivianite irrespective of its amount the modeling of thermal analysis data with the use of coats redfern and horowitz metzger formalisms showed a multifold oftentimes an order of magnitude large reduction in the activation energy as well as in the change of enthalpy and entropy for both dehydration and decomposition transitions with the introduction of vivanite to brushite the average values for activation energy enthalpy change and entropy change for the dehydration reaction were thus 88 56 85 06 and 65 19 kj mol 1 respectively for pure brushite and they decreased down to 36 04 17 52 and 158 82 kj mol 1 respectively for the x 0 8 composition similarly the average values for activation energy enthalpy change and entropy change for the decomposition reaction were 334 24 300 35 and 162 2 kj mol 1 respectively for pure brushite but they decreased down to 30 20 25 05 and 221 03 kj mol 1 respectively for the x 0 8 composition the ultrasonic technique was employed to investigate mechanical properties of the materials and the results showed that the maximal young s modules of 2 74 gpa and the maximal shear modulus of 1 45 gpa were achieved for the x 0 6 composition hardness of the material was also enhanced with the vivianite content up to x 0 8 reaching 0 32 gpa at its maximum the same composition x 0 8 however also exhibited the lowest poisson s ratio of 0 085 demonstrating the multifactorial nature of the mechanical performance of the material requiring tradeoffs between individual properties to be made in the optimization stage tested on pb ii and cr vi the efficiency of the heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions increased as a function of ph in the 2 8 range for all the compositions increasing the vivianite content enhanced the efficacy of the removal of both ions the highest removal efficiency and thus the largest potential for use in environmental remediation applications was obtained for the x 0 8 composition higher than that for pure vivianite x 1 for this composition which was typified by the highest micropore and bet specific surface areas of 13 3 and 12 5 m2 g respectively over 98 of pb ii and around 85 of cr vi were removed from the solution at the standard heavy metal ionic concentrations of 2 ppm an increase in the contact time enhanced the removal efficiency but only up to 5 10 h at which point saturation was reached the systematic comparison of adsorption properties at different weight ratios between the two constitutive phases brushite and vivianite allowed for the delineation of a composition with ideal properties for the environmental decontamination applications this composition is closest to the one containing around 80 wt of the vivianite phase supplemented with around 20 wt of brushite performing significantly better than other compositions including pure brushite and pure vivianite overall this study demonstrates the potential to tune the physical properties of a brushite vivianite mixed system and optimize them for a highly efficient heavy metal removal from contaminated waters by controlling the ca p molar ratio in the synthesis stage and the corresponding weight ratio between the two phases in the material brushite and vivianite one such novel mixed system composed of brushite and vivianite is hereby recommended for continued investigation for applications in environmental remediation

14124,calcium phosphates cps are excellent sorbents with hydroxyapatite being the most commonly used for heavy metal removal from ecological samples the use of more acidic brushite as a cp sorbent can be justified by its greater ph compatibility with particular types of soil such as soil in the areas of high rainfall but also iron containing soil prone to oxidative weathering and soil nitrified with ammonium fertilizers here brushite nanoparticles were supplemented with vivianite as another metal phosphate phase and the resulting material was studied at different concentrations of the respective phases x 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 in fexca1 xhpo4 2h2o structural refinement showed that the weight ratio between the two phases intensely impacted their crystallographic ordering the modeling of thermal analysis data with the use of coats redfern and horowitz metzger formalisms showed a multifold reduction in the activation energy and in the changes of enthalpy and entropy for both dehydration and decomposition transitions with the introduction of vivanite to brushite increasing the vivianite content enhanced the efficacy of the removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions but only up to a certain limit the maximal efficacy along with hardness and microporosity was obtained for the x 0 8 composition for this composition over 98 of pb ii and 85 of cr vi were removed from the solution at the standard heavy metal concentrations of 2 ppm the systematic analysis at different weight ratios between the two constitutive phases allowed for the delineation of a composition with ideal properties for environmental decontamination applications keywords adsorption coats redfern horowitz metzger mechanical properties structural refinement pb ii cr vi thermal stability 1 introduction rapid industrialization and progress in new technologies come at the cost of environmental pollution with heavy metals because of their dissipative nature and the ability to penetrate even the least permeable biological barriers these heavy ions are considered a severe threat to human life and the timely treatment of wastewaters and contaminated soils for the removal of these metals is a crucial factor for enabling sustainable industrial development 1 lead pb is a highly toxic metal and its release to the environment is tied to a number of technological processes including armor production storage battery manufacturing metal mining and smelting and others moreover because of its non biodegradable nature its residence time in the environment is extremely long even for geological timescales 1 2 therefore the efficient environmental remediation of pb ii is a serious challenge and a precondition for the preservation of safe water and soil of the ecosystem a plethora of methodologies have been used before for the heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions such as electrochemical treatments chemical precipitation ion exchange polymeric resins and membrane technology 3 however most of these technologies are costly and time consuming the development of an efficient cheap fast and eco friendly sorbent material is one of the most sought goals on the road to sustainable development that does not relinquish the promises of high technologies 4 solid sorbents for elimination of toxic metals from wastewaters have included activated carbons metal oxides such as al2o3 and tio2 clay graphene and various polymeric materials 5 calcium phosphates cps have attracted the interest of developers of sorbents due to their thermal and chemical stability low cost of manufacture and low solubility in water 6 at the same time they have been used in biomedical applications because of their excellent biocompatibility and in agriculture as nano fertilizers 4 this hints at the dual role possible to fulfill with the use of cps beneficial for the environmental flora and the microbial biome of the soil and eliminatory for the toxic ions contaminating them the most commonly applied cp phase for environmental remediation applications has been hydroxyapatite hap hap has been widely known for its excellent sorption characteristics which were used earlier to immobilize heavy metals 7 radionuclides 8 and organic contaminants 9 in the form of nanoparticles hap has been utilized extensively for the treatment of wastewaters and for the removal of heavy metals such as cd ii pb ii zn ii cu ii and others 10 jing et al for example used nano hap and found out that the adsorption capacities were 3289 3150 3061 and 2784 mg g for pb ii zn ii ni ii and cd ii respectively 11 in some cases as for cd ii where there is a high similarity with the charge and the size of the calcium ion 95 pm vs 100 pm respectively ionic exchange is the dominant sequestration mechanism for other ions such as pb ii the removal mechanism involves an additional precipitation of a new phase on the cp surface composites containing cp as one of the components oftentimes show a better sorption profile than pure cps hap supplemented with a magnetic phase for example exhibits a higher removal capacity than pure hap for ions such as cd ii and zn ii 10 addition of 500 mg l fulvic acid to dispersions of nano hap also increased the elution rate of soil cd ii from 2 8 to 8 5 12 the efficiency of removal of pb ii using hap carbon embedded in the sugarcane stem structure was also relatively high at 210 69 mg g at the concentration of 200 mg l of pb ii with the removal mechanism involving ionic exchange between the structural ca ii ions and hydrated pb ii ions 13 zhang et al investigated the removal of pb ii from aqueous solutions using hap calcium silicate hydrate and concluded that pb ii adsorption capacity is slightly dependent on the ionic strength and strongly dependent on ph 1 wang et al studied hap biochar nanocomposites for the removal of pb ii cu ii and zn ii from their aqueous solutions and showed that the adsorption isotherm followed langmuir s model for pb ii and freundlich s model for cu ii and zn ii 14 moreover hao et al studied the effect of the hap particle morphology on the removal of pb ii and found out that the maximum adsorption capacity of 819 7 mg g was achieved for the dandelion like shape of hap 15 in contrast to hap which is the major cp phase forming by chemical precipitation in alkaline conditions brushite is the major cp phase forming by precipitation in the acidic conditions because of this brushite is usually associated with the final or intermediate forms of cp in pathological calcification deposits 16 also because of its lesser stability and also lesser propensity for ionic exchange brushite has been less explored for sequestration of toxic heavy metals from contaminated environments a simple web of science search turns up hundreds of studies on the sorption of heavy metals using hap but less than a dozen on the use of brushite for the same application and none on the use of brushite composites however rare reports comparing its ability to sequester pb ii show that it can be considerably higher than that of hap exceeding sorption capacities of 1000 mg g 17 one reason for this may be a possible difference in the sorption mechanism between brushite and hap accordingly in addition to the accommodation of heavy metal ions inside the lattice vacancies and as calcium ion substitutions a mechanism that is known to proceed effectively in brushite 18 pb ii also gets deposited on brushite through the epitaxial formation of the surface lead phosphate phase in a process that is intensely concentration dependent 19 for this reason the pretreatment of adsorbents with phosphates is known to increase the immobilization of pb ii on a number of mineral surfaces as much as the pretreatment with pb ii increases the sorption of phosphates 20 the adsorption of proteins can also be higher by a whole order of magnitude on as precipitated brushite than on as precipitated and sintered hap 21 this suggests that surface energetics and surface speciation may significantly favor the sorption on brushite compared to hap for a number of sorbates last but not least brushite decomposes at room temperature to mildly acidic products 22 as opposed to hap whose decomposition alkalizes the environment from this standpoint the use of brushite instead of hap as an environmental sorbent can be justified by its greater ph compatibility with particular types of soil such as soils in the areas of high rainfall due to incorporation of co2 in the form of carbonates but also soils nitrified by the use of ammonium fertilizers iron containing soils prone to oxidative weathering and soils laden with characteristic bacterial biomes in this study we synthesize composites comprising two different metal phosphates brushite and vivianite at different concentrations of the two phases these novel brushite vivianite composites are subsequently analyzed for their crystal structure particle morphology porosity surface topography thermal stability and mechanical performance in the next and the final step we have studied the removal efficiency of heavy metal ions including pb ii and cr vi from aqueous solutions with a particular emphasis on tuning the phase composition of the composite material for the most optimal performance in environmental remediation applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials synthesis brushite vivianite composites with the general chemical formula fexca1 x hpo4 2h2o 0 x 1 with the steps of 0 2 were synthesized via co precipitation method adapted from an earlier study by el dek et al 23 pure brushite x 0 0 was synthesized as follows aqueous solutions of 0 1 m of cacl2 2h2o merck and 0 1 m of nh4 2hpo4 were prepared separately the ph of ca solution was adjusted to 5 0 0 1 using dropwise addition of hcl then the phosphate solution was added dropwise to the ca solution continuously stirred to prepare composites containing vivianite ca solutions were supplemented with different concentrations of fecl2 4h2o including 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m while simultaneously decreasing the concentration of ca so that the total concentration of calcium and iron chloride in the solution equaled 0 1 m the yielded gels were aged for 24 h and then they were filtered and washed several times using doubly distilled water finally the samples were dried in air at 50 60 c 2 2 crystal structure analysis x ray diffraction was performed to identify the phases in the composite analytical x pert pro cu kα1 target λ 1 504 å 45 kv 40 ma netherlands the samples were scanned in the range of 4 2θ 70 with the step size of 0 02 and the scan time of 0 5 s structures were refined using maud software 24 25 2 3 surface morphology and roughness surface morphology was investigated via a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quantafeg 250 netherlands coupled to an energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscopic probe the as synthesized powder samples were sputtered with gold for 60 s and inserted on a holder into the fesem instrument to be investigated the boundaries of each micrograph were cropped and processed via gwyddion 2 45 software to investigate their roughness 26 27 3d micrographs were obtained for each sample and the resolution of the micrographs was fixed at 1450 900 pixels the graphed edges were eliminated to avoid unwanted boundaries finally the roughness parameters were computed using the same software in nm 2 4 particle size distribution particle size distribution was investigated via a high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem jeol jme 2100 japan operated at the electron accelerating voltage of 200 kv the as synthesized powder samples were ultra sonicated in doubly distilled water for 20 min the copper grid was dipped into the suspension for approximately 30 s and then left to dry for 5 min after which it was inserted into the hrtem apparatus to be investigated 2 5 ftir spectra fourier transformed infrared ftir spectra were scanned using an ftir spectrometer perkin elmer 2000 in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 with the resolution of 0 5 cm 1 an automated routine co added 7200 interferograms collected at the given resolution and the resultant interferograms were fourier transformed 2 6 surface area analysis specific surface areas of the powdered samples were measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet technique nova 2000 series quantachrome usa 2 7 heavy metal removal adsorption of heavy metal ions was studied as a function of ph and contact time in the solution brushite vivianite powders in the amount of 0 1 g were added to 100 ml of the metal ion solutions with the standard concentration of 2 ppm lead nitrate and chromium nitrate solutions were used in the experiments the solutions were stirred on an electric shaker for 1 h at different ph values in the range of 2 8 the effect of the contact time variation on removal efficiency was studied by adding 0 2 g of brushite vivianite powders into 100 ml of 2 ppm pb ii and cr vi solutions at room temperature and adjusting ph to its optimum value i e 6 and stirring on an electrical shaker the data were collected at certain times throughout the 24 h incubation period to measure the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi species the atomic absorption spectra were collected on a perkinelmer aanalyst 100 device germany the removal efficiency was calculated according to the following expression 28 30 1 r e m o v a l a d s o r p t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c f c 0 100 where co and cf are initial and final concentrations mg l of lead ions in the solution respectively 2 8 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis tga was carried out from the room temperature up to 700 c in a thermal analyzer dtg 60h shimadzu japan using the air flow rate of 100 ml min the heating rate was 10 c min thermodynamic parameters for brushite vivianite and their thermal decomposition were estimated from the dynamic tga curves two theoretical models were utilized to process the kinetic parameters of reactions including coats redfern cr and horowitz metzger hm methods 31 the coats redfern cr model follows the formula 27 5 l n l n 1 α t 2 l n a r β e e r t where r is the universal gas constant α is the powder fraction that decomposes at time t e is the activation energy a is the arrhenius pre

brushite and vivianite crystals was calculated using the formula 8 ω a b c sin β where a b c and β are lattice parameters of hap unit cell also ω is unit cell volume represented in å3 to measure the contribution of each crystalline phase on the composite properties the modified theoretical density was 27 9 t d x b d x 1 v d x 2 where b and v represent the relative contribution fractions of brushite and vivanite respectively the experimental density ρ was measured using archimedes technique 32 33 while the relative porosity was computed as a ratio between the measured and calculated

crystal structure of the brushite phase at 0 x 0 8 in order to thoroughly study and understand the effects of each component in brushite vivianite composites on their physicochemical properties and sorption capacity a series of composites with different phase compositions was synthesized their general chemical formula was fexca1 x hpo4 2h2o with 0 x 1 in steps of 0 2 fig 1 a e shows the refined xrd patterns of the given series of brushite vivianite structures including pure brushite x 0 and pure vivianite x 1 fig 2 a f meanwhile illustrates the output crystal structures expected from the refined data brushite x 0 0 crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with the space group of c2 m fig 2a the brushite unit cell could be divided to two parts along the b axis each part has two ca and two p ions if the ca ions were counted from the upper left corner of the cell counterclockwise they are called ca 1 ca 2 ca 3 and ca 4 fig 2a the distance between ca 1 and ca 3 is 8 152 å one ca ion from both sides is connected to eight oxygen ions six of which are bonded to p ions while the residual two oxygens belong to the structural water molecules while the ca 1 ca 2 distance is 3 660 å it reaches 6 596 å for ca 3 ca 4 the angle of c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ is 108 148 while the angle c a 1 c a 2 c a 3 ˆ is 101 393 in addition there are two pairs of protons on both far sides along the b axis and the distance between them is identical for both pairs 4 904 å the distance between the protons could reach 14 962 å in which case they belong to the water molecules fig 2b illustrates the structure of the brushite phase at x 0 2 the distance between ca 1 and ca 2 is lower than in the pure phase x 0 0 indicating shrinkage along the c axis in contrast ca 3 and ca 4 move away from each other to compensate for the crystal charge redistribution thus while ca 1 ca 2 distance is 4 020 å it reaches 5 688 å for ca 3 ca 4 the distance between ca 1 and ca 3 is 8 133 å while the angle of c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ is 115 737 fig 2c shows the structure of the brushite phase at x 0 4 with ca 1 and ca 4 partially protruding out of the unit cell on both sides of the bc plane ca 5 and ca 6 are introduced to the same plane to preserve the charge neutrality the ca 1 ca 5 and ca 4 c 6 distances resulting from this perturbation are the same 5 818 å in addition the distance between ca 5 and ca 6 is 12 607 å while the ca 1 ca 3 distance is equal to the ca 2 ca 4 distance of 8 138 å and the c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ angle reverts to 105 940 in addition ca 1 ca 2 and ca 3 ca 4 distances are identical 3 961 å the brushite phase at x 0 6 is shown in fig 2d the two aforementioned segments of the unit cell here appear to be asymmetric specifically the ca 1 ca 3 distance equals the ca 2 ca 4 distance of 8 1455 å while c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ angle decreased to 95 256 this could be assigned to the contraction of the ca 3 ca 4 distance to 3 886 å and the expansion of the ca 1 ca 2 distance to 5 603 å at x 0 8 fig 2e the crystal structure of brushite does not only tend to simulate the x 0 0 structure but it also takes the same parameters including the ca 1 ca 3 and ca 2 ca 4 distances which are both equal at 8 150 å while the angle between c a 1 c a 2 c a 4 ˆ is 106 712 ca 1 ca 2 and ca 3 ca 4 distances are 3 607 å and 5 431 å respectively 3 1 2 crystal structure of the vivianite phase at 0 2 x 1 0 fig 3 a e displays the refined structure of the vivianite phase at different phase contents defined by the parameter x vivianite first appears in the system at x 0 2 as seen from fig 2a fe here possesses two inequivalent coordination sites namely fe 1 and fe 2 fe 1 is located in the center of the unit cell and is surrounded octahedrally by 6 oxygen ions 4 of which are parts of structural water molecules the bond lengths between fe 1 and the adjacent o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 ions are 3 2016 3 2016 3 267 and 3 367 å respectively fe 2 in contrast is coordinated to two oxygen ions o 4 and o 5 which belong to the water molecules with the bond length of 2 125 å along the b axis fe 2 forms pairs and the separation between them is 2 716 å similar distances equaling 2 902 å 36 and 2 850 å 37 were calculated earlier this pair of fe 2 ions is connected together via an oxygen bridge with the angle of 75 518 while fe 1 and fe 2 lie on the surface of the unit cell the po4 ion is embedded deep into its subsurface as a result the distance between fe 1 and p from the same side is 3 644 å fig 3b illustrates the vivianite phase at x 0 4 fe 1 here is coordinated to four oxygen ions namely o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 with the bond lengths of 4 332 4 332 2 519 and 2 519 å respectively the bond of fe 2 o 5 and fe 2 o 6 is 2 275 å while the separation of fe 1 fe 2 along the b axis reaches 2 885 å which is very close to the former value recorded by mori et al 37 in addition the angle of f e 2 o f e 2 ˆ is 76 322 the bond lengths between fe 1 and the surrounding o 1 o 2 o 3 and o 4 are 3 2016 3 2016 3 267 and 3 367 å respectively the configuration of vivianite at x 0 6 is shown in fig 3c fe 1 here is again connected to 6 oxygen ions and the bond lengths of fe 1 o 1 6 are 2 411 1 655 2 411 2 411 1 655 and 2 411 å respectively the angle of o 3 f e 1 o 4 ˆ and o 1 f e 1 o 6 ˆ is 112 202 while the angle between the other arms equals 96 870 along the a axis fe 2 is connected to o 7 and o 8 with the bond length of 3 152 å along the b axis fe ions are separated by a distance that does not exceed 3 011 å in addition p forms six triangular bonds along a and b axes these triangles are orientated up or down with respect to the c direction as a result the p o 9 and p o 11 bond lengths are 1 283 å while the p o 10 bond length is 1 124 å fig 3d illustrates the vivianite structure at x 0 8 where the central fe 1 is found on the top of a pyramidal configuration this pyramid has a triangular base the bond lengths for fe 1 o 1 fe 1 o 2 2 220 å while the fe 1 o 3 bond length is 2 030 å this variation of the bond lengths is accompanied by o 3 being bonded to the p ion with the bond length of 1 565 å in addition the head angles of the pyramid are 90 508 for o 1 f e 1 o 2 ˆ and 89 54 for o 1 f e 1 o 3 ˆ and o 2 f e 1 o 3 ˆ the fe 1 pyramid also relates to an inverse pyramid on the opposite side of the unit cell where the distance between f 1 fe 1 is 4 716 å on the other hand fe 2 is configured in a similar pyramidal configuration with o 4 o 5 and o 6 ions and the bond lengths of 2 148 2 103 and 2 160 å for fe 2 o 4 fe 2 o 5 and fe 2 o 6 respectively the following angles were also derived o 4 f e 2 o 5 ˆ at 93 429 o 5 f e 2 o 6 ˆ at 85 981 and o 6 f e 2 o 4 ˆ at 89 133 this inhomogeneity of angles and bond lengths in the case of fe 2 pyramids is accompanied by both o 5 and o 6 being bonded to p pyramids with bond lengths of 1 542 and 1 528 å also the separation of fe 2 ions lying along the b axis is 2 966 å finally fig 3e shows the configuration of vivianite at x 1 0 the phase composition at which it exists as a pure phase unmixed with brushite the similarity between x 1 0 and 0 8 is obvious nevertheless both bond lengths and angle values are different specifically the bond lengths forming the central pyramid between fe 1 o 1 o 2 and o 3 are 2 201 2 201 and 2 024 å respectively while the angles of o 1 f e 1 o 2 o 1 f e 1 o 3 ˆ and o 2 f e 1 o 3 ˆ are 94 092 86 056 and 86 056 respectively consequently the bond lengths and angles are lower than their respective values at x 0 8 the separation between the heads of fe 1 fe 1 pyramids is 4 697 å on the other hand fe 2 is surrounded by o 4 o 5 and o 6 with the bond lengths of 2 158 2 177 2 284 å respectively and the angles of o 4 f e 2 o 5 ˆ o 5 f e 2 o 6 ˆ and o 6 f e 2 o 4 ˆ equaling 94 217 88 540 and 90 668 respectively the fe 2 fe 2 separation along the b axis does not exceed 3 045 å while the f e 2 o f e 2 ˆ angle is 83 603 3 1 3 cumulative phase composition effects on the unit cell parameters table 1 shows selected bond lengths in the brushite phase at different phase contents defined by the parameter x overall it could be seen that the ca 1 ca 2 bond length starts from 3 661 å at x 0 0 then increases to 4 020 å at x 0 2 and achieves its highest value of 5 603 å at x 0 6 the ca 3 ca 4 bond follows the same trend but only from x 0 0 to x 0 4 after which it plunges down to 3 886 å at x 0 6 this bond length has a significant effect on the lattice parameter c at the same time the ca 1 ca 3 bond length shows the same values as that of the ca 2 ca 4 bond which supports the stability of the crystal in spite of the dramatic changes happening primarily along the b axis due to variations in the phase content table 2 displays selected bond lengths of the vivianite phase at different phase contents overall the oo distance along the a axis fluctuates as a function of x reaching its lowest value of 2 760 å at x 0 4 the separation of fe 2 fe 2 that affects the b axis length increases from 2 716 å at x 0 2 and reaches the highest value of 3 045 å at x 1 0 on the other hand the central separation of fe 1 fe 1 which equals the distance of fe 2 fe 2 along the a axis tends to decrease slightly with the parameter x starting from 4 749 å at x 0 0 and reaching 4 697 å at x 1 0 regarding the variation in the unit cell dimensions pure brushite x 0 0 is widest along the b axis while a and c axes are less than half of the b axis values namely 5 848 and 6 267 å respectively as the contribution of the brushite phase was lowered its a axis decreased slightly down to 5 818 å at x 0 4 after which it grew again the same trend was followed by the b and c axes which also achieved their lowest values at x 0 4 overall the b axis followed the trend of change in the ca 1 ca 3 bond length while the c axis followed the trend of change in the ca 3 ca 4 bond length as it is shown in fig 4 a b table 3 shows the lattice parameters of both brushite and vivianite at different values of the parameter x from which it is observable that the former bond lengths represent a crucial factor in determining the trend followed by lattice parameters concerning the lattice parameters of vivianite the a axis starts from 10 085 å at x 0 2 and then it grows to 10 121 å at x 0 4 which represents it highest value the trend in the lattice parameter a tends to follow that of the oo bond length as it is shown in fig 4c in contrast the b axis starts from 13 484 å at x 0 2 and then it increases to 13 500 å at x 0 6 after which it deteriorates the lattice parameter b follows the trend in the separation of fe 2 fe 2 ions which act as a spring along this same b axis up to x 0 8 in addition the β angle follows the trend of oo separation as it is shown in fig 4d a change in the lattice parameter c shows an overlapping trend with a change in the separation of fe 1 fe 1 and fe 2 fe 2 ions which lie approximately parallel to the c axis and which may be classifiable as surface ions the lattice distortion ε recorded its highest value at x 0 0 after which it drastically deteriorated overall these data indicate a significant crystallographic influence of the two phases brushite and vivianite on each other this mutual effect is largely dependent on the phase composition in the material and can be varied by controlling the ca fe molar ratio in the synthesis stage 3 2 ftir analysis the ftir spectra of composites at different values of the parameter x are shown in fig 5 they demonstrate that the characteristic infrared bands of pure brushite i e x 0 0 composition are detectable at 527 and 574 cm 1 and are attributable to the bending mode of pop whereas the band at 790 1 cm 1 is assigned to water libration 38 39 the bands at 870 and 998 cm 1 indicate the ν 1 stretching vibrational modes of p o h and po respectively 38 the band at 1131 cm 1 in the spectrum of pure brushite x 0 0 represents the ν 3 stretching vibration mode of po 38 this stretching mode of the po group can also be detected as bands at 1064 and 1131 cm 1 40 the reversal of this frequency splitting detected for x 0 2 compositions indicates that the po mode is coordinated to the vibrational mode of fe2 41 the band at 1645 cm 1 could be attributed to the bending mode of the hoh group constituting structural water molecules while the broad band extending from 2839 to 3488 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching mode of h o belonging to the same water molecules of brushite 40 on the other hand the bands at 3488 and 3484 cm 1 in the spectra of x 0 4 and x 0 6 compositions could be assigned to the oh stretch belonging to the fe3 oh group indicating the partial oxidation of fe2 fe3 41 table 4 lists the characteristic ftir bands detected in the composites 3 3 microstructural and morphological properties fig 6 a e shows the hrtem micrographs of brushite vivianite materials at different values of the parameter x nanoparticles comprising the x 0 2 composition were of an ellipsoidal shape with the average dimensions of 40 48 nm fig 6 a b high magnification images of the particles revealed that there were two distinct crystallographic orientations representing the two constitutive phases fig 6b thus shows two different regions in a nanoparticle each displaying crystallographic distances matching the different phases specifically the a axis direction for brushite and c axis for vivianite the mismatch angle between these crystallites was 56 this high degree of anisotropy may be attributed to the lowering of the crystal symmetry for both phases due to their monoclinic structure also the misalignment between the two textures may induce a significant variation in properties such as the elastic modulus or electrical conductivity an increase in the vivianite content in the composites up to x 0 6 increased the ellipticity of the particles with their average dimension now being 50 75 nm fig 6 c d fig 6e shows the x 0 8 composition wherefrom it is obvious that the two phases are represented by different shapes the fiber network with diameters in the 14 17 nm range here represents the vivianite phase while the spherical domains with around 30 nm in diameter scattered through this network represent the brushite phase fig 7 a h displays the micrographs obtained with the use of fesem along with the results of the edx elemental analysis a typical brushite platelet possesses a semi rectangular shape with dimensions of 0 9 3 5 4 μm given as thickness width height in contrast the agglomerated particles surrounding the brushite leaves are attributed to vivianite endowing the structure with a relatively high porosity interesting for a number of applications a micrograph of the x 0 6 composition is displayed in fig 7e showing that at this high of the vivianite content this phase has begun to cover the leaflets of the brushite phase a micrograph of the x 0 8 composition fig 7g shows the increase in the dimensions of the rectangular brushite structures to 0 45 4 7 25 μm vivianite grains at this point tend to exfoliate the brushite platelets by filling up the pores between them which may increase the surface area with direct benefits for the heavy metal removing applications in other words vivianite phase here tends to induce an almost graphene like flattening of the brushite phase albeit on the microscale based on the results of the edx elemental analysis the ca p atomic ratio was 1 06 at x 0 0 which conforms to the stoichiometric ca p atomic ratio in brushite cahpo4 x 2h2o i e 1 with an increase in the vivianite content the atomic fe content increased too the roughness of brushite vivianite materials of different compositions is illustrated in fig 8 a d and table 5 the roughness average ra fluctuates with the phase composition being 22 1 nm and 23 8 nm at x 0 0 and 0 2 respectively then deteriorating to 9 6 nm at x 0 6 and then getting partially recovered to 13 5 nm at x 0 8 the same trend was observed for the root mean square roughness rq and the maximum height of the roughness rt this trend could be explained by supposing that the brushite leaves contribute more to the surface roughness than vivianite therefore at the high contents of brushite the brushite platelets are dominant on the surface where they induce relatively high roughness at x 0 6 however vivianite tends to partially cover the brushite platelets and reduce their effect one effect conforming to the higher roughness exhibited by brushite than by vivianite is that the variation in the lattice parameters was more radical for the former phase than for the latter one table 6 shows that the cumulative pore size calculated from the bjh model displays the same profile for both adsorption and desorption albeit with higher values in the adsorption regimen the pore size increased with the vivianite contribution up to x 0 8 after which it decreased in contrast to the cumulative pore size the total pore volume displayed higher values in the desorption mode than in the adsorption mode it also increased with the vivianite content to 137 5 10 4 and 149 1 10 4 cm3 g for adsorption and desorption respectively at x 0 8 after which it plunged significantly as it could be seen in fig 9 regarding the specific surface area of micropores it started off from 1 01 m2 g at x 0 0 after which it increased and reached 13 30 m2 g at x 0 8 this effect is explained by the greater surface to volume ratio of finer vivianite nanospheres compared to larger brushite microsheets likewise the bet surface area was 0 82 m2 g at x 0 0 and then it increased to 12 53 m2 g at x 0 8 this increase in microporosity and surface area with the vivianite content also increases the concentration of active sites available for physical and chemical interaction with the heavy metal adsorbates it also exemplifies a relatively simple strategy for boosting the efficacy of the removal of metallic contaminants along the way the excessive magnetism which might bind the particles onto unintended surfaces during decontamination but also minimize their surface area due to aggregation effects is avoided with the use of vivianite a nonmagnetic iron compound consequently these compositions can be considered for heavy metal removal applications especially at relatively high contents of vivianite and were tested next in the course of this study 3 4 heavy metal removal the removal of hydrated and solvated pb ii and cr vi heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions was investigated via a batch experiment using brushite vivianite composites of different compositions as adsorbents contact times and ph values of the solution were varied to delineate the most optimal kinetic conditions for interaction between the adsorbates and the adsorbents 42 3 4 1 analysis of the effect of ph on the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi most atoms in nanostructures especially those lying on their surfaces possess higher free energies compared to their ideal bulk states for which reason they have a comparatively high propensity for binding to other atoms as a result nanoparticles are characterized by high adsorption capacities and relatively rapid adsorption processes 42 the efficiency of pb ii and cr vi removal from aqueous solutions at different ph values and the contact time of 1 h is shown in fig 10 a b a slight increase in the immobilization efficiency for all the brushite vivianite compositions is noted as ph increased from 2 to 6 after which a rapid increase is noted as ph further increased from 6 to 8 43 this could be explained by supposing that the alkalinity acidity of the medium affects the hydroxylation protonation of the surface fe ii species in vivianite and ca ii and p v species in brushite depending on the ph specifically fe ii species transform from fe oh to f e o h 2 0 to f e o h 3 as ph is increased whereas ca ii and p v species transform from ca oh2 to ca oh to ca o and from poh to p o respectively thus decreasing the favorability of electrostatic attraction to heavy metals cations the ratio of these surface species changes with a variation in the ph involving different surface charges and electrostatic forces of different sign and magnitude during the adsorption process the supposed neutrality of the surface at ph 7 explains why the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi at this ph was not investigated 44 from this perspective the lower uptake of heavy metals at lower ph values may be explained by the competition between heavy metal ions pb ii and cr vi and h for the adsorbent active sites as well as by the higher mobility of h3o than that of the metal ions 45 however as ph of the aqueous solution increases the protonation of the hydroxyl groups diminishes and more active sites of the adsorbent become available for the removal of heavy metals from the solution 46 at the same time the speciation effects in the solution affect the adsorption with cr vi increasingly transforming from hcro4 and cr2o7 2 to lighter cro4 2 and cr oh 3 species 47 and pb ii from positively charged pb2 to more neutral and partially soluble pb oh and pb oh 2 complexes 48 any further increase in ph causes the metal ions to precipitate owing to their connection with the hydroxyl ions and this effect is not favorable for adsorption 49 therefore the optimal ph value for vivianite containing compositions 0 2 x 1 0 appears to be 6 for pure brushite compositions however ph 8 appears to be the most favorable one way of explaining this is through the phase transformation brushite undergoes at this ph brushite is known to transform partially or completely to apatite under alkaline conditions 50 and this sudden increase in the sorption capacity as ph is increased from 6 to 8 may be explained by the greater surface content of apatite fig 10 a b shows a remarkable almost an order of magnitude increase in the adsorption capacity of the material with the addition of vivianite to it that is with the transition from x 0 0 to x 0 2 this evidences the crucial effect that this phase has on the adsorption properties as already anticipated during the surface area analyses elaborated in sec 3 3 the increased presence of iron domains on the surface as well as the significantly larger pore volume and specific surface area are responsible for this effect the maximal removal efficiency is detected for the x 0 8 composition for which over 98 of pb ii and over 85 of cr vi ions were removed from the solution how this efficiency compares with similar synthetic materials currently in the research stage is illustrated in table 7 most materials reported in the literature in the past two years and listed in table 7 display comparable levels of the maximal wastewater removal efficiency with respect to pb ii and cr vi as brushite vivianite composites described here here it should be mentioned however that the current study did not optimize this efficiency to the concentration of heavy metal ions in the solution which normally exhibits a shaped dependence increasing with concentration but only up to the point when the active sites on the adsorbent reach saturation after which the removal efficiency begins to decrease 3 4 2 analysis of the effect of the contact time on the adsorption of pb ii and cr vi to study the relation between the pb ii and cr vi removal efficiency and the contact time spent by brushite vivianite in the solution ph was adjusted to its optimal value of 6 at this ph the highest removal efficiency was observed for the mixed brushite vivianite compositions without precipitating the metallic ions under alkaline conditions the results of this analysis are presented in fig 11 a b all the compositions regardless of the brushite vivianite ratio followed the same trend which was a continuous increase in the heavy metal ion immobilization in the first 5 h of the contact time this suggests gradual saturation of the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent after a sufficiently long contact time all the active sites have become occupied and the removal efficiency reaches a fixed value which typically does not change up to 10 h or longer 51 52 by changing the heavy metal ion identity the removal efficiency changes too therefore as shown in fig 11 a b the cr vi removal efficiency was lower than that for pb ii for all the compositions this may be attributed to a difference in the affinity of the ions for a particular pore size chemical structure of the adsorbent topography and the particle size the highest efficiency of immobilization of both ions was observed for the x 0 8 composition however even then the removal of pb ii ions upon saturation was higher than that of cr vi ions 98 2 vs 84 9 respectively considering both the ph and the contact time analyses it was concluded that the best removal efficiency of both pb ii and cr vi ions is reached at x 0 8 and at ph 6 after the contact time 6 h 3 5 thermal analysis the tga dtg curves of brushite vivianite materials at different phase contents defined by the parameter x are presented in fig 12 the weight loss at temperatures lower than 200 c is attributed to the surface bound and structural water content present in all the compositions the dehydration propensity of the composite powders increases with the vivianite content because of the more intimate role water plays in structurally stabilizing brushite namely brushite layers are held together via hydrogen bonds 2 but also because the smaller particle size of vivianite directly correlates with a lower dehydration capacity the thermal decomposition of brushite proceeds at temperatures far lower than its melting point tga profiles show a multistep weight loss fig 12 a f that changes depending on the vivianite content in the material thus while pure brushite x 0 0 exhibited decomposition caused weight loss in practically one single step with ts 464 c compositions containing vivianite x 0 2 1 0 show an overlapping typically two step weight loss the endothermic weight loss due to dehydration equals 13 5 18 8 18 18 5 and 17 for x 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 respectively as reported in table 8 which indicates a relatively large percentage of surface and structural water the loss of this water transforms hydrous brushite to anhydrous monetite the weight loss due to decomposition decreases exponentially with temperature up to 500 c 53 fig 12a shows that the lowest total weight loss due to elimination of gaseous species is 7 6 upon heating to 700 c for the ironless sample x 0 0 for vivianite containing samples this amount increases to 24 7 23 4 23 8 and 23 7 for x 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 respectively the second step in the endothermic sequential decomposition may represent the loss of the proton attached to the phosphate group of monetite to form γ ca2p2o7 400 c while heating to higher temperatures produces β ca2p2o7 700 c compositions with x 0 2 show endothermic changes around 460 c which represent the largest weight loss step table 8 shows that increasing the vivianite content in the material causes a sharp decrease in its stability for which reason the most stable compound is assigned to x 0 0 hence the cumulative weight loss starts from 7 6 at x 0 0 then it increases and reaches the highest loss of 24 1 at x 0 4 after which it remains nearly constant at 23 8 at x 1 0 3 5 1 kinetics of thermal dehydration and decomposition the difference in the thermal curve characteristics depending on the brushite vivianite content allowed for the assessment of the potential difference in their kinetic properties correlations between the reaction extent α and temperature obtained using cr and hw models are reported in figs 13 and 14 while the thermodynamic properties computed from them are presented in tables 9 and 10 in general because of the different mathematical treatment the hm method yielded kinetic parameter values somewhat higher than those obtained using the cr integral method regarding the transition step 1 that is dehydration as it seen in table 9 the activation energy per the cr model starts from 84 11 kj mol 1 for x 0 0 and then it decreases with x down to 38 29 kj mol 1 at x 1 0 very similar values were obtained from the hm model based on which the activation energy is at 93 02 kj mol 1 the highest for x 0 0 after which it drops with the addition of vivianite reaching 37 61 kj mol 1 for the pure vivianite phase x 1 0 this reduction in the activation energy due to the presence of vivianite is in agreement with the aforementioned more intimate role structural water plays in stabilizing brushite than vivianite the greater density of intracrystalline hydrogen and covalent bonds in brushite directly translates to a higher energy expense for sublimating this water at elevated temperatures also while dehydration during the transition step 1 induces a phase transition from brushite to monetite no such phase transformation occurs in the vivianite phase which explains the lowering of the activation energy in vivianite containing compositions this however does not explain a rather rapid drop in the activation energy as soon as vivianite appears in the system x 0 2 and little subsequent changes at higher x this effect hints at an additional microstructural effect present in all vivianite containing compositions regardless of the content of this phase enthalpy calculations show that δh starts from 80 61 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 after which it decreases down to 29 7 kj mol 1 at x 0 6 and gets partially restored to 35 3 at x 1 0 in the cr model whereas the values are slightly higher in the hm model but with the same trend higher enthalpy values here refer to a slower dehydration rate and the spread of the reaction over broader temperature ranges finally the calculated values for δg consistently decreased with x and the positive sign of δg for the compositions confesses that the reaction is nonspontaneous concerning the transition step 2 that is thermal decomposition as it is reported in table 10 the activation energy per the cr model decreases significantly with x starting from 321 2 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 dropping down to 45 70 kj mol 1 at x 1 0 and reaching its lowest value of only 22 00 kj mol 1 at x 0 8 the results from the hm model follow the same trend but with somewhat higher values of 347 28 kj mol 1 and 55 27 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 and 1 0 respectively this is to say that the activation energy for the decomposition of pure brushite is 7 times higher than that of pure vivianite which gives an idea about the ratio of stability between them also the highest value of the activation energy obtained from the cr model for the 2nd transition step is 3 82 times higher than the highest value obtained for the 1st transition step in the same model which illustrates that the decomposition of monetite to calcium pyrophosphate ca2p2o7 is a more energetic process than the release of water molecules from brushite vivianite crystals enthalpy calculations illustrate a wide range of values decreasing from 315 1 kj mol 1 at x 0 0 down to 134 7 kj mol 1 at x 0 2 and 41 1 kj mol 1 at x 1 0 this dramatic reduction of enthalpy parallels a significant change in the decomposition rate which is very slow in pure brushite but rapidly gains speed at x 0 2 and higher vivianite contents as it could be seen from the dtg curves in fig 12 a f the entropy also exhibited a steady drop with the vivianite content in the system indicating that the decomposition reaction produces a lesser disorder in the system when taking into account both the structural changes in the material and the liberation of the decomposed fragments at high temperatures 3 6 mechanical properties it could be noticed from table 11 that the total theoretical density increases dramatically with the vivianite content due to the heavier weight of iron atoms relative to calcium the measured density followed the same trend as that predicted by the theoretical one with the porosity decreasing from 32 48 at x 0 0 2 29 at x 0 4 which represented the lowest value attained before it increased to 14 45 at x 1 0 this low porosity had a high impact on the mechanical behavior of the material table 12 correspondingly presents the values obtained for mechanical properties studied using the ultrasound technique it could be seen that poisson s ratio ν varied from its lowest value of 0 085 at x 0 8 to the highest value of 0 273 at x 0 2 young s modulus e and shear modulus g showed the same trend with the highest values of 3 29 and 1 45 gpa respectively achieved at x 0 6 both of these properties exhibit dependence on the vivianite content and get enhanced by it up to x 0 6 after which they deteriorate hardness also improved with the vivianite content and increased up to 0 32 gpa at x 0 8 after which it dropped here it should be noted that the achieved hardness is less than the reported experimental values due to the specificity of the hardness derivation via the ultrasonic technique 54 namely as ultrasonic waves propagate across the sample volume they become mitigated by fluctuations around the regions of grain boundaries and pore edges as a result of this only a trend in the change of hardness should be taken into consideration instead of the literal quantitative values 4 conclusion brushite vivianite composites were synthesized and characterized for their crystallographic spectroscopic microstructural morphological porosimetric mechanical and thermal properties at different concentrations of the respective phases x 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 8 and 1 0 in fexca1 xhpo4 2h2o before being tested for the efficacy of removal of toxic heavy metals from contaminated aqueous solutions x ray diffraction data were refined and used to investigate the effect of changes in the phase composition on the crystallographic features of both phases brushite and vivianite investigation of the crystal structure of brushite vivianite at different concentrations of the respective phases through structural refinement showed that the weight ratio between the two phases had a high impact on their crystallographic ordering among other effects brushite crystals extended along the b axis as the content of vivianite in the material increased while vivianite crystals dilated along the c axis these changes were accompanied by the shortening of ca 1 ca 3 and fe 1 fe 1 bond lengths respectively ca 1 ca 2 and ca 3 ca 4 bond lengths extending in the direction of the crystallographic c axis in brushite crystals varied more erratically as a function of the brushite vivianite weight ratio in the material than ca 1 ca 3 and ca 2 ca 4 bond lengths extending in the direction of the crystallographic b axis in contrast the oo bond length extending in the direction of the crystallographic a axis in vivianite crystals varied as a function of the brushite vivianite weight ratio more erratically than fe 1 fe 1 and fe 2 fe 2 bond lengths extending in the directions of the crystallographic c axis the mutual crystallographic influence of the two phases on each other was significant and largely dependent on the phase composition in the material specifically the stoichiometric ratio of ca to fe surface roughness of the material decreased significantly with the addition of vivianite reaching the lowest value of 9 6 nm in the x 0 6 composition the thermal stability of the material with respect to both dehydration and thermal decomposition was reduced with the substitution of brushite with vivianite even at the lowest amounts of the latter phase this was partly because of the lower extent of the dehydration induced transformation of brushite to monetite and decomposition induced transformation of monetite to calcium pyrophosphate but also because of other microstructural effects produced in the material upon the introduction of vivianite irrespective of its amount the modeling of thermal analysis data with the use of coats redfern and horowitz metzger formalisms showed a multifold oftentimes an order of magnitude large reduction in the activation energy as well as in the change of enthalpy and entropy for both dehydration and decomposition transitions with the introduction of vivanite to brushite the average values for activation energy enthalpy change and entropy change for the dehydration reaction were thus 88 56 85 06 and 65 19 kj mol 1 respectively for pure brushite and they decreased down to 36 04 17 52 and 158 82 kj mol 1 respectively for the x 0 8 composition similarly the average values for activation energy enthalpy change and entropy change for the decomposition reaction were 334 24 300 35 and 162 2 kj mol 1 respectively for pure brushite but they decreased down to 30 20 25 05 and 221 03 kj mol 1 respectively for the x 0 8 composition the ultrasonic technique was employed to investigate mechanical properties of the materials and the results showed that the maximal young s modules of 2 74 gpa and the maximal shear modulus of 1 45 gpa were achieved for the x 0 6 composition hardness of the material was also enhanced with the vivianite content up to x 0 8 reaching 0 32 gpa at its maximum the same composition x 0 8 however also exhibited the lowest poisson s ratio of 0 085 demonstrating the multifactorial nature of the mechanical performance of the material requiring tradeoffs between individual properties to be made in the optimization stage tested on pb ii and cr vi the efficiency of the heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions increased as a function of ph in the 2 8 range for all the compositions increasing the vivianite content enhanced the efficacy of the removal of both ions the highest removal efficiency and thus the largest potential for use in environmental remediation applications was obtained for the x 0 8 composition higher than that for pure vivianite x 1 for this composition which was typified by the highest micropore and bet specific surface areas of 13 3 and 12 5 m2 g respectively over 98 of pb ii and around 85 of cr vi were removed from the solution at the standard heavy metal ionic concentrations of 2 ppm an increase in the contact time enhanced the removal efficiency but only up to 5 10 h at which point saturation was reached the systematic comparison of adsorption properties at different weight ratios between the two constitutive phases brushite and vivianite allowed for the delineation of a composition with ideal properties for the environmental decontamination applications this composition is closest to the one containing around 80 wt of the vivianite phase supplemented with around 20 wt of brushite performing significantly better than other compositions including pure brushite and pure vivianite overall this study demonstrates the potential to tune the physical properties of a brushite vivianite mixed system and optimize them for a highly efficient heavy metal removal from contaminated waters by controlling the ca p molar ratio in the synthesis stage and the corresponding weight ratio between the two phases in the material brushite and vivianite one such novel mixed system composed of brushite and vivianite is hereby recommended for continued investigation for applications in environmental remediation
