8405,study region the lez aquifer is a mediterranean karst system located in southern france which supplies groundwater to the montpellier urban area study focus multi scale hydrodynamic investigations were carried out in a fractured and karstic aquifer in order to identify the flow bearing structures and evaluate their hydraulic properties the study is based on an extensive dataset developed from several hydraulic tests performed at different spatial and temporal scales the scales ranged spatially from a few meters to more than 15 km and temporally from a few minutes to a few months new hydrological insights for the region the data analysis shows that the hydraulic connectivity at both local and regional scales is mainly due to sub horizontal flow bearing structures in which a conduit network has developed this structure appears mainly to be located at the interface between two stratigraphic units at the transition between jurassic and cretaceous limestones kimmeridgian berriasian interface at the regional scale this flow bearing structure plays a major role in large scale connectivity since a compartmentalization of the lez aquifer appears where the continuity of this structure disappears the hydraulic properties estimated appear to be strongly dependent on the investigated geological structures and on the different hydrogeological methods used for the borehole local and regional scale of investigations keywords hydraulic tests multi scale analysis heterogeneity scale fractured and karstic carbonate rocks karstified bedding planes 1 introduction karst aquifers which are generally very productive constitute important groundwater resources for approximately a quarter of the global population ford and williams 2007 these aquifers can be conceptualized by three levels of porosity the primary porosity of the rock matrix the secondary porosity of fractures which includes various fracture types or joints at several scales cracks joints including bedding planes and faults and the third porosity resulting from the dissolution of the bedrock along the fracture or joint surfaces worthington 1999 ford and williams 2007 the permeability of the system is generally dominated by the second and third porosity types worthington et al 2000 worthington and ford 2009 in fractured rocks flow channeling generally occurs at fracture and fracture network scales de dreuzy et al 2012 but this process may be stronger in karstic reservoirs worthington and ford 1995 this behavior may be enhanced by the presence of complex networks of enlarged fractures due to wall dissolution and to the development of karst conduits over several kilometers palmer 1991 worthington 1999 groundwater quality and quantity in karst aquifers are therefore highly variable due to the strong heterogeneity and anisotropy of the fractured and karstic networks worthington 2011 the management of these groundwater resources are thus particularly challenging and require detailed characterization of hydraulic heterogeneity which are extremely variable and difficult to determine bakalowicz 2011 in fractured karstic reservoirs the degree of detail in the hydraulic heterogeneity depends on the spatial extent of the investigation and on the specificity of the hydraulic experiments shapiro et al 2015 for instance hydraulic tomography provides important details of spatial hydraulic heterogeneity but requires multiple cross hole hydraulic tests which are generally made at a limited scale of investigation to allow monitoring of hydraulic responses ackerer and delay 2010 wang et al 2017 fischer et al 2017 however hydraulic tomography still remains a challenge to be conducted at regional scale i e aquifer watershed scale due to for instance the technical difficulty to investigate significant volumes of the aquifer a limited number of observation wells distributed over the entire system or simply to an impossibility to provide responses at each observation well during sequential pumping tests at regional scale groundwater flow and hydraulic property estimates in karstic systems are classically investigated with spring discharge hydrographs baedke and krothe 2001 kovács et al 2005 fiorillo 2014 by hydraulic head data analyses sauter 1991 renard and jeannée 2008 galvão et al 2016 or more rarely by long term pumping test analysis maréchal et al 2008 to obtain more details on hydraulic heterogeneity and connectivity at larger scale which could be helpful to improve groundwater management another approach consists in a multidisciplinary framework this requires consequently intensive investigations to identify and characterize the relevant flow structures such as faults joints bedding planes and karstic features such investigations can be made by measurements at several scales of investigation in order to connect all the information and provide a consistent interpretation at the borehole scale flowing fractures or karstic features can be localized and characterized through different methods such as temperature logging chatelier et al 2011 klepikova et al 2011 packer testing quinn et al 2012 or flowmeter testing paillet 1998 day lewis et al 2000 at the local scales cross hole hydraulic tests such as pumping tests can be used to identify the flow pattern to provide information on reservoir geometry in addition to its hydraulic properties gringarten 2008 at the regional scale water level monitoring in several observation wells appropriately distributed across the system can be used for instance to identify potential compartments under different hydrological conditions guihéneuf et al 2014 even though such approach is challenging and requires numerous data it remains necessary to identify geological structures relevant for groundwater flow at larger scales and estimates their hydraulic properties the objective of this study is to identify and characterize the properties of the main flow bearing structures in a karst aquifer based on geological information and a multi scale hydraulic investigation these intensive investigations were conducted in the lez aquifer a mediterranean karst aquifer located in southern france near the metropolitan area of montpellier investigations were performed at regional scale i e the watershed scale local scale using an experimental site i e the terrieu experimental site and borehole scale with specific measurements in some boreholes detailed knowledge of the aquifer characteristics remains of major importance for the lez aquifer management because groundwater is intensively pumped for water supply to the montpellier metropolitan region such detailed information on reservoir heterogeneities may also be helpful for any future predictive modeling related to groundwater management and protection 2 study site the lez aquifer this large karst system located in the mediterranean basin south east of france is referred to as the lez aquifer because it feeds the lez spring the lez aquifer supplies some 30 million m3 of water per year to the metropolitan area of montpellier the area is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate with dry summers and rainy autumns the mean temperature is about 22 c in summer and about 5 c in winter the intense rainfall events in autumn are the main contributors to the annual recharge annual rainfall occurs primarily from september to december and to a lesser extent from march to may the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 600 mm dry years to more than 1500 mm wet years rainfall is also spatially variable with an increase from south to north due to the rising topography and the proximity of the cevennes hills mazzilli 2011 the recharge area of the lez spring is estimated about 150 km2 corresponding to the surface area where limestone directly outcrops the exact boundaries of the aquifer area are poorly known but it is estimated of more than 250 km2 in the following sections the hydrogeological context of the lez aquifer details concerning the terrieu experimental site and the strategy adopted for this study are presented 2 1 hydrogeological context the lez aquifer is composed mainly of upper jurassic and early cretaceous limestone these sedimentary rocks overlie the callovian oxfordian marls jurassic and may locally be covered by a thick succession of early valanginian early cretaceous marls and marly limestone fig 1 a the aquifer is divided by ne sw normal faults related to the pyrenean orogeny eocene and later impacted by the oligocene extension phase séranne et al 1995 benedicto et al 1999 the matelles corconne fault which is one of the main faults divides the reservoir into two compartments the western compartment contains the upper jurassic limestone at the outcrop while the eastern compartment primarily contains cretaceous formations of the early valanginian at the outcrop fig 1a the lez aquifer shows a high degree of karstification developed during different geological periods from the middle cretaceous to the current period leonardi et al 2011 in particular the possibility of deep karstification is attributed to the messinian salinity crisis about 5 5 my ago when the sea level of the mediterranean sea dropped by more than 1000 m due to the closing of the gibraltar straights audra et al 2004 clauzon et al 2005 an extensive fracture dataset was collected at different spatial scales from 2d patterns observed at the lez aquifer data available come from the geological map at a scale of 1 250 000 tissier 2009 from assembled aerial photographs at a scale of 1 25 000 durepaire 1985 and from in situ outcrop measurements at the terrieu experimental site drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi 2009 statistical analyses revealed different preferential orientations of the fracture sets depending on the scale of analysis leonardi et al 2011 dausse 2015 at the regional scale 1 250 000 the main orientations of the faults are from n010 to n040 with over 50 of fractures oriented in this direction at the 1 25 000 scale the results are highly heterogeneous depending on the selection of the geographic zones dausse 2015 three main fracture sets show the n040 n045 direction the main representative ones are related to the ne sw direction of the matelles corconne fault the n s direction and the e w direction at the local scale i e the terrieu experimental site from cretaceous limestone outcrops two main families of fractures with the n070 and n140 directions have been identified wang et al 2014 according to the scale of observation and to the locations chosen for fracture trace maps analyzed the impact of the variability of the fracture networks is significant on the estimated apparent connectivity ranging from well to poorly connected lei and wang 2016 the connectivity of fracture networks organizes the groundwater flow and could influence the karstification of the carbonate reservoir the organization of the karstic networks is related to both the fracturing and the direction of the hydraulic gradient whereas close to major faults this organization is controlled by the juxtaposition of different units and by the tectonic regime leonardi et al 2011 the karstic network is preferentially oriented along the ne sw main faults but in poorly deformed areas the network is mainly oriented in the ns ew direction leonardi et al 2011 husson et al 2018 demonstrated that the varying karstification distribution of the lez aquifer can be related to the presence or absence of impervious formations covering the carbonate strata in particular carbonates located under impervious marly formations early cretaceous appear mostly preserved from dissolution processes and are less karstified husson et al 2018 the reservoir discharges into several seasonal overflowing springs the main outlet the lez spring is located near saint clément de rivière about 15 km north of montpellier this spring is of a vauclusian type with a maximum discharge of approximately 15 m3 s 1 however the discharge at the lez spring is generally small or nil due to the active pumping management of the aquifer which also reduces downstream floods jourde et al 2014 since 1980 the water supply of the metropolitan area of montpellier has been provided by the underground lez pumping station installed 250 m upstream of the lez spring fig 1c the water is pumped from the main karst conduit leading to the spring around 50 m below the spring level i e 15 m above mean sea level amsl the maximum cumulative pumping rate is about 6120 m3 h 1 the water levels at the lez catchment are monitored through numerous observation wells distributed from a few meters to several kilometers i e 15 km from the pumping station fig 1a one of these observation wells the triadou is located 580 m upstream of the lez pumping station fig 1c and was drilled to a depth of 330 m for the purpose of this work geophysical and hydraulic characterizations in this borehole are presented below in the section borehole scale investigations 2 2 the terrieu experimental site the terrieu experimental site is located at the east of the matelles corconne fault in the eastern compartment of the reservoir 4 6 km north of the lez spring fig 1a this site is located in a ne sw monocline of the early cretaceous marly limestone and the upper jurassic limestone dipping nw from 15 to 20 it is composed of 22 shallow boreholes about 60 m deep with a diameter of 115 mm except p0 p8 p21 with a 216 mm diameter grouped in a network with a spacing of about 5 to 7 m over the 1500 m2 surface area of the site fig 1b groundwater level usually fluctuates from 35 to 75 m above mean sea level i e around 50 to 10 m below ground surface depending on the hydrological conditions under exceptional meteorological conditions artesianism has been observed on the site most of the boreholes are not cased except p18 and p19 with cased screen and intersect two main lithologies the upper part of the boreholes length of about 30 40 m crosscuts inter bedded marly limestone which corresponds to the berriasian limestone the lower part of the boreholes length of about 20 30 m crosscuts more massive limestone this change of lithology may be attributed to the transition between cretaceous berriasian and jurassic kimmeridgian limestones fracture analyses were conducted at the terrieu site on the outcrops as well as in several boreholes from video logs drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi 2009 at the outcrops two main fracture directions were observed n070 and n140 wang et al 2014 from video log investigations the fractures oriented n070 are preferentially open jazayeri noushabadi 2009 this is consistent with the orientation of the observed karst conduits jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 the karstification at this site appears moderately developed with a preferential karstification at the intersections between fractures and bedding planes drogue and grillot 1976 various hydrogeological studies have been performed at the terrieu experimental site the first pumping tests conducted at the site in the 1980s has shown that the flow is preferentially oriented n070 which is well correlated with one of the main fracture orientations drogue and grillot 1976 the correlation with the fracture orientations has also been confirmed by numerous short term several minutes pumping tests conducted at different pumping boreholes jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 wang et al 2016 the pumping tests analyses provided transmissivity values ranging from 3 7 10 7 to 2 0 10 2 m2 s 1 single borehole electromagnetic flowmeter measurements from three boreholes p2 p5 p16 estimated transmissivities ranging from 3 7 10 7 to 1 6 10 4 m2 s 1 lods 2000 these estimates show a strong variability of the transmissivity at the site scale due to a strong heterogeneity of the karst reservoir in addition the single borehole flowmeter tests revealed only two or three main flow zones per borehole which is also confirmed by temperature logging drogue 1985 malard et chapuis 1995 jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 the strong anomalies in temperature loggings measured at some boreholes i e p2 p8 p11 p12 p15 p20 suggested flow zones of higher permeability related to karstified fractures and karst conduits developed along a bedding plane jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 because its extensive network of boreholes the experimental site is also appropriate to conduct hydraulic tomography studies recently sequential short term pumping tests wang et al 2016 2017 fischer et al 2017 and sequential harmonic pumping tests fischer et al 2018a b have been performed to characterize the spatial distribution of field transmissivity and imaging karstic features the inversions of the hydraulic data were based on a two dimensional conceptual model derived from field investigations jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 2 3 multi scale investigations strategy the multi scale investigations of the lez aquifer are based on an analysis of extensive dataset collected at different spatial scales from a few meters to more than 15 km and temporal scales from a few minutes to a few months three main scales have been defined according to the methodology applied and spatial investigation regional local and borehole scales the regional scale presented in section 3 mainly focuses on the large influence of the lez pumping on water levels water levels have been monitored at several location using numerous observation boreholes distributed across the watershed including the terrieu boreholes daily and seasonal variations on water levels have been analyzed to extract hydraulic properties at the terrieu experimental site which represents the local scale presented in section 4 a cross hole pumping test was performed to estimate local properties since high flow rate pumping at the lez station have a large impact on the hydrodynamics of the terrieu experimental site the regional interferences observed during hydraulic tests at this site have been removed to analyze independently the hydrodynamic response to the local perturbation this influence was thus filtered in order to provide a consistent interpretation of the long term pumping test performed at local scale in section 5 the borehole scale investigations are presented these includes specific measurements i e packer tests temperature and electrical conductivity logging conducted in some terrieu boreholes and the triadou borehole which has been implemented for this study in addition to cuttings analysis geophysical resistivity logging was performed at the triadou borehole to characterize properly the geology with depth in order to identify the main flow zones in this borehole and estimate their transmissivity temperature and electrical conductivity logging as well as borehole flowmeter tests were realized 3 regional scale investigations 3 1 materials and methods for the water supply of the metropolitan area of montpellier the pumping rates vary daily according to the water demand and impact the aquifer over several kilometers discharge rates are continuously monitored with high frequency measurements 1 minute timestep water level variations were recorded at high frequency with pressure transducers td diver and ctd diver schlumberger at the lez station and in 14 observation boreholes distributed at different places over the karst catchment red dots in fig 1a the seasonal variations due to the long term pumping later referred to as seasonal drawdowns were observed in most observation boreholes only a few of them are sensitive to daily variations called daily drawdowns seasonal and daily variations were both used to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of the reservoir the hydraulic properties were first derived by the classical cooper and jacob s 1946 and theis 1935 solutions for seasonal and daily responses respectively the limitations of applying the theis solution or its cooper jacob s approximation to model the lez pumping responses are obvious based on their assumptions e g fully penetrating well homogeneous and confined aquifer of infinite extent which cannot account for karst complexity however these reference models can be useful to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties using late times drawdown data and may provide a good estimate of the effective transmissivity in heterogeneous media meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 knudby and carrera 2006 the transmissivity estimates using these simple approaches for seasonal and daily responses are next validated using the radial composite model of butler 1988 which allows to simulate consistently the global behavior of the regional drawdowns 3 2 results 3 2 1 seasonal drawdowns analysis the continuous water level monitoring in several boreholes demonstrates strong temporal and spatial variabilities fig 2 a during the rainy periods water levels react rapidly to rainfall rising from a few meters to several tens of meters when water level at the lez spring is higher than the outlet altitude i e 65 m amsl the lez spring starts flowing however the spring does not always discharge after significant rainfall events because of the lez pumping influence inducing strong decrease in water level during dry periods negligible or no rain the pumping stops the natural flow at the lez spring and decreases the water levels over several kilometers the resulting drawdowns were analyzed over three months during the dry season from june to august 2012 the different types of drawdowns were organized in five groups according to their behaviors fig 2b c and d these responses do not appear dependent of the distance between the borehole and the pumping station fig 1 indeed some boreholes displayed similar drawdown responses while they are located at different radial distances from the pumping station see fig 2b and c a summary is provided in table 1 with the different response categories detailed below fig 2b presents two categories of drawdown responses one category groups boreholes with daily responses i e triadou claret and terrieu all boreholes at the terrieu site react similarly to the lez pumping and thus can be considered as a single point at the regional scale interestingly daily responses measured at the p20 terrieu borehole have lower amplitudes once the water level decreases below 45 m amsl see zoom at fig 2a the amplitude of the average daily drawdowns suddenly changes from 1 7 m to 0 3 m in this borehole the second category groups boreholes with a similar trend and amplitude but without daily variations i e matelles and bois de saint mathieu fig 2c presents a borehole category with a similar shape compared to that of the lez station but without daily variations and with smaller amplitude i e gour noir saint gely sainte croix de quintillargues mas martin and bois des rosiers fig 2d shows two other borehole categories one is characterized by a different behavior i e different inflexion than that of the lez station and groups bois des avants and fontanès note that bois des avants presents a combined behavior during the first four days the response was impacted by daily pumping then it changed to follow the general decrease in water level with a different shape the last category represented by the two boreholes located at viols en laval only one is shown is characterized by almost no response to the pumping note that these last boreholes cross cut only the kimmeridgien limestone in the western compartment of the lez system fig 1 the late times drawdown responses were interpreted with cooper and jacob s 1946 method and the results are presented in table 1 the values of transmissivity range from 3 8 10 3 to 7 8 10 3 m2 s 1 and are characterized by a geometric mean of 6 0 10 3 m2 s 1 this mean value is fully consistent with previous estimates at the lez station which range between 6 0 and 6 9 10 3 m2 s 1 whichever period is considered i e 1986 1987 1998 2002 2003 2005 2006 jourde et al 2011 the storativity values are more variable and range between 8 2 10 5 and 6 3 10 2 which is classically observed from the analysis of pumping tests in heterogeneous reservoirs using this method e g meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 bodin et al 2012 and can be related to the heterogeneous diffusivity of the karst aquifer 3 2 2 daily drawdowns analysis daily water level variations due to the pumping cycles can be clearly observed at the triadou terrieu and claret boreholes fig 2b and for few pumping cycles at the bois des avants borehole fig 2c fig 3 a shows water levels at the triadou borehole from april to july 2012 the lez spring altitude 65 m amsl is represented by the blue dotted line when the water level is above that of the spring the lez spring discharges but when the water level is below that of the spring the discharge stops fig 3b the variable drawdown responses are highlighted for 21 daily pumping cycles in june 2012 fig 3b and c for similar durations and pumping rates at the lez station the variability of the daily drawdown shapes appears strongly correlated to the natural flow discharge at the lez spring fig 3b the slopes and amplitudes of the drawdowns were smaller when the natural discharge at the lez spring was higher than the pumping rates highlighted in green in fig 3b and green curves in 3c the slopes and amplitudes of the drawdowns increased when the natural discharge at the lez spring decreased highlighted in blue and orange in fig 3b and blue and orange curves in 3c once the discharge at the lez spring had stopped the slope and the amplitude of the daily drawdowns stabilized while the water level continued to decrease highlighted in red in fig 3b and red curves in 3c as illustrated in fig 4 similar drawdown behaviors can be observed at the terrieu and claret boreholes that follow the drawdowns at the lez pumping station bois des avants borehole only presents daily responses under high water level conditions the hydrological conditions i e high and low water levels related to the lez spring flow conditions i e overflow or no overflow have a strong impact on hydraulic responses due to the daily pumping tests at regional scale figs 3 and 4 drogue and delaunay 1992 previously demonstrated that the singular evolutions of the hydraulic heads are related to the transition from a flow with pseudo constant head overflow to a flow with variable head no overflow as a consequence of the pumping when the discharge at the lez spring is higher or equal to the pumping rate green and blue cycles on fig 3 the daily drawdowns appear strongly impacted by boundary effects due to the lez spring which do not allow proper application of classical radial flow solution such as theis 1935 or the cooper jacob s approximation accordingly pumping test analysis was performed only for the period during which the discharge at the lez spring was lower than the pumping rate i e q spring q pumping orange cycles or when the discharge at the lez spring was zero red cycles in these cases the spring effect was negligible or nil and the drawdown derivatives obtained using the method of bourdet et al 1989 seem to tend to radial flow even though the derivative may be not stabilized because of the short duration of the daily pumping fig 5 because theis 1935 model can properly reproduce this behavior fig 5 this solution was used to estimate the transmissivity the use of a more complex model cannot be justified from this drawdown behavior although the system is heterogeneous therefore the interpretation using theis 1935 model was focused on six pumping periods without impact of the discharge flow at the lez spring orange and red cycles on fig 3 table 2 presents the hydraulic properties estimated for these pumping cycles at the triadou and terrieu p17 boreholes the estimated transmissivities which are relatively constant and similar for these boreholes are characterized by a geometric mean of 1 0 10 1 m2 s 1 for the triadou borehole and 1 1 10 1 m2 s 1 for the terrieu borehole the estimated storativities are also relatively constant between the different pumping cycles analyzed but different between the boreholes the geometric means of estimated storativity are 4 4 10 3 for the triadou borehole and 5 5 10 5 for the terrieu borehole 3 2 3 radial composite flow model the previous interpretations using the classical radial flow solution at early i e daily responses analysis and late times i e seasonal responses analysis highlighted some changes in the hydraulic properties with the duration of the pumping and therefore with the investigation scale to consider this observation hydrodynamic responses at the lez aquifer were analyzed with a radial composite flow model this interpretation has been performed using the semi analytical solution of butler 1988 which assumes nonuniform aquifer with a pumping well located at the center of a first domain embedded within an infinite second domain of different hydraulic properties this simple configuration does not pretend to discretize the high level of heterogeneity of the karst aquifer but can properly reproduce the global behavior of the pumping responses see fig 6 fig 6 shows in log log and semi log plots the measured drawdowns and the modeling using the composite model of butler 1988 for the lez pumping station and the observation borehole bois de saint mathieu this observation borehole presents a similar behavior of the pumping well but without daily variations see fig 2b the drawdown derivative is represented in green for the data and with a continuous black line for the model note that the drawdown derivatives were noisy especially at the lez station and has been strongly filtered to improve clarity one can observe here that the radial composite flow model of butler 1988 can properly describe the observed regional drawdown behavior in agreement with the transmissivities obtained from daily and late times seasonal responses analyses using theis and cooper jacob s methods respectively the estimated hydraulic parameters obtained with the composite model are presented in table 3 a radius of 5 km was fixed for the first domain extension with the transmissivity t1 of 5 0 10 1 m2 s 1 close to the estimates obtained from daily drawdown analyses using theis 1935 model the second domain had a transmissivity t2 of 6 0 10 3 m2 s 1 corresponding to the geometric mean of the transmissivity estimates obtained from late times analyses of the seasonal drawdowns using cooper jacob s method the storativity estimate of the first domain s1 ranges from 7 5 10 4 to 6 5 10 3 and the storativity estimate of the second domain s2 ranges from 5 0 10 5 to 1 0 10 4 4 local scale investigations 4 1 materials and methods a pumping test was performed at the terrieu experimental site fig 1b at borehole p0 during four days in april 2013 with a discharge rate of 50 m3 h 1 fifteen observation boreholes and the pumping well were monitored with td and ctd diver transducers the test was performed under high water level conditions with an initial water level at about 66 5 m amsl under these conditions the daily interferences related to the pumping at the lez station were minimized see previous section but still visible and superimposed on the local pumping test fig 7 pre test water level measurements have been used to identify and correct the regional effects i e regional pumping interferences and water level trend in order to remove the influence of these regional interferences the superposition principle in time and space was used reilly et al 1984 olsthoorn 2008 first the responses to the lez pumping variations observed a few days before the p0 pumping test were used to estimate the hydraulic properties with theis 1935 solution for each observation well second using the estimates of the hydraulic properties related to the lez pumping and by convolution of the theis 1935 solution with the flow rate variation at the lez station olsthoorn 2008 the theoretical responses to the lez pumping cycles obtained in the terrieu observation boreholes were predicted throughout the measured period i e before and during the p0 pumping test third the simulated interferences were subtracted from the data with a linear coefficient to correct the regional water level recession trend observed for this period fig 7 this procedure made possible a drawdown derivative analysis in order to identify the flow regimes and thus improve the choice of the solution bourdet et al 1989 gringarten 2008 renard et al 2009 4 2 results the pumping test carried out at p0 in terrieu induced significantly different drawdowns in all the nearby boreholes the drawdown map clearly showed two main flow directions oriented at n070 and n160 fig 8 a these features are well known and were found consistently throughout the pumping tests conducted at the site this is related to the structure of the reservoir i e the main fracture directions which control the flow around the boreholes drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 fig 8b shows in log log plot the drawdown and derivative curves obtained for the p4 borehole for the pumping test at p0 after removing most of the regional influences of the lez pumping at early times the drawdown derivative reflects the behavior of the local main flow zone with a short radial flow response then the drawdown derivative decreases between 2 103 and 2 104 seconds and then increases again all the boreholes present the same kind of response characterized by a similar v shape minimum on the drawdown derivative typically associated with a double porosity behavior gringarten 1987 renard et al 2009 we thus considered that the flow regimes can be described through the double porosity model of moench 1984 this model is based on the concept of a fractured system embedded within blocks of lower permeability characterized by a matrix specific storage ssm and a matrix hydraulic conductivity km the flow occurs from the fractures to the pumping well and the water stored in the matrix blocks contributes to the flow in the fractures a fracture skin is considered which provides a resistance to flow from matrix to fractures moench 1984 this transient analytical solution is derived for fully penetrating wells including wellbore storage and wellbore skin table 4 presents the results obtained using the least squares method to fit the model to the data fig 8c a constant fracture skin factor was set to fit the data using sf 1 the transmissivity values obtained for the fractured system range from 2 7 10 3 to 1 3 10 2 m2 s 1 and the storativity values range from 1 9 10 3 to 1 3 10 1 the block matrix presents variable hydraulic conductivity ranging between 4 6 10 10 and 5 6 10 6 m s 1 and specific storage ranging between 3 5 10 6 and 8 2 10 1 m 1 the diffusivity values estimated for the fracture system df tf sf are about 7000 times greater than for the matrix blocks dm km ssm 5 borehole scale investigations 5 1 materials and methods 5 1 1 methodology applied to the terrieu boreholes in order to locate the main flow zones along the boreholes temperature and electrical conductivity loggings were performed under ambient conditions in several boreholes at the terrieu site such logs may provide information on the location of the main flow zones if at depth fluid conductivity and temperature variations or anomalies are encountered that are likely to be related to water circulation in the borehole between the main flow zones drury 1984 keys 1990 chatelier et al 2011 klepikova et al 2011 for a precise comparison only the logs carried out at the same time are presented here i e p3 p5 p11 p13 p15 p17 p20 the temperature was measured with an accuracy of 0 1 c and the electrical conductivity was accurate to 1 of the reading on average the logs were made with 25 measurement points per meter to provide an estimate of the transmissivity of the main flow zones as well as of the surrounding fracture network and fissured matrix 15 straddle packer injection tests were made in p2 p5 p13 and p15 fig 1b to improve the estimate of the depth of the main flow zones in each borehole borehole video logs were also used to control the borehole conditions before installing the packer system straddle packers were inflated at pressures from 7 to 12 bars depending on the water column above in order to minimize the short circuiting in the open borehole above and below the test interval the hydraulic tests were conducted by injecting water into the 32 mm diameter inner pipes nps 1 ¼ from a water tank at the surface to the 0 7 m interval by means of a pump the injection rate was measured with a flow meter with a range of 0 01 l s 1 to 1 8 l s 1 and the water pressure was monitored inside as well as above and below the test interval to identify potential short circuiting the injection reached quasi steady state conditions after a few seconds or a few minutes depending on the tested zone a quasi steady state was assumed to be reached when the pressure in the tested interval and the injection rate were both relatively constant the transmissivity values were calculated by the thiem s method for steady state flow in a confined aquifer bear 1979 quinn et al 2012 5 1 2 methodology applied at the triadou borehole a 330 m deep borehole of 165 mm in diameter was drilled in the valanginian berriasian and kimmeridgian carbonates 580 m upstream of the lez pumping station fig 1c in addition to cuttings analyses and video logs rock resistivity measurements were carried out in the triadou borehole to obtain a detailed characterization of the lithology and of the fractured zones fig 11a and b many flow zones were first identified by air lift during the drilling black arrows in fig 11b in order to localize precisely and estimate the transmissivity of the main flow zones single borehole flowmeter tests in combination with temperature and electrical conductivity loggings were performed under both ambient and pumping conditions comparisons between the ambient and pumping flowmeter logs allow estimates of the transmissivity of the inflow zones paillet 1998 le borgne et al 2006 lods 2000 these measurements were carried out for a few hours on july 2 2012 i e under low water level conditions the vertical flowmeter profiles were obtained using a micro impeller flowmeter which can measure velocities to a minimum of 3 cm s 1 the flow profile under pumping condition was conducted at approximately 16 8 m3 h 1 280 l min 1 once the drawdown was relatively stable the flash program developed by day lewis et al 2011 was used for the analysis of the vertical flow logs the model is based on an analytical solution for steady state multi layer or discrete fractures radial flow to a borehole paillet 1998 5 2 results 5 2 1 at the terrieu boreholes the temperature and electrical conductivity logs obtained at the terrieu site revealed at least one major flow zone fig 9 presents the temperature and electrical conductivity profiles in p3 p5 p11 p13 p15 p17 and p20 and shows variation from 13 c to 14 c for the temperature and from 500 to 900 μs cm 1 for the electrical conductivity these logs present one or two inflections with one located near the water table at around 60 m amsl and the other located between 45 and 50 m amsl depending on the borehole location the second inflection is more or less marked but appears in all the boreholes this flow zone determined from the temperature and electrical conductivity logs can be visible through borehole video investigations and confirms the presence of an active karst conduit in some boreholes i e p0 p8 p11 p12 p15 the 15 straddle packer injection tests conducted in the boreholes p2 p5 p13 and p15 reveal a strong variability of the transmissivity over five orders of magnitude ranging from 7 2 10 8 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 all results are presented in table 5 the transmissivity values obtained for the major flow zone also show a variability ranging from 1 3 10 6 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 depending on the location of the borehole some previous estimates of the transmissivity from single hole vertical flow measurements with an electromagnetic flowmeter lods 2000 conducted in boreholes p2 p5 and p16 see table 5 appear very consistent for this main flow zone interestingly a passive observation at the p15 borehole using a straddle packer system positioned in front of this main flow zone i e karst conduit shows a strong influence by the lez pumping in the isolated interval while observations above and below the packer system did not show a significant one fig 10 this main flow zone located at around 50 m amsl corresponds to the elevation of the stratigraphic interface between marly limestone and hard limestone potentially related to the berriasian kimmeridian transition fig 10b remember that the continuous water level monitoring at the p20 borehole fig 2a showed that the amplitude of daily drawdowns due to the lez pumping strongly decreases at the terrieu site when the water levels are below 45 m amsl corresponding to the elevation of this main flow zone fig 9b 5 2 2 at the triadou borehole fig 11 shows the different logs registered at the triadou borehole electrical resistivity log fig 11a shows clear lithology transitions with depth between the valanginian the berriasian and the kimmeridgian carbonates the electrical resistivity increases because of decreasing clay content in these carbonate facies the borehole crosses first 200 m of early valanginian marls and marly limestone before crossing 70 m of berriasian early cretaceous limestone and 60 m of upper jurassic limestone fig 11b the temperature and electrical conductivity logs show inflections that are characteristics of the main flow zones fig 11c and d the vertical flowmeter profiles fig 11e are fully consistent with the temperature and electrical conductivity logs six important flow zones which are numbered in the fig 11 have been revealed by all the logs in ambient condition flow measurements were between 20 l min 1 and 53 l min 1 the downward flow observed in this condition could be attributed to the lez pumping that significantly impacts the triadou borehole fig 3 interestingly two major outflows are located in the berriasian limestone zones 3 and 5 where one is located at the interface between the berriasian and the kimmeridgian limestones fig 11 under pumping conditions these two major flow zones contribute to the flow by 65 of the total pumping rate the estimated transmissivities using the flash program day lewis et al 2011 range from 1 5 10 4 to 5 1 10 4 m2 s 1 table 5 where the transmissivity in zone 5 is the highest one 6 discussion 6 1 hydraulic properties of the lez aquifer the numerous hydraulic tests performed at different spatial scales from a few meters to more than 15 km and temporal scales from a few minutes to a few months displayed a strong hydraulic property variability of the lez karst aquifer see tables 1 5 the synthesis of these hydraulic properties is provided in fig 12 the transmissivity values obtained at the borehole scale are as expected strongly variable and range from 3 1 10 8 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 this large range is mainly due to the methods used which allow to discretize and investigate low to high permeability features corresponding to fissured matrix and fractured karstic network respectively straddle packer injection tests cover a broad range of transmissivity values with some low estimates related to the fissured rock matrix while the impeller flowmeter instrument detects higher permeability zones generally related to the fracture network or karstic features fig 11 at the local scale p0 pumping test the transmissivities appear less variable compared to straddle packer tests and range from 2 7 10 3 to 1 3 10 2 m2 s 1 with a geometric mean value of 6 3 10 3 m2 s 1 the geometric mean transmissivity value obtained by pumping tests may correspond to the effective transmissivity of the investigated volume of the reservoir meier et al 1998 note that the transmissivity estimates can also be influenced by the location of the pumping well e g jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 at the regional scale the transmissivity values obtained using the cooper jacob s method to analyze the long term behavior i e late times drawdown data of the seasonal pumping also appear less variable and range from 3 8 10 3 to 7 8 10 3 m2 s 1 interestingly the geometric mean transmissivity value of 6 0 10 3 m2 s 1 table 1 appears similar to the mean transmissivity value obtained at the local scale by p0 pumping test which might suggest that the geometric mean transmissivity of the reservoir is about 6 1 10 3 m2 s 1 the interpretation of the daily drawdown observations showed higher values of transmissivity with a geometric mean value of 1 0 10 1 m2 s 1 table 2 suggesting a higher hydraulic connectivity between the observation boreholes and the main pumped karstic drain daily pumping tests may be comparable to high frequency hydraulic periodic tests i e in this case pulse tests which appear more sensitive to local heterogeneity cardiff et al 2013 guiltinan and becker 2015 and to the main flow path network composed of highly conductive features fischer et al 2018b indeed sensitivity of observed drawdown to aquifer heterogeneity are known to be different related to the period of the pumping test cardiff et al 2013 proximity of the pumping well to higher permeable zone may cause a local increase in transmissivity estimated at shorter periods of pumping guiltinan and becker 2015 the daily responses related to short periods of pumping are thus mainly impacted by the high transmissivity of the terminal karst conduit where the pumping well is located the seasonal responses are related to long period of pumping test that investigate larger volume of the aquifer the seasonal pumping effects appear to better integrate all the components of the reservoir that may contribute to flow the long time behaviors are known to be independent of the local heterogeneities butler and liu 1991 the lack of sensitivity to pumping well position is thus expected because transmissivity is derived from the late times behavior of the seasonal drawdowns the different level of heterogeneity i e contrasted transmissivity can be here represented at the first order using the radial composite flow model of butler 1988 which allows to simulate the global behavior early and late times of the regional drawdowns the interpretation using this model considers a first domain of high transmissivity relatively similar to the mean transmissivity estimated from daily drawdowns analysis embedded in a second domain of lower transmissivity corresponding to the mean transmissivity estimated from late times of seasonal drawdowns analysis many investigations of karst aquifers point to increasing transmissivity as a function of the measurement scale e g kiràly 1975 sauter 1991 rovey and cherkauer 1995 schulze makuch and cherkauer 1998 the effect of scale on the transmissivity is often explained by an increase of the connectivity of preferential flow paths kiràly 1975 sánchez vila et al 1996 le borgne et al 2006 illman 2006 however the high transmissivity often estimated at larger scale may be biased as cross hole tests are generally performed in the most permeable zones guimerà et al 1995 the multi scale investigations of the lez karst aquifer confirm that any apparent scale dependency of the transmissivity is mainly related to the tested geological structures and strongly depends on the methodology used to investigate these structures compared to seasonal responses the lower values of storativity estimated for the triadou and terrieu boreholes from daily responses also confirm a better hydraulic connectivity to the lez pumping station indeed the storativity obtained using a radial flow model can be used as an indicator of the hydraulic connectivity in heterogeneous media meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 knudby and carrera 2006 the use of simple classical solutions of theis 1935 and its approximation of cooper and jacob 1946 to analyze short daily pumping and late times of the regional drawdown data provided a high variability of storativity which ranges from 4 2 10 5 to 6 3 10 2 the apparent correlation of these estimates with the distance observed in fig 12b can be attributed to the use of homogeneous radial flow model in heterogeneous reservoirs meier et al 1998 the analyses with the composite model of butler 1988 may provide better storativity estimates with storativity ranging from 7 5 10 4 to 6 5 10 3 for the first domain and from 5 0 10 5 to 1 0 10 4 for the second domain the values obtained at the local scale i e terrieu site which range from 1 9 10 3 to 1 3 10 1 might be here representative of the effective porosity due to strong local hydraulic connectivity 6 2 importance of karst bedding plane structures on groundwater flow in addition to faults and karstic features the multi scale observation also suggests the presence of a sub horizontal structure which seems to significantly impact the hydraulic connectivity and the flow organization of the reservoir at the terrieu site temperature and conductivity logs collected in several boreholes displayed one main flow zone throughout the site by isolating this zone with straddle packers pressure responses related to the regional pumping clearly indicated localized flow within the structure fig 10c this behavior is confirmed by the decreases in amplitude of the daily influences when the water levels at the terrieu site reach levels below this zone see zoom at fig 2a although this structure was cross cut by all the boreholes its transmissivity appears strongly variable and ranges from 1 3 10 6 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 note that the highest estimated transmissivity corresponds to the karstic conduit observed at the site this sub horizontal structure may be related to the bedding plane between the marly limestone and massive limestone which potentially corresponds to the transition between cretaceous berriasian and jurassic kimmeridgian limestones this kimmeridgian berriasian interface follows the ne sw monocline dipping 15 20 towards the wnw at the terrieu site jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 the main karst conduit observed at this site appears as preferentially developed at the intersection between this interface and the fractures drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 this preferential karstification seems to be controlled mainly by interactions between bedding planes and fractures as shown in former studies lauritzen and lundberg 2000 filipponi et al 2009 at the regional scale the viols en laval boreholes located to the west of the matelles corconne fault were not influenced by the lez pumping to the east of the fault whereas all the other boreholes were impacted this behavior suggests a compartmentalization of the reservoir either by the presence of the matelles corconne fault or by the absence of connected structures which can be linked to the absence of the kimmeridgian berriasian interface in this compartment the second hypothesis which is also consistent with the observation at the terrieu site is supported by several indications first the impeded cross fault flow generally occurs where the permeability of the fault core is reduced bense et al 2013 however the matelles corconne fault seems to be permeable enough to transmit the signal of the lez pumping to the claret brissac borehole fig 2b second the flowmeter tests carried out at the triadou borehole have shown a significant flow zone located at the contact between the kimmeridgian and the berriasian stratigraphic units the importance of this flow zone is highlighted by the downward flow observed under ambient conditions which suggests the influence of the lez pumping that tends to withdraw water and localized flow in this structure this is further consistent with the ability of the radial composite flow model to represent the global hydrodynamic behavior early and late times responses at regional scale which suggests flow within a 2d structure finally the main karst conduit at the pumping station was mainly developed along the discontinuity between the kimmeridgian and the berriasian units fig 1c as shown by marjolet and salado 1975 and leonardi et al 2013 thus the kimmeridgian berriasian interface appears to be an important structure for the groundwater flow at the lez reservoir and may control the connectivity of the fault and karstic conduits networks at the regional scale the presence of a large and sub horizontal structure appears to increase the hydraulic connectivity of the fracture network and may contribute to develop the karstic network indeed speleogenesis studies conducted in other carbonate reservoirs have demonstrated that most karstic conduits mainly follow bedding plane structures palmer 1991 filipponi and jeannin 2008 filipponi et al 2009 galvão et al 2016 also showed for the aquifer of sete lagoas minas gerais brazil that the localized development of the sub horizontal karstic bedding dissolution controlled the aquifer permeability at both local and regional scales to summarize all the observations fig 13 presents a 3d hydrogeological conceptual model of the lez aquifer as mentioned previously the berriasian and the kimmeridgian limestones constitute the main aquifer formations where fractures and karstic networks are well developed the major ne sw faults illustrated in fig 13 significantly influence groundwater flow at the regional scale as in the case of the karstic network these faults may strongly channelized flow over several kilometers as demonstrated by isotopes and geochemical tracer analyses these faults also contribute to water mixing by connecting shallow and deeper zones bicalho et al 2012 2017 the contact between the berriasian and the kimmeridgian is shown to have a significant influence for flow at the regional scale the multi scale hydrogeological investigations carried out here suggest the importance of this structure the flow appears likely to be localized at this interface and in its absence the reservoir is compartmentalized in this reservoir flow ranking appears very important and confirmed by the distribution of transmissivity which is below 10 7 m2 s 1 for the matrix varies from 10 7to 10 3 m2 s 1 for the fracture network and above 10 3 m2 s 1 for the karstic features fig 12 even though karstic conduits and fault zones provide locally large transmissivities the sub horizontal 2d interface may constrain the hydraulic connectivity of the reservoir the hydraulic connectivity at the regional scale appears to be based on the contact between the berriasian and the kimmeridgian which contributes to drain the surrounding fracture network where flow may be more diffuse note that the bedding plane structures do not always have the same transmissivity which results in strong heterogeneity as observed at the terrieu site 7 conclusions the multi scale hydraulic investigations performed at the lez karst aquifer illustrated a strong variability of hydraulic properties as well as a clear flow ranking the transmissivity of the lez aquifer obtained by several methods provide values below 10 7 m2 s 1 for the matrix alone ranging from 10 7to 10 3 m2 s 1 for the fracture network and above 10 3 m2 s 1 for the karstic features a large sub horizontal flow bearing structure here the contact i e the bedding plane between the kimmeridgian and berriasian limestone units appears to significantly impact the hydraulic connectivity of the reservoir at the regional scale the other structures of the reservoir i e the faults the karst conduits and the fracture network may be well connected to this interface in the absence of the interface the reservoir seems to be compartmentalized loss of connectivity which highlights the fact that this flow bearing structure plays a major role in large scale connectivity of the aquifer the flow appears strongly localized within this structure despite the strong heterogeneity of the reservoir because this structure seems to insure the connectivity of the reservoir at larger scales it allows large volumes of water to be drained out of the karst aquifer which insures the sustainability of the water supply such spatial characterization of hydraulic heterogeneity and identification of the main flow bearing structures is of prime importance for groundwater resources management and protection the influence of bedding plane structure on connectivity and groundwater flow highlighted for the lez aquifer may also be valid in other karstic areas in the world the fact that flow appears strongly localized at this interface may be critical for groundwater exploitation and vulnerability indeed short transit time of contaminants transport would be expected due to strong channelized flow such phenomena could also be enhanced by the development of karst conduits at the intersection between interfaces and major fractures these flow bearing structures appear thus to be critical in predictive modeling of contaminant transport in such aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8405,study region the lez aquifer is a mediterranean karst system located in southern france which supplies groundwater to the montpellier urban area study focus multi scale hydrodynamic investigations were carried out in a fractured and karstic aquifer in order to identify the flow bearing structures and evaluate their hydraulic properties the study is based on an extensive dataset developed from several hydraulic tests performed at different spatial and temporal scales the scales ranged spatially from a few meters to more than 15 km and temporally from a few minutes to a few months new hydrological insights for the region the data analysis shows that the hydraulic connectivity at both local and regional scales is mainly due to sub horizontal flow bearing structures in which a conduit network has developed this structure appears mainly to be located at the interface between two stratigraphic units at the transition between jurassic and cretaceous limestones kimmeridgian berriasian interface at the regional scale this flow bearing structure plays a major role in large scale connectivity since a compartmentalization of the lez aquifer appears where the continuity of this structure disappears the hydraulic properties estimated appear to be strongly dependent on the investigated geological structures and on the different hydrogeological methods used for the borehole local and regional scale of investigations keywords hydraulic tests multi scale analysis heterogeneity scale fractured and karstic carbonate rocks karstified bedding planes 1 introduction karst aquifers which are generally very productive constitute important groundwater resources for approximately a quarter of the global population ford and williams 2007 these aquifers can be conceptualized by three levels of porosity the primary porosity of the rock matrix the secondary porosity of fractures which includes various fracture types or joints at several scales cracks joints including bedding planes and faults and the third porosity resulting from the dissolution of the bedrock along the fracture or joint surfaces worthington 1999 ford and williams 2007 the permeability of the system is generally dominated by the second and third porosity types worthington et al 2000 worthington and ford 2009 in fractured rocks flow channeling generally occurs at fracture and fracture network scales de dreuzy et al 2012 but this process may be stronger in karstic reservoirs worthington and ford 1995 this behavior may be enhanced by the presence of complex networks of enlarged fractures due to wall dissolution and to the development of karst conduits over several kilometers palmer 1991 worthington 1999 groundwater quality and quantity in karst aquifers are therefore highly variable due to the strong heterogeneity and anisotropy of the fractured and karstic networks worthington 2011 the management of these groundwater resources are thus particularly challenging and require detailed characterization of hydraulic heterogeneity which are extremely variable and difficult to determine bakalowicz 2011 in fractured karstic reservoirs the degree of detail in the hydraulic heterogeneity depends on the spatial extent of the investigation and on the specificity of the hydraulic experiments shapiro et al 2015 for instance hydraulic tomography provides important details of spatial hydraulic heterogeneity but requires multiple cross hole hydraulic tests which are generally made at a limited scale of investigation to allow monitoring of hydraulic responses ackerer and delay 2010 wang et al 2017 fischer et al 2017 however hydraulic tomography still remains a challenge to be conducted at regional scale i e aquifer watershed scale due to for instance the technical difficulty to investigate significant volumes of the aquifer a limited number of observation wells distributed over the entire system or simply to an impossibility to provide responses at each observation well during sequential pumping tests at regional scale groundwater flow and hydraulic property estimates in karstic systems are classically investigated with spring discharge hydrographs baedke and krothe 2001 kovács et al 2005 fiorillo 2014 by hydraulic head data analyses sauter 1991 renard and jeannée 2008 galvão et al 2016 or more rarely by long term pumping test analysis maréchal et al 2008 to obtain more details on hydraulic heterogeneity and connectivity at larger scale which could be helpful to improve groundwater management another approach consists in a multidisciplinary framework this requires consequently intensive investigations to identify and characterize the relevant flow structures such as faults joints bedding planes and karstic features such investigations can be made by measurements at several scales of investigation in order to connect all the information and provide a consistent interpretation at the borehole scale flowing fractures or karstic features can be localized and characterized through different methods such as temperature logging chatelier et al 2011 klepikova et al 2011 packer testing quinn et al 2012 or flowmeter testing paillet 1998 day lewis et al 2000 at the local scales cross hole hydraulic tests such as pumping tests can be used to identify the flow pattern to provide information on reservoir geometry in addition to its hydraulic properties gringarten 2008 at the regional scale water level monitoring in several observation wells appropriately distributed across the system can be used for instance to identify potential compartments under different hydrological conditions guihéneuf et al 2014 even though such approach is challenging and requires numerous data it remains necessary to identify geological structures relevant for groundwater flow at larger scales and estimates their hydraulic properties the objective of this study is to identify and characterize the properties of the main flow bearing structures in a karst aquifer based on geological information and a multi scale hydraulic investigation these intensive investigations were conducted in the lez aquifer a mediterranean karst aquifer located in southern france near the metropolitan area of montpellier investigations were performed at regional scale i e the watershed scale local scale using an experimental site i e the terrieu experimental site and borehole scale with specific measurements in some boreholes detailed knowledge of the aquifer characteristics remains of major importance for the lez aquifer management because groundwater is intensively pumped for water supply to the montpellier metropolitan region such detailed information on reservoir heterogeneities may also be helpful for any future predictive modeling related to groundwater management and protection 2 study site the lez aquifer this large karst system located in the mediterranean basin south east of france is referred to as the lez aquifer because it feeds the lez spring the lez aquifer supplies some 30 million m3 of water per year to the metropolitan area of montpellier the area is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate with dry summers and rainy autumns the mean temperature is about 22 c in summer and about 5 c in winter the intense rainfall events in autumn are the main contributors to the annual recharge annual rainfall occurs primarily from september to december and to a lesser extent from march to may the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 600 mm dry years to more than 1500 mm wet years rainfall is also spatially variable with an increase from south to north due to the rising topography and the proximity of the cevennes hills mazzilli 2011 the recharge area of the lez spring is estimated about 150 km2 corresponding to the surface area where limestone directly outcrops the exact boundaries of the aquifer area are poorly known but it is estimated of more than 250 km2 in the following sections the hydrogeological context of the lez aquifer details concerning the terrieu experimental site and the strategy adopted for this study are presented 2 1 hydrogeological context the lez aquifer is composed mainly of upper jurassic and early cretaceous limestone these sedimentary rocks overlie the callovian oxfordian marls jurassic and may locally be covered by a thick succession of early valanginian early cretaceous marls and marly limestone fig 1 a the aquifer is divided by ne sw normal faults related to the pyrenean orogeny eocene and later impacted by the oligocene extension phase séranne et al 1995 benedicto et al 1999 the matelles corconne fault which is one of the main faults divides the reservoir into two compartments the western compartment contains the upper jurassic limestone at the outcrop while the eastern compartment primarily contains cretaceous formations of the early valanginian at the outcrop fig 1a the lez aquifer shows a high degree of karstification developed during different geological periods from the middle cretaceous to the current period leonardi et al 2011 in particular the possibility of deep karstification is attributed to the messinian salinity crisis about 5 5 my ago when the sea level of the mediterranean sea dropped by more than 1000 m due to the closing of the gibraltar straights audra et al 2004 clauzon et al 2005 an extensive fracture dataset was collected at different spatial scales from 2d patterns observed at the lez aquifer data available come from the geological map at a scale of 1 250 000 tissier 2009 from assembled aerial photographs at a scale of 1 25 000 durepaire 1985 and from in situ outcrop measurements at the terrieu experimental site drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi 2009 statistical analyses revealed different preferential orientations of the fracture sets depending on the scale of analysis leonardi et al 2011 dausse 2015 at the regional scale 1 250 000 the main orientations of the faults are from n010 to n040 with over 50 of fractures oriented in this direction at the 1 25 000 scale the results are highly heterogeneous depending on the selection of the geographic zones dausse 2015 three main fracture sets show the n040 n045 direction the main representative ones are related to the ne sw direction of the matelles corconne fault the n s direction and the e w direction at the local scale i e the terrieu experimental site from cretaceous limestone outcrops two main families of fractures with the n070 and n140 directions have been identified wang et al 2014 according to the scale of observation and to the locations chosen for fracture trace maps analyzed the impact of the variability of the fracture networks is significant on the estimated apparent connectivity ranging from well to poorly connected lei and wang 2016 the connectivity of fracture networks organizes the groundwater flow and could influence the karstification of the carbonate reservoir the organization of the karstic networks is related to both the fracturing and the direction of the hydraulic gradient whereas close to major faults this organization is controlled by the juxtaposition of different units and by the tectonic regime leonardi et al 2011 the karstic network is preferentially oriented along the ne sw main faults but in poorly deformed areas the network is mainly oriented in the ns ew direction leonardi et al 2011 husson et al 2018 demonstrated that the varying karstification distribution of the lez aquifer can be related to the presence or absence of impervious formations covering the carbonate strata in particular carbonates located under impervious marly formations early cretaceous appear mostly preserved from dissolution processes and are less karstified husson et al 2018 the reservoir discharges into several seasonal overflowing springs the main outlet the lez spring is located near saint clément de rivière about 15 km north of montpellier this spring is of a vauclusian type with a maximum discharge of approximately 15 m3 s 1 however the discharge at the lez spring is generally small or nil due to the active pumping management of the aquifer which also reduces downstream floods jourde et al 2014 since 1980 the water supply of the metropolitan area of montpellier has been provided by the underground lez pumping station installed 250 m upstream of the lez spring fig 1c the water is pumped from the main karst conduit leading to the spring around 50 m below the spring level i e 15 m above mean sea level amsl the maximum cumulative pumping rate is about 6120 m3 h 1 the water levels at the lez catchment are monitored through numerous observation wells distributed from a few meters to several kilometers i e 15 km from the pumping station fig 1a one of these observation wells the triadou is located 580 m upstream of the lez pumping station fig 1c and was drilled to a depth of 330 m for the purpose of this work geophysical and hydraulic characterizations in this borehole are presented below in the section borehole scale investigations 2 2 the terrieu experimental site the terrieu experimental site is located at the east of the matelles corconne fault in the eastern compartment of the reservoir 4 6 km north of the lez spring fig 1a this site is located in a ne sw monocline of the early cretaceous marly limestone and the upper jurassic limestone dipping nw from 15 to 20 it is composed of 22 shallow boreholes about 60 m deep with a diameter of 115 mm except p0 p8 p21 with a 216 mm diameter grouped in a network with a spacing of about 5 to 7 m over the 1500 m2 surface area of the site fig 1b groundwater level usually fluctuates from 35 to 75 m above mean sea level i e around 50 to 10 m below ground surface depending on the hydrological conditions under exceptional meteorological conditions artesianism has been observed on the site most of the boreholes are not cased except p18 and p19 with cased screen and intersect two main lithologies the upper part of the boreholes length of about 30 40 m crosscuts inter bedded marly limestone which corresponds to the berriasian limestone the lower part of the boreholes length of about 20 30 m crosscuts more massive limestone this change of lithology may be attributed to the transition between cretaceous berriasian and jurassic kimmeridgian limestones fracture analyses were conducted at the terrieu site on the outcrops as well as in several boreholes from video logs drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi 2009 at the outcrops two main fracture directions were observed n070 and n140 wang et al 2014 from video log investigations the fractures oriented n070 are preferentially open jazayeri noushabadi 2009 this is consistent with the orientation of the observed karst conduits jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 the karstification at this site appears moderately developed with a preferential karstification at the intersections between fractures and bedding planes drogue and grillot 1976 various hydrogeological studies have been performed at the terrieu experimental site the first pumping tests conducted at the site in the 1980s has shown that the flow is preferentially oriented n070 which is well correlated with one of the main fracture orientations drogue and grillot 1976 the correlation with the fracture orientations has also been confirmed by numerous short term several minutes pumping tests conducted at different pumping boreholes jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 wang et al 2016 the pumping tests analyses provided transmissivity values ranging from 3 7 10 7 to 2 0 10 2 m2 s 1 single borehole electromagnetic flowmeter measurements from three boreholes p2 p5 p16 estimated transmissivities ranging from 3 7 10 7 to 1 6 10 4 m2 s 1 lods 2000 these estimates show a strong variability of the transmissivity at the site scale due to a strong heterogeneity of the karst reservoir in addition the single borehole flowmeter tests revealed only two or three main flow zones per borehole which is also confirmed by temperature logging drogue 1985 malard et chapuis 1995 jazayeri noushabadi 2009

conduits developed along a bedding plane jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 because its extensive network of boreholes the experimental site is also appropriate to conduct hydraulic tomography studies recently sequential short term pumping tests wang et al 2016 2017 fischer et al 2017 and sequential harmonic pumping tests fischer et al 2018a b have been performed to characterize the spatial distribution of field transmissivity and imaging karstic features the inversions of the hydraulic data were based on a two dimensional conceptual model derived from field investigations jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 2 3 multi scale investigations strategy the multi scale investigations of the lez aquifer are based on an analysis of extensive dataset collected at different spatial scales from a few meters to more than 15 km and temporal scales from a few minutes to a few months three main scales have been defined according to the methodology applied and spatial investigation regional local and borehole scales the regional scale presented in section 3 mainly focuses on the large influence of the lez pumping on water levels water levels have been monitored at several location using numerous observation boreholes distributed across the watershed including the terrieu boreholes daily and seasonal variations on water levels have been analyzed to extract hydraulic properties at the terrieu experimental site which represents the local scale presented in section 4 a cross hole pumping test was performed to estimate local properties since high flow rate pumping at the lez station have a large impact on the hydrodynamics of the terrieu experimental site the regional interferences observed during hydraulic tests at this site have been removed to analyze independently the hydrodynamic response to the local perturbation this influence was thus filtered in order to provide a consistent interpretation of the long term pumping test performed at local scale in section 5 the borehole scale investigations are presented these includes specific measurements i e packer tests temperature and electrical conductivity logging conducted in some terrieu boreholes and the triadou borehole which has been implemented for this study in addition to cuttings analysis geophysical resistivity logging was performed at the triadou borehole to characterize properly the geology with depth in order to identify the main flow zones in this borehole and estimate their transmissivity temperature and electrical conductivity logging as well as borehole flowmeter tests were realized 3 regional scale investigations 3 1 materials and methods for the water supply of the metropolitan area of montpellier the pumping rates vary daily according to the water demand and impact the aquifer over several kilometers discharge rates are continuously monitored with high frequency measurements 1 minute timestep water level variations were recorded at high frequency with pressure transducers td diver and ctd diver schlumberger at the lez station and in 14 observation boreholes distributed at different places over the karst catchment red dots in fig 1a the seasonal variations due to the long term pumping later referred to as seasonal drawdowns were observed in most observation boreholes only a few of them are sensitive to daily variations called daily drawdowns seasonal and daily variations were both used to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of the reservoir the hydraulic properties were first derived by the classical cooper and jacob s 1946 and theis 1935 solutions for seasonal and daily responses respectively the limitations of applying the theis solution or its cooper jacob s approximation to model the lez pumping responses are obvious based on their assumptions e g fully penetrating well homogeneous and confined aquifer of infinite extent which cannot account for karst complexity however these reference models can be useful to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties using late times drawdown data and may provide a good estimate of the effective transmissivity in heterogeneous media meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 knudby and carrera 2006 the transmissivity estimates using these simple approaches for seasonal and daily responses are next validated using the radial composite model of butler 1988 which allows to simulate consistently the global behavior of the regional drawdowns 3 2 results 3 2 1 seasonal drawdowns analysis the continuous water level monitoring in several boreholes demonstrates strong temporal and spatial variabilities fig 2 a during the rainy periods water levels react rapidly to rainfall rising from a few meters to several tens of meters when water level at the lez spring is higher than the outlet altitude i e 65 m amsl the lez spring starts flowing however the spring does not always discharge after significant rainfall events because of the lez pumping influence inducing strong decrease in water level during dry periods negligible or no rain the pumping stops the natural flow at the lez spring and decreases the water levels over several kilometers the resulting drawdowns were analyzed over three months during the dry season from june to august 2012 the different types of drawdowns were organized in five groups according to their behaviors fig 2b c and d these responses do not appear dependent of the distance between the borehole and the pumping station fig 1 indeed some boreholes displayed similar drawdown responses while they are located at different radial distances from the pumping station see fig 2b and c a summary is provided in table 1 with the different response categories detailed below fig 2b presents two categories of drawdown responses one category groups boreholes with daily responses i e triadou claret and terrieu all boreholes at the terrieu site react similarly to the lez pumping and thus can be considered as a single point at the regional scale interestingly daily responses measured at the p20 terrieu borehole have lower amplitudes once the water level decreases below 45 m amsl see zoom at fig 2a the amplitude of the average daily drawdowns suddenly changes from 1 7 m to 0 3 m in this borehole the second category groups boreholes with a similar trend and amplitude but without daily variations i e matelles and bois de saint mathieu fig 2c presents a borehole category with a similar shape compared to that of the lez station but without daily variations and with smaller amplitude i e gour noir saint gely sainte croix de quintillargues mas martin and bois des rosiers fig 2d shows two other borehole categories one is characterized by a different behavior i e different inflexion than that of the lez station and groups bois des avants and fontanès note that bois des avants presents a combined behavior during the first four days the response was impacted by daily pumping then it changed to follow the general decrease in water level with a different shape the last category represented by the two boreholes located at viols en laval only one is shown is characterized by almost no response to the pumping note that these last boreholes cross cut only the kimmeridgien limestone in the western compartment of the lez system fig 1 the late times drawdown responses were interpreted with cooper and jacob s 1946 method and the results are presented in table 1 the values of transmissivity range from 3 8 10 3 to 7 8 10 3 m2 s 1 and are characterized by a geometric mean of 6 0 10 3 m2 s 1 this mean value is fully consistent with previous estimates at the lez station which range between 6 0 and 6 9 10 3 m2 s 1 whichever period is considered i e 1986 1987 1998 2002 2003 2005 2006 jourde et al 2011 the storativity values are more variable and range between 8 2 10 5 and 6 3 10 2 which is classically observed from the analysis of pumping tests in heterogeneous reservoirs using this method e g meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 bodin et al 2012 and can be related to the heterogeneous diffusivity of the karst aquifer 3 2 2 daily drawdowns analysis daily water level variations due to the pumping cycles can be clearly observed at the triadou terrieu and claret boreholes fig 2b and for few pumping cycles at the bois des avants borehole fig 2c fig 3 a shows water levels at the triadou borehole from april to july 2012 the lez spring altitude 65 m amsl is represented by the blue dotted line when the water level is above that of the spring the lez spring discharges but when the water level is below that of the spring the discharge stops fig 3b the variable drawdown responses are highlighted for 21 daily pumping cycles in june 2012 fig 3b and c for similar durations and pumping rates at the lez station the variability of the daily drawdown shapes appears strongly correlated to the natural flow discharge at the lez spring fig 3b the slopes and amplitudes of the drawdowns were smaller when the natural discharge at the lez spring was higher than the pumping rates highlighted in green in fig 3b and green curves in 3c the slopes and amplitudes of the drawdowns increased when the natural discharge at the lez spring decreased highlighted in blue and orange in fig 3b and blue and orange curves in 3c once the discharge at the lez spring had stopped the slope and the amplitude of the daily drawdowns stabilized while the water level continued to decrease highlighted in red in fig 3b and red curves in 3c as illustrated in fig 4 similar drawdown behaviors can be observed at the terrieu and claret boreholes that follow the drawdowns at the lez pumping station bois des avants borehole only presents daily responses under high water level conditions the hydrological conditions i e high and low water levels related to the lez spring flow conditions i e overflow or no overflow have a strong impact on hydraulic responses due to the daily pumping tests at regional scale figs 3 and 4 drogue and delaunay 1992 previously demonstrated that the singular evolutions of the hydraulic heads are related to the transition from a flow with pseudo constant head overflow to a flow with variable head no overflow as a consequence of the pumping when the discharge at the lez spring is higher or equal to the pumping rate green and blue cycles on fig 3 the daily drawdowns appear strongly impacted by boundary effects due to the lez spring which do not allow proper application of classical radial flow solution such as theis 1935 or the cooper jacob s approximation accordingly pumping test analysis was performed only for the period during which the discharge at the lez spring was lower than the pumping rate i e q spring q pumping orange cycles or when the discharge at the lez spring was zero red cycles in these cases the spring effect was negligible or nil and the drawdown derivatives obtained using the method of bourdet et al 1989 seem to tend to radial flow even though the derivative may be not stabilized because of the short duration of the daily pumping fig 5 because theis 1935 model can properly reproduce this behavior fig 5 this solution was used to estimate the transmissivity the use of a more complex model cannot be justified from this drawdown behavior although the system is heterogeneous therefore the interpretation using theis 1935 model was focused on six pumping periods without impact of the discharge flow at the lez spring orange and red cycles on fig 3 table 2 presents the hydraulic properties estimated for these pumping cycles at the triadou and terrieu p17 boreholes the estimated transmissivities which are relatively constant and similar for these boreholes are characterized by a geometric mean of 1 0 10 1 m2 s 1 for the triadou borehole and 1 1 10 1 m2 s 1 for the terrieu borehole the estimated storativities are also relatively constant between the different pumping cycles analyzed but different between the boreholes the geometric means of estimated storativity are 4 4 10 3 for the triadou borehole and 5 5 10 5 for the terrieu borehole 3 2 3 radial composite flow model the previous interpretations using the classical radial flow solution at early i e daily responses analysis and late times i e seasonal responses analysis highlighted some changes in the hydraulic properties with the duration of the pumping and therefore with the investigation scale to consider this observation hydrodynamic responses at the lez aquifer were analyzed with a radial composite flow model this interpretation has been performed using the semi analytical solution of butler 1988 which assumes nonuniform aquifer with a pumping well located at the center of a first domain embedded within an infinite second domain of different hydraulic properties this simple configuration does not pretend to discretize the high level of heterogeneity of the karst aquifer but can properly reproduce the global behavior of the pumping responses see fig 6 fig 6 shows in log log and semi log plots the measured drawdowns and the modeling using the composite model of butler 1988 for the lez pumping station and the observation borehole bois de saint mathieu this observation borehole presents a similar behavior of the pumping well but without daily variations see fig 2b the drawdown derivative is represented in green for the data and with a continuous black line for the model note that the drawdown derivatives were noisy especially at the lez station and has been strongly filtered to improve clarity one can observe here that the radial composite flow model of butler 1988 can properly describe the observed regional drawdown behavior in agreement with the transmissivities obtained from daily and late times seasonal responses analyses using theis and cooper jacob s methods respectively the estimated hydraulic parameters obtained with the composite model are presented in table 3 a radius of 5 km was fixed for the first domain extension with the transmissivity t1 of 5 0 10 1 m2 s 1 close to the estimates obtained from daily drawdown analyses using theis 1935 model the second domain had a transmissivity t2 of 6 0 10 3 m2 s 1 corresponding to the geometric mean of the transmissivity estimates obtained from late times analyses of the seasonal drawdowns using cooper jacob s method the storativity estimate of the first domain s1 ranges from 7 5 10 4 to 6 5 10 3 and the storativity estimate of the second domain s2 ranges from 5 0 10 5 to 1 0 10 4 4 local scale investigations 4 1 materials and methods a pumping test was performed at the terrieu experimental site fig 1b at borehole p0 during four days in april 2013 with a discharge rate of 50 m3 h 1 fifteen observation boreholes and the pumping well were monitored with td and ctd diver transducers the test was performed under high water level conditions with an initial water level at about 66 5 m amsl under these conditions the daily interferences related to the pumping at the lez station were minimized see previous section but still visible and superimposed on the local pumping test fig 7 pre test water level measurements have been used to identify and correct the regional effects i e regional pumping interferences and water level trend in order to remove the influence of these regional interferences the superposition principle in time and space was used reilly et al 1984 olsthoorn 2008 first the responses to the lez pumping variations observed a few days before the p0 pumping test were used to estimate the hydraulic properties with theis 1935 solution for each observation well second using the estimates of the hydraulic properties related to the lez pumping and by convolution of the theis 1935 solution with the flow rate variation at the lez station olsthoorn 2008 the theoretical responses to the lez pumping cycles obtained in the terrieu observation boreholes were predicted throughout the measured period i e before and during the p0 pumping test third the simulated interferences were subtracted from the data with a linear coefficient to correct the regional water level recession trend observed for this period fig 7 this procedure made possible a drawdown derivative analysis in order to identify the flow regimes and thus improve the choice of the solution bourdet et al 1989 gringarten 2008 renard et al 2009 4 2 results the pumping test carried out at p0 in terrieu induced significantly different drawdowns in all the nearby boreholes the drawdown map clearly showed two main flow directions oriented at n070 and n160 fig 8 a these features are well known and were found consistently throughout the pumping tests conducted at the site this is related to the structure of the reservoir i e the main fracture directions which control the flow around the boreholes drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 fig 8b shows in log log plot the drawdown and derivative curves obtained for the p4 borehole for the pumping test at p0 after removing most of the regional influences of the lez pumping at early times the drawdown derivative reflects the behavior of the local main flow zone with a short radial flow response then the drawdown derivative decreases between 2 103 and 2 104 seconds and then increases again all the boreholes present the same kind of response characterized by a similar v shape minimum on the drawdown derivative typically associated with a double porosity behavior gringarten 1987 renard et al 2009 we thus considered that the flow regimes can be described through the double porosity model of moench 1984 this model is based on the concept of a fractured system embedded within blocks of lower permeability characterized by a matrix specific storage ssm and a matrix hydraulic conductivity km the flow occurs from the fractures to the pumping well and the water stored in the matrix blocks contributes to the flow in the fractures a fracture skin is considered which provides a resistance to flow from matrix to fractures moench 1984 this transient analytical solution is derived for fully penetrating wells including wellbore storage and wellbore skin table 4 presents the results obtained using the least squares method to fit the model to the data fig 8c a constant fracture skin factor was set to fit the data using sf 1 the transmissivity values obtained for the fractured system range from 2 7 10 3 to 1 3 10 2 m2 s 1 and the storativity values range from 1 9 10 3 to 1 3 10 1 the block matrix presents variable hydraulic conductivity ranging between 4 6 10 10 and 5 6 10 6 m s 1 and specific storage ranging between 3 5 10 6 and 8 2 10 1 m 1 the diffusivity values estimated for the fracture system df tf sf are about 7000 times greater than for the matrix blocks dm km ssm 5 borehole scale investigations 5 1 materials and methods 5 1 1 methodology applied to the terrieu boreholes in order to locate the main flow zones along the boreholes temperature and electrical conductivity loggings were performed under ambient conditions in several boreholes at the terrieu site such logs may provide information on the location of the main flow zones if at depth fluid conductivity and temperature variations or anomalies are encountered that are likely to be related to water circulation in the borehole between the main flow zones drury 1984 keys 1990 chatelier et al 2011 klepikova et al 2011 for a precise comparison only the logs carried out at the same time are presented here i e p3 p5 p11 p13 p15 p17 p20 the temperature was measured with an accuracy of 0 1 c and the electrical conductivity was accurate to 1 of the reading on average the logs were made with 25 measurement points per meter to provide an estimate of the transmissivity of the main flow zones as well as of the surrounding fracture network and fissured matrix 15 straddle packer injection tests were made in p2 p5 p13 and p15 fig 1b to improve the estimate of the depth of the main flow zones in each borehole borehole video logs were also used to control the borehole conditions before installing the packer system straddle packers were inflated at pressures from 7 to 12 bars depending on the water column above in order to minimize the short circuiting in the open borehole above and below the test interval the hydraulic tests were conducted by injecting water into the 32 mm diameter inner pipes nps 1 ¼ from a water tank at the surface to the 0 7 m interval by means of a pump the injection rate was measured with a flow meter with a range of 0 01 l s 1 to 1 8 l s 1 and the water pressure was monitored inside as well as above and below the test interval to identify potential short circuiting the injection reached quasi steady state conditions after a few seconds or a few minutes depending on the tested zone a quasi steady state was assumed to be reached when the pressure in the tested interval and the injection rate were both relatively constant the transmissivity values were calculated by the thiem s method for steady state flow in a confined aquifer bear 1979 quinn et al 2012 5 1 2 methodology applied at the triadou borehole a 330 m deep borehole of 165 mm in diameter was drilled in the valanginian berriasian and kimmeridgian carbonates 580 m upstream of the lez pumping station fig 1c in addition to cuttings analyses and video logs rock resistivity measurements were carried out in the triadou borehole to obtain a detailed characterization of the lithology and of the fractured zones fig 11a and b many flow zones were first identified by air lift during the drilling black arrows in fig 11b in order to localize precisely and estimate the transmissivity of the main flow zones single borehole flowmeter tests in combination with temperature and electrical conductivity loggings were performed under both ambient and pumping conditions comparisons between the ambient and pumping flowmeter logs allow estimates of the transmissivity of the inflow zones paillet 1998 le borgne et al 2006 lods 2000 these measurements were carried out for a few hours on july 2 2012 i e under low water level conditions the vertical flowmeter profiles were obtained using a micro impeller flowmeter which can measure velocities to a minimum of 3 cm s 1 the flow profile under pumping condition was conducted at approximately 16 8 m3 h 1 280 l min 1 once the drawdown was relatively stable the flash program developed by day lewis et al 2011 was used for the analysis of the vertical flow logs the model is based on an analytical solution for steady state multi layer or discrete fractures radial flow to a borehole paillet 1998 5 2 results 5 2 1 at the terrieu boreholes the temperature and electrical conductivity logs obtained at the terrieu site revealed at least one major flow zone fig 9 presents the temperature and electrical conductivity profiles in p3 p5 p11 p13 p15 p17 and p20 and shows variation from 13 c to 14 c for the temperature and from 500 to 900 μs cm 1 for the electrical conductivity these logs present one or two inflections with one located near the water table at around 60 m amsl and the other located between 45 and 50 m amsl depending on the borehole location the second inflection is more or less marked but appears in all the boreholes this flow zone determined from the temperature and electrical conductivity logs can be visible through borehole video investigations and confirms the presence of an active karst conduit in some boreholes i e p0 p8 p11 p12 p15 the 15 straddle packer injection tests conducted in the boreholes p2 p5 p13 and p15 reveal a strong variability of the transmissivity over five orders of magnitude ranging from 7 2 10 8 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 all results are presented in table 5 the transmissivity values obtained for the major flow zone also show a variability ranging from 1 3 10 6 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 depending on the location of the borehole some previous estimates of the transmissivity from single hole vertical flow measurements with an electromagnetic flowmeter lods 2000 conducted in boreholes p2 p5 and p16 see table 5 appear very consistent for this main flow zone interestingly a passive observation at the p15 borehole using a straddle packer system positioned in front of this main flow zone i e karst conduit shows a strong influence by the lez pumping in the isolated interval while observations above and below the packer system did not show a significant one fig 10 this main flow zone located at around 50 m amsl corresponds to the elevation of the stratigraphic interface between marly limestone and hard limestone potentially related to the berriasian kimmeridian transition fig 10b remember that the continuous water level monitoring at the p20 borehole fig 2a showed that the amplitude of daily drawdowns due to the lez pumping strongly decreases at the terrieu site when the water levels are below 45 m amsl corresponding to the elevation of this main flow zone fig 9b 5 2 2 at the triadou borehole fig 11 shows the different logs registered at the triadou borehole electrical resistivity log fig 11a shows clear lithology transitions with depth between the valanginian the berriasian and the kimmeridgian carbonates the electrical resistivity increases because of decreasing clay content in these carbonate facies the borehole crosses first 200 m of early valanginian marls and marly limestone before crossing 70 m of berriasian early cretaceous limestone and 60 m of upper jurassic limestone fig 11b the temperature and electrical conductivity logs show inflections that are characteristics of the main flow zones fig 11c and d the vertical flowmeter profiles fig 11e are fully consistent with the temperature and electrical conductivity logs six important flow zones which are numbered in the fig 11 have been revealed by all the logs in ambient condition flow measurements were between 20 l min 1 and 53 l min 1 the downward flow observed in this condition could be attributed to the lez pumping that significantly impacts the triadou borehole fig 3 interestingly two major outflows are located in the berriasian limestone zones 3 and 5 where one is located at the interface between the berriasian and the kimmeridgian limestones fig 11 under pumping conditions these two major flow zones contribute to the flow by 65 of the total pumping rate the estimated transmissivities using the flash program day lewis et al 2011 range from 1 5 10 4 to 5 1 10 4 m2 s 1 table 5 where the transmissivity in zone 5 is the highest one 6 discussion 6 1 hydraulic properties of the lez aquifer the numerous hydraulic tests performed at different spatial scales from a few meters to more than 15 km and temporal scales from a few minutes to a few months displayed a strong hydraulic property variability of the lez karst aquifer see tables 1 5 the synthesis of these hydraulic properties is provided in fig 12 the transmissivity values obtained at the borehole scale are as expected strongly variable and range from 3 1 10 8 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 this large range is mainly due to the methods used which allow to discretize and investigate low to high permeability features corresponding to fissured matrix and fractured karstic network respectively straddle packer injection tests cover a broad range of transmissivity values with some low estimates related to the fissured rock matrix while the impeller flowmeter instrument detects higher permeability zones generally related to the fracture network or karstic features fig 11 at the local scale p0 pumping test the transmissivities appear less variable compared to straddle packer tests and range from 2 7 10 3 to 1 3 10 2 m2 s 1 with a geometric mean value of 6 3 10 3 m2 s 1 the geometric mean transmissivity value obtained by pumping tests may correspond to the effective transmissivity of the investigated volume of the reservoir meier et al 1998 note that the transmissivity estimates can also be influenced by the location of the pumping well e g jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 at the regional scale the transmissivity values obtained using the cooper jacob s method to analyze the long term behavior i e late times drawdown data of the seasonal pumping also appear less variable and range from 3 8 10 3 to 7 8 10 3 m2 s 1 interestingly the geometric mean transmissivity value of 6 0 10 3 m2 s 1 table 1 appears similar to the mean transmissivity value obtained at the local scale by p0 pumping test which might suggest that the geometric mean transmissivity of the reservoir is about 6 1 10 3 m2 s 1 the interpretation of the daily drawdown observations showed higher values of transmissivity with a geometric mean value of 1 0 10 1 m2 s 1 table 2 suggesting a higher hydraulic connectivity between the observation boreholes and the main pumped karstic drain daily pumping tests may be comparable to high frequency hydraulic periodic tests i e in this case pulse tests which appear more sensitive to local heterogeneity cardiff et al 2013 guiltinan and becker 2015 and to the main flow path network composed of highly conductive features fischer et al 2018b indeed sensitivity of observed drawdown to aquifer heterogeneity are known to be different related to the period of the pumping test cardiff et al 2013 proximity of the pumping well to higher permeable zone may cause a local increase in transmissivity estimated at shorter periods of pumping guiltinan and becker 2015 the daily responses related to short periods of pumping are thus mainly impacted by the high transmissivity of the terminal karst conduit where the pumping well is located the seasonal responses are related to long period of pumping test that investigate larger volume of the aquifer the seasonal pumping effects appear to better integrate all the components of the reservoir that may contribute to flow the long time behaviors are known to be independent of the local heterogeneities butler and liu 1991 the lack of sensitivity to pumping well position is thus expected because transmissivity is derived from the late times behavior of the seasonal drawdowns the different level of heterogeneity i e contrasted transmissivity can be here represented at the first order using the radial composite flow model of butler 1988 which allows to simulate the global behavior early and late times of the regional drawdowns the interpretation using this model considers a first domain of high transmissivity relatively similar to the mean transmissivity estimated from daily drawdowns analysis embedded in a second domain of lower transmissivity corresponding to the mean transmissivity estimated from late times of seasonal drawdowns analysis many investigations of karst aquifers point to increasing transmissivity as a function of the measurement scale e g kiràly 1975 sauter 1991 rovey and cherkauer 1995 schulze makuch and cherkauer 1998 the effect of scale on the transmissivity is often explained by an increase of the connectivity of preferential flow paths kiràly 1975 sánchez vila et al 1996 le borgne et al 2006 illman 2006 however the high transmissivity often estimated at larger scale may be biased as cross hole tests are generally performed in the most permeable zones guimerà et al 1995 the multi scale investigations of the lez karst aquifer confirm that any apparent scale dependency of the transmissivity is mainly related to the tested geological structures and strongly depends on the methodology used to investigate these structures compared to seasonal responses the lower values of storativity estimated for the triadou and terrieu boreholes from daily responses also confirm a better hydraulic connectivity to the lez pumping station indeed the storativity obtained using a radial flow model can be used as an indicator of the hydraulic connectivity in heterogeneous media meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 knudby and carrera 2006 the use of simple classical solutions of theis 1935 and its approximation of cooper and jacob 1946 to analyze short daily pumping and late times of the regional drawdown data provided a high variability of storativity which ranges from 4 2 10 5 to 6 3 10 2 the apparent correlation of these estimates with the distance observed in fig 12b can be attributed to the use of homogeneous radial flow model in heterogeneous reservoirs meier et al 1998 the analyses with the composite model of butler 1988 may provide better storativity estimates with storativity ranging from 7 5 10 4 to 6 5 10 3 for the first domain and from 5 0 10 5 to 1 0 10 4 for the second domain the values obtained at the local scale i e terrieu site which range from 1 9 10 3 to 1 3 10 1 might be here representative of the effective porosity due to strong local hydraulic connectivity 6 2 importance of karst bedding plane structures on groundwater flow in addition to faults and karstic features the multi scale observation also suggests the presence of a sub horizontal structure which seems to significantly impact the hydraulic connectivity and the flow organization of the reservoir at the terrieu site temperature and conductivity logs collected in several boreholes displayed one main flow zone throughout the site by isolating this zone with straddle packers pressure responses related to the regional pumping clearly indicated localized flow within the structure fig 10c this behavior is confirmed by the decreases in amplitude of the daily influences when the water levels at the terrieu site reach levels below this zone see zoom at fig 2a although this structure was cross cut by all the boreholes its transmissivity appears strongly variable and ranges from 1 3 10 6 to 5 2 10 3 m2 s 1 note that the highest estimated transmissivity corresponds to the karstic conduit observed at the site this sub horizontal structure may be related to the bedding plane between the marly limestone and massive limestone which potentially corresponds to the transition between cretaceous berriasian and jurassic kimmeridgian limestones this kimmeridgian berriasian interface follows the ne sw monocline dipping 15 20 towards the wnw at the terrieu site jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 the main karst conduit observed at this site appears as preferentially developed at the intersection between this interface and the fractures drogue and grillot 1976 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 this preferential karstification seems to be controlled mainly by interactions between bedding planes and fractures as shown in former studies lauritzen and lundberg 2000 filipponi et al 2009 at the regional scale the viols en laval boreholes located to the west of the matelles corconne fault were not influenced by the lez pumping to the east of the fault whereas all the other boreholes were impacted this behavior suggests a compartmentalization of the reservoir either by the presence of the matelles corconne fault or by the absence of connected structures which can be linked to the absence of the kimmeridgian berriasian interface in this compartment the second hypothesis which is also consistent with the observation at the terrieu site is supported by several indications first the impeded cross fault flow generally occurs where the permeability of the fault core is reduced bense et al 2013 however the matelles corconne fault seems to be permeable enough to transmit the signal of the lez pumping to the claret brissac borehole fig 2b second the flowmeter tests carried out at the triadou borehole have shown a significant flow zone located at the contact between the kimmeridgian and the berriasian stratigraphic units the importance of this flow zone is highlighted by the downward flow observed under ambient conditions which suggests the influence of the lez pumping that tends to withdraw water and localized flow in this structure this is further consistent with the ability of the radial composite flow model to represent the global hydrodynamic behavior early and late times responses at regional scale which suggests flow within a 2d structure finally the main karst conduit at the pumping station was mainly developed along the discontinuity between the kimmeridgian and the berriasian units fig 1c as shown by marjolet and salado 1975 and leonardi et al 2013 thus the kimmeridgian berriasian interface appears to be an important structure for the groundwater flow at the lez reservoir and may control the connectivity of the fault and karstic conduits networks at the regional scale the presence of a large and sub horizontal structure appears to increase the hydraulic connectivity of the fracture network and may contribute to develop the karstic network indeed speleogenesis studies conducted in other carbonate reservoirs have demonstrated that most karstic conduits mainly follow bedding plane structures palmer 1991 filipponi and jeannin 2008 filipponi et al 2009 galvão et al 2016 also showed for the aquifer of sete lagoas minas gerais brazil that the localized development of the sub horizontal karstic bedding dissolution controlled the aquifer permeability at both local and regional scales to summarize all the observations fig 13 presents a 3d hydrogeological conceptual model of the lez aquifer as mentioned previously the berriasian and the kimmeridgian limestones constitute the main aquifer formations where fractures and karstic networks are well developed the major ne sw faults illustrated in fig 13 significantly influence groundwater flow at the regional scale as in the case of the karstic network these faults may strongly channelized flow over several kilometers as demonstrated by isotopes and geochemical tracer analyses these faults also contribute to water mixing by connecting shallow and deeper zones bicalho et al 2012 2017 the contact between the berriasian and the kimmeridgian is shown to have a significant influence for flow at the regional scale the multi scale hydrogeological investigations carried out here suggest the importance of this structure the flow appears likely to be localized at this interface and in its absence the reservoir is compartmentalized in this reservoir flow ranking appears very important and confirmed by the distribution of transmissivity which is below 10 7 m2 s 1 for the matrix varies from 10 7to 10 3 m2 s 1 for the fracture network and above 10 3 m2 s 1 for the karstic features fig 12 even though karstic conduits and fault zones provide locally large transmissivities the sub horizontal 2d interface may constrain the hydraulic connectivity of the reservoir the hydraulic connectivity at the regional scale appears to be based on the contact between the berriasian and the kimmeridgian which contributes to drain the surrounding fracture network where flow may be more diffuse note that the bedding plane structures do not always have the same transmissivity which results in strong heterogeneity as observed at the terrieu site 7 conclusions the multi scale hydraulic investigations performed at the lez karst aquifer illustrated a strong variability of hydraulic properties as well as a clear flow ranking the transmissivity of the lez aquifer obtained by several methods provide values below 10 7 m2 s 1 for the matrix alone ranging from 10 7to 10 3 m2 s 1 for the fracture network and above 10 3 m2 s 1 for the karstic features a large sub horizontal flow bearing structure here the contact i e the bedding plane between the kimmeridgian and berriasian limestone units appears to significantly impact the hydraulic connectivity of the reservoir at the regional scale the other structures of the reservoir i e the faults the karst conduits and the fracture network may be well connected to this interface in the absence of the interface the reservoir seems to be compartmentalized loss of connectivity which highlights the fact that this flow bearing structure plays a major role in large scale connectivity of the aquifer the flow appears strongly localized within this structure despite the strong heterogeneity of the reservoir because this structure seems to insure the connectivity of the reservoir at larger scales it allows large volumes of water to be drained out of the karst aquifer which insures the sustainability of the water supply such spatial characterization of hydraulic heterogeneity and identification of the main flow bearing structures is of prime importance for groundwater resources management and protection the influence of bedding plane structure on connectivity and groundwater flow highlighted for the lez aquifer may also be valid in other karstic areas in the world the fact that flow appears strongly localized at this interface may be critical for groundwater exploitation and vulnerability indeed short transit time of contaminants transport would be expected due to strong channelized flow such phenomena could also be enhanced by the development of karst conduits at the intersection between interfaces and major fractures these flow bearing structures appear thus to be critical in predictive modeling of contaminant transport in such aquifers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8406,study region lower mississippi river alluvial valley lmrav is located in the humid subtropical region of mid south usa and lower yazoo river watershed lyrw in mississippi is within the lmrav study focus groundwater depletion due to anthropogenic activities is an issue of water resource concern in the lmrav some studies suggested that forest lands reduce water recharge from land surface into aquifers as compared to agricultural lands however very few efforts have been devoted to investigating the relationship of water recharge and land use in the lmrav this study was designed to meet this need new hydrological insights for the region using the hspf hydrological simulation program fortran model along with the lyrw we found that the annual average water recharge from the land surface into the deep aquifer over the 10 year simulation period for the three land uses was agriculture forest wetland only 1 1 1 2 and 1 4 of the precipitation water from the agriculture forest and wetland respectively recharged into the deep aquifer in the lyrw results demonstrated that forest land slightly increased rather than reduced water recharge from the land surface into the groundwater as compared to that of the agricultural land these finding could change the traditional scientific view on how forests affect water recharge into groundwater in the humid subtropical region around the world keywords forest land hspf lower mississippi river alluvial valley water recharge 1 introduction groundwater depletion is a long term water level decline due to the agricultural domestic and industrial water usages today many regions of the united states and the world are experiencing depletion of groundwater resources konikow 2013 doll et al 2014 this is also true in the lower mississippi river alluvial valley lmrav which is located in the floodplain of the mississippi river and encompasses seven states i e illinois missouri kentucky arkansas tennessee mississippi and louisiana the desire by farmers to increase crop yields through irrigation has led to the overdraft of groundwater resources in the lmrav ouyang et al 2018a from 1987 to 2014 the average loss of groundwater in the mississippi delta of the lmrav is estimated to be about 493 000 000 m3 y and has resulted in more than 7 m decline in groundwater level clark and hart 2009 ymd 2015 to mitigate groundwater resource depletion in the lmrav management alternatives have been implemented including the construction of on farm water storage ponds for irrigation ouyang et al 2018a the development of optimal irrigation strategies kebede et al 2014 and the conversion of marginal agricultural lands into forests or afforestation stanturf et al 1998 ouyang et al 2013 afforestation is the process of planting trees on a treeless lands to create a forest which plays an integral role in sustaining water resources protecting water quality and attenuating river floods more specifically afforestation can absorb rainwater disperse surface runoff purify pollutant and thereby reduce pollutant load into the rivers and streams and producing clean water ouyang et al 2013 while afforestation on marginal agricultural lands in the lmrav has advantages on reducing sediment erosion and nutrient load into streams increasing forest areas and mitigating groundwater depletion numerous studies reported that forests reduce groundwater recharge allison et al 1990 favreau et al 2002 farley et al 2005 zhang and schilling 2006 smerdon et al 2009 owuor et al 2016 adane et al 2018 for instance allison et al 1990 studied the land clearance and river salinization in the western murray basin a semi arid region of southern australia using the simple unsaturated chloride mass balance approach these authors found that conversion of native vegetation to agricultural land increases groundwater recharge likewise favreau et al 2002 investigated the groundwater recharge in a semi arid southwest region of niger using the isotope analysis and a simple model they found that the conversion of native vegetation to agricultural land increased groundwater recharge by an order of magnitude zhang and schilling 2006 argued that changing land cover from perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops would result in an increase in groundwater recharge and baseflow based on a study from iowa usa by dinnes 2004 owuor et al 2016 reviewed the effects of land use and land cover on groundwater recharge in the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions and found that forests have lower groundwater recharges in the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions adane et al 2018 investigated the impact of grassland conversion to forests on groundwater recharge rate in the nebraska sand hills using the hydrus 1 d model to simulate two plots one representing grasslands and the other dense pine forest conditions they found that the overall reduction of groundwater recharge rate for this conversion is nearly 17 scanlon et al 2002 reviewed the global impacts of conversions of native vegetation into agricultural land on water quality and quantity and argued that increases in rain fed cropland and pastureland during the past 300 years from forest lands decreased evapotranspiration et and increased recharge two orders of magnitude and streamflow one order of magnitude in contrast ilstedt et al 2016 developed an optimum tree cover theory and applied to a cultivated woodland in west africa these authors found that groundwater recharge is maximized or increased at the intermediate tree densities in addition migliavacca et al 2009 and tricker et al 2009 found that the water use of lands with poplars is similar to that of agricultural lands and grasslands in general these mixed results suggest that groundwater recharge in forest lands and that tree planting in the semi arid regions are discouraged because of reducing groundwater resources however the effect of afforestation on groundwater recharge in the humid subtropical region especially in the lmrav remains relatively unexplored because of the increasing groundwater depletion in the lmrav and the conversion of marginal agricultural lands to forest lands an understanding the effect of forest land on groundwater recharge is needed currently little to no effort has been devoted to estimating water recharge from forest lands for the lmrav since a direct measurement of water recharge is challenging a modeling approach is employed in this study the goal of this study was to assess water recharge from three land uses agricultural land forest land and wetland in the lmrav using the hspf hydrological simulation program fortran model our specific objectives were to 1 develop an hspf model for the lower yazoo river watershed lyrw a local watershed in the lmrav 2 calibrate and validate the model with field observed data and 3 apply the model to estimate the amount of water from land surface and vadose zone recharges into groundwater for the respective land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site hspf model and data acquisition the lyrw was selected as the study area because it represented a typical watershed in the lmrav the watershed is 618 km2 in size consists of 61 forest land 31 agriculture land and 4 of wetland and located in the humid subtropical region of the lmrav fig 1 the watershed is a highly productive agricultural area mdeq 2008 ouyang et al 2018b containing these major soil types sand loam and clay hspf is a watershed model developed by the u s environmental protection agency us epa to simulate hydrologic processes and water quality a detailed description of the hspf model can be found elsewhere bicknell et al 2001 https www epa gov ceam hydrological simulation program fortran hspf however an overview is provided to familiarize the reader with the model and its components a schematic diagram illustrates the metrics processes and their linkages used in the hspf model fig 2 precipitation is the principal driver of the model initially it is intercepted by vegetation and other objects before falling to the ground or being evaporated once on the ground surface multiple pathways exist for water movement subsequently only a small portion of precipitation actually recharges groundwater through infiltration percolation and lateral interflow which are quantified in the subroutine lzone processes are site specific and depend on topography land use land cover soil type and geographical location all of these watershed conditions are parameterized in hspf we use lzone to determine the quantity of infiltrated and percolated water which enters the lower soil zone the fraction of water inflow into the lower soil zone is the sum of infiltration percolation and lateral interflow which is determined empirically by as described in the hspf users manual 1 lzfrac 1 0 lzrat 1 0 1 0 indx indx with 2 lzrat lzs lzsn and 3 indx 1 5abs lzrat 1 0 1 0 where lzfrac is the fraction of water stored in the lower soil zone due to infiltration percolation and lateral interflow lzs is the lower zone storage lzsn is the lower zone nominal capacity and abs is the function for determining absolute value the difference between the amounts of soil water supplies i e precipitation and irrigation and the amounts of water from runoff et and upper zone and lower zone storages is the groundwater storage in either active zone or inactive zone the subroutine gwater in hspf is used to determine the amount of water outflow from the active zone or groundwater baseflow and the amount of water inflow into the inactive zone deep aquifer the active zone groundwater outflow or baseflow is estimated by 4 agwo kgw 1 0 kvary x gwvs agws where agwo is the active groundwater outflow baseflow kgw is the coefficient for groundwater baseflow recession kvary is the coefficient characterizing nonlinear relationship between active groundwater storage and its baseflow gwvs is the index to groundwater slope and agws is the initial active groundwater storage the fraction of the groundwater inflow into the inactive aquifer is determined by the parameter deeper table 1 detailed explanations of the parameters in eq 4 and deeper can be found in the hspf users manual in hspf model the land use editor enables users to modify or convert one land use to the other within different catchments this editor enables us to convert agricultural lands into forest lands i e afforestation or vice versa in addition there are several input parameters such as forest agwrc infilt basetp agwetp cepsc and lzetp in the pwater modular which can be used to adjust et under different land uses and land covers table 1 it should be noted that effects of land uses such as agricultural land forest land and wetland on surface and ground to a small degree water hydrology in hspf are simulated by its perlnd pervious land segment module this module groups the same land use e g wetland into a land segment and then calculates the hydrological processes and water budget an elaborate description of the calculations can be found in hspf users manual other input data for land use soil type topography precipitation air temperature solar radiation stream network and discharge were obtained from the national hydrography dataset us geologic survey usgs national water information system and the 2001 national land cover data these data were downloaded from the metadata section of basins 2 2 model calibration validation and scenario model calibration was adjusted to input parameters values within a reasonable range until the model predictions match the field observations in this study the following five input parameters values were adjusted during the model calibration lzsn basetp deeper icr and uzsn table 1 these parameters were selected because they are most sensitive to the hspf model predictions donogian et al 1984 because very few observed discharge data were available at the lyrw outlet for model calibration we used the observed data collected around the watershed outlet and recalculated the data to represent the average lyrw conditions more specifically the observed data from the nearby usgs e g 07289000 at vicksburg ms and army corps of engineer monitoring stations http rivergages mvr usace army mil watercontrol new layout cfm were selected and were further aggregated and or disaggregated to better represent the watershed average conditions fig 3 compared the observed and predicted daily stream discharges for the period from 1987 to 1995 during the model calibration as the values of r2 nse nash sutcliffe efficiency rmse were 0 69 0 68 8 38 m3 s respectively and p 0 001 fig 3a a good agreement was gained between the model predictions and the field observations the goodness of fit was also estimated graphically by comparing the peaks and valleys of daily discharge fig 3b the daily peaks and valleys from the model predictions matched reasonably well visually with the field observations during the model calibration model validation was verified by comparing the model predictions with another independent set of field observations during the model validation none of the input parameters values used during the model calibration were modified fig 4 shows the observed and predicted daily stream discharges for the period from 1994 to 2002 during the model validation the values of r2 nse and rmse were 0 65 0 82 5 64 m3 s respectively and p 0 001 fig 4a indicated a reasonable agreement between the model predictions and field observations fig 4b further revealed that the daily peaks and valleys from the model predictions matched reasonably well with the field observations visually during the model validation we developed a simulation scenario to compare how much water from the land surface recharged into the underlying groundwater in the agricultural land forest land and wetland over the 10 year simulation period from 2000 to 2009 at the lyrw the input data used in this scenario were the same as those used for model validation above except for climate data the values of the key input parameters pertaining to the groundwater recharge calculation in the hspf model are given in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily processes daily changes in measured precipitation simulated surface water runoff and precipitation interception among the three land uses i e agriculture forest and wetland over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period are shown in fig 5 in general the peaks of surface water runoff corresponded very well with those of precipitation among the three land uses with an increase in precipitation normally increasing surface water runoff for example the rates of precipitation were 20 52 and 29 97 mm d on may 12 2009 and may 14 2008 respectively while the rates of surface runoff from the agricultural land were 15 52 and 23 39 mm d for those two days respectively a 46 increase in the rate of precipitation resulted in an increase in the rate of surface runoff from agricultural land by 51 there was more water loss from surface runoff in the agricultural land than in the forest land and wetland fig 5b the rates of surface water runoff were 14 6 mm d in the agricultural land 13 3 mm d in the forest land and 12 1 in the wetland on june 27 2004 overall the rate of surface runoff was agriculture forest wetland this ranking occurred because the agricultural land was covered by crops primarily during the growing season whereas the forest and wetland were covered by trees herbaceous vegetation grasses and organic matter e g recently fallen organic material litter layer and humus the entire year which mitigated surface water runoff in addition wetlands typically reduced surface water runoff since they were normally located in lower topographic land with a lower relief and greater surface storage than typically exhibited by the other land uses and therefore reduced surface water runoff in contrast the daily precipitation interception was lower in the agricultural land than in the forest land and wetland however a distinct pattern in precipitation interception was observed in the agricultural land that is the highest daily precipitation interception was found in the agricultural land during earlier summer for most of the years fig 5c for instance the daily precipitation interceptions were 1 55 mm in the agricultural land 4 11 mm in the forest land and 4 17 mm in the wetland on december 29 2000 by comparison the daily precipitation interceptions were 6 05 mm in the agricultural land and 4 90 mm in both the forest land and wetland on june 28 2000 these seasonal discrepancies in precipitation interception among the three land uses occurred because of the seasonal changes in the agricultural land most of the agricultural lands in mississippi were heavily covered by crops during early summer and thereby intercepted more precipitation during this period in addition the daily precipitation interception was somewhat larger in the wetland than in the forest land fig 5 daily variations in simulated active and inactive groundwater recharges varied among the three land uses over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period fig 6 in hspf model water recharges into active groundwater or baseflow can be outflowed into streams and loss to the atmosphere through et whereas water recharges into inactive groundwater is stored in the deep aquifers in general daily active groundwater recharge was low in the agricultural land and high in the wetland fig 6a for example the rates of daily active groundwater recharge on august 22 2008 were 2 39 2 79 and 3 30 mm d in the agricultural land forest land and wetland respectively this finding was consistent with the general consensus that wetland and grassland increase groundwater recharge as compared to that of agricultural and forest lands but contradicted other studies that reported agricultural land has more groundwater recharge than forest land zhang and schilling 2006 owuor et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 concluded that conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops would result in increasing groundwater recharge the conclusion is drawn based on the studies in iowa usa schilling and libra 2003 dinnes 2004 that the annual water loss from et is generally smaller in crop land than in forest land although how the annual soil evaporation was estimated during the non growing season was not elaborated in their studies however groundwater recharge is not only dependent on et but also on watershed hydrogeological conditions in addition iowa is located in the midwest climate region whereas the lyrw is the located in humid subtropical region owuor et al 2016 reviewed the impacts of pre and post land use changes on groundwater recharge in semi arid environment and concluded that conversion of forest land to crop land increases groundwater recharge by 3 4 their conclusion is primarily based on the study reported by allison et al 1990 who estimated groundwater recharge rate after clearing of native vegetation in a semi arid region of southern australia these authors estimated groundwater recharge using chloride mass balance approach in the unsaturated soil zone with the assumption that surface water runoff is negligible this approach would not be appropriated because several hydrological processes such as surface water runoff soil water interflow and et from vegetation interception and land surface were not included we attributed the discrepancies between our finding and the one from allison et al 1990 to the following two reasons 1 our study was focused on a humid subtropical region while allison and other s study was for a semi arid region and 2 our finding was based on more hydrological processes included in the modeling additionally there was more precipitation available for groundwater recharge in the humid subtropical region than in the semi arid region several factors affected daily active groundwater recharge among the three land uses fig 2 these factors included surface water runoff over land flow precipitation interception interflow storage and lateral interflow and et from precipitation interception surface detention upper zone soil and lower zone soil under normal conditions in the humid subtropical region forest lands record less surface runoff than agricultural lands because of contiguous vegetation cover and the presence of ground litter the entire year agricultural lands were under crops only during the growing season in addition forest land has less surface evaporation than agricultural land because forest land has lower soil surface temperature than agricultural land soil surface temperature was one of the driving forces for surface evaporation in addition more soil water losses to the atmosphere occurred in forest land than in agricultural land due to leaf transpiration groundwater recharge differences between agricultural land and forest land depended also on such factors as geographical locations watershed conditions and tree and crop species active groundwater discharge or baseflow need to be calibrated to obtain more accurate simulation results on deep groundwater recharge although no measured baseflow data were available at the lyrw we found the baseflow estimations within the lmrav near the lyrw by usgs killian and asquith 2019 the minimum mean and maximum values of the basesflows estimated by these authors were respectively 0 0 1 24 and 3 3 mm d from 2000 to 2009 while the minimum mean and maximum values of the basesflows predicted by our simulations were respectively 0 0 0 92 and 3 5 mm d for the same time period results revealed that our predicted baseflows or active groundwater recharge agreed well with those reported by killian and asquith 2019 similar results were obtained for the inactive groundwater recharge that is the daily inactive groundwater recharge was low in the agricultural land and high in the wetland fig 6b what deserves further investigation was the difference between the active and inactive groundwater recharges more specifically the active groundwater recharge was one order of magnitude larger than that of inactive groundwater recharge for instance the active and inactive groundwater recharges were 0 79 and 0 08 mm in forest land on may 16 2004 respectively the former was about 10 times larger than the latter results indicated that the rate of groundwater recharge into the deep aquifer in this watershed was very small this was attributed to the deep aquifer which is about 50 m below the ground surface and the presence of a thick clay layer clark and hart 2009 dyer et al 2015 3 2 annual processes annual variations in measured precipitation and simulated surface runoff and total et among the three land uses over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period are shown in fig 7 similar to daily surface runoff the order of annual surface runoff was agriculture forest wetland fig 7b this was attributed to the same reasons as for the case of daily surface runoff discussed in the previous section unlike the case of daily surface runoff an increase in annual precipitation did not always lead to an increase in annual surface runoff fig 7a and b for example the annual precipitations on agricultural land were 526 and 1326 mm respectively in 2007 and 2008 fig 7a while the annual surface runoffs from the same agricultural land were 510 and 412 mm respectively for those two years fig 7b a 2 5 fold increase in the annual precipitation decreased the annual surface runoff by 19 apparently the annual surface runoff depended not only on the annual precipitation but also on the antecedent watershed conditions if the antecedent soil water content was low due to the low precipitation from the previous years an increase in annual precipitation in the current year did not increase surface runoff because more waters was needed to alleviate soil moisture deficiency surface runoff occurred only when the soil surface was saturated and the surface water ponding follows there were only slightly differences in annual total et among the three land uses with somewhat less et from agricultural land in certain years fig 7c in the hspf model the total et included the ets from interception storage surface detention upper soil zone lower soil zone and active shallow groundwater in general the annual et from the upper soil zone was high in agricultural land because the soil surface evaporation was high during the non growing season whereas the annual et from the low soil zone was high in forest land because the tree root water uptake occurred in this zone data not shown variations in simulated annual active and inactive groundwater recharges varied among the three land uses over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period fig 8 in general the annual active shallow groundwater recharge was low in the agricultural land and high in the wetland with the forest land in between fig 8a for example the annual active groundwater recharges in 2004 were 105 120 and 141 mm in agricultural lands forest lands and wetlands respectively under the normal conditions in this humid subtropical region less surface runoff and more soil water reservation occurred in the forest land than in the agricultural land as previously stated forest land was covered by trees grasses and soil organic matter year round while the agricultural land was covered by crops only during the growing season in addition the forest land had less surface evaporation than the agricultural land because of the lower soil surface temperatures in forest lands soil surface temperature is a driving force for surface evaporation and is usually lower in the forest land than in the agricultural land water in active groundwater was lost to the atmosphere through et or outflowed into the streams also more water loss occurred in the forest land than in the agricultural land due to the leaf water transpiration overall the groundwater recharge for a given soil type depended not only on surface runoff and et but also on vegetative coverage type degree and seasonality stage of organic matter mediated soil structure and topography all of which influenced soil water infiltration percolation and lateral interflow similar results were obtained for the inactive groundwater recharge that is the annual inactive groundwater recharge was low in agricultural land and high in wetland fig 8b comparison of annual active and inactive groundwater recharges among the three land uses however revealed that the amount of inactive groundwater recharge was one order of magnitude lower than that of active groundwater recharge fig 8a and b water in inactive groundwater was stored in the deep aquifer that is normally used for crop irrigation in mississippi an annual groundwater recharge of 20 mm or less fig 8b was the case for all of the three land uses which was very small in the lyrw 3 3 precipitation and recharge annual average precipitation surface runoff total et and water recharge into active and inactive groundwater over the 10 year period and their percentages based on precipitation varied among the three land uses table 2 the average annual surface runoff was high 669 8 mm in the agricultural land but was low 559 82 mm in the wetland about 64 92 59 5 and 54 26 of the precipitation were lost to surface runoff from the agricultural land forest land and wetland respectively results indicated that more precipitation water was runoff in the agricultural land because this land was not covered during the non growing season little differences in annual average total et existed among the three land uses demonstrating that land uses had minimal effects on total et in this watershed as discussed in section 3 1 above our findings were opposite to those reported by zhang and schilling 2006 and owuor et al 2016 we attributed the discrepancies to the differences in climatic settings at different regions and the approaches used in calculation of groundwater recharge in this study we were focused on the humid subtropical region whereas the cited researchers were focused on the semi arid region additionally we have included more hydrological processes for the calculation of groundwater recharge than the cited researchers only a small portion of precipitation contributed to the inactive or deep aquifer groundwater recharge table 2 more specifically only 1 06 1 19 and 1 36 of precipitation from the agricultural land forest land and wetland respectively entered into the deep aquifer in this watershed although the exact reasons for this phenomenon needs to be investigated a possible explanation was that the aquifer is deep about 50 m and has a thick clay layer clark and hart 2009 dyer et al 2015 other hydrological processes such as stream inflow and outflow were not included in this discussion because they were beyond the scope of this study in the hspf model the water balance was automatically checked at each time step of a run resulting in balanced water budget for the study 3 4 sensitivity analysis when insufficient measured data to calibrate and validate the important simulation results exist sensitivity analyses of the model simulations to input parameters need to be conducted in this study we used three input parameters agwrc infilt and icr see table 1 for their definitions for the sensitivity analysis these parameters were highly related to the groundwater recharge estimation which was the major purpose of this study simulations were conducted by varying the values of the three input parameters for the agricultural and forest lands table 3 results show that the decreases of agwrc by 20 and 40 from the base value in the forest land increased the average annual groundwater recharges by 1 3 and 1 35 respectively apparently agwrc or the basic groundwater recession rate was slightly sensitive to groundwater recharge estimation a much less sensitivity was obtained for the agricultural land that is the decreases of agwrc by 20 and 40 from the base value in the agricultural land only increased the average annual groundwater recharges by 0 4 and 0 44 respectively table 3 our simulation further revealed that icr or interflow recession parameter was not sensitive to groundwater recharge in both the agricultural and forest lands by either increased or decreased the base icr value by 20 table 3 by comparison increasing the infilt 20 from the base value in the forest and agricultural lands the average annual groundwater recharges were 14 05 and 12 17 higher respectively result demonstrated that infilt or an index to the infiltration capacity of the soil was highly sensitive the groundwater recharge estimation this was reasonable because soil water infiltration is a major pathway for water recharge into groundwater these results point to the need for field measurement of soil water infiltration rate so that more accurate model simulations can be obtained 4 conclusions modeling study suggested that the effects of land uses on daily and annual surface water runoff were agriculture forest wetland this could occur because the agricultural land was only covered by crops during the growing season whereas the forest land and wetland were covered by trees scrubs and herbaceous vegetation litter grasses and other organic materials year round which mitigated surface water runoff our simulation also showed that daily precipitation interception was in general less in the agricultural land than in the forest land and wetland the maximum daily precipitation interception was observed in the agricultural land during early summer in comparison to the forest land and wetland rest of the year because of the densely crop cover unlike the case of daily surface runoff an increase in annual precipitation did not always increase the annual surface runoff in other words the annual surface runoff depended not only on the annual precipitation but also on the antecedent watershed conditions if the antecedent soil water content was low due to the low precipitation from the previous years an increase in annual precipitation in the current year would not necessarily increase surface runoff due to the soil water deficient conditions in general the annual active baseflow and inactive deep groundwater recharges were less in the agricultural land than in the forest land this finding was opposite to others observations that forest land reduces groundwater recharge more than agricultural land we attributed the discrepancies to the different climate regions humid subtropical versus semi arid and approaches used in the groundwater recharge calculation inclusion of more detailed hydrological processes versus not our modeling study further revealed that the amount of inactive groundwater recharge was one order of magnitude lower than that of active groundwater recharge or baseflow only a small portion of precipitation about 1 contributed to the inactive groundwater or deep aquifer recharge although the exact reasons for this phenomenon remain to be investigated a possible explanation would be that the aquifer is deep about 50 m with a thick clay layer finally our modeling showed that forest land slightly increased groundwater recharge as compared to agricultural land for lyrw additional research and modeling with appropriate field measurements need to be conducted to investigate the role of forest land on groundwater recharge in the humid subtropical region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8406,study region lower mississippi river alluvial valley lmrav is located in the humid subtropical region of mid south usa and lower yazoo river watershed lyrw in mississippi is within the lmrav study focus groundwater depletion due to anthropogenic activities is an issue of water resource concern in the lmrav some studies suggested that forest lands reduce water recharge from land surface into aquifers as compared to agricultural lands however very few efforts have been devoted to investigating the relationship of water recharge and land use in the lmrav this study was designed to meet this need new hydrological insights for the region using the hspf hydrological simulation program fortran model along with the lyrw we found that the annual average water recharge from the land surface into the deep aquifer over the 10 year simulation period for the three land uses was agriculture forest wetland only 1 1 1 2 and 1 4 of the precipitation water from the agriculture forest and wetland respectively recharged into the deep aquifer in the lyrw results demonstrated that forest land slightly increased rather than reduced water recharge from the land surface into the groundwater as compared to that of the agricultural land these finding could change the traditional scientific view on how forests affect water recharge into groundwater in the humid subtropical region around the world keywords forest land hspf lower mississippi river alluvial valley water recharge 1 introduction groundwater depletion is a long term water level decline due to the agricultural domestic and industrial water usages today many regions of the united states and the world are experiencing depletion of groundwater resources konikow 2013 doll et al 2014 this is also true in the lower mississippi river alluvial valley lmrav which is located in the floodplain of the mississippi river and encompasses seven states i e illinois missouri kentucky arkansas tennessee mississippi and louisiana the desire by farmers to increase crop yields through irrigation has led to the overdraft of groundwater resources in the lmrav ouyang et al 2018a from 1987 to 2014 the average loss of groundwater in the mississippi delta of the lmrav is estimated to be about 493 000 000 m3 y and has resulted in more than 7 m decline in groundwater level clark and hart 2009 ymd 2015 to mitigate groundwater resource depletion in the lmrav management alternatives have been implemented including the construction of on farm water storage ponds for irrigation ouyang et al 2018a the development of optimal irrigation strategies kebede et al 2014 and the conversion of marginal agricultural lands into forests or afforestation stanturf et al 1998 ouyang et al 2013 afforestation is the process of planting trees on a treeless lands to create a forest which plays an integral role in sustaining water resources protecting water quality and attenuating river floods more specifically afforestation can absorb rainwater disperse surface runoff purify pollutant and thereby reduce pollutant load into the rivers and streams and producing clean water ouyang et al 2013 while afforestation on marginal agricultural lands in the lmrav has advantages on reducing sediment erosion and nutrient load into streams increasing forest areas and mitigating groundwater depletion numerous studies reported that forests reduce groundwater recharge allison et al 1990 favreau et al 2002 farley et al 2005 zhang and schilling 2006 smerdon et al 2009 owuor et al 2016 adane et al 2018 for instance allison et al 1990 studied the land clearance and river salinization in the western murray basin a semi arid region of southern australia using the simple unsaturated chloride mass balance approach these authors found that conversion of native vegetation to agricultural land increases groundwater recharge likewise favreau et al 2002 investigated the groundwater recharge in a semi arid southwest region of niger using the isotope analysis and a simple model they found that the conversion of native vegetation to agricultural land increased groundwater recharge by an order of magnitude zhang and schilling 2006 argued that changing land cover from perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops would result in an increase in groundwater recharge and baseflow based on a study from iowa usa by dinnes 2004 owuor et al 2016 reviewed the effects of land use and land cover on groundwater recharge in the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions and found that forests have lower groundwater recharges in the semi arid tropical and subtropical regions adane et al 2018 investigated the impact of grassland conversion to forests on groundwater recharge rate in the nebraska sand hills using the hydrus 1 d model to simulate two plots one representing grasslands and the other dense pine forest conditions they found that the overall reduction of groundwater recharge rate for this conversion is nearly 17 scanlon et al 2002 reviewed the global impacts of conversions of native vegetation into agricultural land on water quality and quantity and argued that increases in rain fed cropland and pastureland during the past 300 years from forest lands decreased evapotranspiration et and increased recharge two orders of magnitude and streamflow one order of magnitude in contrast ilstedt et al 2016 developed an optimum tree cover theory and applied to a cultivated woodland in west africa these authors found that groundwater recharge is maximized or increased at the intermediate tree densities in addition migliavacca et al 2009 and tricker et al 2009 found that the water use of lands with poplars is similar to that of agricultural lands and grasslands in general these mixed results suggest that groundwater recharge in forest lands and that tree planting in the semi arid regions are discouraged because of reducing groundwater resources however the effect of afforestation on groundwater recharge in the humid subtropical region especially in the lmrav remains relatively unexplored because of the increasing groundwater depletion in the lmrav and the conversion of marginal agricultural lands to forest lands an understanding the effect of forest land on groundwater recharge is needed currently little to no effort has been devoted to estimating water recharge from forest lands for the lmrav since a direct measurement of water recharge is challenging a modeling approach is employed in this study the goal of this study was to assess water recharge from three land uses agricultural land forest land and wetland in the lmrav using the hspf hydrological simulation program fortran model our specific objectives were to 1 develop an hspf model for the lower yazoo river watershed lyrw a local watershed in the lmrav 2 calibrate and validate the model with field observed data and 3 apply the model to estimate the amount of water from land surface and vadose zone recharges into groundwater for the respective land uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site hspf model and data acquisition the lyrw was selected as the study area because it represented a typical watershed in the lmrav the watershed is 618 km2 in size consists of 61 forest land 31 agriculture land and 4 of wetland and located in the humid subtropical region of the lmrav fig 1 the watershed is a highly productive agricultural area mdeq 2008 ouyang et al 2018b containing these major soil types sand loam and clay hspf is a watershed model developed by the u s environmental protection agency us epa to simulate hydrologic processes and water quality a detailed description of the hspf model can be found elsewhere bicknell et al 2001 https www epa gov ceam hydrological simulation program fortran hspf however an overview is provided to familiarize the reader with the model and its components a schematic diagram illustrates the metrics processes and their linkages used in the hspf model fig 2 precipitation is the principal driver of the model initially it is intercepted by vegetation and other objects before falling to the ground or being evaporated once on the ground surface multiple pathways exist for water movement subsequently only a small portion of precipitation actually recharges groundwater through infiltration percolation and lateral interflow which are quantified in the subroutine lzone processes are site specific and depend on topography land use land cover soil type and geographical location all of these watershed conditions are parameterized in hspf we use lzone to determine the quantity of infiltrated and percolated water which enters the lower soil zone the fraction of water inflow into the lower soil zone is the sum of infiltration percolation and lateral interflow which is determined empirically by as described in the hspf users manual 1 lzfrac 1 0 lzrat 1 0 1 0 indx indx with 2 lzrat lzs lzsn and 3 indx 1 5abs lzrat 1 0 1 0 where lzfrac is the fraction of water stored in the lower soil zone due to infiltration percolation and lateral interflow lzs is the lower zone storage lzsn is the lower zone nominal capacity and abs is the function for determining absolute value the difference between the amounts of soil water supplies i e precipitation and irrigation and the amounts of water from runoff et and upper zone and lower zone storages is the groundwater storage in either active zone or inactive zone the subroutine gwater in hspf is used to determine the amount of water outflow from the active zone or groundwater baseflow and the amount of water inflow into the inactive zone deep aquifer the active zone groundwater outflow or baseflow is estimated by 4 agwo kgw 1 0 kvary x gwvs agws where agwo is the active groundwater outflow baseflow kgw is the coefficient for groundwater baseflow recession kvary is the coefficient characterizing nonlinear relationship between active groundwater storage and its baseflow gwvs is the index to groundwater slope and agws is the initial active groundwater storage the fraction of the groundwater inflow into the inactive aquifer is determined by the parameter deeper table 1 detailed explanations of the parameters in eq 4 and deeper can be found in the hspf users manual in hspf model the land use editor enables users to modify or convert one land use to the other within different catchments this editor enables us to convert agricultural lands into forest lands i e afforestation or vice versa in addition there are several input parameters such as forest agwrc infilt basetp agwetp cepsc and lzetp in the pwater modular which can be used to adjust et under different land uses and land covers table 1 it should be noted that effects of land uses such as agricultural land forest land and wetland on surface and ground to a small degree water hydrology in hspf are simulated by its perlnd pervious land segment module this module groups the same land use e g wetland into a land segment and then calculates the hydrological processes and water budget an elaborate description of the calculations can be found in hspf users manual other input data for land use soil type topography precipitation air temperature solar radiation stream network and discharge were obtained from the national hydrography dataset us geologic survey usgs national water information system and the 2001 national land cover data these data were downloaded from the metadata section of basins 2 2 model calibration validation and scenario model calibration was adjusted to input parameters values within a reasonable range until the model predictions match the field observations in this study the following five input parameters values were adjusted during the model calibration lzsn basetp deeper icr and uzsn table 1 these parameters were selected because they are most sensitive to the hspf model predictions donogian et al 1984 because very few observed discharge data were available at the lyrw outlet for model calibration we used the observed data collected around the watershed outlet and recalculated the data to represent the average lyrw conditions more specifically the observed data from the nearby usgs e g 07289000 at vicksburg ms and army corps of engineer monitoring stations http rivergages mvr usace army mil watercontrol new layout cfm were selected and were further aggregated and or disaggregated to better represent the watershed average conditions fig 3 compared the observed and predicted daily stream discharges for the period from 1987 to 1995 during the model calibration as the values of r2 nse nash sutcliffe efficiency rmse were 0 69 0 68 8 38 m3 s respectively and p 0 001 fig 3a a good agreement was gained between the model predictions and the field observations the goodness of fit was also estimated graphically by comparing the peaks and valleys of daily discharge fig 3b the daily peaks and valleys from the model predictions matched reasonably well visually with the field observations during the model calibration model validation was verified by comparing the model predictions with another independent set of field observations during the model validation none of the input parameters values used during the model calibration were modified fig 4 shows the observed and predicted daily stream discharges for the period from 1994 to 2002 during the model validation the values of r2 nse and rmse were 0 65 0 82 5 64 m3 s respectively and p 0 001 fig 4a indicated a reasonable agreement between the model predictions and field observations fig 4b further revealed that the daily peaks and valleys from the model predictions matched reasonably well with the field observations visually during the model validation we developed a simulation scenario to compare how much water from the land surface recharged into the underlying groundwater in the agricultural land forest land and wetland over the 10 year simulation period from 2000 to 2009 at the lyrw the input data used in this scenario were the same as those used for model validation above except for climate data the values of the key input parameters pertaining to the groundwater recharge calculation in the hspf model are given in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 daily processes daily changes in measured precipitation simulated surface water runoff and precipitation interception among the three land uses i e agriculture forest and wetland over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period are shown in fig 5 in general the peaks of surface water runoff corresponded very well with those of precipitation among the three land uses with an increase in precipitation normally increasing surface water runoff for example the rates of precipitation were 20 52 and 29 97 mm d on may 12 2009 and may 14 2008 respectively while the rates of surface runoff from the agricultural land were 15 52 and 23 39 mm d for those two days respectively a 46 increase in the rate of precipitation resulted in an increase in the rate of surface runoff from agricultural land by 51 there was more water loss from surface runoff in the agricultural land than in the forest land and wetland fig 5b the rates of surface water runoff were 14 6 mm d in the agricultural land 13 3 mm d in the forest land and 12 1 in the wetland on june 27 2004 overall the rate of surface runoff was agriculture forest wetland this ranking occurred because the agricultural land was covered by crops primarily during the growing season whereas the forest and wetland were covered by trees herbaceous vegetation grasses and organic matter e g recently fallen organic material litter layer and humus the entire year which mitigated surface water runoff in addition wetlands typically reduced surface water runoff since they were normally located in lower topographic land with a lower relief and greater surface storage than typically exhibited by the other land uses and therefore reduced surface water runoff in contrast the daily precipitation interception was lower in the agricultural land than in the forest land and wetland however a distinct pattern in precipitation interception was observed in the agricultural land that is the highest daily precipitation interception was found in the agricultural land during earlier summer for most of the years fig 5c for instance the daily precipitation interceptions were 1 55 mm in the agricultural land 4 11 mm in the forest land and 4 17 mm in the wetland on december 29 2000 by comparison the daily precipitation interceptions were 6 05 mm in the agricultural land and 4 90 mm in both the forest land and wetland on june 28 2000 these seasonal discrepancies in precipitation interception among the three land uses occurred because of the seasonal changes in the agricultural land most of the agricultural lands in mississippi were heavily covered by crops during early summer and thereby intercepted more precipitation during this period in addition the daily precipitation interception was somewhat larger in the wetland than in the forest land fig 5 daily variations in simulated active and inactive groundwater recharges varied among the three land uses over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period fig 6 in hspf model water recharges into active groundwater or baseflow can be outflowed into streams and loss to the atmosphere through et whereas water recharges into inactive groundwater is stored in the deep aquifers in general daily active groundwater recharge was low in the agricultural land and high in the wetland fig 6a for example the rates of daily active groundwater recharge on august 22 2008 were 2 39 2 79 and 3 30 mm d in the agricultural land forest land and wetland respectively this finding was consistent with the general consensus that wetland and grassland increase groundwater recharge as compared to that of agricultural and forest lands but contradicted other studies that reported agricultural land has more groundwater recharge than forest land zhang and schilling 2006 owuor et al 2016 zhang and schilling 2006 concluded that conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops would result in increasing groundwater recharge the conclusion is drawn based on the studies in iowa usa schilling and libra 2003 dinnes 2004 that the annual water loss from et is generally smaller in crop land than in forest land although how the annual soil evaporation was estimated during the non growing season was not elaborated in their studies however groundwater recharge is not only dependent on et but also on watershed hydrogeological conditions in addition iowa is located in the midwest climate region whereas the lyrw is the located in humid subtropical region owuor et al 2016 reviewed the impacts of pre and post land use changes on groundwater recharge in semi arid environment and concluded that conversion of forest land to crop land increases groundwater recharge by 3 4 their conclusion is primarily based on the study reported by allison et al 1990 who estimated groundwater recharge rate after clearing of native vegetation in a semi arid region of southern australia these authors estimated groundwater recharge using chloride mass balance approach in the unsaturated soil zone with the assumption that surface water runoff is negligible this approach would not be appropriated because several hydrological processes such as surface water runoff soil water interflow and et from vegetation interception and land surface were not included we attributed the discrepancies between our finding and the one from allison et al 1990 to the following two reasons 1 our study was focused on a humid subtropical region while allison and other s study was for a semi arid region and 2 our finding was based on more hydrological processes included in the modeling additionally there was more precipitation available for groundwater recharge in the humid subtropical region than in the semi arid region several factors affected daily active groundwater recharge among the three land uses fig 2 these factors included surface water runoff over land flow precipitation interception interflow storage and lateral interflow and et from precipitation interception surface detention upper zone soil and lower zone soil under normal conditions in the humid subtropical region forest lands record less surface runoff than agricultural lands because of contiguous vegetation cover and the presence of ground litter the entire year agricultural lands were under crops only during the growing season in addition forest land has less surface evaporation than agricultural land because forest land has lower soil surface temperature than agricultural land soil surface temperature was one of the driving forces for surface evaporation in addition more soil water losses to the atmosphere occurred in forest land than in agricultural land due to leaf transpiration groundwater recharge differences between agricultural land and forest land depended also on such factors as geographical locations watershed conditions and tree and crop species active groundwater discharge or baseflow need to be calibrated to obtain more accurate simulation results on deep groundwater recharge although no measured baseflow data were available at the lyrw we found the baseflow estimations within the lmrav near the lyrw by usgs killian and asquith 2019 the minimum mean and maximum values of the basesflows estimated by these authors were respectively 0 0 1 24 and 3 3 mm d from 2000 to 2009 while the minimum mean and maximum values of the basesflows predicted by our simulations were respectively 0 0 0 92 and 3 5 mm d for the same time period results revealed that our predicted baseflows or active groundwater recharge agreed well with those reported by killian and asquith 2019 similar results were obtained for the inactive groundwater recharge that is the daily inactive groundwater recharge was low in the agricultural land and high in the wetland fig 6b what deserves further investigation was the difference between the active and inactive groundwater recharges more specifically the active groundwater recharge was one order of magnitude larger than that of inactive groundwater recharge for instance the active and inactive groundwater recharges were 0 79 and 0 08 mm in forest land on may 16 2004 respectively the former was about 10 times larger than the latter results indicated that the rate of groundwater recharge into the deep aquifer in this watershed was very small this was attributed to the deep aquifer which is about 50 m below the ground surface and the presence of a thick clay layer clark and hart 2009 dyer et al 2015 3 2 annual processes annual variations in measured precipitation and simulated surface runoff and total et among the three land uses over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period are shown in fig 7 similar to daily surface runoff the order of annual surface runoff was agriculture forest wetland fig 7b this was attributed to the same reasons as for the case of daily surface runoff discussed in the previous section unlike the case of daily surface runoff an increase in annual precipitation did not always lead to an increase in annual surface runoff fig 7a and b for example the annual precipitations on agricultural land were 526 and 1326 mm respectively in 2007 and 2008 fig 7a while the annual surface runoffs from the same agricultural land were 510 and 412 mm respectively for those two years fig 7b a 2 5 fold increase in the annual precipitation decreased the annual surface runoff by 19 apparently the annual surface runoff depended not only on the annual precipitation but also on the antecedent watershed conditions if the antecedent soil water content was low due to the low precipitation from the previous years an increase in annual precipitation in the current year did not increase surface runoff because more waters was needed to alleviate soil moisture deficiency surface runoff occurred only when the soil surface was saturated and the surface water ponding follows there were only slightly differences in annual total et among the three land uses with somewhat less et from agricultural land in certain years fig 7c in the hspf model the total et included the ets from interception storage surface detention upper soil zone lower soil zone and active shallow groundwater in general the annual et from the upper soil zone was high in agricultural land because the soil surface evaporation was high during the non growing season whereas the annual et from the low soil zone was high in forest land because the tree root water uptake occurred in this zone data not shown variations in simulated annual active and inactive groundwater recharges varied among the three land uses over the 10 year 2000 2009 simulation period fig 8 in general the annual active shallow groundwater recharge was low in the agricultural land and high in the wetland with the forest land in between fig 8a for example the annual active groundwater recharges in 2004 were 105 120 and 141 mm in agricultural lands forest lands and wetlands respectively under the normal conditions in this humid subtropical region less surface runoff and more soil water reservation occurred in the forest land than in the agricultural land as previously stated forest land was covered by trees grasses and soil organic matter year round while the agricultural land was covered by crops only during the growing season in addition the forest land had less surface evaporation than the agricultural land because of the lower soil surface temperatures in forest lands soil surface temperature is a driving force for surface evaporation and is usually lower in the forest land than in the agricultural land water in active groundwater was lost to the atmosphere through et or outflowed into the streams also more water loss occurred in the forest land than in the agricultural land due to the leaf water transpiration overall the groundwater recharge for a given soil type depended not only on surface runoff and et but also on vegetative coverage type degree and seasonality stage of organic matter mediated soil structure and topography all of which influenced soil water infiltration percolation and lateral interflow similar results were obtained for the inactive groundwater recharge that is the annual inactive groundwater recharge was low in agricultural land and high in wetland fig 8b comparison of annual active and inactive groundwater recharges among the three land uses however revealed that the amount of inactive groundwater recharge was one order of magnitude lower than that of active groundwater recharge fig 8a and b water in inactive groundwater was stored in the deep aquifer that is normally used for crop irrigation in mississippi an annual groundwater recharge of 20 mm or less fig 8b was the case for all of the three land uses which was very small in the lyrw 3 3 precipitation and recharge annual average precipitation surface runoff total et and water recharge into active and inactive groundwater over the 10 year period and their percentages based on precipitation varied among the three land uses table 2 the average annual surface runoff was high 669 8 mm in the agricultural land but was low 559 82 mm in the wetland about 64 92 59 5 and 54 26 of the precipitation were lost to surface runoff from the agricultural land forest land and wetland respectively results indicated that more precipitation water was runoff in the agricultural land because this land was not covered during the non growing season little differences in annual average total et existed among the three land uses demonstrating that land uses had minimal effects on total et in this watershed as discussed in section 3 1 above our findings were opposite to those reported by zhang and schilling 2006 and owuor et al 2016 we attributed the discrepancies to the differences in climatic settings at different regions and the approaches used in calculation of groundwater recharge in this study we were focused on the humid subtropical region whereas the cited researchers were focused on the semi arid region additionally we have included more hydrological processes for the calculation of groundwater recharge than the cited researchers only a small portion of precipitation contributed to the inactive or deep aquifer groundwater recharge table 2 more specifically only 1 06 1 19 and 1 36 of precipitation from the agricultural land forest land and wetland respectively entered into the deep aquifer in this watershed although the exact reasons for this phenomenon needs to be investigated a possible explanation was that the aquifer is deep about 50 m and has a thick clay layer clark and hart 2009 dyer et al 2015 other hydrological processes such as stream inflow and outflow were not included in this discussion because they were beyond the scope of this study in the hspf model the water balance was automatically checked at each time step of a run resulting in balanced water budget for the study 3 4 sensitivity analysis when insufficient measured data to calibrate and validate the important simulation results exist sensitivity analyses of the model simulations to input parameters need to be conducted in this study we used three input parameters agwrc infilt and icr see table 1 for their definitions for the sensitivity analysis these parameters were highly related to the groundwater recharge estimation which was the major purpose of this study simulations were conducted by varying the values of the three input parameters for the agricultural and forest lands table 3 results show that the decreases of agwrc by 20 and 40 from the base value in the forest land increased the average annual groundwater recharges by 1 3 and 1 35 respectively apparently agwrc or the basic groundwater recession rate was slightly sensitive to groundwater recharge estimation a much less sensitivity was obtained for the agricultural land that is the decreases of agwrc by 20 and 40 from the base value in the agricultural land only increased the average annual groundwater recharges by 0 4 and 0 44 respectively table 3 our simulation further revealed that icr or interflow recession parameter was not sensitive to groundwater recharge in both the agricultural and forest lands by either increased or decreased the base icr value by 20 table 3 by comparison increasing the infilt 20 from the base value in the forest and agricultural lands the average annual groundwater recharges were 14 05 and 12 17 higher respectively result demonstrated that infilt or an index to the infiltration capacity of the soil was highly sensitive the groundwater recharge estimation this was reasonable because soil water infiltration is a major pathway for water recharge into groundwater these results point to the need for field measurement of soil water infiltration rate so that more accurate model simulations can be obtained 4 conclusions modeling study suggested that the effects of land uses on daily and annual surface water runoff were agriculture forest wetland this could occur because the agricultural land was only covered by crops during the growing season whereas the forest land and wetland were covered by trees scrubs and herbaceous vegetation litter grasses and other organic materials year round which mitigated surface water runoff our simulation also showed that daily precipitation interception was in general less in the agricultural land than in the forest land and wetland the maximum daily precipitation interception was observed in the agricultural land during early summer in comparison to the forest land and wetland rest of the year because of the densely crop cover unlike the case of daily surface runoff an increase in annual precipitation did not always increase the annual surface runoff in other words the annual surface runoff depended not only on the annual precipitation but also on the antecedent watershed conditions if the antecedent soil water content was low due to the low precipitation from the previous years an increase in annual precipitation in the current year would not necessarily increase surface runoff due to the soil water deficient conditions in general the annual active baseflow and inactive deep groundwater recharges were less in the agricultural land than in the forest land this finding was opposite to others observations that forest land reduces groundwater recharge more than agricultural land we attributed the discrepancies to the different climate regions humid subtropical versus semi arid and approaches used in the groundwater recharge calculation inclusion of more detailed hydrological processes versus not our modeling study further revealed that the amount of inactive groundwater recharge was one order of magnitude lower than that of active groundwater recharge or baseflow only a small portion of precipitation about 1 contributed to the inactive groundwater or deep aquifer recharge although the exact reasons for this phenomenon remain to be investigated a possible explanation would be that the aquifer is deep about 50 m with a thick clay layer finally our modeling showed that forest land slightly increased groundwater recharge as compared to agricultural land for lyrw additional research and modeling with appropriate field measurements need to be conducted to investigate the role of forest land on groundwater recharge in the humid subtropical region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8407,study region the bromo tengger volcanic aquifer system east java indonesia study focus andesitic volcanic aquifers in indonesia are an important source of groundwater supply for the population the artesian flow from high discharge springs facilitates the access for irrigation and drinking water but continuously flowing artesian wells exert an increasing pressure on the groundwater resource given the complexity of the volcanic edifice a multidisciplinary approach including geological hydrometeorological hydrochemical and isotopic measurements was performed to characterise the hydrogeological functioning of the volcano s northern flank new hydrogeological insights for the region two main hydrogeological systems are identified a system with perched aquifers in the lava flows and pyroclastic complex supplying low discharge springs or infiltrating to a deep flow system the latter system is unconfined and provides groundwater to the downstream plain that hosts a confined multi layer volcano sedimentary aquifer the joint implementation of a quantitative isotopic approach and a groundwater budget allows characterising aquifer recharge along the whole volcano flank it is mainly controlled by the rainfall distribution that peaks around 1200 m elevation the caldera basin on the top of the volcano has a very limited contribution to recharge a conceptual hydrogeological model is proposed and compared to the main concepts of volcanic islands this study is a first step for further scientific and management discussions to implement protection policies on the bromo tengger aquifer system keywords hydrogeology volcanic aquifer andesite recharge isotopes hydrochemistry quantitative analysis 1 introduction worldwide insular volcanic aquifers are a serious asset for drinking water supply in such environments due to the growth of water needs surface water resources are no longer sufficient particularly during the dry season in many cases groundwater becomes an alternative resource to provide drinking water such as on hawaii in the pacific ocean whittier et al 2010 jeju island in korea hamm et al 2005 martinique island in the caribbean sea vittecoq et al 2015 or the canary islands in the atlantic ocean izquierdo 2014 the indonesian archipelago is located on the ring of fire pambudi 2018 which is an area of intense seismic and volcanic activity including 400 andesitic volcanoes of which about 70 are still active some of them are known for the emission of the most major plinian eruptions already having upset global climate such as the mont samalas guillet et al 2017 in this region volcanoes represent a concentration of significant hazards and natural livelihood for the population the mount bromo tengger in the eastern part of the java island is one of the most visited andesitic volcanoes in the world bromo tengger semeru national park fao 1982 cochrane 2006 more than a profitable touristic spot the massif also provides a unique drinking water resource to the local population through groundwater several volcanic springs discharging more than 1000 l s 1 are known at the feet of the volcano and are used for irrigation and the population needs since centuries to millennials in particular they partly supply the second biggest city of indonesia surabaya about 4 million inhabitants 80 km north of the volcano and other cities surrounding the volcano such as probolinggo east and malang west they also totally supply the city of pasuruan north the artesian spring of umbulan is the most important spring of the area with a current discharge of about 3500 l s 1 during the last few decades and mainly since the 80 hundreds of wells were drilled at the feet of the volcano particularly for paddy fields irrigation these continuously flowing artesian wells with a discharge often higher than 15 l s 1 modify the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer as highlighted by the significant decrease of the major springs discharge the knowledge of the structure functioning and water budget of the whole hydrogeological system in this area is thus required to ensure the sustainable quantitative management of the aquifer and also to preserve groundwater quality the andesitic type volcanism hydrogeology is much less studied than the basaltic one and there is a need for the development of hydrogeological conceptual models two majors distinctions have been proposed in the literature to describe basaltic type volcanism hydrogeological systems at the volcano island scale 1 the hawaiian model and 2 the canary island model the hawaiian model describes a low lying basal aquifer with high level water bodies perched on low permeability layers and impounded by dikes ingebritsen and scholl 1993 the canary model describes a continuous aquifer that domes steeply inland to high elevation over a low permeability volcanic core custodio 2007 hemmings et al 2015b however there is now a consensus on considering only one single conceptual model with differences depending on local circumstances and the effects of the volcanic deposits succession erosion and reshaping due to major landslides custodio com pers custodio 2007 herrera and custodio 2008 this single conceptual model considers only one main stratified and heterogeneous groundwater body through a combination of a central low permeability volcanic core with a dyke intrusion network a more permeable cover and a skirt or apron of very transmissive materials in periphery custodio com pers custodio et al 2016 marrero diaz et al 2015 some andesitic geological environments such as pyroclastic formations have locally been studied e g charlier et al 2011 in the caribbean or selles et al 2015 in indonesia however the hydrogeological functioning of andesitic volcanoes or composite shield volcanoes such as the bromo tengger are poorly known moreover the proposed case study can also be considered as an example of the hydrological responses to changing conditions due to anthropogenic forcings there is a real lack of knowledge regarding the hydrogeology of the bromo tengger volcano previous studies mostly focused on the volcanology and seismics of the mount bromo and its caldera and some others on the geological architecture of the volcanic edifice aiuppa et al 2015 bachri et al 2015 bani et al 2013 gottschämmer and surono 2000 mulyadi 1992 van gerven and pichler 1995 zaennudin et al 1994 the main aim of this study is thus to identify the structure and hydrogeological functioning of the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcanic edifice as required for a correct characterization of such complex hydrosystems a pluridisciplinary approach see for instance dewandel et al 2017 maréchal et al 2014 pryet et al 2012a 2012b has been implemented geological hydroclimatic hydrochemical and isotopic investigations allow the construction of a robust conceptual model of the bromo tengger volcano in addition it is also important to adapt existing methodologies such as isotope hydrology and to reinforce their robustness into this specific context of humid tropical climate with a wide range of elevations the present work is structured as follows after this introduction section 1 the study area is presented in section 2 section 3 details the methodology which combines geological surveys the implementation of a hydro climatologic monitoring network hydrochemistry and isotopes analyses section 4 focus on the results and interpretations of the gathered data for a better understanding of groundwater circulation section 5 is devoted to a discussion about the interest of a quantitative isotopic modelling coupled with a hydrological water balance to identify the recharge area of the multilayer aquifer located at the basis of this andesitic volcano and to the set up of its conceptual hydrogeological model 2 study area the study area fig 1 is approximately 1300 km² and covers the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcano including the highest caldera tengger caldera and the coastal plain of pasuruan city while only few springs exist in the southern part of the volcano the northern part is of great hydrogeological interest due to the numerous high discharge water points groundwater outflows known in that area 2 1 geology the bromo tengger bt mountain is one of the many volcanic edifices in the eastern part of the java island indonesia fig 1 a it is a complex andesitic stratovolcano comprising in its actual caldera several cones such as the last active mount bromo fig 1 b the bromo tengger is located in the bromo tengger semeru national park and culminates at about 2700 m above sea level m a s l the inner caldera floor is at about 2100 m a s l this volcanic massif began to grow about 1 4 million years ago as a result of the northwards subduction of the indo australian plate beneath the eurasian plate this volcano is located in the back arc basin of the sunda arc hamilton 1988 the different eruptions of the tengger are mainly classified as vei 2 as regards the volcanic explosivity index defined by newhall and self 1982 that comprises 8 classes over time they produced a succession of a huge accumulation of lava flows and subordinate pyroclastic deposits which constitute the framework of the composite bromo tengger volcano thouret 1999 the recent collapse of the magmatic chamber created a large caldera 16 km in diameter with a large collapse in its north east edge sapikerep valley widespread ash fall deposits covering the upper flanks of the tengger are related to phreatomagmatic activity from the intra caldera complex mulyadi 1992 erosion by streams forms numerous canyons with very steep slopes which extend radially from the caldera and the volcano slopes to the piedmont areas the peripheral zones of the volcano structure and particularly the pasuruan north plain are constituted by volcano sedimentary deposits quaternary in age such as observed around most big stratovolcano volcanoes in indonesia selles et al 2015 the thickness of this filling is more than 300 m according to the stratigraphy proposed for the lusi mud volcano mazzini et al 2017 located about 40 km north from the pasuruan plain fig 1a this volcano sedimentary series exhibits a south north graded bedding it comprises all the transition terms between proximal volcanic series such as lava flows pyroclastic falls and flows lahars reworked volcanic formations and more distal volcano sedimentary deposits that are progressively more clayey towards the north fine clayey sediments constitute the first tens of meters below ground surface of this volcano sedimentary series if many studies focused on the geology and geomorphology of the tengger caldera fig 1 b there is still an important lack of knowledge concerning the fault system of the tengger edifice and the detailed structure of the peripheral sectors such as the north pasuruan plain the major tectonic structures of east java are normal e w and strike slip ne sw faults inherited from the subduction context marliyani 2016 susilohadi 1995 some authors describe the caldera structure and the caldera bounding faults of different type of volcanoes cabusson 2012 cole et al 2005 in particular for the tengger the northeast margin of the tengger caldera fig 1 a is linear suggesting a control by a nw se trending fault newhall and dzurisin 1988 additionally neumann van padang 1951 suggested the existence of two subtle alignments of vents within the caldera nne ssw and e w no other fault system is described on the tengger in the literature however the watukosek fault system fig 1 a associated to the arjuno welirang volcanic complex described by moscariello et al 2017 could be extrapolated to similar regional ne sw fault systems responsible of the alignment of the semeru bromo and the piercement structure illustrated by the ranu grati maar in the pasuruan plain the north pasuruan fault zone surveyed by marliyani 2016 suggests that the pasuruan plain is structured by a south north graben 2 2 climate according to badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika of malang bmkg 2018 east java is characterised by a humid tropical climate with two distinct seasons a wet season from november to april and a dry season from may to october the east java mean annual rainfall is about 1500 mm at sea level with about 140 rainy days a year bps statistics indonesia 2017 for the bromo tengger area the precipitation recorded for the 2008 2018 period is ranging from 1290 to 2400 mm year 1 respectively for the station 9 and 5 bmkg 2018 fig 2 a the mean interannual precipitation estimated on the basis of 6 rain gauges n 1 2 4 5 6 7 fig 1 regularly located on the northern flank of bromo tengger is about 2000 mm year 1 with a maximum amount of rainfall from december to february fig 2 a b unfortunately bmkg data are not precise enough to map rainfall on the tengger volcano because of numerous and long gaps observed in data for all rain gauges in such steep topographic environment the rainfall usually increases from the coastal low elevation areas to the inland highest areas but also depends on the wind orientation from the surabaya and malang stations data the annual average wind direction is about n150 nw se with a mean velocity of about 5 km h 1 and the annual average humidity is 76 the 2008 2018 annual average temperature shows a minimum temperature of 18 3 c for malang 580 m a s l and a maximum temperature of 32 1 c for surabaya 10 m a s l the mean interannual precipitation estimated by the trmm satellite data kummerow et al 1998 for the hydrological years 2000 2018 fig 2 c is 2123 mm year 1 there is no significant precipitation trend observed during the last 18 years for annual rainfall as well as for rainfall during wet and dry seasons the two last hydrological years 2017 2018 have rainfall very near the average and can both be considered as representative mean hydrological years in addition the 2017 and 2018 rainfall amount measured during the rainy season is near the average rainfall amount of the rainy season 2 3 hydrogeology in continental context the structure of volcanic aquifers is mainly governed by the opposition between an impermeable substratum often non volcanic and overlying volcanic formations generally permeable see for instance bourlier et al 2005 or rouquet et al 2012 in insular volcanic context two main manifestations of a single conceptual hydrogeological model are described in the literature at the volcanic edifice scale or even at the whole island scale 1 a low lying basal aquifer linked to inland dike impounded and perched aquifers such as in the island of oahu in hawaii nichols et al 1996 peterson 1972 2 a continuous basal aquifer extending far inland and at rather high elevation which is well detailed in the canary islands custodio 2007 these hydrogeological models were developed for basaltic volcanism hot spots transform faults etc geodynamical context and are still improved by the hydrogeological community especially regarding the key role of the volcanic core with dike network acting as barriers or as water conducting features through the fissures associated herrera and custodio 2008 recent studies show a more complex reality and the need for higher resolution hydrogeological studies even in basaltic context join et al 2005 lachassagne et al 2014 moreover andesitic type volcanism exhibits different hydrogeological patterns than the basaltic one and still need to be better characterized charlier et al 2011 hemmings et al 2015b in such andesitic context the volcanic formations have often more various lithologies than in basaltic context with lavas but also pyroclastic formations and volcano detritic series such as lahars and debris flows for instance the hydrogeological role of the extensive ignimbrite deposits frequently found in andesitic context is still poorly understood and may enable the presence of more than a single groundwater system the andesitic volcanic formations are also often older with several volcanic and erosion phases and the associated weathering processes and paleosurfaces it generates multiple superimposed or juxtaposed hydrogeological units with various hydrogeological relationships furthermore the high relief of volcanoes favours erosion and the associated presence of deep canyons may also laterally limit the extension of the hydrogeological units in the merapi volcano indonesia a dominant pyroclastic and volcano detritic volcano groundwater flow pathways are described to be related to the volcanic infilling of ancient paleovalley systems locally comprising lava flows which act as a preferential underground drainage networks selles et al 2015 the volcanic context of the tengger strato volcano is rather different as lava flows mainly basic andesite extensively present on most of the northern slope gradually disappear to the upper reach of the north plain where the volcano sedimentary series appear only a few gravity springs with discharge of a few l s 1 are known on the flank of the volcano in contrast important artesian springs outflow from the upper part of the volcano sedimentary series of the northern plain such as umbulan q 3500 l s 1 and banyu biru q 300 l s 1 springs which are used for irrigation and drinking water supply in the pasuruan plain fig 1 a an artesian spring or well is defined as a groundwater outflow which occurs through some fissure or other opening features lithological heterogeneity fault intrusive bodies or drilling for a well in the confining bed that overlies the confined aquifer definititon modified from unesco 2012 the plain is also characterized by hundreds of artesian wells drilled in the volcano sedimentary formation near or downstream the springs for agricultural or domestic uses their depth varies between 30 and 120 m and their discharge often reaches several l s 1 the geometry and lateral extent of the confining units responsible of artesianism are not known but some authors present the pasuruan plain as an extensive and productive aquifer system of moderate transmissivity and with piezometric head near or above the land surface soekardi puspowardoyo 1985 there is no information about hydrothermal activity on the northern flank of the bromo tengger in addition the water temperature measured in artesian wells of the volcano sedimentary plain is about 23 c which indicates a negative thermal anomaly in comparison with the local mean annual air temperature of about 30 c then the low temperature of the groundwater suggests a recharge at high elevation the hydrogeological functioning of the 40 km2 endorheic basin at the summit of the volcano tengger sea sand caldera is also unknown 3 methodology the comprehension of the structure and hydrogeological functioning of complex systems requires a multidisciplinary approach in fact each method provides some clues of the hydrosystem which can only be considered as reliable insights when they converge complementary methods were then applied geological study implementation of a hydro climatologic monitoring network hydrochemistry and isotopes analyses results of these investigations and analyses described here below allow delineating the recharge area and conceptualizing the aquifer structure and its functioning 3 1 geological study a multi scale geological field work has been conducted to gather complementary data first the main geomorphological structures of the bromo tengger massif were characterized using arcgis and google earth tools an hill shade map of the srtm30 m at a resolution of one arc second farr et al 2007 was elaborated and compared to the different existing geological maps mulyadi 1992 santosa et al 1992 zaennudin et al 1994 second a 5 months geological fieldwork was performed to both observe lithological features in areas where information was missing and verify geological descriptions and limits of the existing maps on the northern flank of the volcano this work was mainly carried out in canyons where most of the outcrops are located stratigraphic logs and geological data were collected from about 250 outcropping sites then analyzed to corroborate and sometimes correct information from the existing geological maps on the volcano sedimentary plain of pasuruan the existing geological description was completed by the geological logging of seven wells 34 to 103 m deep on the basis of the cuttings and cores collected during drilling appendix fig a1 3 2 monitoring network for recharge assessment 3 2 1 hydro climatological monitoring the rainfall and temperature pattern of the bromo volcano were characterized using 4 new meteorological stations cimel rtu station installed along a north south transect at different elevations kronto 535 m a s l wonorejo 1158 m a s l temple 2154 m a s l and seruni 2681 m a s l fig 3 hourly temperature and rainfall measurements were recorded over one year from 1 04 2017 to 31 03 2018 this period is part of 2017 and 2018 hydrological years considered as mean hydrological years see section 2 2 rainfall was collected for isotope analysis and cumulated rainfall assessment in a 200 l water tank initially filled with 1 l of motor oil to avoid evaporation the final volume of water in this tank was measured at the end of the monitoring period to check the good calibration of the cimel rain gauges in addition the aqua factory meteo station located in the pasuruan plain aqua 17 m a s l that records daily rainfall was also used a 5 8 km² representative surface watershed was monitored to estimate the water budget of the study area this watershed ranges from 435 m a s l at the kronto river gauging station to 2615 m a s l stream water level was measured with a 0 5 cmh2o precision pressure probe during the hydrological year stemming from 01 11 2017 to 31 10 2018 a rating curve was built using 5 manual discharge gaugings ranging between 2 5 and 60 l s 1 and completed by the discharge estimated during a peak flood about 1500 l s 1 from a velocity estimate performed with a floating object a bottle and the known section of the stream water points on the volcano flank and in the plain springs wells dugwells were inventoried and stored in a database discharge measurements of the main artesian springs and the artesian wells were also realized 3 2 2 analysis of climatic and hydrological data the monitoring results were used to characterize the spatial rainfall and temperature distributions along the northern flank of the volcano based on the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 the aquifer recharge was computed as follows 1 re r ret

rainfall r ret mm the potential and the real evapotranspiration pet and ret were calculated for each meteorological stations at a monthly time step considering a 100 mm maximum soil moisture storage

2017 to 31 03 2018 monitoring period the runoff was estimated from the kronto watershed hydrological data 01 11 2017 to 31 10 2018 to compute average rainfall over this watershed the weighted surface coefficient from thiessen polygon is applied on the surface watershed with the data from the kronto wonorejo and seruni meteo stations with respectively 20 62 and 18 the total recharge of the aquifer was inferred from its outflows from the main artesian springs and artesian wells and from leakage estimated vertical groundwater flow through the plain aquitard 3 3 hydrochemical and isotopic measurements during 4 sampling campaigns including dry and wet season may june 2016 november 2016 may june 2017 and march june 2018 with sampling elevation ranging from 13 to 2700 masl were collected i 31 groundwater samples artesian wells artesian and gravity springs ii 1 surface water sample from a lake maar iii 4 rainwater samples from meteorological stations details of the sampling points are given in table 1 and plotted in fig 3 on the northern flank of the bromo tengger the 17 groundwater samples were mainly collected from gravity springs such as inter lava flows springs in the volcano sedimentary plain the 14 water samples were collected from artesian springs and artesian wells for each groundwater sample physico chemical measurements electrical conductivity ec ph temperature dissolved oxygen were recorded in the field using a multiparameter probe hach hq40d and completed by spring well discharge measurements anion and alkalinity were collected in hdep bottles of 10 ml and 50 ml respectively and stored without air bubbles water isotopes were collected in 10 ml amber glass bottles also avoiding entrapped air bubbles samples for cation and traces analysis were collected in acid washed 20 ml vials and the samples were preserved by acidifying to ph 2 with concentrated trace grade hno3 each vial was previously rinsed 3 times with the water being sampled anion cation and trace elements were filtrated using a 022 μm millipore filter samples were kept refrigerated prior to analyses alkalinity was determined in the field by titration with hcl 0 1 m using a manual titrator hach the other analyses were performed in hydrosciences laboratory university of montpellier anions were analyzed by ionic chromatography using a ic1000 dionex cations and traces were analysed with an icp ms icap q thermo fisher the analytical error for major elements is below 5 and below 0 1 for traces elements stable isotopes δ 18o δd were analysed at lama laboratory using an isoprime mass spectrometer with an accuracy of 0 08 for δ 18o and of 0 8 for δd the isotopic data are reported in the conventional delta notation as a deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow comparison of the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and rain water at different altitudes is defined as an efficient and approved scientific tools for evaluating recharge area from complex hydrogeological systems gat 1996 jones et al 2000 this method has been successfully performed for many volcanic islands heilweil et al 2009 hildenbrand et al 2005 prada et al 2016 however the monthly rainfall sampling required for establishing altitudinal isotopic gradient gonfiantini et al 2001 is challenging to perform in volcanic regions with difficult access due to dense vegetation and high slope and has some drawbacks as no local isotopic monitoring exists on the study area we first determined an altitudinal gradient of water isotopes using small local springs q 1 l s 1 called integrative springs located along the northern flank of the volcano these integrative springs are characterised by small watershed 0 5 km² and short flowpaths between recharge and discharge locations the geomorphology confirmed the limited extension of their watershed such as seruni n 17 table 2 located in a small thalweg at less than 100 m from the volcano summit or little spring of tosari n 14 table 2 located under a high cliff and no relationship with stream water infiltrated upstream in addition these springs show significantly stable physicochemical parameters and water isotopes suggesting a local aquifer nevertheless sufficiently developed to smooth rain events and seasonal variations local anthropogenic impacts or volcanic activity dry deposits influence some of these springs in accordance with the land use of their inferred recharge area also confirming a local recharge this methodology has been successfully applied on volcanic context such as in guatemala mulligan et al 2011 the isotopic value of the integrative springs was used to calculate a local meteoric water line referred as the bromo spring water line bswl the stable isotopes of rain water were also sampled at the end of march 2018 after one full year of cumulated rainfall storage at each meteorological station fig 3 and section 3 2 1 these samples allowed to establish a local meteoric water line bmwl bromo meteoric water line calculated as a first approximation with the pwlsr precipitation weighted method hughes and crawford 2012 due to uncomplete rainfall collection at aqua station we estimated water isotope values in the plain using the gnip station of jakarta iaea 1961 determined for the same coast and elevation than aqua station iaea 1962 1998 8 m a s l δd 7 47 δ18o 7 99 the bmwl is then compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 and validated by the local meteoric water line lmwl based on gnip of jakarta 3 4 quantitative estimation of stable isotopes signature for recharge area delineation to delineate the recharge area of the aquifer we assume that the isotopic signature of the main spring umbulan is representative of the isotopic signature of the basal volcano sedimentary aquifer which is confirmed by isotopic sampling in the plain the methodology developed in this paper combines the use of a the stable isotopes data outflow at the main spring on the one hand and local meteoric water line built from the integrative springs bswl on the other hand b the total groundwater outflow measured from the aquifer see section 3 2 1 and elevation dependent groundwater recharge computation the interest of a 2d quantitative modeling developed in this paper as compared with a simple 1d approach allows 1 to take into account the conical shape of the volcano and 2 to accordingly compute a recharge function leading to the water budget that depends not only on the elevation but also on the shape of the volcano which is a key point to constrain the results these geometrical characteristics shape and recharge function more precisely effective rainfall f elevation and shape of the volcano are considered as fixed entry parameters as well as the isotopic data the infiltration rate on the contributing slices is also considered as a fixed parameter based on hydrological measurements then the only adjusted parameters are the contributing slices which elevation for the recharge area and the surface area of the whole recharge area geological and hydrogeological arguments are used to validate and ensure the reliability of the results of course such a methodology provides theoretically a non unique solution however constraining a maximum of parameters from other independent methods approaches and using other information such as geology and hydrogeology helps identify the most probable one s the methodology comprises 5 steps fig 4 steps 1 3 correspond to the preparation of the data base then of the model steps 4 and 5 to its calibration to delineate the aquifer recharge area computations were performed with msexcel step 1 discretisation of the maximum lateral and vertical extension of the potential recharge area of the aquifer dividing all the northern flank of the volcano into 100 m range of elevation slices the number of slices n is defined as 2 n i s l i c e i where i 0 to n and each slice mean elevation is mh i i using morphological information to laterally west east limit the extension of the recharge area this step enables to compute a first distribution of surface area for each slice that may be refined later during the modeling process the potential recharge surface area stotal is computed as follows 3 s t o t a l i s i where s i the surface of slice i km² enabling aquifer recharge step2 recharge was computed for each slice along the same range of elevation by interpolating the results r ret from water budget section 3 2 2 obtained at the 5 meteorological stations of the northern flank of the volcano and infiltration rate the recharge of each slice r e i is given by 4 r e i e r i c i n f s i from which the total estimated inflow to the aquifer is inferred 5 q t o t a l i r e i where er the effective rainfall of the slice i mm y 1 cinf the coefficient of infiltration of the effective rainfall initially fixed at 100 for each slice step 3 the δ 18o recharge signal for each slice was derived from the bswl and used as an input in the model the δ 18o recharge signal for each slice δ 18 o r e c i is given by 6 δ 18 o r e c i δ 18 o

by 7 δ 18 o c o n t i r e i δ 18 o r e c i q t o t a l step 4 first calibration phase of the model here the objective is to define the elevation slices where recharge can occur with the objective to obtain the δ18o composition measured at the spring aquifer calibration is performed first from the altitudinal distribution of re imposed from step 2 and 3 the computed δ18o composition of the aquifer δ 18 o t o t a l is calculated from 8 δ 18 o t o t a l i δ 18 o c o n t i based on geological or hydrogeological information ex low permeability layers runoff etc the coefficient of infiltration c inf applied on each slice see eq 4 can be adjusted to fit with the observed δ18o composition of the aquifer spring a step 5 second phase of the model calibration calibration of the width of the total recharge area and then of the total surface of the recharge area the west east width of the recharge area is adjusted to fit with the total outflow measured from the aquifer b the calibration process can be iterative particularly between steps 4 and 5 finally sensitivity analyses are performed to estimate the accuracy of the calibration the outputs of this process are mainly the altitudinal and lateral delineation of the recharge area and the spatial distribution of the recharge within this area 4 results and interpretations 4 1 geological synthesis and hydrogeological implications the existing geological maps mulyadi 1992 santosa et al 1992 zaennudin et al 1994 have been compiled and completed with field observations fig 5 a the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcanic edifice appear to be mostly composed of a thick series of calc alkaline lava flows mostly andesitic and unweathered these formations outcrop in the medial zone from 60 to 1500 m a s l and are referenced as olf bri klf nkj on fig 5 a some lava flows series are more than 50 m thick cooked paleosoils locally covered by autobreccia of limited thickness 2 3 m max are interstratified within the lava flows series the upstream part of the volcano current proximal zone ranging from 1500 to 2700 m a s l is covered by pyroclastic materials wjph njp mainly constituted from fall deposits ash lapilli sometimes crisscrossed by lava flows these fall deposits are unconsolidated and are deeply incised by canyons from the hydrographic network a few slope deposits are identified at the outlet of some large valleys madakaripura and sapiekerep they are composed of lahars pyroclastic flows and ignimbrites mulyadi 1992 spread towards the north suig nm in term of geomorphology the volcanic edifice is scarred by 4 main super structures the sand sea caldera ss of the bromo tengger summit with the tengger caldera wall unit tdk the deep sapikerep valley nap located east of the volcano related to the bromo tengger caldera collapse the madakaripura valley sm nm due to the ngadisari caldera collapse the old caldera of nongkojajar nkj bordering the west side of the volcanic edifice our observations enable to complete the geological map as follows with the black dotted line units on fig 5 a the pyroclastic deposits ejected by the ranu grati maar explosions rg encircle this 120 m deep volcanic lake the north hill of pasuruan hng is composed of pyroclastic deposits lahars and possibly ignimbrites this relief may be the distal part of the sapikerep fan deposit suig more than 100 m thick lahars deposits were mainly identified in the downstream part of the madakaripura valley sm and nm adventive cones cinder cones ac seem to correspond to the last lava outflows gunung tinggi and pandak south east of umbulan spring the western limit of the old lava flows olf has been extended and is now in contact with the nongkojajar unit nkj a sw ne inferred fault may explain the artesian springs alignment umbulan banyu biru telogo kali sukun respectively n 4 2 1 3 on fig 3 with the ranu grati lake in the distal zone of the volcano pasuruan plain 7 drillings red dots on fig 5 b appendix fig a 1 enabled the identification of a superficial first unit ranging from 0 to 30 m deep mainly composed of weathered volcanic tuffs mixed with fluvial deposits characterized by their clayey and cinder matrix several cores at about 30 m deep were collected and show consolidated and clayey pyroclastic materials probably from lahars or ignimbrites deposits the lateral variation of these materials is difficult to precise but the thickness of each unit is about 10 m the clayey formations described in this first unit surely confine the underlying main aquifer the second unit top deeper than 30 40 m deep is composed of reworked volcanoclastics ash and lapilli materials with ripples marks intersected by paleochannels filled with alluvial laharic and polygenic conglomerates mostly consolidated this deep unit is probably contemporaneous and interstratified at its southern limit with the lava flows but as these formations are difficult to drill with the local engines there is no drilling data in the transition zone the volcano sedimentary series thickness is still unknown but some deep artesian wells may be more than 200 m deep from farmers oral testimonies no artesian deep wells have been inventoried in the northern part of the plain in the surroundings of the pasuruan city the distal zone of the stratovolcano is surely characterized by fine deltaic sediments such as silts and clays carried along the hydrographic network selles et al 2015 this surely explains the northern ending up of the aquifer 4 1 1 hydrogeological implications from this complex geological structure we propose a simplified hydrogeological structure composed by 5 main hydrogeological units from the volcano summit to the north coast the central zone constituted by the sand sea caldera ss is filled mostly by dark sand with a high porosity this large endorheic zone with no permanent steam network probably hosts an unconfined aquifer of unknown thickness which outlets and relationships with other aquifers are unknown in the proximal zone of the edifice the thickness of the pyroclastic complex is difficult to estimate however the inner caldera rim outcrops tdk indicate that it could be several hundred meters thick it may overlay the lava flows complex described just below a few low discharge springs were identified in this formation at the favour of layers of lower permeability e g seruni spring table 1 this formation apparently exhibits a high interstices porosity and permeability the medial zone is occupied by the mostly unweathered lava flow complex lfc with chronologically nkj olf klf bri it constitutes a huge geological unit springs and rivers discharge observations show that at the exception of the olf lava flow unit which exhibits a weathering profile the lfc can be considered as homogeneous as a whole this is demonstrated by the fact that only a few low discharge a few l s 1 inter lava flows springs have been identified indicating few perched and local aquifers most of these inter lava springs flow out from clinker layers in contact with cooked paleosoils red layers acting as local impermeable layers hydrogeological surveys along the streams during the dry season show their low specific discharge as compared to the efficient rainfall and no measurable discharge increase along the stream was observed it suggests that beyond these small springs streams do not drain significant aquifers nor loss significant amount of water this later process being surely due to stream siltation in addition few adventives cones ac have been observed on the medial zone and may provide a laterally continuous low permeability and high density materials according to kereszturi and nmeth 2012 in the distal zone of the volcano the slope deposits nm suig hng most probably have a low permeability because of their clayey content in the volcano sedimentary plain distal zone the main hydrogeological feature is the confined aquifer which provides groundwater to the artesian springs and wells according to the geological logs realized during the drilling survey the confined aquifer is multi layered it is confined by a more than 10 m thick confining unit 460 artesian wells were inventoried in the plain with an average discharge of 4 1 l s 1 considering the density of well on the field 6 well km 2 we assume that 20 of the wells have not been inventoried a maximum of about 600 wells is then estimated corresponding to 2400 l s 1 flowing out in the plain all the artesian springs show a total discharge of about 4000 l s 1 table 1 assuming a mean hydraulic head difference of about 5 m between the multi layered confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer and a confining unit of about 10 m thickness with an hydraulic conductivity of 10 8 m s 1 breuer et al 2000 charlier et al 2011 this gives a mean leakage of about 5 l s 1 km2 for the whole volcano sedimentary plain where artesianism is known about 150 km2 it results in a discharge of about 750 l s 1 due to natural leakage through the upper confining unit the first estimation of the total outflow from the whole aquifer system would thus be about 7000 l s 1 4 2 hydro climatological monitoring of the northern flank of the bromo tengger the new meteorological data are in agreement with the duration of the dry and wet seasons in this area from may to october and from november to april respectively fig 6 b the minimum of the dry season occurred on august with only 3 mm of rainfall at the temple station and no rainfall at all at the other stations the wet season peak occurred in february 2018 with a maximum rainfall value of 668 mm at kronto during both seasons the kronto and wonorejo stations show higher rainfall than aqua on one hand but also than seruni and temple that are however at a higher elevation on the basis of all data 9 to 21 of annual rainfall occurs during the dry season while 79 to 91 of rainfall is recorded during the wet season an important altitudinal gradient of rainfall is observed on the volcano s flank from aqua station 20 m a s l in the plain to wonorejo station 1100 m a s l with annual rainfall of 1878 mm and 3891 mm respectively fig 6 c upstream rainfall decreases from wonorejo to seruni 2700 m a s l and to temple 2100 m a s l with annual rainfall of 1781 and 1552 mm respectively studies about altitudinal gradient of precipitation on high tropical or equatorial mountains also show a decrease of rainfall beyond a certain elevation such as in hawaii scholl et al 1996 2002 or in the martinique french west indies island vittecoq et al 2010 the air mass reaching the volcano s summit are cooler however they are impoverished in vapor based on these studies and our data the most realistic precipitation pattern was drawn with a peak at an elevation of about 1200 m a s l fig 7 b an altitudinal gradient of temperature of about 0 6 c 100 m was assessed with a mean annual temperature of about 30 c in the plain to 11 8 c in the caldera which is consistent with the known temperature gradient on volcanoes in such tropical environment selles 2014 no significant gradient is observed for the relative humidity ranging from 75 in the plain to 83 3 in wonorejo station however cloud and fog accumulation are frequently observed below seruni 2700 m a s l indicating a condensation layer below this elevation the interception of wind blown droplets of water by the vegetation commonly called cloud water interception cwi or fog drip is likely to increase rainfall height in the santa cruz island of the galapagos ecuador the fog drip is negligible at 400 m a s l but represents more than 20 of incident rainfall at about 650 m a s l and directly contributes to groundwater recharge pryet et al 2012a b this parameter can thus be a significative part of the recharge as also identified on la gomera canary island where it represents more than 700 mm y 1 according to the fog drip calculation models izquierdo 2014 on the bromo tengger except some field observations there is no measurement allowing to quantify fog drip as a summary these first results indicate a precipitation pattern controlled by orographic effects occurring on the northern flank of the volcano under the influence of the dominant nw se winds the rainfall thus increases to a maximum value at about 1200 m a s l elevation and decreases beyond 4 2 1 results of the climatic and hydrological analyses the computation of the water budget at each meteorological station allows to plot the rainfall ret and er as function of the elevation fig 7 a b c from april 2017 to march 2018 the recharge rate was also estimated on the representative kronto watershed fig 7 a all results are compiled in the table from fig 7 c pet ret similarly to the temperature the potential evapotranspiration pet and the real evapotranspiration ret continually decrease from the plain to the volcano summit with for example a ret of about 1460 mm in the pasuruan plain and about 620 mm at seruni these ret results are consistent with the gleam satellite data martens et al 2017 with a difference of less than 6 fig 1 1153 mm y 1 for the mean gleam interannual ret from november 1980 to october 2017 and 1223 mm computed on our site for april 2017 to march 2018 the effective rainfall er is very concomitant with the rainfall r variation because of the ret absolute value much lower than r at the exception of the lower part of the volcano and the ret distribution along the flank of the volcano nevertheless the impact of ret is maximum at low elevation where er is finally rather low about 600 mm at an elevation of 50 m a s l then er increases steeply to reach a maximum of 3100 mm also at about 1200 m a s l at higher elevation er steeply decreases with 1300 mm only on the top of the volcano s flank and 900 mm in the inner caldera re during the period nov 17 to oct 18 the discharge of the kronto representative watershed is only about 7 of the rainfall 9 5 of the effective rainfall these data suggest that aquifer recharge is about 66 of the rainfall and about 90 5 of the effective rainfall fig 7 c this result is consistent with the geological observations cf section 4 1 that did not identify impermeable rocks on this experimental watershed nor on the whole flank of the bromo volcano similar results were found in tropical and andesitic pyroclastics context in guadeloupe french west indies where the aquifer recharge was estimated at about 85 of the annual effective rainfall charlier et al 2011 this recharge rate is an average infiltration rate on the whole representative watershed 450 2600 m a s l as the hydrological and hydrogeological field observations did not enable to identify any preferential recharge area 4 3 hydrochemistry field parameters and laboratory analyses including major ions and stable isotopes δ18o δd of groundwater samples from gravity springs artesian springs and artesian wells are reported on tables 1 and 2 and their location is plotted on fig 3 electrical conductivity ec of groundwater ranges from 109 to 671 μs cm 1 in the plain artesian wells and springs show relatively homogeneous conductivity values ranging from 202 to 353 μs cm 1 and 203 to 381 μs cm 1 respectively gravity springs located on the flank of the volcano show a large range of conductivity from 109 to 671 μs cm 1 and the highest values but no correlation was found between the conductivity and the location of the spring as high conductivity is mostly linked to anthropogenic impacts on each small watershed in contrast an increase of conductivity towards the north was found for artesian springs and wells located in the plain due to water rock interactions the mean temperature of the water samples is 22 6 c 3 6 c groundwater temperature is well correlated with the elevation of the spring the water temperature increases as the elevation decreases with a minimal temperature of 12 5 c at 2700 m a s l seruni spring n 17 and a maximal temperature of 26 2 c in the plain for the deep artesian well 20 150 m deep the main spring of the system umbulan has an intermediate temperature of 23 5 c temperatures of the artesian wells and springs in the plain are not at the equilibrium with the mean local air temperature about 30 c indicating a recharge at a higher elevation for all groundwater samples dominant cations are ca and mg fig 8 a table 2 in good agreement with the andesitic bedrock composition three dominant anions hco3 so4 2 cl were found depending on the groundwater samples based on the dominant anions and the relative ca vs mg concentration of water three groups of groundwater were identified they are also related to various elevations fig 8 a in the plain water samples of artesian springs and wells are dominated by camg hco3 water type fig 8 a on the flank of the volcano gravity springs located higher than 1000 m a s l volcanic anthropogenic group fig 8 a belong to camg cl or camg so4 water type the high values of cl and no3 occur in the vicinity of villages or crop fields and indicate anthropic contaminations e g banyu ngisor n 15 table 2 the highest so4 2 contents were found in springs close to the top of the volcano at elevation ranging between 1700 and 2700 m a s l where volcanic sulphur deposits occur they indicate the influence of the volcanic activity e g widodaren n 16 a last group show an intermediate composition between the volcanic anthropogenic type and the main basal aquifer type groundwater samples from intermediate and artesian plain groups show a continuous geochemical evolution through an increase of ca mg towards the north fig 8 b with the distance from the volcano the conductivity increase and mg2 enrichment in the volcano sedimentary plain may result from an increase of residence time triggered by an intensive water rock interaction with clayey formations paternoster et al 2010 the weathering of the volcano sedimentary formations allows the dissolution of mg rich minerals like olivine mg fe 2sio4 and pyroxene x y sio3 2 this dissolution together with the north south groundwater flow direction explains the mg trend observed on artesian wells towards the north fig 8 b this relatively linear mg enrichment for these 2 groups is well correlated with the electric conductivity and water temperature increases this spatial evolution of water chemistry suggests that gravity springs at low elevation and artesian wells springs belong to the same lithological and hydrogeological system with groundwater aging as it flows towards the north gravity springs result from perched aquifers direct recharge leaking water from these perched aquifers and surface water directly infiltrating to the main basal aquifer supply the multi layered aquifer feeding the artesian springs and wells as a consequence common recharge processes can be considered for the artesian springs wells and gravity springs of low elevation the gravity springs above 1700 m a s l do not exactly show the same evolution as they are also influenced by different processes and notably deposits issuing from the active volcanic vents regarding the ca2 increase observed on these springs it may correspond to water rock interaction at the surface of clay minerals within the pyroclastic complex no anthropogenic and volcanic chemical components are significantly observed in the plain system this suggest a limited contribution from the highest part of the volcano to the recharge of the main basal aquifer so4 and confirm the limited extension of agricultural activities compared to the total recharge area of the aquifer dilution effect two wells n 7 and 22 follow the same ca mg ratio trend they are located between umbulan and banyu biru springs and aligned on the supposed sw ne fault fig 5 which could explain a shorter transit time led by this fault the ranu grati maar could be a natural outflow from the same type of aquifer s at least as regards lithology but with longer water rock interactions 4 4 isotopic composition of groundwater and rainfall water isotopes signatures of groundwater surface water and precipitation are reported in the table 2 and plotted in fig 9 a the four rain gauges from 545 to 2681 m a s l have sampled one full year of annual cumulated rainfall april 1st 2017 march 2018 they show a large range of variation from 7 5 to 11 8 for δ18o and from 45 8 to 78 6 for δd the observed δ18o altitude gradient for rainfall is consistent with to a rayleigh adiabatic condensation process the isotopic signature of groundwater samples fig 9 b shows a similar range of variation 6 6 to 10 8 for δ18o and from 37 to 68 8 for δd for an elevation of sampling locations ranging from about 20 to 2700 m a s l in the main artesian system of the plain springs and wells the range of variation is narrower with variations ranging from 6 91 to 7 46 for δ18o and from 39 70 to 44 75 for δd strongly suggesting a common recharge area the surface water sample ranu grati lake n 23 shows the lowest δ18o value and the highest δd 4 9 and 33 7 respectively most of the groundwater samples align above the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl calculated from the gnip station of jakarta iaea 1961 these results show that rainwater composition undergoes the local topographic effects of the volcano the sample from surface water ranu grati lake falls below the lmwl fig 9 b this position indicates an evaporation process in good agreement with the stagnation of the lake water and the high temperature in the plain about 30 c to take into account the local topographic effect on rainwater the bromo meteoric water line was calculated bmwl fig 9 b from the four rain gauges of the area and the gnip station of jakarta with weighted mean respectively 5 63 and 36 10 for δ18o and δd the bmwl equation is 9 δd 7 23 δ18o 7 53 in addition four integrative springs n 11 14 15 and 17 black crosses fig 9 selected for their short groundwater flow paths and no relationships with nearby stream water were used as proxies for precipitation to calculate the bromo spring water line bswl given by the equation 10 δd 7 71 δ18o 12 37 the elevation effect is clearly visible for the northern flank of the bromo tengger fig 9 c with a δ18o and δd decrease as elevation increases the widodaren spring n 16 located at 2200 m a s l in the inner caldera does not follow this trend its δ18o signature is similar to the one of the springs from the northern flank of the bromo tengger located at about 1800 m a s l elevation the difference may be explained by the impact of the local volcanic steam from the active vent of mt bromo that probably emits an enriched δ18o there is a good correlation between the isotopic composition of the 4 elevations classes of groundwater samples fig 9 and the precipitation defined by a gradient of 0 19 δ18o 100 m from the bswl and by a gradient 0 23 δ18o 100 m from bmwl these gradient values are of the same order of magnitude than those found for other volcanoes in indonesia such as merapi 0 29 δ18o 100 m selles 2014 or the vulture volcano in italy 0 17 δ18o 100 m parisi et al 2011 nevertheless a shift is observed between bmwl and bswl this shift cannot be solely explained by the isotopic inter annual variation 1962 to 1998 data from the gnip station of jakarta show only a seasonal difference of 0 58 δ18o but the fog drip observed from about 2000 m a s l on the bromo tengger section 4 2 may represent a water input to the aquifer which has to be taken into account and may explain this shift according to scholl et al 2002 fog samples have isotopic signatures enriched by as much as 3 in δ18o and 21 in δd compared to volume weighted average precipitation at the same elevation our field observations comfort this hypothesis as the highest part of the volcano is covered by cloud layers and fog drip from the trees was observed near seruni rain gauge and spring this enrichment cannot be observed on the rain isotopic results because rain gauges are located on a clear and open area to avoid fog drip or other quantitative artefact from vegetation but they are registered by the springs as elevation decreases the fog drip effect decreases reducing the shift between the two lines bmwl and bswl as a consequence the bswl is more representative of the recharge of the aquifer the δ18o altitudinal gradient from integrative springs was thus used to infer recharge elevation for the artesian springs and wells fig 9 c the apparent mean recharge elevation of the all artesian springs and wells is from about 700 to 1300 m a s l 150 m if one considers analytical uncertainty fig 9c the artesian springs and wells 100 m a s l seem to have the same isotopic signature than the gravity springs below 1300 m a s l green square and orange triangle fig 9 careful hydrogeological interpretation shows that orange triangle springs have a small sized recharge area and can also be considered as integrative springs whereas green square springs have a large recharge area and are probably influenced by stream infiltration or connected perched aquifers stream infiltration is the most relevant explanation as recharge elevation inferred from these springs isotopic signature is consistent with the elevation range of streams surface watersheds near the springs these data cannot be used to draw the bswl the highest springs on the northern flank with the lowest isotopic values suggest that they are i disconnected from the downstream groundwater and the artesian plain or ii represented a low contribution to the recharge of the main basal aquifer 4 5 quantitative modeling of groundwater isotopic signature step i discretisation of the potential recharge area refer to fig 4 for methodology the whole northern flank of the bromo tengger was discretized into 29 slices of 100 m elevation interval fig 10 the median elevation of each slice is ranging from 50 m a s l 1st slice to 2750 m a s l 28th slice a 29th slice considers the half surface of the tengger caldera with an elevation of 2150 m a s l the total surface considered potential recharge area is 540 8 km² the first slice was considered without any potential recharge due to the cover of the low permeability volcano sedimentary confining unit and the upwards piezometric gradient it was thus not taken into account this slice constitutes the northern limit of the potential recharge area the western and eastern limits of the potential recharge area are delineated on the basis of geomorphological arguments nongkojajar caldera rim to the west and sapikerep valley to the east while the southern limit is bounded by the volcano s summit and the half of the tengger caldera the lowest slices exhibit the largest surface areas 44 7 km2 for the lowest slice surface areas progressively decrease when elevation increases at the exception of the 29th slice which is larger since it comprises the half of the tengger caldera 20 km² steps 2 and 3 potential recharge computation fig 11 reports the results from the water budget and recharge computation presented at section 4 2 1 fig 7 b ordinate axis as a function of the elevation of each considered slice abscissa axis as well as the δ18o recharge line bswl selected at section 4 4 at this step of the process recharge is still a potential recharge as it does not account for the isotopic composition of the water from the aquifer here the umbulan spring nor for the total outflow outflow recharge from the volcanic aquifer see steps 4 and 5 steps 4 and 5 recharge area calibration the main outputs from step 3 with recharge 90 5 of effective rainfall except for the slice of the sea of sand caldera where 100 of effective rainfall is considered to infiltrate i e c inf 905 as runoff 9 5 see section 4 2 1 are the following δ18o signature of the whole recharge δ18ototal 7 25 to be compared with the average umbulan spring signature 7 25 standard deviation 0 07 section 4 4 which is used to perform the recharge computations total estimated outflow recharge qtotal 31 000 l s 1 to be compared with the total outflow measured in the plain of 7 000 l s 1 section 4 2 1 at this stage without any calibration the computed isotopic composition 7 25 is already perfectly fitting to the one of the umbulan spring 7 25 this result comforts the hypothesis that the recharge occurs along most of the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcano the computed outflow is much higher than the observed one the surface of the recharge area thus must be significantly reduced laterally by a factor of about 4 4 then the recharge distribution on each slice is available step 4 and illustrated in fig 12 finally the step 5 calibration was performed to proportionally reduce the surface area of each slice in order to adjust to the measured outflow the proportionality coefficient is 4 43 31 000 7 000 then the total computed recharge area may finally be about 122 km2 these results show that most of the northern flank of the bromo tengger may contribute to the recharge of the artesian aquifer consequently the recharge pattern is strongly influenced i by the recharge vs elevation relationships and ii by the morphology of the northern flank of the volcano smaller surfaces at high elevation than at the lower ones due to the shape of the volcano the limited contribution of the lowest elevation area of the volcano to aquifer recharge is supported by geological evidences the cover of the lower area by low permeability sediments that confine the artesian aquifer below the about 50 m a s l elevation line fig 5 a b and 10 and the observed weathering profile developed at the surface of the olf old lava flows fig 5 a and b moreover in this area rainfall minus real evapotranspiration is at minimum fig 11 this first estimation also shows that the eastern and western morphological limits chosen at step 1 are far away from the real limits of the recharge area as a consequence of this recharge pattern about 80 of the recharge occurs within an elevation range of 150 and 1450 m a s l around the r er and re peak fig 12 this result is consistent with the hydrochemistry and isotopic results suggesting a limited contribution of the highest part of the volcano the irregular shape of the recharge values between 750 and 1050 m a s l is strictly related to the corresponding slices surface area which are locally less or larger in the western part of the potential recharge area see step 1 these variations have then no real physical signification and an average 7 8 recharge contribution must be considered the computed average recharge elevation computed with the bswl isotopic line is 1038 m a s l however this value is purely indicative as was demonstrated by the current computations sensitivity analysis as said above the quantitative modeling is mainly controlled by the recharge pattern and the recharge surface area distribution along the volcano s flank the sensitivity analysis table 3 shows that not considering the contribution of the caldera has a significant impact on the aquifer s computed isotopic signature 7 19 vs 7 25 all other parameters being the same as described above but no significant impact on the aquifer s water budget 6870 l s 1 vs 7000 l s 1 it then requires to modify the calibration through reducing the recharge at lower elevation no recharge in the 0 200 m a s l slices 76 recharge rather than 90 5 in the 200 300 m a s l slice conversely if the whole caldera surface 40 km² is considered it requires enabling aquifer recharge to occur much lower than the 100 m threshold even below sea level which is impossible this sensitivity analysis shows that this approach is not precise enough to really demonstrate that the caldera is contributing to the aquifer recharge but the probability is high on the other hand the contribution of the whole caldera is rather inconceivable according to isotopic data a rainfall variation on all slices for instance of 15 has a significant impact on the results as efficient rainfall and then recharge does not evolve linearly with rainfall a 15 decrease of rainfall logically yields a decrease of the aquifer recharge 7000 to 5420 l s 1 it triggers also a shift of the computed isotopic signature from 7 25 to 7 28 as the recharge is smaller mainly at the lowest elevations which also correspond to the largest potential recharge area for the aquifer recalibration of the model requires only to decrease the contribution of the half caldera with a recharge of 52 of effective rainfall conversely increasing rainfall by 15 only requires to reduce the recharge in the lowest 100 200 m a s l slice of the model to 60 of effective rainfall against 90 5 again similarly to the previous sensitivity test this result shows the limits of this approach which precision is not enough to precisely determine the upper and lower limits of the recharge area logically a similar change in the recharge rate along all the volcano s flank has no impact on the isotopic signature of the recharging water but only on the required recharge surface area the calibration carried out and the sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the recharge surely occurs along most of the volcano s flank furthermore as there is neither geological nor hydrogeological change along the flank of the volcano the recharge pattern is mainly controlled by the effective rainfall distribution and the morphology of the volcano surface area distribution vs elevation 5 discussion and implications for the conceptual hydrogeological model 5 1 hydrogeological structure and functioning the hydrogeological structure of the northern flank of the volcano comprises two main geological units i an upstream volcanic geological unit mostly composed of pyroclastic and lava flow series pc and lfc despite the geological complexity of these formations this volcanic unit hydrogeologically appears as homogeneous and permeable at the scale of the whole northern flank of the volcano the pyroclastic formations display an interstice porosity whereas the lavas exhibit both an interstice porosity clinker layers and a cooling fractures porosity these hydrogeological formations host an unconfined aquifer similar to a basal aquifer described in other shield volcanoes such as in hawaii and parts of reunion island where piezometric level is very deep and covered by a thick vadose zone local aquifers perched on ash layers and cooked paleo soil formations feed a few low discharge springs inter and under lava springs naud 1971 on the flank of the volcano isotopic results confirm the small extension of their hydrogeological catchment about 0 5 km2 on average if these local impervious layers are leaking these perched aquifers also partly recharge the basal aquifer this volcanic hydrogeological unit is limited to the south by the tengger caldera summit west and east the geological limits of the studied aquifer where not precisely identified the results of the study shows that they are much less far than the nongkojajar caldera rim and the sapikarep valley ii a downstream volcano sedimentary unit composed of volcanic coarse sand interstratified reworked ashfall lahar tuff bounded to the north by distal clayey deposits the superficial part of the plain is composed of shallow unconfined aquifer described as low permeability volcanic tuff intercalated with permeable fluvial deposits the runoff coming from the rivers flank provides water to the shallow aquifer the confining unit identified around 30 m deep probably explains the presence of artesian aquifer in the plain this aquifer also comprises ash fall deposits and consolidated breccia mostly impermeable which provide it the characteristics of a multilayer confined aquifer system this aquifer is in continuity with the upstream volcanic basal aquifer the hydrochemistry results notably ca mg demonstrate a groundwater flowing and aging towards the north a sw ne fault system could explain the alignment of high discharge artesian springs umbulan and maar the other main outflow from this aquifer is due to human activities in the plain with about 600 artesian wells the transition between the upstream volcanic hydrogeological unit and the downstream volcano sedimentary hydrogeological unit is rather well constrained spatially from field geological observations and also from the southern limit of the artesian wells it is however not well described in terms of geological structure the detailed characterization of this transition zone would require modern drilling techniques which are not available among the local drillers and geophysical measurements however this knowledge is not of prime interest for the understanding of the aquifer s functioning neither for its management 5 2 recharge distribution and hydrogeological balance the recharge occurs on the whole northern flank of the volcano within the andesite lava flows series and the pyroclastic complex lfc and pc however hydrochemical and isotopic results suggest a low contribution of the highest volcano part 1700 m a s l and an apparent mean recharge elevation of about 1000 m a s l the bromo spring water line bswl inferred from integrative springs is a cost effective robust way to characterize the isotopic gradient on the volcano such measurements enable to avoid artefacts such as seasonal rainfall selection blavoux et al 2013 and to account for fog drip observed on the bromo tengger there are still some questions regarding the proportion of recharge input from fog drip that was not explicitly quantitatively computed at this stage of the research complex interception models such as the rutter type rutter et al 1972 could be used to better quantify it or even working on the shift between this bswl and the rainfall line bmwl lower than expected groundwater temperatures in the plain between 23 and 25 c whereas the expected shallow local groundwater temperature should be about 30 c qualitatively confirm that recharge occurs at high elevation based on this quantitative modeling of groundwater isotopic content 80 of the recharge occurs between 150 and 1450 m a s l the recharge is mainly controlled by the rainfall spatial distribution itself strongly impacted by seasonal and elevation effect the rainfall reaches 4000 mm year 1 at 1200 m a s l with 79 91 of which occurring during the wet season the low precipitations recorded on the highest volcano part associated by the δ18o impoverished values excludes the tengger caldera as being the main recharge zone but it is quite sure that it contributes to the recharge an additional hypothesis is to consider the tengger caldera with a north east groundwater flow circulation supplying gravity springs along the sapikerep collapse valley the sapikerep collapse formations may represent a preferential drainage network in agreement with other large landslides of deep erosion in volcanic context as is the case in tenerife island marrero diaz et al 2015 this could be confirmed infirmed by isotopic measurements at these springs in 2018 the outflow measured from the studied hydrogeological system occur within the volcano sedimentary unit and is about 7000 l s 1 the artesian springs constitute a large part of this outflow about 60 the rest is mostly flowing out from the artesian wells a water budget estimation on a representative watershed indicates an effective rainfall infiltration of about 90 5 i e 66 of rainfall based on the previous quantitative insights recharge surface area on the northern volcano flank is estimated to about 120 km² however the lateral extension of the recharge area should be precised to enable the real delineation of the recharge area other tracers than water isotopes could be used 5 3 towards a conceptual hydrogeological model the new insights previously described enable to build a robust hydrogeological conceptual model of the northern flank of the bromo tengger fig 13 a and b inferred from a high resolution and multidisciplinary approach the hydrogeological observations performed on the bromo tengger volcano can be compared with the main volcanic hydrogeological conceptual model illustrated by the hawaiian ingebritsen and scholl 1993 and the canarian manifestations custodio 2007 hemmings et al 2015a the high permeability apron the presence of perched aquifers and the related thick vadose zone of the bromo tengger show many similarities with the oahu island in hawaii nichols et al 1996 additionally with the presence of an artesian basin such as in honolulu however in the proximal zone of the bromo tengger there is no clear indication whether a volcanic core exists or not neither highly altered rocks nor dike clusters have been observed on the field but this may be due to the lack of deep erosion incisions in this part of the volcano on the basis of the andesitic volcano architecture described in indonesia such as in merapi selles et al 2015 we may assume an inner structure with a volcanic core but probably occupying a low to middle elevation because of the absence of gravity springs at high elevation enabling a thick unsaturated zone cruz fuentes et al 2014 herrera and custodio 2008 the main differences between the bromo tengger and the conceptual model of basaltic islands are the presence of ignimbrite deposits sapikerep valley and north ranu grati maybe playing an important role within the confining layers a more complex volcanic architecture of the tengger edifice induced by separated or partially overlapping with a wide spectrum of different cumulative structures such as the calderas 5 4 perspectives now that a hydrogeological conceptual model is proposed it opens up perspectives for a complete deterministic 3d modeling of this complex hydrosystem necessary to set up quantitative management scenarios of this groundwater resource complementary field investigations with a piezometric survey in the plain will notably precise the west east extension of the downstream aquifer modeling of δ18o from the recharge area to and within the downstream aquifer may enable explaining the slight spatial δ18o variations observed in the plain then precise the aquifer recharge area especially to identify the eventual hydrogeological role of the nongkojajar caldera the study of the other flanks of the volcano may provide a thorough understanding of the global hydrogeology of the bromo tengger groundwater age dating is scheduled and will provide precious residence time data necessary to prevent some pollution impacts such as those induced by anthropogenic pressures on the northern flank of the volcano 6 conclusions this multidisciplinary study comprising geological hydrometeorological monitoring hydrochemical and isotopic approaches together with a simple quantitative modeling of groundwater isotopic content allowed designing the hydrogeological structure and functioning of a complex andesitic system such as the bromo tengger volcano only a combination of results each obtained from one discipline allows to build a robust conceptual model of the bromo tengger on this volcano two main hydrogeological systems are identified the upstream host aquifer rock is composed of an andesite lava flows series topped with a pyroclastic series these formations geologically complex in details appear as homogeneous and permeable at the volcano scale they host a basal aquifer and a few perched aquifers the latest being characterised by low discharge gravity springs the basal aquifer supplies the volcano sedimentary aquifer from the plain the downstream part is characterised by a multilayer volcano sedimentary confined aquifer it gives rise to high discharge artesian springs such as umbulan and numerous artesian wells the realistic modeling of groundwater isotopic content supported by isotopic data and the water budget of the northern flank of the bromo tengger shows that the recharge occurs along the whole northern flank of the volcano it is mostly controlled by orographic effects that trigger the rainfall spatial distribution as a consequence of this recharge pattern about 80 of the recharge occurs within an elevation range of 150 and 1450 m a s l around the r er and re peak the contribution of the tengger caldera to recharge is then limited the insights presented here provide first valid hydrogeological constraints for further 3d numerical modeling to assess the response of the aquifer to anthropogenic and climate changes on the basis of various simulation scenarios declaration of competing interest

8407,study region the bromo tengger volcanic aquifer system east java indonesia study focus andesitic volcanic aquifers in indonesia are an important source of groundwater supply for the population the artesian flow from high discharge springs facilitates the access for irrigation and drinking water but continuously flowing artesian wells exert an increasing pressure on the groundwater resource given the complexity of the volcanic edifice a multidisciplinary approach including geological hydrometeorological hydrochemical and isotopic measurements was performed to characterise the hydrogeological functioning of the volcano s northern flank new hydrogeological insights for the region two main hydrogeological systems are identified a system with perched aquifers in the lava flows and pyroclastic complex supplying low discharge springs or infiltrating to a deep flow system the latter system is unconfined and provides groundwater to the downstream plain that hosts a confined multi layer volcano sedimentary aquifer the joint implementation of a quantitative isotopic approach and a groundwater budget allows characterising aquifer recharge along the whole volcano flank it is mainly controlled by the rainfall distribution that peaks around 1200 m elevation the caldera basin on the top of the volcano has a very limited contribution to recharge a conceptual hydrogeological model is proposed and compared to the main concepts of volcanic islands this study is a first step for further scientific and management discussions to implement protection policies on the bromo tengger aquifer system keywords hydrogeology volcanic aquifer andesite recharge isotopes hydrochemistry quantitative analysis 1 introduction worldwide insular volcanic aquifers are a serious asset for drinking water supply in such environments due to the growth of water needs surface water resources are no longer sufficient particularly during the dry season in many cases groundwater becomes an alternative resource to provide drinking water such as on hawaii in the pacific ocean whittier et al 2010 jeju island in korea hamm et al 2005 martinique island in the caribbean sea vittecoq et al 2015 or the canary islands in the atlantic ocean izquierdo 2014 the indonesian archipelago is located on the ring of fire pambudi 2018 which is an area of intense seismic and volcanic activity including 400 andesitic volcanoes of which about 70 are still active some of them are known for the emission of the most major plinian eruptions already having upset global climate such as the mont samalas guillet et al 2017 in this region volcanoes represent a concentration of significant hazards and natural livelihood for the population the mount bromo tengger in the eastern part of the java island is one of the most visited andesitic volcanoes in the world bromo tengger semeru national park fao 1982 cochrane 2006 more than a profitable touristic spot the massif also provides a unique drinking water resource to the local population through groundwater several volcanic springs discharging more than 1000 l s 1 are known at the feet of the volcano and are used for irrigation and the population needs since centuries to millennials in particular they partly supply the second biggest city of indonesia surabaya about 4 million inhabitants 80 km north of the volcano and other cities surrounding the volcano such as probolinggo east and malang west they also totally supply the city of pasuruan north the artesian spring of umbulan is the most important spring of the area with a current discharge of about 3500 l s 1 during the last few decades and mainly since the 80 hundreds of wells were drilled at the feet of the volcano particularly for paddy fields irrigation these continuously flowing artesian wells with a discharge often higher than 15 l s 1 modify the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer as highlighted by the significant decrease of the major springs discharge the knowledge of the structure functioning and water budget of the whole hydrogeological system in this area is thus required to ensure the sustainable quantitative management of the aquifer and also to preserve groundwater quality the andesitic type volcanism hydrogeology is much less studied than the basaltic one and there is a need for the development of hydrogeological conceptual models two majors distinctions have been proposed in the literature to describe basaltic type volcanism hydrogeological systems at the volcano island scale 1 the hawaiian model and 2 the canary island model the hawaiian model describes a low lying basal aquifer with high level water bodies perched on low permeability layers and impounded by dikes ingebritsen and scholl 1993 the canary model describes a continuous aquifer that domes steeply inland to high elevation over a low permeability volcanic core custodio 2007 hemmings et al 2015b however there is now a consensus on considering only one single conceptual model with differences depending on local circumstances and the effects of the volcanic deposits succession erosion and reshaping due to major landslides custodio com pers custodio 2007 herrera and custodio 2008 this single conceptual model considers only one main stratified and heterogeneous groundwater body through a combination of a central low permeability volcanic core with a dyke intrusion network a more permeable cover and a skirt or apron of very transmissive materials in periphery custodio com pers custodio et al 2016 marrero diaz et al 2015 some andesitic geological environments such as pyroclastic formations have locally been studied e g charlier et al 2011 in the caribbean or selles et al 2015 in indonesia however the hydrogeological functioning of andesitic volcanoes or composite shield volcanoes such as the bromo tengger are poorly known moreover the proposed case study can also be considered as an example of the hydrological responses to changing conditions due to anthropogenic forcings there is a real lack of knowledge regarding the hydrogeology of the bromo tengger volcano previous studies mostly focused on the volcanology and seismics of the mount bromo and its caldera and some others on the geological architecture of the volcanic edifice aiuppa et al 2015 bachri et al 2015 bani et al 2013 gottschämmer and surono 2000 mulyadi 1992 van gerven and pichler 1995 zaennudin et al 1994 the main aim of this study is thus to identify the structure and hydrogeological functioning of the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcanic edifice as required for a correct characterization of such complex hydrosystems a pluridisciplinary approach see for instance dewandel et al 2017 maréchal et al 2014 pryet et al 2012a 2012b has been implemented geological hydroclimatic hydrochemical and isotopic investigations allow the construction of a robust conceptual model of the bromo tengger volcano in addition it is also important to adapt existing methodologies such as isotope hydrology and to reinforce their robustness into this specific context of humid tropical climate with a wide range of elevations the present work is structured as follows after this introduction section 1 the study area is presented in section 2 section 3 details the methodology which combines geological surveys the implementation of a hydro climatologic monitoring network hydrochemistry and isotopes analyses section 4 focus on the results and interpretations of the gathered data for a better understanding of groundwater circulation section 5 is devoted to a discussion about the interest of a quantitative isotopic modelling coupled with a hydrological water balance to identify the recharge area of the multilayer aquifer located at the basis of this andesitic volcano and to the set up of its conceptual hydrogeological model 2 study area the study area fig 1 is approximately 1300 km² and covers the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcano including the highest caldera tengger caldera and the coastal plain of pasuruan city while only few springs exist in the southern part of the volcano the northern part is of great hydrogeological interest due to the numerous high discharge water points groundwater outflows known in that area 2 1 geology the bromo tengger bt mountain is one of the many volcanic edifices in the eastern part of the java island indonesia fig 1 a it is a complex andesitic stratovolcano comprising in its actual caldera several cones such as the last active mount bromo fig 1 b the bromo tengger is located in the bromo tengger semeru national park and culminates at about 2700 m above sea level m a s l the inner caldera floor is at about 2100 m a s l this volcanic massif began to grow about 1 4 million years ago as a result of the northwards subduction of the indo australian plate beneath the eurasian plate this volcano is located in the back arc basin of the sunda arc hamilton 1988 the different eruptions of the tengger are mainly classified as vei 2 as regards the volcanic explosivity index defined by newhall and self 1982 that comprises 8 classes over time they produced a succession of a huge accumulation of lava flows and subordinate pyroclastic deposits which constitute the framework of the composite bromo tengger volcano thouret 1999 the recent collapse of the magmatic chamber created a large caldera 16 km in diameter with a large collapse in its north east edge sapikerep valley widespread ash fall deposits covering the upper flanks of the tengger are related to phreatomagmatic activity from the intra caldera complex mulyadi 1992 erosion by streams forms numerous canyons with very steep slopes which extend radially from the caldera and the volcano slopes to the piedmont areas the peripheral zones of the volcano structure and particularly the pasuruan north plain are constituted by volcano sedimentary deposits quaternary in age such as observed around most big stratovolcano volcanoes in indonesia selles et al 2015 the thickness of this filling is more than 300 m according to the stratigraphy proposed for the lusi mud volcano mazzini et al 2017 located about 40 km north from the pasuruan plain fig 1a this volcano sedimentary series exhibits a south north graded bedding it comprises all the transition terms between proximal volcanic series such as lava flows pyroclastic falls and flows lahars reworked volcanic formations and more distal volcano sedimentary deposits that are progressively more clayey towards the north fine clayey sediments constitute the first tens of meters below ground surface of this volcano sedimentary series if many studies focused on the geology and geomorphology of the tengger caldera fig 1 b there is still an important lack of knowledge concerning the fault system of the tengger edifice and the detailed structure of the peripheral sectors such as the north pasuruan plain the major tectonic structures of east java are normal e w and strike slip ne sw faults inherited from the subduction context marliyani 2016 susilohadi 1995 some authors describe the caldera structure and the caldera bounding faults of different type of volcanoes cabusson 2012 cole et al 2005 in particular for the tengger the northeast margin of the tengger caldera fig 1 a is linear suggesting a control by a nw se trending fault newhall and dzurisin 1988 additionally neumann van padang 1951 suggested the existence of two subtle alignments of vents within the caldera nne ssw and e w no other fault system is described on the tengger in the literature however the watukosek fault system fig 1 a associated to the arjuno welirang volcanic complex described by moscariello et al 2017 could be extrapolated to similar regional ne sw fault systems responsible of the alignment of the semeru bromo and the piercement structure illustrated by the ranu grati maar in the pasuruan plain the north pasuruan fault zone surveyed by marliyani 2016 suggests that the pasuruan plain is structured by a south north graben 2 2 climate according to badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika of malang bmkg 2018 east java is characterised by a humid tropical climate with two distinct seasons a wet season from november to april and a dry season from may to october the east java mean annual rainfall is about 1500 mm at sea level with about 140 rainy days a year bps statistics indonesia 2017 for the bromo tengger area the precipitation recorded for the 2008 2018 period is ranging from 1290 to 2400 mm year 1 respectively for the station 9 and 5 bmkg 2018 fig 2 a the mean interannual precipitation estimated on the basis of 6 rain gauges n 1 2 4 5 6 7 fig 1 regularly located on the northern flank of bromo tengger is about 2000 mm year 1 with a maximum amount of rainfall from december to february fig 2 a b unfortunately bmkg data are not precise enough to map rainfall on the tengger volcano because of numerous and long gaps observed in data for all rain gauges in such steep topographic environment the rainfall usually increases from the coastal low elevation areas to the inland highest areas but also depends on the wind orientation from the surabaya and malang stations data the annual average wind direction is about n150 nw se with a mean velocity of about 5 km h 1 and the annual average humidity is 76 the 2008 2018 annual average temperature shows a minimum temperature of 18 3 c for malang 580 m a s l and a maximum temperature of 32 1 c for surabaya 10 m a s l the mean interannual precipitation estimated by the trmm satellite data kummerow et al 1998 for the hydrological years 2000 2018 fig 2 c is 2123 mm year 1 there is no significant precipitation trend observed during the last 18 years for annual rainfall as well as for rainfall during wet and dry seasons the two last hydrological years 2017 2018 have rainfall very near the average and can both be considered as representative mean hydrological years in addition the 2017 and 2018 rainfall amount measured during the rainy season is near the average rainfall amount of the rainy season 2 3 hydrogeology in continental context the structure of volcanic aquifers is mainly governed by the opposition between an impermeable substratum often non volcanic and overlying volcanic formations generally permeable see for instance bourlier et al 2005 or rouquet et al 2012 in insular volcanic context two main manifestations of a single conceptual hydrogeological model are described in the literature at the volcanic edifice scale or even at the whole island scale 1 a low lying basal aquifer linked to inland dike impounded and perched aquifers such as in the island of oahu in hawaii nichols et al 1996 peterson 1972 2 a continuous basal aquifer extending far inland and at rather high elevation which is well detailed in the canary islands custodio 2007 these hydrogeological models were developed for basaltic volcanism hot spots transform faults etc geodynamical context and are still improved by the hydrogeological community especially regarding the key role of the volcanic core with dike network acting as barriers or as water conducting features through the fissures associated herrera and custodio 2008 recent studies show a more complex reality and the need for higher resolution hydrogeological studies even in basaltic context join et al 2005 lachassagne et al 2014 moreover andesitic type volcanism exhibits different hydrogeological patterns than the basaltic one and still need to be better characterized charlier et al 2011 hemmings et al 2015b in such andesitic context the volcanic formations have often more various lithologies than in basaltic context with lavas but also pyroclastic formations and volcano detritic series such as lahars and debris flows for instance the hydrogeological role of the extensive ignimbrite deposits frequently found in andesitic context is still poorly understood and may enable the presence of more than a single groundwater system the andesitic volcanic formations are also often older with several volcanic and erosion phases and the associated weathering processes and paleosurfaces it generates multiple superimposed or juxtaposed hydrogeological units with various hydrogeological relationships furthermore the high relief of volcanoes favours erosion and the associated presence of deep canyons may also laterally limit the extension of the hydrogeological units in the merapi volcano indonesia a dominant pyroclastic and volcano detritic volcano groundwater flow pathways are described to be related to the volcanic infilling of ancient paleovalley systems locally comprising lava flows which act as a preferential underground drainage networks selles et al 2015 the volcanic context of the tengger strato volcano is rather different as lava flows mainly basic andesite extensively present on most of the northern slope gradually disappear to the upper reach of the north plain where the volcano sedimentary series appear only a few gravity springs with discharge of a few l s 1 are known on the flank of the volcano in contrast important artesian springs outflow from the upper part of the volcano sedimentary series of the northern plain such as umbulan q 3500 l s 1 and banyu biru q 300 l s 1 springs which are used for irrigation and drinking water supply in the pasuruan plain fig 1 a an artesian spring or well is defined as a groundwater outflow which occurs through some fissure or other opening features lithological heterogeneity fault intrusive bodies or drilling for a well in the confining bed that overlies the confined aquifer definititon modified from unesco 2012 the plain is also characterized by hundreds of artesian wells drilled in the volcano sedimentary formation near or downstream the springs for agricultural or domestic uses their depth varies between 30 and 120 m and their discharge often reaches several l s 1 the geometry and lateral extent of the confining units responsible of artesianism are not known but some authors present the pasuruan plain as an extensive and productive aquifer system of moderate transmissivity and with piezometric head near or above the land surface soekardi puspowardoyo 1985 there is no information about hydrothermal activity on the northern flank of the bromo tengger in addition the water temperature measured in artesian wells of the volcano sedimentary plain is about 23 c which indicates a negative thermal anomaly in comparison with the local mean annual air temperature of about 30 c then the low temperature of the groundwater suggests a recharge at high elevation the hydrogeological functioning of the 40 km2 endorheic basin at the summit of the volcano tengger sea sand caldera is also unknown 3 methodology the comprehension of the structure and hydrogeological functioning of complex systems requires a multidisciplinary approach in fact each method provides some clues of the hydrosystem which can only be considered as reliable insights when they converge complementary methods were then applied geological study implementation of a hydro climatologic monitoring network hydrochemistry and isotopes analyses results of these investigations and analyses described here below allow delineating the recharge area and conceptualizing the aquifer structure and its functioning 3 1 geological study a multi scale geological field work has been conducted to gather complementary data first the main geomorphological structures of the bromo tengger massif were characterized using arcgis and google earth tools an hill shade map of the srtm30 m at a resolution of one arc second farr et al 2007 was elaborated and compared to the different existing geological maps mulyadi 1992 santosa et al 1992 zaennudin et al 1994 second a 5 months geological fieldwork was performed to both observe lithological features in areas where information was missing and verify geological descriptions and limits of the existing maps on the northern flank of the volcano this work was mainly carried out in canyons where most of the outcrops are located stratigraphic logs and geological data were collected from about 250 outcropping sites then analyzed to corroborate and sometimes correct information from the existing geological maps on the volcano sedimentary plain of pasuruan the existing geological description was completed by the geological logging of seven wells 34 to 103 m deep on the basis of the cuttings and cores collected during drilling appendix fig a1 3 2 monitoring network for recharge assessment 3 2 1 hydro climatological monitoring the rainfall and temperature pattern of the bromo volcano were characterized using 4 new meteorological stations cimel rtu station installed along a north south transect at different elevations kronto 535 m a s l wonorejo 1158 m a s l temple 2154 m a s l and seruni 2681 m a s l fig 3 hourly temperature and rainfall measurements were recorded over one year from 1 04 2017 to 31 03 2018 this period is part of 2017 and 2018 hydrological years considered as mean hydrological years see section 2 2 rainfall was collected for isotope analysis and cumulated rainfall assessment in a 200 l water tank initially filled with 1 l of motor oil to avoid evaporation the final volume of water in this tank was measured at the end of the monitoring period to check the good calibration of the cimel rain gauges in addition the aqua factory meteo station located in the pasuruan plain aqua 17 m a s l that records daily rainfall was also used a 5 8 km² representative surface watershed was monitored to estimate the water budget of the study area this watershed ranges from 435 m a s l at the kronto river gauging station to 2615 m a s l stream water level was measured with a 0 5 cmh2o precision pressure probe during the hydrological year stemming from 01 11 2017 to 31 10 2018 a rating curve was built using 5 manual discharge gaugings ranging between 2 5 and 60 l s 1 and completed by the discharge estimated during a peak flood about 1500 l s 1 from a velocity estimate performed with a floating object a bottle and the known section of the stream water points on the volcano flank and in the plain springs wells dugwells were inventoried and stored in a database discharge measurements of the main artesian springs and the artesian wells were also realized 3 2 2 analysis of climatic and hydrological data the monitoring results were used to characterize the spatial rainfall and temperature distributions along the northern flank of the volcano based on the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 the aquifer recharge was computed as follows 1 re r ret

2017 to 31 03 2018 monitoring period the runoff was estimated from the kronto watershed hydrological data 01 11 2017 to 31 10 2018 to compute average rainfall over this watershed the weighted surface coefficient from thiessen polygon is applied on the surface watershed with the data from the kronto wonorejo and seruni meteo stations with respectively 20 62 and 18 the total recharge of the aquifer was inferred from its outflows from the main artesian springs and artesian wells and from leakage estimated vertical groundwater flow through the plain aquitard 3 3 hydrochemical and isotopic measurements during 4 sampling campaigns including dry and wet season may june 2016 november 2016 may june 2017 and march june 2018 with sampling elevation ranging from 13 to 2700 masl were collected i 31 groundwater samples artesian wells artesian and gravity springs ii 1 surface water sample from a lake maar iii 4 rainwater samples from meteorological stations details of the sampling points are given in table 1 and plotted in fig 3 on the northern flank of the bromo tengger the 17 groundwater samples were mainly collected from gravity springs such as inter lava flows springs in the volcano sedimentary plain the 14 water samples were collected from artesian springs and artesian wells for each groundwater sample physico chemical measurements electrical conductivity ec ph temperature dissolved oxygen were recorded in the field using a multiparameter probe hach hq40d and completed by spring well discharge measurements anion and alkalinity were collected in hdep bottles of 10 ml and 50 ml respectively and stored without air bubbles water isotopes were collected in 10 ml amber glass bottles also avoiding entrapped air bubbles samples for cation and traces analysis were collected in acid washed 20 ml vials and the samples were preserved by acidifying to ph 2 with concentrated trace grade hno3 each vial was previously rinsed 3 times with the water being sampled anion cation and trace elements were filtrated using a 022 μm millipore filter samples were kept refrigerated prior to analyses alkalinity was determined in the field by titration with hcl 0 1 m using a manual titrator hach the other analyses were performed in hydrosciences laboratory university of montpellier anions were analyzed by ionic chromatography using a ic1000 dionex cations and traces were analysed with an icp ms icap q thermo fisher the analytical error for major elements is below 5 and below 0 1 for traces elements stable isotopes δ 18o δd were analysed at lama laboratory using an isoprime mass spectrometer with an accuracy of 0 08 for δ 18o and of 0 8 for δd the isotopic data are reported in the conventional delta notation as a deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow comparison of the stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and rain water at different altitudes is defined as an efficient and approved scientific tools for evaluating recharge area from complex hydrogeological systems gat 1996 jones et al 2000 this method has been successfully performed for many volcanic islands heilweil et al 2009 hildenbrand et al 2005 prada et al 2016 however the monthly rainfall sampling required for establishing altitudinal isotopic gradient gonfiantini et al 2001 is challenging to perform in volcanic regions with difficult access due to dense vegetation and high slope and has some drawbacks as no local isotopic monitoring exists on the study area we first determined an altitudinal gradient of water isotopes using small local springs q 1 l s 1 called integrative springs located along the northern flank of the volcano these integrative springs are characterised by small watershed 0 5 km² and short flowpaths between recharge and discharge locations the geomorphology confirmed the limited extension of their watershed such as seruni n 17 table 2 located in a small thalweg at less than 100 m from the volcano summit or little spring of tosari n 14 table 2 located under a high cliff and no relationship with stream water infiltrated upstream in addition these springs show significantly stable physicochemical parameters and water isotopes suggesting a local aquifer nevertheless sufficiently developed to smooth rain events and seasonal variations local anthropogenic impacts or volcanic activity dry deposits influence some of these springs in accordance with the land use of their inferred recharge area also confirming a local recharge this methodology has been successfully applied on volcanic context such as in guatemala mulligan et al 2011 the isotopic value of the integrative springs was used to calculate a local meteoric water line referred as the bromo spring water line bswl the stable isotopes of rain water were also sampled at the end of march 2018 after one full year of cumulated rainfall storage at each meteorological station fig 3 and section 3 2 1 these samples allowed to establish a local meteoric water line bmwl bromo meteoric water line calculated as a first approximation with the pwlsr precipitation weighted method hughes and crawford 2012 due to uncomplete rainfall collection at aqua station we estimated water isotope values in the plain using the gnip station of jakarta iaea 1961 determined for the same coast and elevation than aqua station iaea 1962 1998 8 m a s l δd 7 47 δ18o 7 99 the bmwl is then compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 and validated by the local meteoric water line lmwl based on gnip of jakarta 3 4 quantitative estimation of stable isotopes signature for recharge area delineation to delineate the recharge area of the aquifer we assume that the isotopic signature of the main spring umbulan is representative of the isotopic signature of the basal volcano sedimentary aquifer which is confirmed by isotopic sampling in the plain the methodology developed in this paper combines the use of a the stable isotopes data outflow at the main spring on the one hand and local meteoric water line built from the integrative springs bswl on the other hand b the total groundwater outflow measured from the aquifer see section 3 2 1 and elevation dependent groundwater recharge computation the interest of a 2d quantitative modeling developed in this paper as compared with a simple 1d approach allows 1 to take into account the conical shape of the volcano and 2 to accordingly compute a recharge function leading to the water budget that depends not only on the elevation but also on the shape of the volcano which is a key point to constrain the results these geometrical characteristics shape and recharge function more precisely effective rainfall f elevation and shape of the volcano are considered as fixed entry parameters as well as the isotopic data the infiltration rate on the contributing slices is also considered as a fixed parameter based on hydrological measurements then the only adjusted parameters are the contributing slices which elevation for the recharge area and the surface area of the whole recharge area geological and hydrogeological arguments are used to validate and ensure the reliability of the results of course such a methodology provides theoretically a non unique solution however constraining a maximum of parameters from other independent methods approaches and using other information such as geology and hydrogeology helps identify the most probable one s the methodology comprises 5 steps fig 4 steps 1 3 correspond to the preparation of the data base then of the model steps 4 and 5 to its calibration to delineate the aquifer recharge area computations were performed with msexcel step 1 discretisation of the maximum lateral and vertical extension of the potential recharge area of the aquifer dividing all the northern flank of the volcano into 100 m range of elevation slices the number of slices n is defined as 2 n i s l i c e i where i 0 to n and each slice mean elevation is mh i i using morphological information to laterally west east limit the extension of the recharge area this step enables to compute a first distribution of surface area for each slice that may be refined later during the modeling process the potential recharge surface area stotal is computed as follows 3 s t o t a l i s i where s i the surface of slice i km² enabling aquifer recharge step2 recharge was computed for each slice along the same range of elevation by interpolating the results r ret from water budget section 3 2 2 obtained at the 5 meteorological stations of the northern flank of the volcano and infiltration rate the recharge of each slice r e i is given by 4 r e i e r i c i n f s i from which the total estimated inflow to the aquifer is inferred 5 q t o t a l i r e i where er the effective rainfall of the slice i mm y 1 cinf the coefficient of infiltration of the effective rainfall initially fixed at 100 for each slice step 3 the δ 18o recharge signal for each slice was derived from the bswl and used as an input in the model the δ 18o recharge signal for each slice δ 18 o r e c i is given by 6 δ 18 o r e c i δ 18 o

by 7 δ 18 o c o n t i r e i δ 18 o r e c i q t o t a l step 4 first calibration phase of the model here the objective is to define the elevation slices where recharge can occur with the objective to obtain the δ18o composition measured at the spring aquifer calibration is performed first from the altitudinal distribution of re imposed from step 2 and 3 the computed δ18o composition of the aquifer δ 18 o t o t a l is calculated from 8 δ 18 o t o t a l i δ 18 o c o n t i based on geological or hydrogeological information ex low permeability layers runoff etc the coefficient of infiltration c inf applied on each slice see eq 4 can be adjusted to fit with the observed δ18o composition of the aquifer spring a step 5 second phase of the model calibration calibration of the width of the total recharge area and then of the total surface of the recharge area the west east width of the recharge area is adjusted to fit with the total outflow measured from the aquifer b the calibration process can be iterative particularly between steps 4 and 5 finally sensitivity analyses are performed to estimate the accuracy of the calibration the outputs of this process are mainly the altitudinal and lateral delineation of the recharge area and the spatial distribution of the recharge within this area 4 results and interpretations 4 1 geological synthesis and hydrogeological implications the existing geological maps mulyadi 1992 santosa et al 1992 zaennudin et al 1994 have been compiled and completed with field observations fig 5 a the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcanic edifice appear to be mostly composed of a thick series of calc alkaline lava flows mostly andesitic and unweathered these formations outcrop in the medial zone from 60 to 1500 m a s l and are referenced as olf bri klf nkj on fig 5 a some lava flows series are more than 50 m thick cooked paleosoils locally covered by autobreccia of limited thickness 2 3 m max are interstratified within the lava flows

crisscrossed by lava flows these fall deposits are unconsolidated and are deeply incised by canyons from the hydrographic network a few slope deposits are identified at the outlet of some large valleys madakaripura and sapiekerep they are composed of lahars pyroclastic flows and ignimbrites mulyadi 1992 spread towards the north suig nm in term of geomorphology the volcanic edifice is scarred

alignment umbulan banyu biru telogo kali sukun respectively n 4 2 1 3 on fig 3 with the ranu grati lake in the distal zone of the volcano pasuruan plain 7 drillings red dots on fig 5 b appendix fig a 1 enabled the identification of a superficial first unit ranging from 0 to 30 m deep mainly composed of weathered volcanic tuffs mixed with fluvial deposits characterized by their clayey and cinder matrix several cores at about 30 m deep were collected and show consolidated and clayey pyroclastic materials probably from lahars or ignimbrites deposits the lateral variation of these materials is difficult to precise but the thickness of each unit is about 10 m the clayey formations described in this first unit surely confine the underlying main aquifer the second unit top deeper than 30 40 m deep is composed of reworked volcanoclastics ash and lapilli materials with ripples marks intersected by paleochannels filled with alluvial laharic and polygenic conglomerates mostly consolidated this deep unit is probably contemporaneous and interstratified at its southern limit with the lava flows but as these formations are difficult to drill with the local engines there is no drilling data in the transition zone the volcano sedimentary series thickness is still unknown but some deep artesian wells may be more than 200 m deep from farmers oral testimonies no artesian deep wells have been inventoried in the northern part of the plain in the surroundings of the pasuruan city the distal zone of the stratovolcano is surely characterized by fine deltaic sediments such as silts and clays carried along the hydrographic network selles et al 2015 this surely explains the northern ending up of the aquifer 4 1 1 hydrogeological implications from this complex geological structure we propose a simplified hydrogeological structure composed by 5 main hydrogeological units from the volcano summit to the north coast the central zone constituted by the sand sea caldera ss is filled mostly by dark sand with a high porosity this large endorheic zone with no permanent steam network probably hosts an unconfined aquifer of unknown thickness which outlets and relationships with other aquifers are unknown in the proximal zone of the edifice the thickness of the pyroclastic complex is difficult to estimate however the inner caldera rim outcrops tdk indicate that it could be several hundred meters thick it may overlay the lava flows complex described just below a few low discharge springs were identified in this formation at the favour of layers of lower permeability e g seruni spring table 1 this formation apparently exhibits a high interstices porosity and permeability the medial zone is occupied by the mostly unweathered lava flow complex lfc with chronologically nkj olf klf bri it constitutes a huge geological unit springs and rivers discharge observations show that at the exception of the olf lava flow unit which exhibits a weathering profile the lfc can be considered as homogeneous as a whole this is demonstrated by the fact that only a few low discharge a few l s 1 inter lava flows springs have been identified indicating few perched and local aquifers most of these inter lava springs flow out from clinker layers in contact with cooked paleosoils red layers acting as local impermeable layers hydrogeological surveys along the streams during the dry season show their low specific discharge as compared to the efficient rainfall and no measurable discharge increase along the stream was observed it suggests that beyond these small springs streams do not drain significant aquifers nor loss significant amount of water this later process being surely due to stream siltation in addition few adventives cones ac have been observed on the medial zone and may provide a laterally continuous low permeability and high density materials according to kereszturi and nmeth 2012 in the distal zone of the volcano the slope deposits nm suig hng most probably have a low permeability because of their clayey content in the volcano sedimentary plain distal zone the main hydrogeological feature is the confined aquifer which provides groundwater to the artesian springs and wells according to the geological logs realized during the drilling survey the confined aquifer is multi layered it is confined by a more than 10 m thick confining unit 460 artesian wells were inventoried in the plain with an average discharge of 4 1 l s 1 considering the density of well on the field 6 well km 2 we assume that 20 of the wells have not been inventoried a maximum of about 600 wells is then estimated corresponding to 2400 l s 1 flowing out in the plain all the artesian springs show a total discharge of about 4000 l s 1 table 1 assuming a mean hydraulic head difference of about 5 m between the multi layered confined aquifer and the unconfined aquifer and a confining unit of about 10 m thickness with an hydraulic conductivity of 10 8 m s 1 breuer et al 2000 charlier et al 2011 this gives a mean leakage of about 5 l s 1 km2 for the whole volcano sedimentary plain where artesianism is known about 150 km2 it results in a discharge of about 750 l s 1 due to natural leakage through the upper confining unit the first estimation of the total outflow from the whole aquifer system would thus be about 7000 l s 1 4 2 hydro climatological monitoring of the northern flank of the bromo tengger the new meteorological data are in agreement with the duration of the dry and wet seasons in this area from may to october and from november to april respectively fig 6 b the minimum of the dry season occurred on august with only 3 mm of rainfall at the temple station and no rainfall at all at the other stations the wet season peak occurred in february 2018 with a maximum rainfall value of 668 mm at kronto during both seasons the kronto and wonorejo stations show higher rainfall than aqua on one hand but also than seruni and temple that are however at a higher elevation on the basis of all data 9 to 21 of annual rainfall occurs during the dry season while 79 to 91 of rainfall is recorded during the wet season an important altitudinal gradient of rainfall is observed on the volcano s flank from aqua station 20 m a s l in the plain to wonorejo station 1100 m a s l with annual rainfall of 1878 mm and 3891 mm respectively fig 6 c upstream rainfall decreases from wonorejo to seruni 2700 m a s l and to temple 2100 m a s l with annual rainfall of 1781 and 1552 mm respectively studies about altitudinal gradient of precipitation on high tropical or equatorial mountains also show a decrease of rainfall beyond a certain elevation such as in hawaii scholl et al 1996 2002 or in the martinique french west indies island vittecoq et al 2010 the air mass reaching the volcano s summit are cooler however they are impoverished in vapor based on these studies and our data the most realistic precipitation pattern was drawn with a peak at an elevation of about 1200 m a s l fig 7 b an altitudinal gradient of temperature of about 0 6 c 100 m was assessed with a mean annual temperature of about 30 c in the plain to 11 8 c in the caldera which is consistent with the known temperature gradient on volcanoes in such tropical environment selles 2014 no significant gradient is observed for the relative humidity ranging from 75 in the plain to 83 3 in wonorejo station however cloud and fog accumulation are frequently observed below seruni 2700 m a s l indicating a condensation layer below this elevation the interception of wind blown droplets of water by the vegetation commonly called cloud water interception cwi or fog drip is likely to increase rainfall height in the santa cruz island of the galapagos ecuador the fog drip is negligible at 400 m a s l but represents more than 20 of incident rainfall at about 650 m a s l and directly contributes to groundwater recharge pryet et al 2012a b this parameter can thus be a significative part of the recharge as also identified on la gomera canary island where it represents more than 700 mm y 1 according to the fog drip calculation models izquierdo 2014 on the bromo tengger except some field observations there is no measurement allowing to quantify fog drip as a summary these first results indicate a precipitation pattern controlled by orographic effects occurring on the northern flank of the volcano under the influence of the dominant nw se winds the rainfall thus increases to a maximum value at about 1200 m a s l elevation and decreases beyond 4 2 1 results of the climatic and hydrological analyses the computation of the water budget at each meteorological station allows to plot the rainfall ret and er as function of the elevation fig 7 a b c from april 2017 to march 2018 the recharge rate was also estimated on the representative kronto watershed fig 7 a all results are compiled in the table from fig 7 c pet ret similarly to the temperature the potential evapotranspiration pet and the real evapotranspiration ret continually decrease from the plain to the volcano summit with for example a ret of about 1460 mm in the pasuruan plain and about 620 mm at seruni these ret results are consistent with the gleam satellite data martens et al 2017 with a difference of less than 6 fig 1 1153 mm y 1 for the mean gleam interannual ret from november 1980 to october 2017 and 1223 mm computed on our site for april 2017 to march 2018 the effective rainfall er is very concomitant with the rainfall r variation because of the ret absolute value much lower than r at the exception of the lower part of the volcano and the ret distribution along the flank of the volcano nevertheless the impact of ret is maximum at low elevation where er is finally rather low about 600 mm at an elevation of 50 m a s l then er increases steeply to reach a maximum of 3100 mm also at about 1200 m a s l at higher elevation er steeply decreases with 1300 mm only on the top of the volcano s flank and 900 mm in the inner caldera re during the period nov 17 to oct 18 the discharge of the kronto representative watershed is only about 7 of the rainfall 9 5 of the effective rainfall these data suggest that aquifer recharge is about 66 of the rainfall and about 90 5 of the effective rainfall fig 7 c this result is consistent with the geological observations cf section 4 1 that did not identify impermeable rocks on this experimental watershed nor on the whole flank of the bromo volcano similar results were found in tropical and andesitic pyroclastics context in guadeloupe french west indies where the aquifer recharge was estimated at about 85 of the annual effective rainfall charlier et al 2011 this recharge rate is an average infiltration rate on the whole representative watershed 450 2600 m a s l as the hydrological and hydrogeological field observations did not enable to identify any preferential recharge area 4 3 hydrochemistry field parameters and laboratory analyses including major ions and stable isotopes δ18o δd of groundwater samples from gravity springs artesian springs and artesian wells are reported on tables 1 and 2 and their location is plotted on fig 3 electrical conductivity ec of groundwater ranges from 109 to 671 μs cm 1 in the plain artesian wells and springs show relatively homogeneous conductivity values ranging from 202 to 353 μs cm 1 and 203 to 381 μs cm 1 respectively gravity springs located on the flank of the volcano show a large range of conductivity from 109 to 671 μs cm 1 and the highest values but no correlation was found between the conductivity and the location of the spring as high conductivity is mostly linked to anthropogenic impacts on each small watershed in contrast an increase of conductivity towards the north was found for artesian springs and wells located in the plain due to water rock interactions the mean temperature of the water samples is 22 6 c 3 6 c groundwater temperature is well correlated with the elevation of the spring the water temperature increases as the elevation decreases with a minimal temperature of 12 5 c at 2700 m a s l seruni spring n 17 and a maximal temperature of 26 2 c in the plain for the deep artesian well 20 150 m deep the main spring of the system umbulan has an intermediate temperature of 23 5 c temperatures of the artesian wells and springs in the plain are not at the equilibrium with the mean local air temperature about 30 c indicating a recharge at a higher elevation for all groundwater samples dominant cations are ca and mg fig 8 a table 2 in good agreement with the andesitic bedrock composition three dominant anions hco3 so4 2 cl were found depending on the groundwater samples based on the dominant anions and the relative ca vs mg concentration of water three groups of groundwater were identified they are also related to various elevations fig 8 a in the plain water samples of artesian springs and wells are dominated by camg hco3 water type fig 8 a on the flank of the volcano gravity springs located higher than 1000 m a s l volcanic anthropogenic group fig 8 a belong to camg cl or camg so4 water type the high values of cl and no3 occur in the vicinity of villages or crop fields and indicate anthropic contaminations e g banyu ngisor n 15 table 2 the highest so4 2 contents were found in springs close to the top of the volcano at elevation ranging between 1700 and 2700 m a s l where volcanic sulphur deposits occur they indicate the influence of the volcanic activity e g widodaren n 16 a last group show an intermediate composition between the volcanic anthropogenic type and the main basal aquifer type groundwater samples from intermediate and artesian plain groups show a continuous geochemical evolution through an increase of ca mg towards the north fig 8 b with the distance from the volcano the conductivity increase and mg2 enrichment in the volcano sedimentary plain may result from an increase of residence time triggered by an intensive water rock interaction with clayey formations paternoster et al 2010 the weathering of the volcano sedimentary formations allows the dissolution of mg rich minerals like olivine mg fe 2sio4 and pyroxene x y sio3 2 this dissolution together with the north south groundwater flow direction explains the mg trend observed on artesian wells towards the north fig 8 b this relatively linear mg enrichment for these 2 groups is well correlated with the electric conductivity and water temperature increases this spatial evolution of water chemistry suggests that gravity springs at low elevation and artesian wells springs belong to the same lithological and hydrogeological system with groundwater aging as it flows towards the north gravity springs result from perched aquifers direct recharge leaking water from these perched aquifers and surface water directly infiltrating to the main basal aquifer supply the multi layered aquifer feeding the artesian springs and wells as a consequence common recharge processes can be considered for the artesian springs wells and gravity springs of low elevation the gravity springs above 1700 m a s l do not exactly show the same evolution as they are also influenced by different processes and notably deposits issuing from the active volcanic vents regarding the ca2 increase observed on these springs it may correspond to water rock interaction at the surface of clay minerals within the pyroclastic complex no anthropogenic and volcanic chemical components are significantly observed in the plain system this suggest a limited contribution from the highest part of the volcano to the recharge of the main basal aquifer so4 and confirm the limited extension of agricultural activities compared to the total recharge area of the aquifer dilution effect two wells n 7 and 22 follow the same ca mg ratio trend they are located between umbulan and banyu biru springs and aligned on the supposed sw ne fault fig 5 which could explain a shorter transit time led by this fault the ranu grati maar could be a natural outflow from the same type of aquifer s at least as regards lithology but with longer water rock interactions 4 4 isotopic composition of groundwater and rainfall water isotopes signatures of groundwater surface water and precipitation are reported in the table 2 and plotted in fig 9 a the four rain gauges from 545 to 2681 m a s l have sampled one full year of annual cumulated rainfall april 1st 2017 march 2018 they show a large range of variation from 7 5 to 11 8 for δ18o and from 45 8 to 78 6 for δd the observed δ18o altitude gradient for rainfall is consistent with to a rayleigh adiabatic condensation process the isotopic signature of groundwater samples fig 9 b shows a similar range of variation 6 6 to 10 8 for δ18o and from 37 to 68 8 for δd for an elevation of sampling locations ranging from about 20 to 2700 m a s l in the main artesian system of the plain springs and wells the range of variation is narrower with variations ranging from 6 91 to 7 46 for δ18o and from 39 70 to 44 75 for δd strongly suggesting a common recharge area the surface water sample ranu grati lake n 23 shows the lowest δ18o value and the highest δd 4 9 and 33 7 respectively most of the groundwater samples align above the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl calculated from the gnip station of jakarta iaea 1961 these results show that rainwater composition undergoes the local topographic effects of the volcano the sample from surface water ranu grati lake falls below the lmwl fig 9 b this position indicates an evaporation process in good agreement with the stagnation of the lake water and the high temperature in the plain about 30 c to take into account the local topographic effect on rainwater the bromo meteoric water line was calculated bmwl fig 9 b from the four rain gauges of the area and the gnip station of jakarta with weighted mean respectively 5 63 and 36 10 for δ18o and δd the bmwl equation is 9 δd 7 23 δ18o 7 53 in addition four integrative springs n 11 14 15 and 17 black crosses fig 9 selected for their short groundwater flow paths and no relationships with nearby stream water were used as proxies for precipitation to calculate the bromo spring water line bswl given by the equation 10 δd 7 71 δ18o 12 37 the elevation effect is clearly visible for the northern flank of the bromo tengger fig 9 c with a δ18o and δd decrease as elevation increases the widodaren spring n 16 located at 2200 m a s l in the inner caldera does not follow this trend its δ18o signature is similar to the one of the springs from the northern flank of the bromo tengger located at about 1800 m a s l elevation the difference may be explained by the impact of the local volcanic steam from the active vent of mt bromo that probably emits an enriched δ18o there is a good correlation between the isotopic composition of the 4 elevations classes of groundwater samples fig 9 and the precipitation defined by a gradient of 0 19 δ18o 100 m from the bswl and by a gradient 0 23 δ18o 100 m from bmwl these gradient values are of the same order of magnitude than those found for other volcanoes in indonesia such as merapi 0 29 δ18o 100 m selles 2014 or the vulture volcano in italy 0 17 δ18o 100 m parisi et al 2011 nevertheless a shift is observed between bmwl and bswl this shift cannot be solely explained by the isotopic inter annual variation 1962 to 1998 data from the gnip station of jakarta show only a seasonal difference of 0 58 δ18o but the fog drip observed from about 2000 m a s l on the bromo tengger section 4 2 may represent a water input to the aquifer which has to be taken into account and may explain this shift according to scholl et al 2002 fog samples have isotopic signatures enriched by as much as 3 in δ18o and 21 in δd compared to volume weighted average precipitation at the same elevation our field observations comfort this hypothesis as the highest part of the volcano is covered by cloud layers and fog drip from the trees was observed near seruni rain gauge and spring this enrichment cannot be observed on the rain isotopic results because rain gauges are located on a clear and open area to avoid fog drip or other quantitative artefact from vegetation but they are registered by the springs as elevation decreases the fog drip effect decreases reducing the shift between the two lines bmwl and bswl as a consequence the bswl is more representative of the recharge of the aquifer the δ18o altitudinal gradient from integrative springs was thus used to infer recharge elevation for the artesian springs and wells fig 9 c the apparent mean recharge elevation of the all artesian springs and wells is from about 700 to 1300 m a s l 150 m if one considers analytical uncertainty fig 9c the artesian springs and wells 100 m a s l seem to have the same isotopic signature than the gravity springs below 1300 m a s l green square and orange triangle fig 9 careful hydrogeological interpretation shows that orange triangle springs have a small sized recharge area and can also be considered as integrative springs whereas green square springs have a large recharge area and are probably influenced by stream infiltration or connected perched aquifers stream infiltration is the most relevant explanation as recharge elevation inferred from these springs isotopic signature is consistent with the elevation range of streams surface watersheds near the springs these data cannot be used to draw the bswl the highest springs on the northern flank with the lowest isotopic values suggest that they are i disconnected from the downstream groundwater and the artesian plain or ii represented a low contribution to the recharge of the main basal aquifer 4 5 quantitative modeling of groundwater isotopic signature step i discretisation of the potential recharge area refer to fig 4 for methodology the whole northern flank of the bromo tengger was discretized into 29 slices of 100 m elevation interval fig 10 the median elevation of each slice is ranging from 50 m a s l 1st slice to 2750 m a s l 28th slice a 29th slice considers the half surface of the tengger caldera with an elevation of 2150 m a s l the total surface considered potential recharge area is 540 8 km² the first slice was considered without any potential recharge due to the cover of the low permeability volcano sedimentary confining unit and the upwards piezometric gradient it was thus not taken into account this slice constitutes the northern limit of the potential recharge area the western and eastern limits of the potential recharge area are delineated on the basis of geomorphological arguments nongkojajar caldera rim to the west and sapikerep valley to the east while the southern limit is bounded by the volcano s summit and the half of the tengger caldera the lowest slices exhibit the largest surface areas 44 7 km2 for the lowest slice surface areas progressively decrease when elevation increases at the exception of the 29th slice which is larger since it comprises the half of the tengger caldera 20 km² steps 2 and 3 potential recharge computation fig 11 reports the results from the water budget and recharge computation presented at section 4 2 1 fig 7 b ordinate axis as a function of the elevation of each considered slice abscissa axis as well as the δ18o recharge line bswl selected at section 4 4 at this step of the process recharge is still a potential recharge as it does not account for the isotopic composition of the water from the aquifer here the umbulan spring nor for the total outflow outflow recharge from the volcanic aquifer see steps 4 and 5 steps 4 and 5 recharge area calibration the main outputs from step 3 with recharge 90 5 of effective rainfall except for the slice of the sea of sand caldera where 100 of effective rainfall is considered to infiltrate i e c inf 905 as runoff 9 5 see section 4 2 1 are the following δ18o signature of the whole recharge δ18ototal 7 25 to be compared with the average umbulan spring signature 7 25 standard deviation 0 07 section 4 4 which is used to perform the recharge computations total estimated outflow recharge qtotal 31 000 l s 1 to be compared with the total outflow measured in the plain of 7 000 l s 1 section 4 2 1 at this stage without any calibration the computed isotopic composition 7 25 is already perfectly fitting to the one of the umbulan spring 7 25 this result comforts the hypothesis that the recharge occurs along most of the northern flank of the bromo tengger volcano the computed outflow is much higher than the observed one the surface of the recharge area thus must be significantly reduced laterally by a factor of about 4 4 then the recharge distribution on each slice is available step 4 and illustrated in fig 12 finally the step 5 calibration was performed to proportionally reduce the surface area of each slice in order to adjust to the measured outflow the proportionality coefficient is 4 43 31 000 7 000 then the total computed recharge area may finally be about 122 km2 these results show that most of the northern flank of the bromo tengger may contribute to the recharge of the artesian aquifer consequently the recharge pattern is strongly influenced i by the recharge vs elevation relationships and ii by the morphology of the northern flank of the volcano smaller surfaces at high elevation than at the lower ones due to the shape of the volcano the limited contribution of the lowest elevation area of the volcano to aquifer recharge is supported by geological evidences the cover of the lower area by low permeability sediments that confine the artesian aquifer below the about 50 m a s l elevation line fig 5 a b and 10 and the observed weathering profile developed at the surface of the olf old lava flows fig 5 a and b moreover in this area rainfall minus real evapotranspiration is at minimum fig 11 this first estimation also shows that the eastern and western morphological limits chosen at step 1 are far away from the real limits of the recharge area as a consequence of this recharge pattern about 80 of the recharge occurs within an elevation range of 150 and 1450 m a s l around the r er and re peak fig 12 this result is consistent with the hydrochemistry and isotopic results suggesting a limited contribution of the highest part of the volcano the irregular shape of the recharge values between 750 and 1050 m a s l is strictly related to the corresponding slices surface area which are locally less or larger in the western part of the potential recharge area see step 1 these variations have then no real physical signification and an average 7 8 recharge contribution must be considered the computed average recharge elevation computed with the bswl isotopic line is 1038 m a s l however this value is purely indicative as was demonstrated by the current computations sensitivity analysis as said above the quantitative modeling is mainly controlled by the recharge pattern and the recharge surface area distribution along the volcano s flank the sensitivity analysis table 3 shows that not considering the contribution of the caldera has a significant impact on the aquifer s computed isotopic signature 7 19 vs 7 25 all other parameters being the same as described above but no significant impact on the aquifer s water budget 6870 l s 1 vs 7000 l s 1 it then requires to modify the calibration through reducing the recharge at lower elevation no recharge in the 0 200 m a s l slices 76 recharge rather than 90 5 in the 200 300 m a s l slice conversely if the whole caldera surface 40 km² is considered it requires enabling aquifer recharge to occur much lower than the 100 m threshold even below sea level which is impossible this sensitivity analysis shows that this approach is not precise enough to really demonstrate that the caldera is contributing to the aquifer recharge but the probability is high on the other hand the contribution of the whole caldera is rather inconceivable according to isotopic data a rainfall variation on all slices for instance of 15 has a significant impact on the results as efficient rainfall and then recharge does not evolve linearly with rainfall a 15 decrease of rainfall logically yields a decrease of the aquifer recharge 7000 to 5420 l s 1 it triggers also a shift of the computed isotopic signature from 7 25 to 7 28 as the recharge is smaller mainly at the lowest elevations which also correspond to the largest potential recharge area for the aquifer recalibration of the model requires only to decrease the contribution of the half caldera with a recharge of 52 of effective rainfall conversely increasing rainfall by 15 only requires to reduce the recharge in the lowest 100 200 m a s l slice of the model to 60 of effective rainfall against 90 5 again similarly to the previous sensitivity test this result shows the limits of this approach which precision is not enough to precisely determine the upper and lower limits of the recharge area logically a similar change in the recharge rate along all the volcano s flank has no impact on the isotopic signature of the recharging water but only on the required recharge surface area the calibration carried out and the sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the recharge surely occurs along most of the volcano s flank furthermore as there is neither geological nor hydrogeological change along the flank of the volcano the recharge pattern is mainly controlled by the effective rainfall distribution and the morphology of the volcano surface area distribution vs elevation 5 discussion and implications for the conceptual hydrogeological model 5 1 hydrogeological structure and functioning the hydrogeological structure of the northern flank of the volcano comprises two main geological units i an upstream volcanic geological unit mostly composed of pyroclastic and lava flow series pc and lfc despite the geological complexity of these formations this volcanic unit hydrogeologically appears as homogeneous and permeable at the scale of the whole northern flank of the volcano the pyroclastic formations display an interstice porosity whereas the lavas exhibit both an interstice porosity clinker layers and a cooling fractures porosity these hydrogeological formations host an unconfined aquifer similar to a basal aquifer described in other shield volcanoes such as in hawaii and parts of reunion island where piezometric level is very deep and covered by a thick vadose zone local aquifers perched on ash layers and cooked paleo soil formations feed a few low discharge springs inter and under lava springs naud 1971 on the flank of the volcano isotopic results confirm the small extension of their hydrogeological catchment about 0 5 km2 on average if these local impervious layers are leaking these perched aquifers also partly recharge the basal aquifer this volcanic hydrogeological unit is limited to the south by the tengger caldera summit west and east the geological limits of the studied aquifer where not precisely identified the results of the study shows that they are much less far than the nongkojajar caldera rim and the sapikarep valley ii a downstream volcano sedimentary unit composed of volcanic coarse sand interstratified reworked ashfall lahar tuff bounded to the north by distal clayey deposits the superficial part of the plain is composed of shallow unconfined aquifer described as low permeability volcanic tuff intercalated with permeable fluvial deposits the runoff coming from the rivers flank provides water to the shallow aquifer the confining unit identified around 30 m deep probably explains the presence of artesian aquifer in the plain this aquifer also comprises ash fall deposits and consolidated breccia mostly impermeable which provide it the characteristics of a multilayer confined aquifer system this aquifer is in continuity with the upstream volcanic basal aquifer the hydrochemistry results notably ca mg demonstrate a groundwater flowing and aging towards the north a sw ne fault system could explain the alignment of high discharge artesian springs umbulan and maar the other main outflow from this aquifer is due to human activities in the plain with about 600 artesian wells the transition between the upstream volcanic hydrogeological unit and the downstream volcano sedimentary hydrogeological unit is rather well constrained spatially from field geological observations and also from the southern limit of the artesian wells it is however not well described in terms of geological structure the detailed characterization of this transition zone would require modern drilling techniques which are not available among the local drillers and geophysical measurements however this knowledge is not of prime interest for the understanding of the aquifer s functioning neither for its management 5 2 recharge distribution and hydrogeological balance the recharge occurs on the whole northern flank of the volcano within the andesite lava flows series and the pyroclastic complex lfc and pc however hydrochemical and isotopic results suggest a low contribution of the highest volcano part 1700 m a s l and an apparent mean recharge elevation of about 1000 m a s l the bromo spring water line bswl inferred from integrative springs is a cost effective robust way to characterize the isotopic gradient on the volcano such measurements enable to avoid artefacts such as seasonal rainfall selection blavoux et al 2013 and to account for fog drip observed on the bromo tengger there are still some questions regarding the proportion of recharge input from fog drip that was not explicitly quantitatively computed at this stage of the research complex interception models such as the rutter type rutter et al 1972 could be used to better quantify it or even working on the shift between this bswl and the rainfall line bmwl lower than expected groundwater temperatures in the plain between 23 and 25 c whereas the expected shallow local groundwater temperature should be about 30 c qualitatively confirm that recharge occurs at high elevation based on this quantitative modeling of groundwater isotopic content 80 of the recharge occurs between 150 and 1450 m a s l the recharge is mainly controlled by the rainfall spatial distribution itself strongly impacted by seasonal and elevation effect the rainfall reaches 4000 mm year 1 at 1200 m a s l with 79 91 of which occurring during the wet season the low precipitations recorded on the highest volcano part associated by the δ18o impoverished values excludes the tengger caldera as being the main recharge zone but it is quite sure that it contributes to the recharge an additional hypothesis is to consider the tengger caldera with a north east groundwater flow circulation supplying gravity springs along the sapikerep collapse valley the sapikerep collapse formations may represent a preferential drainage network in agreement with other large landslides of deep erosion in volcanic context as is the case in tenerife island marrero diaz et al 2015 this could be confirmed infirmed by isotopic measurements at these springs in 2018 the outflow measured from the studied hydrogeological system occur within the volcano sedimentary unit and is about 7000 l s 1 the artesian springs constitute a large part of this outflow about 60 the rest is mostly flowing out from the artesian wells a water budget estimation on a representative watershed indicates an effective rainfall infiltration of about 90 5 i e 66 of rainfall based on the previous quantitative insights recharge surface area on the northern volcano flank is estimated to about 120 km² however the lateral extension of the recharge area should be precised to enable the real delineation of the recharge area other tracers than water isotopes could be used 5 3 towards a conceptual hydrogeological model the new insights previously described enable to build a robust hydrogeological conceptual model of the northern flank of the bromo tengger fig 13 a and b inferred from a high resolution and multidisciplinary approach the hydrogeological observations performed on the bromo tengger volcano can be compared with the main volcanic hydrogeological conceptual model illustrated by the hawaiian ingebritsen and scholl 1993 and the canarian manifestations custodio 2007 hemmings et al 2015a the high permeability apron the presence of perched aquifers and the related thick vadose zone of the bromo tengger show many similarities with the oahu island in hawaii nichols et al 1996 additionally with the presence of an artesian basin such as in honolulu however in the proximal zone of the bromo tengger there is no clear indication whether a volcanic core exists or not neither highly altered rocks nor dike clusters have been observed on the field but this may be due to the lack of deep erosion incisions in this part of the volcano on the basis of the andesitic volcano architecture described in indonesia such as in merapi selles et al 2015 we may assume an inner structure with a volcanic core but probably occupying a low to middle elevation because of the absence of gravity springs at high elevation enabling a thick unsaturated zone cruz fuentes et al 2014 herrera and custodio 2008 the main differences between the bromo tengger and the conceptual model of basaltic islands are the presence of ignimbrite deposits sapikerep valley and north ranu grati maybe playing an important role within the confining layers a more complex volcanic architecture of the tengger edifice induced by separated or partially overlapping with a wide spectrum of different cumulative structures such as the calderas 5 4 perspectives now that a hydrogeological conceptual model is proposed it opens up perspectives for a complete deterministic 3d modeling of this complex hydrosystem necessary to set up quantitative management scenarios of this groundwater resource complementary field investigations with a piezometric survey in the plain will notably precise the west east extension of the downstream aquifer modeling of δ18o from the recharge area to and within the downstream aquifer may enable explaining the slight spatial δ18o variations observed in the plain then precise the aquifer recharge area especially to identify the eventual hydrogeological role of the nongkojajar caldera the study of the other flanks of the volcano may provide a thorough understanding of the global hydrogeology of the bromo tengger groundwater age dating is scheduled and will provide precious residence time data necessary to prevent some pollution impacts such as those induced by anthropogenic pressures on the northern flank of the volcano 6 conclusions this multidisciplinary study comprising geological hydrometeorological monitoring hydrochemical and isotopic approaches together with a simple quantitative modeling of groundwater isotopic content allowed designing the hydrogeological structure and functioning of a complex andesitic system such as the bromo tengger volcano only a combination of results each obtained from one discipline allows to build a robust conceptual model of the bromo tengger on this volcano two main hydrogeological systems are identified the upstream host aquifer rock is composed of an andesite lava flows series topped with a pyroclastic series these formations geologically complex in details appear as homogeneous and permeable at the volcano scale they host a basal aquifer and a few perched aquifers the latest being characterised by low discharge gravity springs the basal aquifer supplies the volcano sedimentary aquifer from the plain the downstream part is characterised by a multilayer volcano sedimentary confined aquifer it gives rise to high discharge artesian springs such as umbulan and numerous artesian wells the realistic modeling of groundwater isotopic content supported by isotopic data and the water budget of the northern flank of the bromo tengger shows that the recharge occurs along the whole northern flank of the volcano it is mostly controlled by orographic effects that trigger the rainfall spatial distribution as a consequence of this recharge pattern about 80 of the recharge occurs within an elevation range of 150 and 1450 m a s l around the r er and re peak the contribution of the tengger caldera to recharge is then limited the insights presented here provide first valid hydrogeological

changes in lulc new hydrological insights for this region the consequences of urbanization in kathmandu valley kv have been observed in various forms such as change in runoff groundwater recharge water scarcity and others to sustainably utilize groundwater resources by ensuring adequate supply recharge to groundwater system land use cover lulc management is required a set of models and tools such as the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model for future lulc projection geographic information system gis for spatial data management and analysis analytical hierarchy process ahp to estimate appropriate weights for different layers that influence groundwater recharge and in situ field test and analysis for infiltration rate were used to achieve the objectives results showed that built up area in the kv watershed is projected to change by 21 4 agricultural land by 20 5 and forest areas by 0 9 between 2020 and 2050 in terms of recharge area 6 of open land is projected to convert into impervious area every decade the projected changes are expected to have implications in terms of depletion in groundwater levels and subsequent consequences in urban water environment including base flows in rivers keywords ahp clue s model groundwater recharge kathmandu valley land use cover change 1 introduction subsurface water in various forms such as well stone spout and others are used by human being from history to the hitherto for various purposes such as domestic agriculture and industrial among others gautam and prajapati 2014 as water is central to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs and groundwater is a key source to supply water in many areas it plays a vital role in achieving the sdgs groundwater use is governed by factors such as availability accessibility transportability and cost effectiveness reliable sources and affordable cost are the primary factors that prompt people to use the subsurface water shrestha et al 2016 groundwater the renewable reserve of freshwater in many cases is stored in aquifers groundwater is also the primary source of water in the river during lean seasons particularly when rainfall is nominal belhassan 2011 groundwater impacts the socio economic health of the urban areas however urbanization process affects the quality and quantity of the groundwater in the area wakode et al 2018 due to population growth agricultural development and urban area extension means of lulc change the volume shape and pattern of the groundwater recharge as well as surface runoff is affected ansari et al 2016 such a change can affect directly and or indirectly the socio economic conditions as well as eco environment of the surroundings in many ways han et al 2017 this is true for the kathmandu valley kv one of the largest urban centers in nepal as well over four million people in this valley rely on groundwater as main source of water supply due to limited surface water resources groundwater has been a natural choice as an alternate source for the water supply industries hotels and housing colonies in the valley are using groundwater as a safe reliable and cost effective source of water since the 1980s pandey et al 2010 kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl the major supplier of water throughout the valley is fulfilling only 19 of the demand in the dry season and 31 in wet seasons thapa et al 2018 this clearly depicts that subsurface water is being used by public to fulfil the deficit groundwater contribution to the river flow is estimated at the range of 30 74 depending on the topography soil type climatic factor among others pandey et al 2010 however rapid urbanization of the catchment is resulting increase in runoff and decrease in groundwater recharge thapa et al 2018 the change in surface recharge will ultimately affects groundwater budget earlier studies have estimated groundwater recharge is the valley in the range of 4 6 14 6 million cubic meters mcm per year pandey and kazama 2014 shrestha et al 2017 however groundwater level is depleting in the valley pandey et al 2010 due to the combination of land use cover lulc change and excessive pumping to regulate either of the drivers we need a scientific understanding of the extent of changes and associated impacts kaliraj et al 2014 has reported that plain areas of the valley especially foothills are the most suitable recharge areas however they are under rapid urbanization therefore it is imperative to understand the extent of encroachment of recharge areas due to lulc change it requires projection of future lulc change using a suitable model and translating the lulc change into potential groundwater recharge areas different types of models are available for lulc projection they include but not limited to clue s verburg et al 2002a b dinamica ego soares filho et al 2002 geomod praskievicz and chang 2011 landuse sim pratomoatmojo 2018 and land change modeler lcm kim 2010 the conversion of land use and its effects clue is a dynamic model which can simulate the lulc conversion with the reference of driving forces veldkamp and fresco 1996 in a small region or scale clue output is not properly valid because in the local level there are many driving forces that are not built in clue therefore the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model was developed for the small extent analysis verburg et al 2002a b clue s model has been commonly used for the simulation of lulc in regional and small scale verburg et al 2002a b zheng et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 to further translate lulc data for various scenarios into potential groundwater recharge areas geographic information system gis can be used as a tool as it is capable to handle analysis of spatial data chowdhury et al 2009 kaliraj et al 2014 jhariya et al 2016 different thematic layers that influence groundwater recharge such as drainage density lulc geology rainfall and topography among others are generally used for delineating groundwater recharge areas chowdhury et al 2009 singh et al 2018 the studies have integrated remote sensing and gis techniques for the purpose depending upon relative importance of one layer against another differential weights can be assigned to the thematic layers chaudhary et al 2016 analytical hierarchical process ahp a form of multi criteria decision making mcdm techniques can be used for deriving differential weights to the layers singh et al 2018 earlier studies have also attempted to delineate groundwater recharge areas in the valley for example jica 1990 divided the kv into three zones i e northern central and southern groundwater districts for the purpose of groundwater development and management and also delineated some pockets as potential recharge areas later on thapa et al 2017 also classified the five different area from the output of model however none of them attempted to analyze future lulc scenario and associated impact on recharge areas this study therefore aims to evaluate the impact of lulc change in potential groundwater recharge areas in the kv by answering following research questions i what are projected changes in future lulc under different scenarios ii what are potential areas for groundwater recharge under current condition iii how and where the potential recharge areas are projected to encroach due to lulc change 2 study area bagmati river watershed area is spread in 613 km2 and it is located between 27032 13 and 27049 10 n and 85011 31 and 85031 38 e as shown in fig 1 it is bowl shaped valley with the elevation ranging from 1212 to 2762 m above the mean sea level bagmati is the major river that flows north to south within the basin originated from shivapuri hill bisnumati hanumante dhobi khola manohara balkhu and nakhhu are the major tributaries of the bagmati river kathmandu valley is enclosed by the mahabharat mountain range surrounded by four hills namely phulchowki 2762 m in the southeast chandragiri champadevi in the southwest shivapuri 2722 m in the northwest and nagarkot in the northeast formerly known as the forts of the valley average mean monthly precipitation ranges from 4 2 mm in december to 402 1 mm in july the total average annual rainfall of the basin is 1533 mm yr and more than 80 of total rainfall is received during the monsoon period june september the valley climate is semi tropical and the monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures vary from 29 8 0c to 3 4 0c and average humidity of the basin is 75 dhm 2015 in dry season there is minimum flow and high flow during monsoon within the basin the average annual runoff of the bagmati river at the khokana station valley outlet point st no 550 05 located at the southern tip of the valley is 456 01 million m3 year administratively kathmandu valley represents the three district kathmandu lalitpur and bhaktapur where five major cities kathmandu lalitpur bhaktapur kritipur and thimi are situated the outer periphery hilly area of kv is covered by mixed forest and the peri urban areas are composed of a mixture of agricultural and built up lands and the central core of the valley is covered by built up area thapa and murayama 2009 3 methodology fig 2 depicts the methodological framework adopted in this study lulc map was generated for baseline case using remote sensing products future lulc was projected based on clue s model under different projection scenarios a suitable set of indicators layers for delineating groundwater recharge areas were identified based on literature review expert consultation and data availability differential weights of the layers were estimated based on ahp method recharge areas delineated from the analysis of layers were evaluated based on infiltration rate map prepared as a part of this study based on these analyses projected change in future lulc current recharge areas and encroachment in recharge areas were estimated and mapped detailed methods are elaborated in following sub sections 3 1 watershed delineation the outlet of the bagmati river basin was considered at katuwal daha 850 16 41 96 east and 270 34 54 6 north to incorporate the all urban and peri urban areas of the kv watershed boundary was defined by considering the demographic area of the kv using the 30 m aster gdem global digital elevation map the watershed area was calculated as 613 km2 the entire basin land is divided into five categories agricultural built up forest water and restricted area like airport park governmental office area cultural area etc 3 2 data collection and processing land sat image from 2010 to 2018 usgs land sat 5 to 8 of the study area was downloaded for the analysis by using gis and land sat image the lulc map from 2010 to 2018 were prepared the 2010 lulc data awas downloaded from international center for integrated mountain development icimod and the lulc was validated from icimod 2010 data biophysical and socio economic driving forces that influence the lulc change were selected for analysis topographical factors such as elevation slope aspect etc were taken from the 30 m aster global digital elevation map gdem data human geographic driving forces like river network road network location of settlement etc were taken from the gdem and gis database similarly socio economic data involving population was taken from cbs 2012 the geological factors which influence the lulc change like a geological formation soil type soil texture was taken from the geological map of nepal hydro meteorological data of the kv was taken from department of hydrology and meteorology dhm 2015 to input in the analysis 3 3 past lulc change and validation of lulc map for the retrieved data as above to classify the land category and prepare the lulc map gis was used as an analysis tool existing lulc map of the kv is shown in fig 3 after plotting the dataset of 2010 2018 the lulc trend of each land use type was outlined icimod also prepared the lulc map of nepal in 2010 in this map there are nine lulc type were identified viz agricultural barren grass river built up needle leaved close forest needle leaved open forest broad leaved close forest broad leaved open forest for the validation purpose all the similar type of lulc was categorized in the similar group of icimod data and the total lulc type was changed into five categories the generated data of the study area was validated from the icimod 2010 data by using kappa statistical analysis k the kappa values vary from 0 to 1 the maximum value 1 represents the most perfect agreement between two maps and zero means no level of agreement cohen 1960 the k value can be represented by eqn 1 as follows 1 k p r a p r e 1 p r e where pr a is the observed relative agreement among all rasters and pr e is the hypothetical probability of a chance of agreement for the purpose of validation five lulc categories were defined most of the forest area in the valley is situated in the peripheral part and managed by community forest user groups cfugs therefore from the past lulc data no significant change in the forest coverage area was detected this study therefore considered low conversion area areas such as airport parks religious areas etc were considered as a restricted area due to the governmental restriction not allowing their conversion to other lulc type due to the encroachment of the liner waterway of the river and water body of the kv cannot pass the peak runoff and suffer in numerous flood in the urban area shrestha 2015 currently bagmati integrated river basin project and river road corridor project is under implementation for the management of the waterway and river corridor in this study it is assumed that the lulc of the water body is not changing lulc demand projection scenario was basically estimated from the increase in built up in map and rate of increase in population in the kv for the sensitivity analysis of lulc demand and lulc change of the study area five types of lulc demand scenario were analyzed based on built area and population increase rate a normal land use change scenario b double land use change scenario c half of land use change scenario d population growth rate scenario e half of population growth rate scenario 3 4 future lulc projection the clue s model was selected for future lulc projection it simulates lulc based on an empirical analysis of location suitability combined with the dynamic simulation of competition and interactions between the spatial and temporal dynamics of lulc systems verburg et al 2002a b the model is separated into two modules namely non spatial demand module and spatially explicit allocation module the demand module examines the demand for various lulc through past lulc trends or scenario based lulc and then translates the demand for lulc for application by the spatial allocation module verburg 2010 ten driving forces geology soil type elevation slope population density distance from market etc were considered for the future lulc projection and the dependency of the each driving forces was analysis based on roc value zhou et al 2016 the clue s uses the logistic regression model eq 2 for the identification of driving factors and their probability of the lulc change ordinary logistic regression model as used in other studies e g verburg et al 2002a b chen et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 was used for the purpose first the study area was divided into grid units and the response variable spatial distribution of land use type was in a binary number 1 indicated the transition occur and 0 indicated that this grid did not exist and explained verburg et al 2002a b then the logistic regression model of the probability of the suitability of the lulc was analyzed based on the spss tools and goodness of fit of the analysis is checked by the receiver operating curve roc value pontius and schneider 2001 2 log p i 1 p i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β n x n i where p i is the probability of specified lulc type i transition in the grid and β i is a coefficient to be estimated for each explanatory variable x n i the probability of each grid is calculated to generate the suitability map of different lulc the model then combines the initial lulc map suitability map and lulc transition rules to calculate total probability eq 3 3 tpropi u pi u elasu iteru where tpropi u is the total probability of cell i is suitable for land use u pi u is the spatial distribution probability obtained by logistic regression elasu is the transition elasticity of land use u and it varies from 0 lesser stability of the corresponding land use to 1 higher stability of the corresponding land use and iteru is the iteration variable of land use u from the clue s model was generate the probability map and land use map the result from the clue s was found in the ascii file and easily analysis from gis tools 3 5 delineation of groundwater recharge area a set of 10 indicators table 1 covering three broad categories fig 4 were selected based on literature review their logical ink to recharge potential expert consultation data availability and statistical test e g roc test ahp method as elaborated in other studies e g chaudhary et al 2016 kaliraj et al 2014 singh and nachtnebel 2016 was adopted to estimate weights to the layers the weights factor was obtained by pair wise comparison of each layer against rest of the layers saaty 2004 3 5 1 data standardization for using of each thematic layer of the study each thematic layer grids have a different unique value and the standardization process converts them into the dimensionless same value of the layers the standardization eq 4 and eq 5 are given below and obtained value of the study area was larger the better and smaller the worst of the alternative value of the grids in each thematic layer pei yue et al 2010 standardization used for larger the better 4 yi x i x i m i n x i m a x x i m i n standardization used for larger the better 5 yi x max x i x i m a x x i m i n where yi is the standardized value of the thematic grid and i is the index of thematic grid and x i x i m a x x i m i n are the original maximum and minimum values of the thematic grids respectively 3 5 2 calculation of the groundwater potential recharge area gwpra index all the thematic layers were then aggregated in gis to get a single score of potential recharge area eq 6 malczewski 1999 sum of the product of each weights and its corresponding grid value gave the high potential recharge zone jhariya et al 2016 all the assigned value in each layer grid and the weights factor of each layer computed the theoretical potential recharge areas the higher value of the grid has higher potential and vice versa 6 gwpra j 1 m i 1 n w j x i where gwpra is the groundwater potential recharge area of the study area x i is the normalized weight of the ith class of the thematic layer w j is the weight derived from ahp of the jth thematic layer and m is the total number of thematic layer and n is the total number of class in thematic layer the obtained recharge value from the analysis was categorized in the six different zone the dimensionless output value was analysis by using the gis application gwpra was classified as per table 2 singh et al 2018 3 6 evaluation of groundwater recharge map theoretical recharge potential estimated as described in section 3 5 were further evaluated based on infiltration data collected from the field in situ field test with double ring infiltration method was used to estimate information at different locations within the kv because double ring infiltrometer is likely to give better performance verbist et al 2010 infiltration rate at 86 locations as shown in fig 7 c with wide spatial coverage was estimated from field test by spatial interpolation a raster map of infiltration rate was developed those two maps were compared using kappa statistical analysis k for the evaluation the kappa values vary from 0 to 1 with one indicating the most perfect agreement between two maps cohen 1960 after proper validation baseline recharge area map was finalized a 3 7 projection and analysis of encroachment of recharge area the validated pair wise comparison of weights factor of each layer is used to generate the potential future groundwater recharge area by using the future lulc map generated by clue s model then the future potential recharge areas were compared with baseline map to estimate encroachment in recharge areas by using gis tools 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of satellite driven lulc data 2010 data lulc data was downloaded from the usgs website in land sat image and processed by using arc gis tools the images in figs 3 a and 5 a show lulc maps from 2010 and 2018 for the purpose of statistical data validation the observed map of 2010 was overlapped into the icimod 2010 as shown in fig 3 b overall the lulc map generated in this study was in good agreement with the one from icimod 2010 with this validation the kappa coefficient k value 0 68 was obtained from the analysis the result showed that the generated lulc of 2010 and the corresponding process had considerable accuracy the results presented in table 3 show that the built up area increased by 4 96 whereas the agriculture area decreased by 6 51 of the total land between 2010 2018 it can be noticed that due to the 2015 earthquake 2016 built up area trend partially decreased but again rapidly increased during years 2017 and 2018 due to the formation of community forest user s group encroachment of forest land is drastically decreased as a result of rapid urbanization post 2015 earthquake forest areas has been decreased partially as reflected in the form of decrease in forest cover from 2016 furthermore increase in built up area is reducing the open agriculture and barren land thus adversely affecting groundwater for the future analysis water body and the restricted area land use was assumed that there is no change in the future 4 2 evaluation of clue s model for the lulc change projection ten different driving forces were considered as an input values which is already discussed in previous section the roc value validates the logistic regression model if the roc value is less than 0 7 the accuracy of the model is low and if the value is less or greater than 0 9 represents the accuracy is credible and high precision respectively pontius and schneider 2001 the roc value of each lulc was greater than 0 83 and it shows that there was a strong relationship between the driving forces and the lulc type these data indicated that the regression results are excellent and the regression coefficient from the driving forces was validated parameter for each lulc change is shown in table 4 for the sensitivity analysis of the lulc demand of the study area was analyzed by five demand scenarios and it already describe in previous section normal land use demand scenario was quantified based on the lulc change from 2010 to 2018 and the population growth analysis was based on census population growth rate from 1971 to 2011 of the kv population growth rate demand projection is overestimated and non realistic and half of the normal land use change growth was underestimated however normal land use change is more practical or realistic compared to the other as shown in fig 6 according to the five different scenarios described in the previous section the clue s model was used to project the lulc change in the kv among these scenarios normal land use change scenario was taken for further analysis as water body and restricted areas are not expected to change in all the scenarios lulc change was considered in agriculture and built up areas only simulated data from years 2010 to 2018 was used for the validation of the map and the forecasted data for year 2020 to 2050 is used for the analysis the generated map from the clue s model was validated through the kappa k coefficient the kappa coefficient of years 2014 2016 and 2018 was 0 75 0 64 and 0 62 respectively it showed that the analysis is of considerable accuracy the model assumed that the urban development is concentrated into the existing market and dense village but the practically development is scattered due to high cost of land and less open space in the existing market from the simulation of clue s from 2020 to 2030 forest water body and the restricted areas are not projected to change significantly but the agricultural land is projected to decrease dramatically from 40 11 to 33 44 within that decade average annual encroachment of the fertile land is projected to be 0 67 4 07 km2 by mostly built up area due to the construction of physical infrastructure meanwhile the built area of the kv is projected to increase by 6 85 within a decade which can be clearly seen in the map and appended table 5 and 6 as shown in fig 7 from the overall simulation model 2020 to 2050 agriculture and forest lands is projected to reduce by 20 4 125 05 km2 and 0 9 5 51 km2 of the total area respectively the total built area is projected to increase by 21 3 130 57 km2 of the total area within three decades half of the agriculture land of the kv is projected to shift into the urban area if the current level of urbanization continues as usual more fertile land might convert into a constructed area also the open space used as recreational area of the kv might decline in upcoming days the agricultural production will be decreased due to the loss of fertile land and increase the food deficiency meanwhile the groundwater recharge by the encroachment of potential groundwater recharge area would lower the groundwater table the encroachment of the open areas by the urbanization between 2010 2018 was 10 4 63 54 km2 of the total basin area the lulc map of the clue s model 2020 to 2050 clearly shows that 21 4 130 68 km2 of the open area is projected to change from fertile and permeable agriculture land to built up area 4 3 delineation of potential recharge areas under current and future scenario ten thematic layers were used for the ahp to find the paired comparison weights factor the grid value of each thematic layer was given by the pair wise comparison from 1 to 9 the consistency ratio cr of each thematic layer was less than 8 which indicates the analysis is consistent and the generated data from each layer was suitable for the future ahp analysis overall ten thematic layer analysis cr value 9 7 indicate that the pair wise comparison was more consistent saaty 2004 and the output weight age of each layer was more realistic comparison matrix of ahp and weights factor of each layer is as shown in table 7 matrix was generated from the experts view with the assumption that each layer influenced the rate of groundwater recharge form the analysis precipitation 28 91 is the main key factor for the groundwater recharge and the effect of geology 18 52 and land use 17 16 is relatively high bank of the river is mostly formed by the river deposition which has relatively high infiltration capacity and its weights factor 12 89 was also a major influencing parameter slope influences the contact time of runoff water and soil layer higher slope has high velocity and less recharge and vice versa by using gis and ahp weights factor the potential groundwater recharge area was identified as shown in fig 8 b for validation of the ahp generated potential groundwater recharge area by the actual field condition number of spouts 83 no were identified as per the geological hydro meteorological socio economical changes location every variation of the geological formation land use change in the location and change in the soil texture area is considered for the test point the location point must be free from an anthropogenic disturbance and it must be an open space for the field test double ring infiltrometer see for details lucke et al 2014 test was conducted in 83 different locations of the study area the overall location of the field test point is shown in the map fig 7c actual field raster map was prepared by the field test infiltration rate mm hr point and that was compared with the ahp generated map for the evaluation of ahp outputs due to lack of the information about litho logical moisture content water table soil density and so on actual recharge rate was not accurately quantified due to the variable grid value unit one infiltration value and other is unit less recharge factor statistically these maps could not be validated however from the inception of map and as shown in pervious literature pandey et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 adhikari et al 2019 foothill of the mountain and the alluvial part of the river corridor were most potential area groundwater potential area was computed using eq 6 and the output of the study area was categorized into six parts as per quintile mapping in arcgis area coverage of the very low low moderate low moderate high high and very high was 4 29 9 14 and 14 72 32 59 32 89 and 7 37 respectively of the total area coverage as shown in fig 8 currently high and very high areas are still in open area in the foot hill of northern and eastern part of mountain of the valley central part of the valley also has the potential recharge area but now it is mostly in concrete jungle northern and eastern part of the valley were more groundwater recharge potential zone and the peripheral boundary of the valley are less recharge potential due to high hill and geological formation from the comparison of the observation of field test map ahp method map and previous literature and maps pandey et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 adhikari et al 2019 potential recharge location may be a similar area the southern and northern foothill of mountain areas are the main possible recharge location of the kv if that potential area could be preserved and managed and artificial recharge system will be adapted which can overcome the water security situation of the kv in the future form the analysis the theoretically generated map from the different layers using mcdm techniques is realistic and useable for the location which has less groundwater recharge information like nepal 4 4 change in recharge areas under projected land use cover rapid urbanization mostly influences the groundwater recharge future encroachment of recharge area was identified by using ahp weights factor and the lulc map generated from the clue s model the projected future potential recharge zones are shown in fig 9 from the maps shown in fig 9 it can be observed that every decade the open area agriculture and forest land of the valley is projected to encroach by the urbanization from the data every decade on an average of 6 of open land is projected to decrease and each year 3 66 km2 of open land will change into the urban area the likely reason for not consistent trend across future time periods in table 8 is due to consideration of only one factor i e lulc whereas recharge areas are affected by various other factors as well such decrease will lead in the reduction of groundwater recharge reduction in groundwater leads to the lowering of groundwater table and base flow contributions in river basin in addition the rate of groundwater recharge will reduce over the time primarily due to the increment of the urban population and increases the volume of the water demand such reduction also effects in quantity and quality of water and other urban environments 5 conclusion a methodological framework has been developed and implemented in this study that helps to classify the lulc type identification of the potential recharge area possible protection of the agriculture land for the groundwater recharge and future possible encroachment in the groundwater recharge areas identification of the lulc the future projection of lulc and encroachment of recharge area generated in this study will be useful in effective urban planning optimal utilization of water supply demand and water resources planning and management the sum of the present study could be summarized in the following conclusions a the trend of past and present lulc analysis highlights that the agricultural land is projected to decrease by 6 51 leading to an increment of 4 96 in built up areas it is interesting to note that between 2010 2018 the forest area is found to be increased by 1 48 due to community forestry programs conversion of pervious recharge areas into impervious constructed areas would lead into the reduction of groundwater recharge as the increment of forest area does not necessarily contributes significantly into recharge b the predicted scenario between 2020 2050 using clue s model highlights that the built up area is projected to increase by 21 4 in the next 30 years and the agricultural and forest areas is projected to decrease by 20 5 and 0 9 respectively the results outline that the fertile lands would be converted into urban areas leading to the reduction in agricultural products and productivity lack of irrigation water may also be a crucial case which imparts additional pressure over the groundwater c precipitation geology land use cover distance from the river slope among others were identified to be the significant factors to contribute in delineation of potential groundwater recharge area for the ahp mcdm technique notably 7 37 of the total area was obtained to be the high recharge area 32 89 under high 32 59 moderately high 14 72 moderately low 9 14 low and 4 29 very low recharge areas the high and moderately high recharge areas are situated in the urban areas with greater tendency of expansion thus there might be the case that due to the lulc change more high to moderate recharge areas would be converted to urban areas leading to additional pressure on groundwater d future lulc change analysis highlighted that 6 3 99 km2 of rechargeable land area are projected to convert to impervious land in a decade as kathmandu valley is already facing water scarcity the urban expansion would put additional pressure leading to the graver water scarcity the application of clue s gis and ahp mcdm techniques are more realistic cost effective simple and reliable approaches and scientifically sound methods for the analysis the methodology used in the study area can also be used into other urban areas in the country as well as worldwide the findings from the study provide valuable information for decision makers planners and managers for the sustainable management of the land and water resources the impact of lulc on groundwater and surface water would ultimately affect the river runoff pattern to address this issue further analyses would be carried

such as the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model for future lulc projection geographic information system gis for spatial data management and analysis analytical hierarchy process ahp to estimate appropriate weights for different layers that influence groundwater recharge and in situ field test and analysis for infiltration rate were used to achieve the objectives results showed that built up area in the kv watershed is projected to change by 21 4 agricultural land by 20 5 and forest areas by 0 9 between 2020 and 2050 in terms of recharge area 6 of open land is projected to convert into impervious area every decade the projected changes are expected to have implications in terms of depletion in groundwater levels and subsequent consequences in urban water environment including base flows in rivers keywords ahp clue s model groundwater recharge kathmandu valley land use cover change 1 introduction subsurface water in various forms such as well stone spout and others are used by human being from history to the hitherto for various purposes such as domestic agriculture and industrial among others gautam and prajapati 2014 as water is central to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs and groundwater is a key source to supply water in many areas it plays a vital role in achieving the sdgs groundwater use is governed by factors such as availability accessibility transportability and cost effectiveness reliable sources and affordable cost are the primary factors that prompt people to use the subsurface water shrestha et al 2016 groundwater the renewable reserve of freshwater in many cases is stored in aquifers groundwater is also the primary source of water in the river during lean seasons particularly when rainfall is nominal belhassan 2011 groundwater impacts the socio economic health of the urban areas however urbanization process affects the quality and quantity of the groundwater in the area wakode et al 2018 due to population growth agricultural development and urban area extension means of lulc change the volume shape and pattern of the groundwater recharge as well as surface runoff is affected ansari et al 2016 such a change can affect directly and or indirectly the socio economic conditions as well as eco environment of the surroundings in many ways han et al 2017 this is true for the kathmandu valley kv one of the largest urban centers in nepal as well over four million people in this valley rely on groundwater as main source of water supply due to limited surface water resources groundwater has been a natural choice as an alternate source for the water supply industries hotels and housing colonies in the valley are using groundwater as a safe reliable and cost effective source of water since the 1980s pandey et al 2010 kathmandu upatyaka khanepani limited kukl the major supplier of water throughout the valley is fulfilling only 19 of the demand in the dry season and 31 in wet seasons thapa et al 2018 this clearly depicts that subsurface water is being used by public to fulfil the deficit groundwater contribution to the river flow is estimated at the range of 30 74 depending on the topography soil type climatic factor among others pandey et al 2010 however rapid urbanization of the catchment is resulting increase in runoff and decrease in groundwater recharge thapa et al 2018 the change in surface recharge will ultimately affects groundwater budget earlier studies have estimated groundwater recharge is the valley in the range of 4 6 14 6 million cubic meters mcm per year pandey and kazama 2014 shrestha et al 2017 however groundwater level is depleting in the valley pandey et al 2010 due to the combination of land use cover lulc change and excessive pumping to regulate either of the drivers we need a scientific understanding of the extent of changes and associated impacts kaliraj et al 2014 has reported that plain areas of the valley especially foothills are the most suitable recharge areas however they are under rapid urbanization therefore it is imperative to understand the extent of encroachment of recharge areas due to lulc change it requires projection of future lulc change using a suitable model and translating the lulc change into potential groundwater recharge areas different types of models are available for lulc projection they include but not limited to clue s verburg et al 2002a b dinamica ego soares filho et al 2002 geomod praskievicz and chang 2011 landuse sim pratomoatmojo 2018 and land change modeler lcm kim 2010 the conversion of land use and its effects clue is a dynamic model which can simulate the lulc conversion with the reference of driving forces veldkamp and fresco 1996 in a small region or scale clue output is not properly valid because in the local level there are many driving forces that are not built in clue therefore the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent clue s model was developed for the small extent analysis verburg et al 2002a b clue s model has been commonly used for the simulation of lulc in regional and small scale verburg et al 2002a b zheng et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 to further translate lulc data for various scenarios into potential groundwater recharge areas geographic information system gis can be used as a tool as it is capable to handle analysis of spatial data chowdhury et al 2009 kaliraj et al 2014 jhariya et al 2016 different thematic layers that influence groundwater recharge such as drainage density lulc geology rainfall and topography among others are generally used for delineating groundwater recharge areas chowdhury et al 2009 singh et al 2018 the studies have integrated remote sensing and gis techniques for the purpose depending upon relative importance of one layer against another differential weights can be assigned to the thematic layers chaudhary et al 2016 analytical hierarchical process ahp a form of multi criteria decision making mcdm techniques can be used for deriving differential weights to the layers singh et al 2018 earlier studies have also attempted to delineate groundwater recharge areas in the valley for example jica 1990 divided the kv into three zones i e northern central and southern groundwater districts for the purpose of groundwater development and management and also delineated some pockets as potential recharge areas later on thapa et al 2017 also classified the five different area from the output of model however none of them attempted to analyze future lulc scenario and associated impact on recharge areas this study therefore aims to evaluate the impact of lulc change in potential groundwater recharge areas in the kv by answering following research questions i what are projected changes in future lulc under different scenarios ii what are potential areas for groundwater recharge under current condition iii how and where the potential recharge areas are projected to encroach due to lulc change 2 study area bagmati river watershed area is spread in 613 km2 and it is located between 27032 13 and 27049 10 n and 85011 31 and 85031 38 e as shown in fig 1 it is bowl shaped valley with the elevation ranging from 1212 to 2762 m above the mean sea level bagmati is the major river that flows north to south within the basin originated from shivapuri hill bisnumati hanumante dhobi khola manohara balkhu and nakhhu are the major tributaries of the bagmati river kathmandu valley is enclosed by the mahabharat mountain range surrounded by four hills namely phulchowki 2762 m in the southeast chandragiri champadevi in the southwest shivapuri 2722 m in the northwest and nagarkot in the northeast formerly known as the forts of the valley average mean monthly precipitation ranges from 4 2 mm in december to 402 1 mm in july the total average annual rainfall of the basin is 1533 mm yr and more than 80 of total rainfall is received during the monsoon period june september the valley climate is semi tropical and the monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures vary from 29 8 0c to 3 4 0c and average humidity of the basin is 75 dhm 2015 in dry season there is minimum flow and high flow during monsoon within the basin the average annual runoff of the bagmati river at the khokana station valley outlet point st no 550 05 located at the southern tip of the valley is 456 01 million m3 year administratively kathmandu valley represents the three district kathmandu lalitpur and bhaktapur where five major cities kathmandu lalitpur bhaktapur kritipur and thimi are situated the outer periphery hilly area of kv is covered by mixed forest and the peri urban areas are composed of a mixture of agricultural and built up lands and the central core of the valley is covered by built up area thapa and murayama 2009 3 methodology fig 2 depicts the methodological framework adopted in this study lulc map was generated for baseline case using remote sensing products future lulc was projected based on clue s model under different projection scenarios a suitable set of indicators layers for delineating groundwater recharge areas were identified based on literature review expert consultation and data availability differential weights of the layers were estimated based on ahp method recharge areas delineated from the analysis of layers were evaluated based on infiltration rate map prepared as a part of this study based on these analyses projected change in future lulc current recharge areas and encroachment in recharge areas were estimated and mapped detailed methods are elaborated in following sub sections 3 1 watershed delineation the outlet of the bagmati river basin was considered at katuwal daha 850 16 41 96 east and 270 34 54 6 north to incorporate the all urban and peri urban areas of the kv watershed boundary was defined by considering the demographic area of the kv using the 30 m aster gdem global digital elevation map the watershed area was calculated as 613 km2 the entire basin land is divided into five categories agricultural built up forest water and restricted area like airport park governmental office area cultural area etc 3 2 data collection and processing land sat image from 2010 to 2018 usgs land sat 5 to 8 of the study area was downloaded for the analysis by using gis and land sat image the lulc map from 2010 to 2018 were prepared the 2010 lulc data awas downloaded from international center for integrated mountain development icimod and the lulc was validated from icimod 2010 data biophysical and socio economic driving forces that influence the lulc change were selected for analysis topographical factors such as elevation slope aspect etc were taken from the 30 m aster global digital elevation map gdem data human geographic driving forces like river network road network location of settlement etc were taken from the gdem and gis database similarly socio economic data involving population was taken from cbs 2012 the geological factors which influence the lulc change like a geological formation soil type soil texture was taken from the geological map of nepal hydro meteorological data of the kv was taken from department of hydrology and meteorology dhm 2015 to input in the analysis 3 3 past lulc change and validation of lulc map for the retrieved data as above to classify the land category and prepare the lulc map gis was used as an analysis tool existing lulc map of the kv is shown in fig 3 after plotting the dataset of 2010 2018 the lulc trend of each land use type was outlined icimod also prepared the lulc map of nepal in 2010 in this map there are nine lulc type were identified viz agricultural barren grass river built up needle leaved close forest needle leaved open forest broad leaved close forest broad leaved open forest for the validation purpose all the similar type of lulc was categorized in the similar group of icimod data and the total lulc type was changed into five categories the generated data of the study area was validated from the icimod 2010 data by using kappa statistical analysis k the kappa values vary from 0 to 1 the maximum value 1 represents the most perfect agreement between two maps and zero means no level of agreement cohen 1960 the k value can be represented by eqn 1 as follows 1 k p r a p r e 1 p r e where pr a is the observed relative agreement among all rasters and pr e is the hypothetical probability of a chance of agreement for the purpose of validation five lulc categories were defined most of the forest area in the valley is situated in the peripheral part and managed by community forest user groups cfugs therefore from the past lulc data no significant change in the forest coverage area was detected this study therefore considered low conversion area areas such as airport parks religious areas etc were considered as a restricted area due to the governmental restriction not allowing their conversion to other lulc type due to the encroachment of the liner waterway of the river and water body of the kv cannot pass the peak runoff and suffer in numerous flood in the urban area shrestha 2015 currently bagmati integrated river basin project and river road corridor project is under implementation for the management of the waterway and river corridor in this study it is assumed that the lulc of the water body is not changing lulc demand projection scenario was basically estimated from the increase in built up in map and rate of increase in population in the kv for the sensitivity analysis of lulc demand and lulc change of the study area five types of lulc demand scenario were analyzed based on built area and population increase rate a normal land use change scenario b double land use change scenario c half of land use change scenario d population growth rate scenario e half of population growth rate scenario 3 4 future lulc projection the clue s model was selected for future lulc projection it simulates lulc based on an empirical analysis of location suitability combined with the dynamic simulation of competition and interactions between the spatial and temporal dynamics of lulc systems verburg et al 2002a b the model is separated into two modules namely non spatial demand module and spatially explicit allocation module the demand module examines the demand for various lulc through past lulc trends or scenario based lulc and then translates the demand for lulc for application by the spatial allocation module verburg 2010 ten driving forces geology soil type elevation slope population density distance from market etc were considered for the future lulc projection and the dependency of the each driving forces was analysis based on roc value zhou et al 2016 the clue s uses the logistic regression model eq 2 for the identification of driving factors and their probability of the lulc change ordinary logistic regression model as used in other studies e g verburg et al 2002a b chen et al 2010 zhou et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 was used for the purpose first the study area was divided into grid units and the response variable spatial distribution of land use type was in a binary number 1 indicated the transition occur and 0 indicated that this grid did not exist and explained verburg et al 2002a b then the logistic regression model of the probability of the suitability of the lulc was analyzed based on the spss tools and goodness of fit of the analysis is checked by the receiver operating curve roc value pontius and schneider 2001 2 log p i 1 p i β 0 β 1 x 1 i β n x n i where p i is the probability of specified lulc type i transition in the grid and β i is a coefficient to be estimated for each explanatory variable x n i the probability of each grid is calculated to generate the suitability map of different lulc the model then combines the initial lulc map suitability map and lulc transition rules to calculate total probability eq 3 3 tpropi u pi u elasu iteru where tpropi u is the total probability of cell i is suitable for land use u pi u is the spatial distribution probability obtained by logistic regression elasu is the transition elasticity of land use u and it varies from 0 lesser stability of the corresponding land use to 1 higher stability of the corresponding land use and iteru is the iteration variable of land use u from the clue s model was generate the probability map and land use map the result from the clue s was found in the ascii file and easily analysis from gis tools 3 5 delineation of groundwater recharge area a set of 10 indicators table 1 covering three broad categories fig 4 were selected based on literature review their logical ink to recharge potential expert consultation data availability and statistical test e g roc test ahp method as elaborated in other studies e g chaudhary et al 2016 kaliraj et al 2014 singh and nachtnebel 2016 was adopted to estimate weights to the layers the weights factor was obtained by pair wise comparison of each layer against rest of the layers saaty 2004 3 5 1 data standardization for using of each thematic layer of the study each thematic layer grids have a different unique value and the standardization process converts them into the dimensionless same value of the layers the standardization eq 4 and eq 5 are given below and obtained value of the study area was larger the better and smaller the worst of the alternative value of the grids in each thematic layer pei yue et al 2010 standardization used for larger the better 4 yi x i x i m i n x i m a x x i m i n standardization used for larger the better 5 yi x max x i x i m a x x i m i n where yi is the standardized value of the thematic grid and i is the index of thematic grid and x i x i m a x x i m i n are the original maximum and minimum values of the thematic grids respectively 3 5 2 calculation of the groundwater potential recharge area gwpra index all the thematic layers were then aggregated in gis to get a single score of potential recharge area eq 6 malczewski 1999 sum of the product of each weights and its corresponding grid value gave the high potential recharge zone jhariya et al 2016 all the assigned value in each layer grid and the weights factor of each layer computed the theoretical potential recharge areas the higher value of the grid has higher potential and vice versa 6 gwpra j 1 m i 1 n w j x i where gwpra is the groundwater potential recharge area of the study area x i is the normalized weight of the ith class of the thematic layer w j is the weight derived from ahp of the jth thematic layer and m is the total number of thematic layer and n is the total number of class in thematic layer the obtained recharge value from the analysis was categorized in the six different zone the dimensionless output value was analysis by using the gis application gwpra was classified as per table 2 singh et al 2018 3 6 evaluation of groundwater recharge map theoretical recharge potential estimated as described in section 3 5 were further evaluated based on infiltration data collected from the field in situ field test with double ring infiltration method was used to estimate information at different locations within the kv because double ring infiltrometer is likely to give better performance verbist et al 2010 infiltration rate at 86 locations as shown in fig 7 c with wide spatial coverage was estimated from field test by spatial interpolation a raster map of infiltration rate was developed those two maps were compared using kappa statistical analysis k for the evaluation the kappa values vary from 0 to 1 with one indicating the most perfect agreement between two maps cohen 1960 after proper validation baseline recharge area map was finalized a 3 7 projection and analysis of encroachment of recharge area the validated pair wise comparison of weights factor of each layer is used to generate the potential future groundwater recharge area by using the future lulc map generated by clue s model then the future potential recharge areas were compared with baseline map to estimate encroachment in recharge areas by using gis tools 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of satellite driven lulc data 2010 data lulc data was downloaded from the usgs website in land sat image and processed by using arc gis tools the images in figs 3 a and 5 a show lulc maps from 2010 and 2018 for the purpose of statistical data validation the observed map of 2010 was overlapped into the icimod 2010 as shown in fig 3 b overall the lulc map generated in this study was in good agreement with the one from icimod 2010 with this validation the kappa coefficient k value 0 68 was obtained from the analysis the result showed that the generated lulc of 2010 and the corresponding process had considerable accuracy the results presented in table 3 show that the built up area increased by 4 96 whereas the agriculture area decreased by 6 51 of the total land between 2010 2018 it can be noticed that due to the 2015 earthquake 2016 built up area trend partially decreased but again rapidly increased during years 2017 and 2018 due to the formation of community forest user s group encroachment of forest land is drastically decreased as a result of rapid urbanization post 2015 earthquake forest areas has been decreased partially as reflected in the form of decrease in forest cover from 2016 furthermore increase in built up area is reducing the open agriculture and barren land thus adversely affecting groundwater for the future analysis water body and the restricted area land use was assumed that there is no change in the future 4 2 evaluation of clue s model for the lulc change projection ten different driving forces were considered as an input values which is already discussed in previous section the roc value validates the logistic regression model if the roc value is less than 0 7 the accuracy of the model is low and if the value is less or greater than 0 9 represents the accuracy is credible and high precision respectively pontius and schneider 2001 the roc value of each lulc was greater than 0 83 and it shows that there was a strong relationship between the driving forces and the lulc type these data indicated that the regression results are excellent and the regression coefficient from the driving forces was validated parameter for each lulc change is shown in table 4 for the sensitivity analysis of the lulc demand of the study area was analyzed by five demand scenarios and it already describe in previous section normal land use demand scenario was quantified based on the lulc change from 2010 to 2018 and the population growth analysis was based on census population growth rate from 1971 to 2011 of the kv population growth rate demand projection is overestimated and non realistic and half of the normal land use change growth was underestimated however normal land use change is more practical or realistic compared to the other as shown in fig 6 according to the five different scenarios described in the previous section the clue s model was used to project the lulc change in the kv among these scenarios normal land use change scenario was taken for further analysis as water body and restricted areas are not expected to change in all the scenarios lulc change was considered in agriculture and built up areas only simulated data from years 2010 to 2018 was used for the validation of the map and the forecasted data for year 2020 to 2050 is used for the analysis the generated map from the clue s model was validated through the kappa k coefficient the kappa coefficient of years 2014 2016 and 2018 was 0 75 0 64 and 0 62 respectively it showed that the analysis is of considerable accuracy the model assumed that the urban development is concentrated into the existing market and dense village but the practically development is scattered due to high cost of land and less open space in the existing market from the simulation of clue s from 2020 to 2030 forest water body and the restricted areas are not projected to change significantly but the agricultural land is projected to decrease dramatically from 40 11 to 33 44 within that decade average annual encroachment of the fertile land is projected to be 0 67 4 07 km2 by mostly built up area due to the construction of physical infrastructure meanwhile the built area of the kv is projected to increase by 6 85 within a decade which can be clearly seen in the map and appended table 5 and 6 as shown in fig 7 from the overall simulation model 2020 to 2050 agriculture and forest lands is projected to reduce by 20 4 125 05 km2 and 0 9 5 51 km2 of the total area respectively the total built area is projected to increase by 21 3 130 57 km2 of the total area within three decades half of the agriculture land of the kv is projected to shift into the urban area if the current level of urbanization continues as usual more fertile land might convert into a constructed area also the open space used as recreational area of the kv might decline in upcoming days the agricultural production will be decreased due to the loss of fertile land and increase the food deficiency meanwhile the groundwater recharge by the encroachment of potential groundwater recharge area would lower the groundwater table the encroachment of the open areas by the urbanization between 2010 2018 was 10 4 63 54 km2 of the total basin area the lulc map of the clue s model 2020 to 2050 clearly shows that 21 4 130 68 km2 of the open area is projected to change from fertile and permeable agriculture land to built up area 4 3 delineation of potential recharge areas under current and future scenario ten thematic layers were used for the ahp to find the paired comparison weights factor the grid value of each thematic layer was given by the pair wise comparison from 1 to 9 the consistency ratio cr of each thematic layer was less than 8 which indicates the analysis is consistent and the generated data from each layer was suitable for the future ahp analysis overall ten thematic layer analysis cr value 9 7 indicate that the pair wise comparison was more consistent saaty 2004 and the output weight age of each layer was more realistic comparison matrix of ahp and weights factor of each layer is as shown in table 7 matrix was generated from the experts view with the assumption that each layer influenced the rate of groundwater recharge form the analysis precipitation 28 91 is the main key factor for the groundwater recharge and the effect of geology 18 52 and land use 17 16 is relatively high bank of the river is mostly formed by the river deposition which has relatively high infiltration capacity and its weights factor 12 89 was also a major influencing parameter slope influences the contact time of runoff water and soil layer higher slope has high velocity and less recharge and vice versa by using gis and ahp weights factor the potential groundwater recharge area was identified as shown in fig 8 b for validation of the ahp generated potential groundwater recharge area by the actual field condition number of spouts 83 no were identified as per the geological hydro meteorological socio economical changes location every variation of the geological formation land use change in the location and change in the soil texture area is considered for the test point the location point must be free from an anthropogenic disturbance and it must be an open space for the field test double ring infiltrometer see for details lucke et al 2014 test was conducted in 83 different locations of the study area the overall location of the field test point is shown in the map fig 7c actual field raster map was prepared by the field test infiltration rate mm hr point and that was compared with the ahp generated map for the evaluation of ahp outputs due to lack of the information about litho logical moisture content water table soil density and so on actual recharge rate was not accurately quantified due to the variable grid value unit one infiltration value and other is unit less recharge factor statistically these maps could not be validated however from the inception of map and as shown in pervious literature pandey et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 adhikari et al 2019 foothill of the mountain and the alluvial part of the river corridor were most potential area groundwater potential area was computed using eq 6 and the output of the study area was categorized into six parts as per quintile mapping in arcgis area coverage of the very low low moderate low moderate high high and very high was 4 29 9 14 and 14 72 32 59 32 89 and 7 37 respectively of the total area coverage as shown in fig 8 currently high and very high areas are still in open area in the foot hill of northern and eastern part of mountain of the valley central part of the valley also has the potential recharge area but now it is mostly in concrete jungle northern and eastern part of the valley were more groundwater recharge potential zone and the peripheral boundary of the valley are less recharge potential due to high hill and geological formation from the comparison of the observation of field test map ahp method map and previous literature and maps pandey et al 2013 thapa et al 2018 adhikari et al 2019 potential recharge location may be a similar area the southern and northern foothill of mountain areas are the main possible recharge location of the kv if that potential area could be preserved and managed and artificial recharge system will be adapted which can overcome the water security situation of the kv in the future form the analysis the theoretically generated map from the different layers using mcdm techniques is realistic and useable for the location which has less groundwater recharge information like nepal 4 4 change in recharge areas under projected land use cover rapid urbanization mostly influences the groundwater recharge future encroachment of recharge area was identified by using ahp weights factor and the lulc map generated from the clue s model the projected future potential recharge zones are shown in fig 9 from the maps shown in fig 9 it can be observed that every decade the open area agriculture and forest land of the valley is projected to encroach by the urbanization from the data every decade on an average of 6 of open land is projected to decrease and each year 3 66 km2 of open land will change into the urban area the likely reason for not consistent trend across future time periods in table 8 is due to consideration of only one factor i e lulc whereas recharge areas are affected by various other factors as well such decrease will lead in the reduction of groundwater recharge reduction in groundwater leads to the lowering of groundwater table and base flow contributions in river basin in addition the rate of groundwater recharge will reduce over the time primarily due to the increment of the urban population and increases the volume of the water demand such reduction also effects in quantity and quality of water and other urban environments 5 conclusion a methodological framework has been developed and implemented in this study that helps to classify the lulc type identification of the potential recharge area possible protection of the agriculture land for the groundwater recharge and future possible encroachment in the groundwater recharge areas identification of the lulc the future projection of lulc and encroachment of recharge area generated in this study will be useful in effective urban planning optimal utilization of water supply demand and water resources planning and management the sum of the present study could be summarized in the following conclusions a the trend of past and present lulc analysis highlights that the agricultural land is projected to decrease by 6 51 leading to an increment of 4 96 in built up areas it is interesting to note that between 2010 2018 the forest area is found to be increased by 1 48 due to community forestry programs conversion of pervious recharge areas into impervious constructed areas would lead into the reduction of groundwater recharge as the increment of forest area does not necessarily contributes significantly into recharge b the predicted scenario between 2020 2050 using clue s model highlights that the built up area is projected to increase by 21 4 in the next 30 years and the agricultural and forest areas is projected to decrease by 20 5 and 0 9 respectively the results outline that the fertile lands would be converted into urban areas leading to the reduction in agricultural products and productivity lack of irrigation water may also be a crucial case which imparts additional pressure over the groundwater c precipitation geology land use cover distance from the river slope among others were identified to be the significant factors to contribute in delineation of potential groundwater recharge area for the ahp mcdm technique notably 7 37 of the total area was obtained to be the high recharge area 32 89 under high 32 59 moderately high 14 72 moderately low 9 14 low and 4 29 very low recharge areas the high and moderately high recharge areas are situated in the urban areas with greater tendency of expansion thus there might be the case that due to the lulc change more high to moderate recharge areas would be converted to urban areas leading to additional pressure on groundwater d future lulc change analysis highlighted that 6 3 99 km2 of rechargeable land area are projected to convert to impervious land in a decade as kathmandu valley is already facing water scarcity the urban expansion would put additional pressure leading to the graver water scarcity the application of clue s gis and ahp mcdm techniques are more realistic cost effective simple and reliable approaches and scientifically sound methods for the analysis the methodology used in the study area can also be used into other urban areas in the country as well as worldwide the findings from the study provide valuable information for decision makers planners and managers for the sustainable management of the land and water resources the impact of lulc on groundwater and surface water would ultimately affect the river runoff pattern to address this issue further analyses would be carried

significant component of the carbon budget vesterdal et al 2013 kindler et al 2011 siemens and kaupenjohann 2003 kindler et al 2011 found an average flux across land use systems of 19 4 4 0 g c m 2 yr 1 median 15 2 g c m 2 yr 1 and leaching increased the net losses from cropland soils by 24 105 median 25 however estimates of carbon leaching losses are few and their contribution to the net ecosystem carbon balance is uncertain kindler et al 2011 doc leaching into stream waters depends on the interplay of land to stream transfer processes seitzinger et al 2010 controlled by land use land cover lulc edaphic factors environmental factors temperature and rainfall atmospheric co2 and atmospheric nitrogen deposition and land management practices cultivation crop rotation and lime fertilizer and organic manure applications land use land cover refers to cover types e g forest or grassland and to management within a land cover type e g tillage fertilizer use shifting cultivation selective logging draining of peatlands use or exclusion of fire soils from different land covers are known to exhibit strong differences in their doc concentrations and exports worldwide conversions from forests to agricultural lands decrease soil organic carbon soc while afforestation restores soc stocks genxu et al 2002 guo and gifford 2002 degryze et al 2004 grünzweig et al 2004 dawson and smith 2007 maia et al 2010 in terms of carbon export agricultural land use tends to increase the concentration of both doc and suspended sediment merchán et al 2019 and loads oliveira et al 2011 ferreira et al 2016 agriculture alters the overall amounts of soil organic carbon available for export from a watershed post and kwon 2000 in agriculture dominated ecosystems where organic layers are small or totally missing due to regular ploughing there are few studies on doc leaching edaphic factors include soil texture total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and cation exchange capacity cec kalbitz et al 2000 soil structure and properties control doc leaching to groundwater and streamflow through basic flow and or overland flow soil doc is either bound to soil particles or is present as a soluble material in leached and runoff waters withers and lord 2002 increased soil ionic strength can reduce doc mobilization or partially increases doc though anions sulfate phosphates etc competition with doc for soil adsorption sites kalbitz et al 2000 more doc is released when so4 2 is present in concentrations 10 mmol l 1 or when it is more than no 3 at the same ph kaiser and zech 1998 ionic strength increased by the presence of polyvalent cations such as al3 fe3 ca2 or mg2 which reduce mobilization of doc in organic soils kalbitz et al 2000 climate alters the transport of soil dissolved organic carbon doc bellmore et al 2015 regnier et al 2013 stanley et al 2012 how much doc is transported into stream waters is determined by rainfall rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount intensity storage and water flow affect soil doc mobilization and leaching kalbitz et al 2000 found that soil doc leaching increases with high water fluxes after large rainfall events during high rainfall events doc leaching and dilution is high in organic horizons easthouse et al 1992 additionally rainfall and water fluxes are greatly responsible for changes in concentrations and fluxes of soil and stream doc doc transfer down soil profile or downslope with surface involves a number of hydrological and biochemical interactions the doc transfer begins with erosion governed by soil and hydrological factors soil structure and texture amount and intensity o rainfall and runoff velocity after erosion has occurred doc is transported into streams through various physical and biochemical mechanisms the latter include mainly the deposition of sediment adsorption of doc on to suspended sediment and doc assimilation by microorganisms regarding the effect of rainfall characteristics on soil doc increased rainfall is commensurate with higher decomposition davidson and janssens 2006 and thereby high soil doc a long contact time between water and organic matter allows more efficient microbial processing and vice versa lundquist et al 1999 when soils wet up soil doc concentrations increase mainly due to reduced microbial utilization of doc in dry periods enhanced turnover of microbial biomass condensation of microbial products by rewetting and disruption of soil structure which makes previously sequestered carbon more available as doc lundquist et al 1999 and therefore increases leached dissolved organic carbon ldoc the effects of rainfall are however influenced by soil structure and the hydraulic soil properties weigand and totsche 1998 climate change referring specifically to the resulting change in rainfall and temperature patterns is altering the transport of soil doc bellmore et al 2015 regnier et al 2013 stanley et al 2012 increased precipitation will increase doc mobilization depending on the amount and quality of soil organic matter som in the catchment temperature and the particular decomposer community that is present the rates of decomposition and solubilization of som generally increase with temperature along with the activity of microbial freeman et al 2001 and invertebrate cole et al 2002 populations of the produced doc a part is stored in soil and another transported via runoff and or by leaching through increased diffusion and transfer from topsoil to deeper soil horizons soil doc leaching may cause both soil and natural water degradation soil doc is linked with soil capacity to supply nutrients sucker and krause 2010 thus its export is associated with the depletion of soil nutrients leading to land degradation regarding natural water degradation high stream doc concentration can result in brown water and reduces light penetration in water with negative implications on aquatic productivity and thereby aquatic food chain erlandsson et al 2011 additionally high doc in water is coupled to nitrogen and phosphorus and induces eutrophication processes aparicio et al 2016 however a reasonable amount of water doc plays a key role in aquatic ecosystem function it is a potential source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic organisms and thus contributes significantly to aquatic ecosystem metabolism understanding the dynamics of soil and water doc is therefore important for effective integrated management of land and water resources for better use of these resources data on doc export can be used in consensus based decision making when searching for optimal efficiency and when aiming for the co existence of both uniformity and diversity dalling 2007 within soil and water systems some studies on doc dynamics have been conducted but most of them are focused on temperate watersheds and very few on tropical watersheds there is a need for such studies in tropical watersheds where coupled climate carbon cycle models indicate that soil carbon storage will potentially increase or decrease in tropical ecosystems depending on the particular conditions found in a given ecosystem soil carbon storage will increase in ecosystems where higher atmospheric co2 and increased precipitation will enhance plant photosynthesis and therefore root exudates that simulate microbial growth and activity on soil organic matter soil carbon storage will decrease in ecosystems with higher soil respiration rates associated with warming temperatures that dominate the above plant photosynthesis enhancement cox et al 2013 a key uncertainty is the degree to which tropical watersheds respond to climate driven changes in hydrology and doc export data on the response of tropical watersheds on doc export could help to develop effective integrated watershed policies that can build resilience to the impacts of climate and land cover changes and protect watershed services in tropical africa paeth et al 2009 indicated the dominance of positive trends of precipitation and that simulated changes until 2050 are consistent with internal variability also ecosystems in tropical africa have proven to be very sensitive to climate fluctuations paeth et al 2009 these climate fluctuations combined with a high level of land cover change occurring wasige et al 2013 may affect primary production soil doc storage and therefore leached doc in these ecosystems a simultaneous enhancement of plant photosynthesis under increased co2 and water use efficiency as a consequence of increased precipitation are expected to stimulate primary plant production freeman et al 2004 in fact plants need both co2 and water to produce organic matter from which doc is mobilized in contrast higher soil and plant respiration rates and the increased export of soil carbon through runoff and leaching will decrease soil doc nowadays sources and destinations of carbon fluxes from the land to water especially for dissolved organic carbon doc are still unclear yang et al 2013 thus there is a need to monitor doc flux via runoff and leaching under ongoing climate and land use land cover changes to investigate how soil doc may evolve under ongoing environmental change and to quantify carbon balance at both global and ecosystem scales better data on leaching could improve estimates of carbon budgets of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and our understanding of soil and inland carbon cole et al 2007 and can contribute to more effective and long term integrated management of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as doc export may cause both soil and natural water degradation this paper is aimed at quantifying topsoil doc leaching fluxes and identifying their potential implications for stream doc under ongoing climate and lulc changes in a data scarce area the paper specifically i determined topsoil ldoc flux in natural forests plantation forests tea plantations and croplands ii estimated the loss of topsoil doc through leaching compared to the net primary productivity of the watershed iii described the relationships between ldoc flux rainfall amount rainfall intensity runoff soil water storage capacity and stream doc and iv calculated annual ldoc flux from topsoil to deeper soil layers in the study area 2 material and methods the study was conducted in the rukarara river watershed rrw in rwanda within this study area we quantified topsoil doc leaching fluxes predicted their effect on loss of topsoil doc and stream doc and established relationships between leached doc and rainfall characteristics to understand how doc dynamics will evolve under ongoing changes in climate and land use land cover various datasets including leached doc fluxes ldoc stream doc rainfall soil texture total organic carbon net primary productivity npp and land use land cover map were used in this paper within the study area ldoc fluxes data were used for quantifying topsoil doc leaching fluxes within four main lulc classes natural forest plantation forest tea plantations and croplands and predicting the effect of soil doc leaching on stream doc under climate and lulc variability also ldoc fluxes data were examined to establish their relationships with rainfall and soil hydrological properties we think lulc rainfall characteristics and soil hydrological properties may affect ldoc fluxes within our study area a study area description and the methods used for collection and analysis of above datasets are presented in the following sections 2 1 description of the study area the study was conducted in the rukarara river watershed rrw whose area is 493 5 km2 and is located in the southwestern part of rwanda fig 1 the watershed is a high altitude region with elevation ranging from 1544 to 2924 masl the watershed has irregular slopes ranging from 0 to 68 includes a part of the nyungwe natural forest and contains plantation forests as well as annual and perennial crops plantation forests are replacing annual crops particularly in degraded soils where productivity has become very low such annual crops include for example common beans maize sorghum wheat and potatoes perennials are for example tea cassava and banana plantations plantation forests are mainly made of fast growth tree species such as eucalyptus sp and pinus sp farmers rotate groups of crops and intercrop others like common bean and maize regarding fertilizers farmers use mostly manure and few make use of mineral fertilizers especially for tea maize and potato crops wasige et al 2013 the rrw geology is mainly composed of precambrian rocks of granite quartzite and dolerite dowsett lemaire 1990 soils are mainly of the types acrisol alisol and cambisol fao 2007 three soil depth categories were identified within the watershed 0 5 m 34 53 0 5 1 m 58 18 and 1 m 7 29 the soils are acidic 3 ph 6 5 strongly leached and particularly vulnerable because of potentially damaging human activities gharahi ghehi et al 2012 such activities include overcultivation and cultivation on steep slopes and cause soil erosion the rrw climate is humid and cool with precipitation ranging from 1300 to 1450 mm per year and temperatures from 15 to 25 c the climate comprises four seasons spread throughout the year two dry seasons stretch from january to february and from july to mid september and two rainy seasons take place from mid september to december and from march to june two main types of storms occur in the area tropical cyclones and thunderstorms a tropical cyclone is a storm system with a closed circulation around a center of low pressure fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and condense these tropical cyclones are huge revolving storms moving in clockwise direction ngarukiyimana et al 2018 a thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates lightning and the attendant thunder it is normally accompanied by heavy precipitation ngarukiyimana et al 2018 tropical cyclones dominate at the eastern and center sites whereas thunderstorms dominate at the western site due to the presence of nyungwe forest which creates high humidity and atmospheric instability conditions in the area 2 2 data collection methods 2 2 1 rainfall data rainfall data were collected from november 2016 to may 2018 using a tipping bucket rain gauge with integrated data logger model omc 210 2 bucket size of 0 2 mm installed in the study area at three sites namely the western site ws centre site cs and eastern site es fig 2 rainfall data were used to calculate rainfall characteristics including rainfall amount mm and rainfall intensity mm hour rainfall amounts ra were calculated by the summation of all recorded rainfall during sampling periods rainfall intensity ri values were calculated by dividing the sum of rainfall amounts by the sum of durations hours of all individual rainfall events that have occurred during sampling period intervals an individual rainfall event is here defined as a period of rainfall with at least six preceding and six succeeding non rainfall hours wischmeier and smith 1978 transformed rainfall amount and intensity data were used to describe their relationship with ldoc flux in the study area rainfall amount and intensity data were transformed by quotient transformation qt r dębkowska and jarocka 2013 mean rainfall amount and intensity between sites were compared and their difference tested using the anova with post hoc test approach 2 2 2 leached doc fluxes leached doc samples were collected monthly at the above mentioned three sites in multiple plots 14 cm x 25 cm per site during rainy seasons occurring during the period from november 2016 to may 2018 plots were located in different lulc classes to distinguish between the effects of site and lulc on ldoc flux within the study area the sites were composed of cropland and patches of plantation forests for the es site croplands patches of tea plantation and plantation forests for the cs site and natural forest plantation forest and croplands for the ws site plots were distributed as follows 6 plots in the natural forest nf 6 plots in plantation forests pf 4 plots in tea plantations tp and 7 plots in croplands cl table 1 leached water was collected in plastic boxes 140 x 225 mm installed under the top 20 cm of the soil boxes were covered by a nylon mesh to retain the soil and were laterally installed in the soil with an effort made to minimize disturbance the volume of the leached water was measured using a graduated glass cylinder the leached water samples were transported in polyethylene bottles 25 ml on ice to the chemistry laboratory of the college of science of the university of rwanda for leached doc concentration analysis using a toc analyzer the ldoc flux was calculated as the product of the ldoc concentration and the leached water volume kindler et al 2011 mean leached doc fluxes per sampling campaign were calculated and used to describe the relationship of ldoc flux with rainfall amount and intensity and stream doc 2 2 3 soil properties data soil samples were collected in topsoil 0 20 cm at the ws cs and es sites to determine soil properties such as percent content of clay silt sand total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn twenty three samples were collected in plots close to ldoc sampling plots using soil sample 53 x 50 mm rings labelled by indicating plot code and geographical coordinates and transported to a laboratory for analysis of soil texture elements toc and tn the distribution of soil sampling plots per site is summarized in table 1 soil texture elements were analyzed in the laboratory using the improved bouyoucos method bouyoucos 1962 the toc was analyzed using the loss on ignition loi method davies 1974 and the tn by the micro kjeldahl digestion distillation method as described by bremner 1996 soil texture data were used to estimate soil porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d to characterize soil hydrological conditions of plots using the equations of saxton et al 1986 mean values soil properties were compared per site and per lulc also soil properties were used to describe their individual relationships with ldoc flux in the study area 2 2 4 stream doc we analyzed stream doc concentrations mg c l from stream water samples collected during the period spanning from november 2016 to may 2018 at three sites located in natural forest tea plantation and cropland land uses the samples were collected at a biweekly frequency in 25 ml polyethylene bottles transported on ice and stored in a fridge for two days in the chemistry laboratory of the college of science of the university of rwanda one milliliter of sulfuric acid h2so4 was added to each water sample immediately after collection to reduce the microbial activity before laboratory analysis in the laboratory stream water doc concentrations were analyzed with a toc analyzer the sieversinnovox laboratory toc analyzer from filtered stream water samples the latter were filtered using nylon membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm to remove both large particles and particulate organic carbon stream doc datasets were used to analyze to describe the relationship between stream doc concentration and ldoc to derive the impact of leaching on riverine doc content 2 2 5 spatial data spatial data include a land cover land use lulc classification map gridded net primary productivity npp and a 10 m digital elevation model 10 m dem of the study area lulc data were obtained from rizinjirabake et al 2018 and used to calculate curve number cn area and mean slope for each lulc class regarding npp we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod17a3 500 m 500 m data ornl daac 2018 running and zhao 2015 for the whole of rrw for the period from 2010 to 2014 npp data were used to estimate the loss of topsoil doc through leaching related to the net primary productivity of the watershed the dem was provided by the centre of geographical information system cgis of the university of rwanda ur 2 2 6 runoff and rainfall storage data potential surface runoff q data were calculated by the scs cn method usda soil conservation service 1972 a valuable and useful approach for computing the total volume of direct runoff grimaldi et al 2013 the method uses rainfall amount and curve number the latter is mainly based on the area s hydrologic soil group hsg land use treatment and hydrologic conditions the first two factors being the most important grimaldi et al 2013 hsgs refer to soil groups classified based on soil properties and easily estimate rainfall losses hsgs data are in four classes a b c and d corresponding to soils with low moderately low moderately high and high runoff potential respectively ross et al 2018 wet soils that have high runoff potential are assigned dual hsgs e g c d d d cn data were read in mockus handbook 1969 after a correspondence of lulc classes was developed between those found in the study area and those given in the handbook hsgs data were retrieved from the ornl daac hysogs250m ross et al 2018 the scs cn method is based on the water balance equation eq 1 and two fundamental concepts namely the proportional equality concept eq 2 and the ia s concept eq 3 mishra and singh 2002 1 p i a f q 2 p p i a f s 3 i a λ s where p is the total rainfall mm ia the initial abstraction f is the cumulative infiltration excluding ia q ie the direct runoff and s is the maximum retention or infiltration λ is the parameter viewed as a regional parameter depending on geologic and climatic factors lambda λ values vary between 0 and 0 3 but the existing scs cn method assumes λ equals 0 2 for practical applications mishra and singh 2002 rainfall storage f data were derived from eq 2 as follows 4 f p i a q the scs method is expressed as 5 q p 0 2 s p 0 2 s p 0 8 s p 0 2 s and q 0 p 0 2 s the parameter s is related to the cn by the scs equation usda soil conservation service 1972 eq 6 the method is appropriate for slopes less or equal to 5 as slopes are higher than 5 in the rrw an adjustment of s to high slopes was necessary the adjusted retention parameter s s2s was calculated using the williams et al 2006 method eq 7 6 s 254 100 c n 1 7 s 2 s s 1 1 s t p s t p exp 3 7 0 02117 s t p where s2s is the retention parameter adjusted for slopes higher than 5 stp is average slope of the watershed stp was calculated using esri s arcmap 10 5 1 from the 10 m dem of the study watershed trend lines between ldoc and q and f data for all sampled plots were developed to understand the effect of these rainfall characteristics on doc leaching in the study area cn values of different sampled plots were also used to calculate weighted cn wcn values for different lulc classes cn values were weighed with respect to the watershed area eq 8 as follows 8 w c n c n i a i a where cni is the cn value for interest lulc class ai the area of the lulc class and a the area of the watershed wcn values were used in turn to calculate q s2s and f values for cl tp pf and nf q and f values were compared in different lulc and the difference of their means tested using the anova with post hoc test approach 2 3 data analysis methods 2 3 1 statistical tests the anova with post hoc test approach and confidence interval tests were used for this study the anova with post hoc test approach often called the hsd honestly significant difference test is designed to make all pairwise comparisons while maintaining the experiment wise error rate at the pre established significance level hinkle et al 1998 the anova with post hoc test approach was used to test the statistical difference in ldoc fluxes between lulc classes and sites soil properties per sites and lulc rainfall characteristics means per sites confidence interval tests were used to test the significance of r2 values for the relationships between ldoc flux ra ri q and f 2 3 2 linear modelling linear regression models were used to describe the relationships between ldoc and various driving factors we used general linear models lm and linear mixed effects models lme lms assume linear relationships between dependent variables and each of the independent variables poole and o farrell 1971 lmes analyze fixed effects and random effects on basis of independent variables lme models are tools for modeling continuous correlated hierarchical data kuznetsova et al 2017 linear models lm were used to predict ldoc flux as a function of toc tn rainfall amount ra rainfall intensity ri runoff q and rainfall storage f in the study area the linear regression approach was used also to describe the relationship between ldoc flux and stream doc concentration to derive the impact of leaching on riverine doc content regarding q and f data their trend lines with ldoc were developed to understand effect of these rainfall characteristics on doc leaching and to predict ldoc flux under rainfall variability in the study area lms were developed using microsoft excel version 2010 and evaluated using r2 and mean absolute error mae the model with the highest r2 and lowest mae was preferred lme analyzed fixed effects and random effects on basis of sites east center and west and lulc lme models were fitted by the restricted maximum likelihood reml method which has the advantage of producing unbiased estimates of variance and covariance parameters liu et al 2017 lmes of ldoc flux were developed as a function of ra model 1 ri model 2 and ra and ri model 3 q model 4 f model 5 and both q and f model 6 using the rstudio software with the lme4 package performance of lmes was evaluated by using the akaike information criterion aic and mae aic is optimal for selecting a model with the optimal balance between minimal mean squared error and minimal complexity yang 2005 the model with the lowest aic and mae was preferred 3 results 3 1 ldoc flux per site mean ldoc fluxes were 30 28 14 62 16 66 4 60 and 18 91 4 69 mg c m2 month respectively at the ws cs and es sites the minimal ldoc fluxes were 14

results showed a statistically significant difference in leached doc fluxes at significance level of 5 between sites regarding the difference within groups of sites only ws and es are significantly different as indicated by tukey s hsd at p 0 05 3 2 ldoc flux and soil properties 3 2 1 soil properties per site and lulc a summary of the soil properties of the studied plots is presented in appendix a mean values of soil properties at the sampling sites and lulc and their corresponding standard deviations were summarized in table 2 mean toc was 15 90 6 67 4 64 1 96 and 6 50 2 50 whereas mean tn was 0 05 0 07 and 0 06 at the ws cs and es sites respectively mean values were 30 40 21 49 16 20 for the cec meq 100 g respectively at the ws cs and es sites regarding hydrological parameters mean

the ws site showed the highest toc content higher than the cs site p 0 05 and es site p 0 05 in contrast there was no significant statistical difference in toc content between cs and es sites regarding tn between sites the tukey hsd test showed a significant difference only between ws and wc p 0 05 the tukey hsd test indicated significant difference in cec mgeq between the ws and es sites p 0 05 and the ws and cs sites p 0 05 however no difference was observed for mean values of porosity saturated hydrological conductivity sand contents silt contents nor for clay content between sites considering the distribution of soil properties under lulc classes anova tukey hsd indicated no difference in clay silt ks and porosity between studied lulc classes the test indicated however significant difference at a significance level of 5 in sand between cl and pf p 0 05 in toc between nf and cl p 0 05 and tp p 0 05 in tn between nf and cl p 0 05 and tp p 0 05 and between pf and cl p 0 05 in cec between nf and cl p 0 05 and tp p 0 05 3 2 2 linear relationships between ldoc and soil properties individual relationships between ldoc flux and soil properties indicated that toc tn and cec explained 30 28 and 22 of the variation of ldoc flux in the rrw fig 3 the confidence interval test indicated that the coefficient of determination for the relationship between ldoc and toc was significant at the significance level of 5 0 01 r2 0 59 coefficients of determination between ldoc tn and cec were non significant at 5 there was no variation explained by estimated by soil texture elements porosity and saturated hydrological conductivity r2 values for the relationships between ldoc and these soil parameters were less than 1 and not considered for further analysis 3 3 ldoc flux

indicated that ldoc flux is significantly different between cl and pf p 0 05 cl and nf p 0 05 tp and pf p 0 05 tp and nf p 0 05 and pf and nf p 0 05 however the difference was not significant between cl and tp p 0 05 within sites high ldoc flux was observed under plantation forests at all sites whereas the lowest ldoc flux was observed within croplands fig 3b ldoc flux in plantation forests was 33 higher than in the natural forest and 69 higher than in croplands ldoc flux in the natural forest was 53 greater than that found in croplands the ldoc flux was statistically significant between the cropland and tree plantation found at the cs site p 0 05 at the es site p 0 05 and at the ws p 0 05 site at the significance level of 5 the difference in ldoc flux was also significant at the significance level of 5 between tea plantation and plantation forest at the cs site p 0 05 and at ws p 0 05 the difference was found to be statistically significant at the ws site between ldoc in natural forest and cropland p 0 05 between natural forest and tea p 0 05 and between natural forest and tree p 0 05 in contrast ldoc flux was not statistically different between cropland and tea plantation at the cs and ws sites at the significance level of 5 3 4 ldoc and rainfall characteristics 3 4 1 site rainfall characteristics during the study period from november 2016 to may 2018 recorded amounts of rainfall were 3050 40 2353 30 and 2308 60 mm respectively at the ws cs and es sites fig 5 a anova tukey hsd indicated a non significant difference in rainfall amount between sites 0 50 p 0 67 at a significance level of 5 mean rainfall intensities were 2 25 1 41 and 1 53 mm h respectively at the ws cs and es sites fig 5b the anova tukey hsd approach indicated a significant different ri between ws and cs p 0 05 and between ws and es p 0 05 at a significance level of 5 there was no difference in ri between cs and es p 0 05 3 4 2 ldoc rainfall amount and intensity a linear model indicated that rainfall amount and rainfall intensity explained respectively 7 and 23 of the variation of the ldoc flux in the study area fig 6 the trend line between ldoc and rainfall intensity had the best fit mae 7 82 mae for the trend line between ldoc flux and rainfall amount was 26 33 however the confidence interval test indicated that determination coefficients between ldoc fluxes ra and ri were non significant at significance level of 5 0 07 r2 0 38 lme models of ldoc flux as a function of ra model 1 ri model 2 and ra and ri model 3 were developed these three models include fixed effects of ra and ri and the random effect of lulc the analysis of performance of these models also indicated that ri showed also the best fit model of ldoc flux in the rrw table 3 characterizes the developed lme models 3 5 ldoc and soil water characteristics 3 5 1 potential rainwater runoff and storage in the rrw cn values and hsgs for all sampling plots were summarized in table 4 the analysis of the rrw hydrologic soil groups indicated that all plots at the ws site belonged to class c whereas plots in the cs belong to class d regarding the es site it has its plots distributed into classes c and d table 4 the analysis also indicated that plantation forest areas have the highest mean slope followed by the natural forest and the tea plantation areas the cropland areas showed the lowest mean slope the potential runoff was the highest in built up areas followed by plantation forest tea plantation natural forest and cropland areas regarding rainwater storage it was the highest in cropland areas followed by natural forest plantation forest tea plantation and built up areas table 5 3 5 2 relationship between ldoc flux rainfall runoff and storage the rainfall storage f in soil explained the highest variation of ldoc flux r2 0 14 in the study area the surface runoff q explained only 7 of the variation of ldoc flux r2 7 fig 7 however a confidence interval test indicated that the above r squared values were non significant at a significance level of 5 0 04 r2 0 36 results of lme models indicated that the rainwater storage f produced the best fitting model table 6 the aic of the lme models of ldoc flux as a function of q model 4 f model 5 and q and f model 6 was lowest for f the models include fixed effects of q and f and fixed effects of sites 3 6 ldoc flux from topsoil the total ldoc flux from topsoil to deeper soil layers during the period from november 12 2016 to may 22 2018 was 15 02 tonnes of carbon tc in the rrw this is to say that an annualized ldoc flux of 13 62 tonnes of carbon was observed considering lulc classes and their respective covered areas the pf showed the highest percentage 66 18 of ldoc loss to deeper soil layers followed by the nf 26 98 the total soil carbon stock was 0 90 mt table 7 the topsoil ldoc was approximately 0 5 of the annual npp and 0 02 of the soil carbon stock in the rrw 3 7 ldoc flux and stream doc the linear regression revealed a weak positive relationship between stream doc and ldoc flux in the study area during the period from november 2016 to may 2018 the coefficient of determination was 0 18 fig 8 but the confidence interval test revealed that the squared r is non significant at a significance level of 5 0 05 r2 0 41 4 discussion 4 1 ldoc flux variation between land use land cover types ldoc flux in plantation forests was 33 higher than in the natural forest and 69 higher than in croplands ldoc flux in the natural forest was 53 greater than in croplands the higher ldoc flux originating from plantation forest 33 than that from the natural forest can be explained by higher carbon stock content in plantation forest than that in natural forest wasige et al 2014 plantation forests are fast growing trees which are known to have relatively high carbon stocks the higher ldoc flux in plantation and natural forests than in croplands in the rrw can be explained by their high total carbon stock table 7 and the significant decrease of that carbon stock following land cover degradation from forest to fallow cultivated land andriamananjara et al 2016 powlson et al 2011 grünzweig et al 2004 degryze et al 2004 guo and gifford 2002 detwiler 1986 the carbon stock in plantation forest is in general twelve times greater than in croplands and three times greater than in the natural forest see table 7 additionally forests have a greater ldoc flux compared to croplands because they give time for rainwater to soak into the soil and to dissolve soil organic carbon and therefore high rainwater infiltration this high rainwater infiltration is enhanced by soil forest high permeability bathurst et al 2011 eisenbies et al 2007 due to their deep root systems hümann et al 2011 calvo cases et al 2003 these deep root systems of forests lead to important biopores that enhance water infiltration and associated doc in natural and plantation forests in the rrw and therefore higher doc leaching compared to other lulc classes these biopores in natural and plantation forests increase doc leaching and reduce surface runoff when forest soils progressively store rainwater biopores become more hydrologically active and transport more rainwater and associated doc from topsoil into deeper soil layers in contrast croplands in the rrw accelerate surface runoff with decreased ldoc flux 4 2 ldoc variation between sites the ws site showed the highest ldoc flux as compared to the cs and es sites this result is explained by the high toc content at the ws site as compared to other sites ldoc flux was found to be 55 correlated to toc at ws site table 2 the high ldoc flux at the ws site can also be associated with the high carbon stock present in the soil layer from 0 to 50 cm of depth wasige et al 2013 our findings can also be associated with differences in land cover types pardini et al 2017 the western site includes ldoc sampling plots located in the natural forest and in the plantation forest serving as the buffer zone to this natural forest high biomass produced by these natural and plantation forests and therefore important attendant soil carbon may explain higher ldoc at the ws site as compared to the cs and es sites don et al 2007 4 3 effect of rainfall characteristics on ldoc fluxes our results indicate that the variation of ldoc flux explained by rainfall amount rainfall intensity estimated rainwater storage and runoff was non significant at the significance level of 5 we expected that rainfall amount and intensity could have increased percolate volume under high intensity rainfall ma et al 2014 edwards et al 1992 detached soil doc adsorbed on soil complexes morgan 1977 van dijk et al 2002 and therefore increased ldoc flux in contrast rainwater soil storage capacity and runoff could have decreased ldoc flux in the rrw due to soil infiltrability eigel and moore 1983 with increased rainwater storage fine particles moved down the soil profile to 0 1 0 5 mm depth and accumulated clogging conducting pores decreasing infiltration water volume but generating more overland flow agassi et al 1981 with increased overland flow subsequent raindrop impacts could lift organic carbon progressively decreasing doc concentration in infiltration water and therefore ldoc flux bradford et al 1987 this failure to determine significant effects of rainfall amount rainfall intensity estimated rainwater storage and runoff on ldoc flux may be due to a relatively short rainfall sampling period 19 months and probable error in assigning cn values the variation of ldoc explained by both rainfall amount and intensity was not significant for the sampling period with a short sampling period there was a risk of lack of heavy rainfall capable of detaching soil doc adsorbed on soil complexes destroying these complexes ability to mobilize doc and therefore resulting in increased leached doc regarding errors in assigning cn values cn is a key parameter to estimate rainwater storage and runoff data and has variable components cn values are not a constant for a given watershed mccuen 2002 they vary with rainfall stewart et al 2012 but we used constant cn values from the mockus handbook 1969 after a correspondence of lulc classes was determined between those in the study area and those given in the handbook this may have caused errors in estimating rainwater storage and runoff the non significant relationships between ldoc rainwater storage and runoff may be due to such errors assigning cn values represents a level of risk for ungauged watersheds and has been problematic hawkins 1984 4 4 impact of ldoc flux on carbon dynamics in the rrw topsoil ldoc flux to deeper soil layers represents 0 5 of the annual npp and 0 02 of the soil carbon stock in the rrw these ldoc fluxes are too small to significantly affect the soil health of the rrw this low impact of leaching on topsoil carbon in the rrw can be associated with its steep slopes that reduce leaching flux in favor of overland flow rizinjirabake et al 2018 have indicated that the overland flow and quick flow contributed from rainfall were the most important flows in the rrw with respect to base flow in other words the contribution of leaching to stream doc is less important in the rrw the large proportion of stream doc comes from sources other than leached doc 4 5 topsoil ldoc flux and stream doc leached doc fluxes from topsoil may have an important effect on stream doc in fact doc leaching may contribute significant amounts of doc to stream waters with important impacts on watershed carbon budgets however for our study the relationship between topsoil ldoc fluxes and stream doc was non significant at a significance level of 5 this is in conformity with the results reported in rizinjirabake et al 2018 who found a small contribution of the baseflow to stream flow within the study area the weak relationship between topsoil ldoc fluxes and stream doc suggests that the ldoc effect on stream doc depends on deeper soil horizons to retain or transport water and associated dissolved matter the contribution of ldoc to stream doc will depend on flow through these horizons our results revealed a weak positive relationship between topsoil ldoc and stream doc this suggests that the transport of doc from the topsoil to the subsoil contributes to stream doc this could represent an important input of carbon into subsoils and therefore into natural waters important topsoil doc leaching may strongly contribute to the formation of stable soil organic carbon in deeper soil horizons and therefore to the increase of carbon stocks kalbitz and kaiser 2008 but this carbon storage in deeper soils is possible when ldoc interacts with soil minerals and is stabilized against microbial mineralization eusterhues et al 2014 5 conclusions and implications in this paper we investigated the potential effects of land cover land use and rainfall characteristics on ldoc flux the study also dealt with the impact of ldoc flux on stream doc and carbon budget in the study area the present study demonstrated that plantation forests followed by the natural forest have increased ldoc fluxes as compared to tea plantations and croplands plantation forests showed the highest percentage ldoc loss to deeper soil layers there is a risk that increased plantation forests will increase ldoc flux with implications for stream doc flux a linear weak positive relationship was observed between topsoil ldoc flux and stream doc in this study this implies that doc leaching makes a small contribution to stream doc most leached topsoil doc may be retained by deeper soil horizons with positive implications for carbon sequestration in soils this suggests that when considering the amount of doc that annually leaves topsoil through the leaching process an important proportion is sequestered in deeper soils this sequestration of soil organic carbon is important to climate change mitigation within the study area and similar ecosystems in contrast the loss of doc from topsoil may contribute to a decrease in soil productivity and encourage soil erosion and therefore increase doc in stream waters this increase of doc in streams may degrade water quality further research is needed to assess how increased stream doc is affecting water quality within the

soil organic matter som leaching of dissolved organic carbon doc and loss of particulates through mechanical clearing water and wind powlson et al 2011 detwiler 1986 in this paper we analyzed dissolved organic carbon doc losses due to leaching in a mixed agricultural and forested watershed doc leaching has important environmental and ecological consequences for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems dhillon and inamdar 2013 terrestrial ecosystems lose doc and plant nutrients with negative impacts on soil fertility and therefore crop productivity leached dissolved organic carbon ldoc may increase stream water doc levels with impacts on water quality metabolism nutrient uptake and growth of microorganisms stanley et al 2012 the leaching flux of soil doc can additionally be a significant component of the carbon budget vesterdal et al 2013 kindler et al 2011 siemens and kaupenjohann 2003 kindler et al 2011 found an average flux across land use systems of 19 4 4 0 g c m 2 yr 1 median 15 2 g c m 2 yr 1 and leaching increased the net losses from cropland soils by 24 105 median 25 however estimates of carbon leaching losses are few and their contribution to the net ecosystem carbon balance is uncertain kindler et al 2011 doc leaching into stream waters depends on the interplay of land to stream transfer processes seitzinger et al 2010 controlled by land use land cover

logging draining of peatlands use or exclusion of fire soils from different land covers are known to exhibit strong differences in their doc concentrations and exports worldwide conversions from

2007 maia et al 2010 in terms of carbon export agricultural land use tends to increase the concentration of both doc and suspended sediment merchán et al 2019 and loads oliveira et al 2011 ferreira et al 2016 agriculture alters the overall amounts of soil organic carbon available for export from a watershed post and kwon 2000 in agriculture dominated ecosystems where organic layers are small or totally missing due to regular ploughing there are few studies on doc leaching edaphic factors include soil texture total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and cation exchange capacity cec kalbitz et al 2000 soil structure and properties control doc leaching to groundwater and streamflow through basic flow and or overland flow soil doc is either bound to soil particles or is present as a soluble material in leached and runoff waters withers and lord 2002 increased soil ionic strength can reduce doc mobilization or partially increases doc though anions sulfate phosphates etc competition with doc for soil adsorption sites kalbitz et al 2000 more doc is released when so4 2 is present in concentrations 10 mmol l 1 or when it is more than no 3 at the same ph kaiser and zech 1998 ionic strength increased by the presence of polyvalent cations such as al3 fe3 ca2 or mg2 which reduce mobilization of doc in organic soils kalbitz et al 2000 climate alters the transport of soil dissolved organic carbon doc bellmore et al 2015 regnier et al 2013 stanley et al 2012 how much doc is transported into stream waters is determined by rainfall rainfall characteristics such as rainfall amount intensity storage and water flow affect soil doc mobilization and leaching kalbitz et al 2000 found that soil doc leaching increases with high water fluxes after large rainfall events during high rainfall events doc leaching and dilution is high in organic horizons easthouse et al 1992 additionally rainfall and water fluxes are greatly responsible for changes in concentrations and fluxes of soil and stream doc doc transfer down soil profile or downslope with surface involves a number of hydrological and biochemical interactions the doc transfer begins with erosion governed by soil and hydrological factors soil structure and texture amount and intensity o rainfall and runoff velocity after erosion has occurred doc is transported into streams through various physical and biochemical mechanisms the latter include mainly the deposition of sediment adsorption of doc on to suspended sediment and doc assimilation by microorganisms regarding the effect of rainfall characteristics on soil doc increased rainfall is commensurate with higher decomposition davidson and janssens 2006 and thereby high soil doc a long contact time between water and organic matter allows more efficient microbial processing and vice versa lundquist et al 1999 when soils wet up soil doc concentrations increase mainly due to reduced microbial utilization of doc in dry periods enhanced turnover of microbial biomass condensation of microbial products by rewetting and disruption of soil structure which makes previously sequestered carbon more available as doc lundquist et al 1999 and therefore increases leached dissolved organic carbon ldoc the effects of rainfall are however influenced by soil structure and the hydraulic soil properties weigand and totsche 1998 climate change referring specifically to the resulting change in rainfall and temperature patterns is altering the transport of soil doc bellmore et al 2015 regnier et al 2013 stanley et al 2012 increased precipitation will increase doc mobilization depending on the amount and quality of soil organic matter som in the catchment temperature and the particular decomposer community that is present the rates of decomposition and solubilization of som generally increase with temperature along with the activity of microbial freeman et al 2001 and invertebrate cole et al 2002 populations of the produced doc a part is stored in soil and another transported via runoff and or by leaching through increased diffusion and transfer from topsoil to deeper soil horizons soil doc leaching may cause both soil and natural water degradation soil doc is linked with soil capacity to supply nutrients sucker and krause 2010 thus its export is associated with the depletion of soil nutrients leading to land degradation regarding natural water degradation high stream doc concentration can result in brown water and reduces light penetration in water with negative implications on aquatic productivity and thereby aquatic food chain erlandsson et al 2011 additionally high doc in water is coupled to nitrogen and phosphorus and induces eutrophication processes aparicio et al 2016 however a reasonable amount of water doc plays a key role in aquatic ecosystem function it is a potential source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic organisms and thus contributes significantly to aquatic ecosystem metabolism understanding the dynamics of soil and water doc is therefore important for effective integrated management of land and water resources for better use of these resources data on doc export can be used in consensus based decision making when searching for optimal efficiency and when aiming for the co existence of both uniformity and diversity dalling 2007 within soil and water systems some studies on doc dynamics have been conducted but most of them are focused on temperate watersheds and very few on tropical watersheds there is a need for such studies in tropical watersheds where coupled climate carbon cycle models indicate that soil carbon storage will potentially increase or decrease in tropical ecosystems depending on the particular conditions found in a given ecosystem soil carbon storage will increase in ecosystems where higher atmospheric co2 and increased precipitation will enhance plant photosynthesis and therefore root exudates that simulate microbial growth and activity on soil organic matter soil carbon storage will decrease in ecosystems with higher soil respiration rates associated with warming temperatures that dominate the above plant photosynthesis enhancement cox et al 2013 a key uncertainty is the degree to which tropical watersheds respond to climate driven changes in hydrology and doc export data on the response of tropical watersheds on doc export could help to develop effective integrated watershed policies that can build resilience to the impacts of climate and land cover changes and protect watershed services in tropical africa paeth et al 2009 indicated the dominance of positive trends of precipitation and that simulated changes until 2050 are consistent with internal variability also ecosystems in tropical africa have proven to be very sensitive to climate fluctuations paeth et al 2009 these climate fluctuations combined with a high level of land cover change occurring wasige et al 2013 may affect primary production soil doc storage and therefore leached doc in these ecosystems a simultaneous enhancement of plant photosynthesis under increased co2 and water use efficiency as a consequence of increased precipitation are expected to stimulate primary plant production freeman et al 2004 in fact plants need both co2 and water to produce organic matter from which doc is mobilized in contrast higher soil and plant respiration rates and the increased export of soil carbon through runoff and leaching will decrease soil doc nowadays sources and destinations of carbon fluxes from the land to water especially for dissolved organic carbon doc are still unclear yang et al 2013 thus there is a need to monitor doc flux via runoff and leaching under ongoing climate and land use land cover changes to investigate how soil doc may evolve under ongoing environmental change and to quantify carbon balance at both global and ecosystem scales better data on leaching could improve estimates of carbon budgets of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and our understanding of soil and inland carbon cole et al 2007 and can contribute to more effective and long term integrated management of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as doc export may cause both soil and natural water degradation this paper is aimed at quantifying topsoil doc leaching fluxes and identifying their potential implications for stream doc under ongoing climate and lulc changes in a data scarce area the paper specifically i determined topsoil ldoc flux in natural forests plantation forests tea plantations and croplands ii estimated the loss of topsoil doc through leaching compared to the net primary productivity of the watershed iii described the relationships between ldoc flux rainfall amount rainfall intensity runoff soil water storage capacity and stream doc and iv calculated annual ldoc flux from topsoil to deeper soil layers in the study area 2 material and methods the study was conducted in the rukarara river watershed rrw in rwanda within this study area we quantified topsoil doc leaching fluxes predicted their effect on loss of topsoil doc and stream doc and established relationships between leached doc and rainfall characteristics to understand how doc dynamics will evolve under ongoing changes in climate and land use land cover various datasets including leached doc fluxes ldoc stream doc rainfall soil texture total organic carbon net primary productivity npp and land use land cover map were used in this paper within the study area ldoc fluxes data were used for quantifying topsoil doc leaching fluxes within four main lulc classes natural forest plantation forest tea plantations and croplands and predicting the effect of soil doc leaching on stream doc under climate and lulc variability also ldoc fluxes data were examined to establish their relationships with rainfall and soil hydrological properties we think lulc rainfall characteristics and soil hydrological properties may affect ldoc fluxes within our study area a study area description and the methods used for collection and analysis of above datasets are presented in the following sections 2 1 description of the study area the study was conducted in the rukarara river watershed rrw whose area is 493 5 km2 and is located in the southwestern part of rwanda fig 1 the watershed is a high altitude region with elevation ranging from 1544 to 2924 masl the watershed has irregular slopes ranging from 0 to 68 includes a part of the nyungwe natural forest and contains plantation forests as well as annual and perennial crops plantation forests are replacing annual crops particularly in degraded soils where productivity has become very low such annual crops include for example common beans maize sorghum wheat and potatoes perennials are for example tea cassava and banana plantations plantation forests are mainly made of fast growth tree species such as eucalyptus sp and pinus sp farmers rotate groups of crops and intercrop others like common bean and maize regarding fertilizers farmers use mostly manure and few make use of mineral fertilizers especially for tea maize and potato crops wasige et al 2013 the rrw geology is mainly composed of precambrian rocks of granite quartzite and dolerite dowsett lemaire 1990 soils are mainly of the types acrisol alisol and cambisol fao 2007 three soil depth categories were identified within the watershed 0 5 m 34 53 0 5 1 m 58 18 and 1 m 7 29 the soils are acidic 3 ph 6 5 strongly leached and particularly vulnerable because of potentially damaging human activities gharahi ghehi et al 2012 such activities include overcultivation and cultivation on steep slopes and cause soil erosion the rrw climate is humid and cool with precipitation ranging from 1300 to 1450 mm per year and temperatures from 15 to 25 c the climate comprises four seasons spread throughout the year two dry seasons stretch from january to february and from july to mid september and two rainy seasons take place from mid september to december and from march to june two main types of storms occur in the area tropical cyclones and thunderstorms a tropical cyclone is a storm system with a closed circulation around a center of low pressure fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and condense these tropical cyclones are huge revolving storms moving in clockwise direction ngarukiyimana et al 2018 a thunderstorm is a type of storm that generates lightning and the attendant thunder it is normally accompanied by heavy precipitation ngarukiyimana et al 2018 tropical cyclones dominate at the eastern and center sites whereas thunderstorms dominate at the western site due to the presence of nyungwe forest which creates high humidity and atmospheric instability conditions in the area 2 2 data collection methods 2 2 1 rainfall data rainfall data were collected from november 2016 to may 2018 using a tipping bucket rain gauge with integrated data logger model omc 210 2 bucket size of 0 2 mm installed in the study area at three sites namely the western site ws centre site cs and eastern site es fig 2 rainfall data were used to calculate rainfall characteristics including rainfall amount mm and rainfall intensity mm hour rainfall amounts ra were calculated by the summation of all recorded rainfall during sampling periods rainfall intensity ri values were calculated by dividing the sum of rainfall amounts by the sum of durations hours of all individual rainfall events that have occurred during sampling period intervals an individual rainfall event is here defined as a period of rainfall with at least six preceding and six succeeding non rainfall hours wischmeier and smith 1978 transformed rainfall amount and intensity data were used to describe their relationship with ldoc flux in the study area rainfall amount and intensity data were transformed by quotient transformation qt r dębkowska and jarocka 2013 mean rainfall amount and intensity between sites were compared and their difference tested using the anova with post hoc test approach 2 2 2 leached doc fluxes leached doc samples were collected monthly at the above mentioned three sites in multiple plots 14 cm x 25 cm per site during rainy seasons occurring during the period from november 2016 to may 2018 plots were located in different lulc classes to distinguish between the effects of site and lulc on ldoc flux within the study area the sites were composed of cropland and patches of plantation forests for the es site croplands patches of tea plantation and plantation forests for the cs site and natural forest plantation forest and croplands for the ws site plots were distributed as follows 6 plots in the natural forest nf 6 plots in plantation forests pf 4 plots in tea plantations tp and 7 plots in croplands cl table 1 leached water was collected in plastic boxes 140 x 225 mm installed under the top 20 cm of the soil boxes were covered by a nylon mesh to retain the soil and were laterally installed in the soil with an effort made to minimize disturbance the volume of the leached water was measured using a graduated glass cylinder the leached water samples were transported in polyethylene bottles 25 ml on ice to the chemistry laboratory of the college of science of the university of rwanda for leached doc concentration analysis using a toc analyzer the ldoc flux was calculated as the product of the ldoc concentration and the leached water volume kindler et al 2011 mean leached doc fluxes per sampling campaign were calculated and used to describe the relationship of ldoc flux with rainfall amount and intensity and stream doc 2 2 3 soil properties data soil samples were collected in topsoil 0 20 cm at the ws cs and es sites to determine soil properties such as percent content of clay silt sand total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn twenty three samples were collected in plots close to ldoc sampling plots using soil sample 53 x 50 mm rings labelled by indicating plot code and geographical coordinates and transported to a laboratory for analysis of soil texture elements toc and tn the distribution of soil sampling plots per site is summarized in table 1 soil texture elements were analyzed in the laboratory using the improved bouyoucos method bouyoucos 1962 the toc was analyzed using the loss on ignition loi method davies 1974 and the tn by the micro kjeldahl digestion distillation method as described by bremner 1996 soil texture data were used to estimate soil porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks cm d to characterize soil hydrological conditions of plots using the equations of saxton et al 1986 mean values soil properties were compared per site and per lulc also soil properties were used to describe their individual relationships with ldoc flux in the study area 2 2 4 stream doc we analyzed stream doc concentrations mg c l from stream water samples collected during the period spanning from november 2016 to may 2018 at three sites located in natural forest tea plantation and cropland land uses the samples were collected at a biweekly frequency in 25 ml polyethylene bottles transported on ice and stored in a fridge for two days in the chemistry laboratory of the college of science of the university of rwanda one milliliter of sulfuric acid h2so4 was added to each water sample immediately after collection to reduce the microbial activity before laboratory analysis in the laboratory stream water doc concentrations were analyzed with a toc analyzer the sieversinnovox laboratory toc analyzer from filtered stream water samples the latter were filtered using nylon membrane filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm to remove both large particles and particulate organic carbon stream doc datasets were used to analyze to describe the relationship between stream doc concentration and ldoc to derive the impact of leaching on riverine doc content 2 2 5 spatial data spatial data include a land cover land use lulc classification map gridded net primary productivity npp and a 10 m digital elevation model 10 m dem of the study area lulc data were obtained from rizinjirabake et al 2018 and used to calculate curve number cn area and mean slope for each lulc class regarding npp we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod17a3 500 m 500 m data ornl daac 2018 running and zhao 2015 for the whole of rrw for the period from 2010 to 2014 npp data were used to estimate the loss of topsoil doc through leaching related to the net primary productivity of the watershed the dem was provided by the centre of geographical information system cgis of the university of rwanda ur 2 2 6 runoff and rainfall storage data potential surface runoff q data were calculated by the scs cn method usda soil conservation service 1972 a valuable and useful approach for computing the total volume of direct runoff grimaldi et al 2013 the method

grimaldi et al 2013 hsgs refer to soil groups classified based on soil properties and easily estimate rainfall losses hsgs data are in four classes a b c and d corresponding to soils with low

s t p where s2s is the retention parameter adjusted for slopes higher than 5 stp is average slope of the watershed stp was calculated using esri s arcmap 10 5 1 from the 10 m dem of the study watershed trend lines between ldoc and q and f data for all sampled plots were developed to understand the effect of these rainfall characteristics on doc leaching in the study area cn values of different sampled plots were also used to calculate weighted cn wcn values for different lulc classes cn values were weighed with respect to the watershed area eq 8 as follows 8 w c n c n i a i a where cni is the cn value for interest lulc class ai the area of the lulc class and a the area of the watershed wcn values were used in turn to calculate q s2s and f values for cl tp pf and nf q and f values were compared in different lulc and the difference of their means tested using the anova with post hoc test approach 2 3 data analysis methods 2 3 1 statistical tests the anova with post hoc test approach and confidence interval tests were used for this study the anova with post hoc test approach often called the hsd honestly significant difference test is designed to make all pairwise comparisons while maintaining the experiment wise error rate at the pre established significance level hinkle et al 1998 the anova with post hoc test approach was used to test the statistical difference in ldoc fluxes between lulc classes and sites soil properties per sites and lulc rainfall characteristics means per sites confidence interval tests were used to test the significance of r2 values for the relationships between ldoc flux ra ri q and f 2 3 2 linear modelling linear regression models were used to describe the relationships between ldoc and various driving factors we used general linear models lm and linear mixed effects models lme lms assume linear relationships between dependent variables and each of the independent variables poole and o farrell 1971 lmes analyze fixed effects and random effects on basis of independent variables lme models are tools for modeling continuous correlated hierarchical data kuznetsova et al 2017 linear models lm were used to predict ldoc flux as a function of toc tn rainfall amount ra rainfall intensity ri runoff q and rainfall storage f in the study area the linear regression approach was used also to describe the relationship between ldoc flux and stream doc concentration to derive the impact of leaching on riverine doc content regarding q and f data their trend lines with ldoc were developed to understand effect of these rainfall characteristics on doc leaching and to predict ldoc flux under rainfall variability in the study area lms were developed using microsoft excel version 2010 and evaluated using r2 and mean absolute error mae the model with the highest r2 and lowest mae was preferred lme analyzed fixed effects and random effects on basis of sites east center and west and lulc lme models were fitted by the restricted maximum likelihood reml method which has the advantage of producing unbiased estimates of variance and covariance parameters liu et al 2017 lmes of ldoc flux were developed as a function of ra model 1 ri model 2 and ra and ri model 3 q model 4 f model 5 and both q and f model 6 using the rstudio software with the lme4 package performance of lmes was evaluated by using the akaike information criterion aic and mae aic is optimal for selecting a model with the optimal balance between minimal mean squared error and minimal complexity yang 2005 the model with the lowest aic and mae was preferred 3 results 3 1 ldoc flux per site mean ldoc fluxes were 30 28 14 62 16 66 4 60 and 18 91 4 69 mg c m2 month respectively at the ws cs and es sites the minimal ldoc fluxes were 14 30 9 69 and 12 494 mg c m2 month respectively at the ws cs and es sites the maximal ldoc fluxes were 74 11 25 38 29 88 mg c m2 month respectively at the ws cs and es sites anova with post hoc test results showed a statistically significant difference in leached doc fluxes at significance level of 5 between sites regarding the difference within groups of sites only ws and es are significantly different as indicated by tukey s hsd at p 0 05 3 2 ldoc flux and soil properties 3 2 1 soil properties per site and lulc a summary of the soil properties of the studied plots is presented in appendix

the ws site showed the highest toc content higher than the cs site p 0 05 and es site p 0 05 in contrast there was no significant statistical difference in toc content between cs and es sites regarding tn between sites the tukey hsd test showed a significant difference only between ws and wc p 0 05 the tukey hsd test indicated significant difference in cec mgeq between the ws and es sites p 0 05 and the ws and cs sites p 0 05 however no difference was observed for mean values of porosity saturated hydrological conductivity sand contents silt contents nor for clay content between sites considering the distribution of soil properties under lulc classes anova tukey hsd indicated no difference in clay silt ks and porosity between studied lulc classes the test indicated however

cec explained 30 28 and 22 of the variation of ldoc flux in the rrw fig 3 the confidence interval test indicated that the coefficient of determination for the relationship between ldoc and toc was significant at the significance level of 5 0 01 r2 0 59 coefficients of determination between ldoc tn and cec were non significant at 5 there was no variation explained by estimated by soil texture elements porosity and saturated hydrological conductivity r2 values for the relationships between ldoc and these soil parameters were less than 1 and not considered for further analysis 3 3 ldoc flux and lulc mean ldoc mg c m2 month was 38 04 5 97 27 75 11 08 14 61 6 18 and 11 82 4 91 respectively in the pf nf tp and cl fig 4 a anova with post hoc test applied at the significance level of 5 indicated that ldoc flux is significantly different between cl and pf p 0 05 cl and nf p 0 05 tp and pf p 0 05 tp and nf p 0 05 and pf and nf p 0 05 however the difference was not significant between cl and tp p 0 05 within sites high ldoc flux was observed under plantation forests at all sites whereas the lowest ldoc flux was observed within croplands fig 3b ldoc flux in plantation forests was 33 higher than in the natural forest and 69 higher than in croplands ldoc flux in the natural forest was 53 greater than that found in croplands the ldoc flux was statistically significant between the cropland and tree plantation found at the cs site p 0 05 at the es site p 0 05 and at the ws p 0 05 site at the significance level of 5 the difference in ldoc flux was also significant at the significance level of 5 between tea plantation and plantation forest at the cs site p 0 05 and at ws p 0 05 the difference was found to be statistically significant at the ws site between ldoc in natural forest and cropland p 0 05 between natural forest and tea p 0 05 and between natural forest and tree p 0 05 in contrast ldoc flux was not statistically different between cropland and tea plantation at the cs and ws sites at the significance level of 5 3 4 ldoc and rainfall characteristics 3 4 1 site rainfall characteristics during the study period from november 2016 to may 2018 recorded amounts of rainfall were 3050 40 2353 30 and 2308 60 mm respectively at the ws cs and es sites fig 5 a anova tukey hsd indicated a non significant difference in rainfall amount between sites 0 50 p 0 67 at a significance level of 5 mean rainfall intensities were 2 25 1 41 and 1 53 mm h respectively at the ws cs and es sites fig 5b the anova tukey hsd approach indicated a significant different ri between ws and cs p 0 05 and between ws and es p 0 05 at a significance level of 5 there was no difference in ri between cs and es p 0 05 3 4 2 ldoc rainfall amount and intensity a linear model indicated that rainfall amount and rainfall intensity explained respectively 7 and 23 of the variation of the ldoc flux in the study area fig 6 the trend line between ldoc and rainfall intensity had the best fit mae 7 82 mae for the trend line between ldoc flux and rainfall amount was 26 33 however the confidence interval test indicated that determination coefficients between ldoc fluxes ra and ri were non significant at significance level of 5 0 07 r2 0 38 lme models of ldoc flux as a function of ra model 1 ri model 2 and ra and ri model 3 were developed these three models include fixed effects of ra and ri and the random effect of lulc the analysis of performance of these models also indicated that ri showed also the best fit model of ldoc flux in the rrw table 3 characterizes the developed lme models 3 5 ldoc and soil water characteristics 3 5 1 potential rainwater runoff and storage in the rrw cn values and hsgs for all sampling plots were summarized in table 4 the analysis of the rrw hydrologic soil groups indicated that all plots at the ws site belonged to class c whereas plots in the cs belong to class d regarding the es site it has its plots distributed into classes c and d table 4 the analysis also indicated that plantation forest areas have the highest mean slope followed by the natural forest and the tea plantation areas the cropland areas showed the lowest mean slope the potential runoff was the highest in built up areas followed by plantation forest tea plantation natural forest and cropland areas regarding rainwater storage it was the highest in cropland areas followed by natural forest plantation forest tea plantation and built up areas table 5 3 5 2 relationship between ldoc flux rainfall runoff and storage the rainfall storage f in soil explained the highest variation of ldoc flux r2 0 14 in the study area the surface runoff q explained only 7 of the variation of ldoc flux r2 7 fig 7 however a confidence interval test indicated that the above r squared values were non significant at a significance level of 5 0 04 r2 0 36 results of lme models indicated that the rainwater storage f produced the best fitting model table 6 the aic of the lme models of ldoc flux as a function of q model 4 f model 5 and q and f model 6 was lowest for f the models include fixed effects of q and f and fixed effects of sites 3 6 ldoc flux from topsoil the total ldoc flux from topsoil to deeper soil layers during the period from november 12 2016 to may 22 2018 was 15 02 tonnes of carbon tc in the rrw this is to say that an annualized ldoc flux of 13 62 tonnes of carbon was observed considering lulc classes and their respective covered areas the pf showed the highest percentage 66 18 of ldoc loss to deeper soil layers followed by the nf 26 98 the total soil carbon stock was 0 90 mt table 7 the topsoil ldoc was approximately 0 5 of the annual npp and 0 02 of the soil carbon stock in the rrw 3 7 ldoc flux and stream doc the linear regression revealed a weak positive relationship between stream doc and ldoc flux in the study area during the period from november 2016 to may 2018 the coefficient of determination was 0 18 fig 8 but the confidence interval test revealed that the squared r is non significant at a significance level of 5 0 05 r2 0 41 4 discussion 4 1 ldoc flux variation between land use land cover types ldoc flux in plantation forests was 33 higher than in the natural forest and 69 higher than in croplands ldoc flux in the natural forest was 53 greater than in croplands the higher ldoc flux originating from plantation forest 33 than that from the natural forest can be explained by higher carbon stock content in plantation forest than that in natural forest wasige et al 2014 plantation forests are fast growing trees which are known to have relatively high carbon stocks the higher ldoc flux in plantation and natural forests than in croplands in the rrw can be explained by their high total carbon stock table 7 and the significant decrease of that carbon stock following land cover degradation from forest to fallow cultivated land andriamananjara et al 2016 powlson et al 2011 grünzweig et al 2004 degryze et al 2004 guo and gifford 2002 detwiler 1986 the carbon stock in plantation forest is in general twelve times greater than in croplands and three times greater than in the natural forest see table 7 additionally forests have a greater ldoc flux compared to croplands because they give time for rainwater to soak into the soil and to dissolve soil organic carbon and therefore high rainwater infiltration this high rainwater infiltration is enhanced by soil forest high permeability bathurst et al 2011 eisenbies et al 2007 due to their deep root systems hümann et al 2011 calvo cases et al 2003 these deep root systems of forests lead to important biopores that enhance water infiltration and associated doc in natural and plantation forests in the rrw and therefore higher doc leaching compared to other lulc classes these biopores in natural and plantation forests increase doc leaching and reduce surface runoff when forest soils progressively store rainwater biopores become more hydrologically active and transport more rainwater and associated doc from topsoil into deeper soil layers in contrast croplands in the rrw accelerate surface runoff with decreased ldoc flux 4 2 ldoc variation between sites the ws site showed the highest ldoc flux as compared to the cs and es sites this result is explained by the high toc content at the ws site as compared to other sites ldoc flux was found to be 55 correlated to toc at ws site table 2 the high ldoc flux at the ws site can also be associated with the high carbon stock present in the soil layer from 0 to 50 cm of depth wasige et al 2013 our findings can also be associated with differences in land cover types pardini et al 2017 the western site includes ldoc sampling plots located in the natural forest and in the plantation forest serving as the buffer zone to this natural forest high biomass produced by these natural and plantation forests and therefore important attendant soil carbon may explain higher ldoc at the ws site as compared to the cs and es sites don et al 2007 4 3 effect of rainfall characteristics on ldoc fluxes our results indicate that the variation of ldoc flux explained by rainfall amount rainfall intensity estimated rainwater storage and runoff was non significant at the significance level of 5 we expected that rainfall amount and intensity could have increased percolate volume under high intensity rainfall ma et al 2014 edwards et al 1992 detached soil doc adsorbed on soil complexes morgan 1977 van dijk et al 2002 and therefore increased ldoc flux in contrast rainwater soil storage capacity and runoff could have decreased ldoc flux in the rrw due to soil infiltrability eigel and moore 1983 with increased rainwater storage fine particles moved down the soil profile to 0 1 0 5 mm depth and accumulated clogging conducting pores decreasing infiltration water volume but generating more overland flow agassi et al 1981 with increased overland flow subsequent raindrop impacts could lift organic carbon progressively decreasing doc concentration in infiltration water and therefore ldoc flux bradford et al 1987 this failure to determine significant effects of rainfall amount rainfall intensity estimated rainwater storage and runoff on ldoc flux may be due to a relatively short rainfall sampling period 19 months and probable error in assigning cn values the variation of ldoc explained by both rainfall amount and intensity was not significant for the sampling period with a short sampling period there was a risk of lack of heavy rainfall capable of detaching soil doc adsorbed on soil complexes destroying these complexes ability to mobilize doc and therefore resulting in increased leached doc regarding errors in assigning cn values cn is a key parameter to estimate rainwater storage and runoff data and has variable components cn values are not a constant for a given watershed mccuen 2002 they vary with rainfall stewart et al 2012 but we used constant cn values from the mockus handbook 1969 after a correspondence of lulc classes was determined between those in the study area and those given in the handbook this may have caused errors in estimating rainwater storage and runoff the non significant relationships between ldoc rainwater storage and runoff may be due to such errors assigning cn values represents a level of risk for ungauged watersheds and has been problematic hawkins 1984 4 4 impact of ldoc flux on carbon dynamics in the rrw topsoil ldoc flux to deeper soil layers represents 0 5 of the annual npp and 0 02 of the soil carbon stock in the rrw these ldoc fluxes are too small to significantly affect the soil health of the rrw this low impact of leaching on topsoil carbon in the rrw can be associated with its steep slopes that reduce leaching flux in favor of overland flow rizinjirabake et al 2018 have indicated that the overland flow and quick flow contributed from rainfall were the most important flows in the rrw with respect to base flow in other words the contribution of leaching to stream doc is less important in the rrw the large proportion of stream doc comes from sources other than leached doc 4 5 topsoil ldoc flux and stream doc leached doc fluxes from topsoil may have an important effect on stream doc in fact doc leaching may contribute significant amounts of doc to stream waters with important impacts on watershed carbon budgets however for our study the relationship between topsoil ldoc fluxes and stream doc was non significant at a significance level of 5 this is in conformity with the results reported in rizinjirabake et al 2018 who found a small contribution of the baseflow to stream flow within the study area the weak relationship between topsoil ldoc fluxes and stream doc suggests that the ldoc effect on stream doc depends on deeper soil horizons to retain or transport water and associated dissolved matter the contribution of ldoc to stream doc will depend on flow through these horizons our results revealed a weak positive relationship between topsoil ldoc and stream doc this suggests that the transport of doc from the topsoil to the subsoil contributes to stream doc this could represent an important input of carbon into subsoils and therefore into natural waters important topsoil doc leaching may strongly contribute to the formation of stable soil organic carbon in deeper soil horizons and therefore to the increase of carbon stocks kalbitz and kaiser 2008 but this carbon storage in deeper soils is possible when ldoc interacts with soil minerals and is stabilized against microbial mineralization eusterhues et al 2014 5 conclusions and implications in this paper we investigated the potential effects of land cover land use and rainfall characteristics on ldoc flux the study also dealt with the impact of ldoc flux on stream doc and carbon budget in the study area the present study demonstrated that plantation forests followed by the natural forest have increased ldoc fluxes as compared to tea plantations and croplands plantation forests showed the highest percentage ldoc loss to deeper soil layers there is a risk that increased plantation forests will increase ldoc flux with implications for stream doc flux a linear weak positive relationship was observed between topsoil ldoc flux and stream doc in this study this implies that doc leaching makes a small contribution to stream doc most leached topsoil doc may be retained by deeper soil horizons with positive implications for carbon sequestration in soils this suggests that when considering the amount of doc that annually leaves topsoil through the leaching process an important proportion is sequestered in deeper soils this sequestration of soil organic carbon is important to climate change mitigation within the study area and similar ecosystems in contrast the loss of doc from topsoil may contribute to a decrease in soil productivity and encourage soil erosion and therefore increase doc in stream waters this increase of doc in streams may degrade water quality further research is needed to assess how increased stream doc is affecting water quality within the
