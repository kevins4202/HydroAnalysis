13745,the present study was designed to produce a new adsorption efficiency cost efficient and recoverable cementitous adsorbent fsc and study the removal and recovery of phosphorus p the result of langmuir isotherm revealed the maximum capacity is 46 8 mg g interference by competitive ions cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 was weak and p adsorption reached 95 of the optimum value in a wide ph of 3 0 7 0 the results of batch experiments sem eds xrd and ftir suggested that the adsorption of phosphate obviously facilitated the release of so4 2 from the fsc hydration products via so4 2 exchange and formation of metal p precipitates was the predominant p removal mechanism the column filtration results showed the number of bed volume before p breakthrough was 1564 2112 and the effluent ph stabilized at 8 0 the p loaded fsc was used to cultivate ipomoea aquatica forsk in the hydroponic boxes the sample plant dry weight using adsorbed fsc as p source was 0 40 0 41 0 05 g which was dramatically increased comparing with the non p source samples 0 19 g 0 07 g our present study firstly employed the sulfoaluminate cement based material for eutrophic water remediation and presents a comprehensive study combining p removal mechanisms influencing factors and application insights gained from adsorption mechanisms and p recovery approach can further our understanding on the practical application of fsc keywords sulfoaluminate cement phosphate recycle precipitation adsorption 1 introduction excessive phosphorus p leads to the rampant growth of bacteria and algae which deplete oxygen levels and deteriorate the quality of the aquatic ecosystems resulting in environmental as well as economic damage 1 2 on the other hand as a non renewable natural resource that cannot be substituted with other sources the natural source of p is dwindling and geopolitically imbalanced 3 4 up to present a variety of materials have been evaluated for phosphate removal including natural minerals e g mineral zeolite rock and crab shell 5 7 industrial byproducts e g steel slag fly ash and waterworks sludge residuals and artificially synthesized products e g organic polymer adsorbents biochar and ceramsite 8 9 however the direct use of raw materials will have shortcomings such as small adsorption capacity poor mechanical strength and low chemical stability on the other hand the high costly of specifically synthesized adsorption materials makes its implement challenging several adsorbents mentioned above for example the powdered materials carbon based composites and natural mineral etc and the materials with poor swelling property may cause secondary pollution due to the difficulty of solid liquid separation sulfoaluminate cement sc has been widely used in architecture due to its early strength low alkali and less co2 release characteristics in recent years 10 11 it contains elements including ca oxides 36 43 al oxides 28 40 and fe oxides 1 3 11 which opens up the possibility of adsorption and precipitation of p in the process of sc hydration the amorphous calcium silicate hydrate and aluminum hydroxide are generated which have been used to remove heavy metal ions such as cr iii pb2 and cd2 12 13 concrete fabricated with sc and bottom ash aggregates was testified can remove 70 of the dissolved p however the implementation of the sc cement was inhibited by the clogging effect 14 the cement and concrete waste were also employed for phosphate removal and the mechanism involved was formation of the ca3 po4 2 precipitate according to ion exchange 15 after 1073 k calcination high phosphate adsorption capacity could be achieved by adding alunite to cement 16 another study showed that p can be effectively removed by the cement bound ochre pellets waste due to the formation of calcium phosphate precipitate with the release of ca2 in solution 17 however the lack of functional groups with positive charge in cement based materials limits their application in comparison to commercial adsorbents phosphorus adsorption can usually be achieved via long electrical interaction force firstly hence metal cations e g iron salts manganese salts and aluminum salts attract much attention because of their high point of zero charge and rich surface functional groups 18 several studies reported enhanced phosphate removal was considered due to the facilitated generation of fe iii through oxidation of fe ii in the presence of feso4 19 and fecl2 20 to date most previous studies were focused on the cement based demolition waste modification and its utilization 21 22 limited research is available on the comprehensive study of p removal mechanisms influencing factors and practical application with cement based materials meanwhile few studies involved modification of the cement based materials it is of great significance to establish such knowledge system for p removal and recovery from natural waters the objective of this study was to develop a new adsorption efficiency low cost and recoverable sc based material for p removal in order to improve the p adsorption capacity ferrous sulfate 7 4 mass weight was added to sc materials to increase adsorption sites in addition the adsorption mechanism and application prospect of p on fe loaded sulfoaluminate cement fsc were studied comprehensively interactions of p on the present adsorbent were studied and compared in batch and fix bed conditions which should improve our knowledge in p immobilization from natural waters to discuss the possibility of p recovery and utilization the adsorbed materials were used as the p source to cultivate ipomoea aquatica forsk 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent preparation and characterization 2 1 1 materials used in this study

coexisting ion solutions were prepared from anhydrous kh2po4 and their corresponding sodium salts in deionized water 18 2 mω 5 g l of sulfuric acid was added to ensure stability other standard phosphate solutions were prepared by diluting this stock solution fsc used in this study was synthetized with sulfoaluminate cement 42 5 as the binder with a water binder ratio of 0 32 the compositions of raw materials for fsc synthesis are shown in table s1 four kinds of materials were chosen as control including sc sc doped with zeolite sc doped with feso4 and iron oxide the iron oxide was prepared by dropping 0 1 m naoh into 1 m feso4 solution 23 the other three materials are obtained by replacing its components in fsc with sc on equal mass ratio all components were stirred by 1 5 min of slow stirring followed by 1 5 min of rapid stirring in a mortar jj 5 wuxi jianyi instrument machinery co ltd china after 3 h the product was dried at 45 c for 12 h the fsc mortar was then ground and sieved to a maximum grain size of 200 mesh before all experiments the mixtures were molded into a cube of 10 0 cm 10 0 cm 10 0 cm to test its compressive strength the compressive strength and setting time of concretes were measured according to the gb t 50081 2002 standard 24 2 1 2 characterization the physicochemical properties and the microstructure of the fsc and fsc p were

malvern instruments uk 2 2 adsorption experiments 2 2 1 batch experiments phosphate adsorption behavior of fsc was investigated by batch adsorption all experiments were carried out at 25 c in 150 ml conical flasks at a shaking rate of 200 rpm for 48 h in triplicate molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method was used to determine the phosphate concentration of each solution 25 the ph of each solution was analyzed with a mettler toledu s210 k instrument mettler switzerland to study the effect of initial solution ph to phosphate removal suspension samples containing 40 mg l phosphate and 1 g l fsc were adjusted to desired ph values in the range 2 12 with naoh and hcl after the samples were mixed in a constant temperature shaking table for 48 h the final ph was measured and the suspension was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter for soluble metal measurements during phosphate adsorption the secondary hydrolysis in fsc will release hydroxyl groups resulting in the increase of ph to study the ph effects to phosphate adsorption and fsc hydration stationary ph dependent experiments were carried on during which the ph values 3 0 8 0 of all batch samples were adjusted and fixed throughout the reaction in addition other experimental conditions are the same as the previous ph dependent experiments the interferences of the coexisting anions were also investigated by addition of nacl nano3 na2so4 or nahco3 0 01 mol l to 40 mg l phosphate solutions for the adsorption kinetic experiments 1 0 g l fsc was added to solutions containing initial phosphate concentrations of 40 80 and 120 mg l phosphate concentrations were analyzed at appropriate times both the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models were used to clarify the adsorption kinetics of phosphate on fsc to study the adsorption capacity of fsc the adsorbents were added to solutions with initial phosphate concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 mg l the adsorption isotherm data was simulated by langmuir and freundlich equations 26 details of kinetic and isotherm modeling related parameters and chemical calculations and bjh results fig s1 and table s2 were reported in the supplementary materials 2 2 2 risk evaluation of harmful component release fsc 1 g was added to a beaker containing 1 l of deionized water and preserved for 2 weeks at room temperature according to the actual project situation the concentrations of harmful heavy metals in solution were monitored by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific usa 2 3 column filtration experiments experiments were conducted with a glass column of 2 0 cm in internal diameter and 20 0 cm in height fig s2 the solutions were flowed through the fixed bed filtration column from bottom to top with a peristaltic pump the experimental conditions was a bed depth of 7 6 7 5 and 15 2 cm a flow rate of 1 0 0 1 ml min an initial solution ph of 5 0 7 0 and 9 1 and an initial phosphate concentration of 20 mg l the ph of the effluents after adsorption was recorded periodically to monitor any changes that might occur during the adsorption the phosphate concentration of the effluent was determined with a smartchem 200 automatic chemical analyzer ams westco italia a schematic view of the experimental set up is presented in fig s2 at last p laden fsc after column experiment was dried and sieved for characterization test including xrd and ftir 2 4 breakthrough curve data calculation ct c 0 mg l was plotted against t min to attain the breakthrough profile where t is the time c0 represents the influent phosphate concentration and ct denotes the effluent concentration the point of column breakthrough and exhaustion was 10 ct c 0 10 and 90 ct c 0 90 of the influent phosphate concentration respectively 2 5 application of the adsorbed fsc 0 1 g recovered fsc was added in 150 ml conical flask with 100 ml di water with ph values of 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 respectively for testing the feasibility of phosphate loaded composite as a phosphate fertilizer substitute a hydroponic experiment was carried out based on a procedure previously described by park et al 27 the variety of spinach used in the experiment was ipomoea aquatica forsk which was purchased from yanjiang third road market haikou china plants were then acclimated in hydroponic tanks 38 5 27 14 cm containing 6 l of 0 2 strength 0 2x hoagland solution see table s3 for component content for 3 days then randomly selected plants and quantitative fsc p powder were cultured with whole nutrient solution and 12 plants per tank four treatments were performed in the test according to preliminary experiments and calculations of the adsorption capacity data 1 ck1 hoagland solution 2 ck2 hoagland solution without phosphorus source kcl insteads of kh2po4 3 t1 5 g l recovered fsc in ck2 4 t2 10 g l recovered fsc in ck2 the solution was adjusted to ph 5 5 using diluted hcl or naoh stirred daily and renewed weekly to determine the dry biomass plants were grown in the nutrient solutions for 14 d harvested washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in an oven at 60 c to a constant weight after 30 min at 105 c 28 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of fsc for the perspective of engineering application sulfoaluminate cement sc was used to ensure the compressive strength at the early age of curing the main constituents of the sc are ye elimite c4a3 and calcium sulfoaluminate phase whereas those of ordinary portland cement opc are ccalcium aluminate c3a alcium silicate c3s and c2s and ferrite c4af 29 the ye elimite c4a3 in the sc is a key component which forms the ettringite at an early age of curing accelerating the strength development of the concrete 30 the preparation process of fsc is shown in fig s3 and the chemical composition and physical properties of fsc are shown in table 1 the performance of fast mechanical strength and proper setting time is crucial for the practical application of fsc considering the property of phosphate adsorption feso4 and zeolite was added in sc the results from fig s4 revealed that the addition of iron salt promoted the adsorption rate and adsorption capacities of phosphate adsorption with the addition of iron oxides the adsorption equilibrium time of sc decreased from 45 h sc to 20 h fsc moreover the phosphate adsorption capacities increased from 29 72 mg g sc to 34 12 mg g fsc the addition of iron oxide provides a large number of adsorption sites which makes the concentration of phosphorus on the surface of fsc increase rapidly and precipitate with cations such as ca2 and al3 the characteristics of early strength and good impermeability of sulfoaluminate cement are due to its higher compactness which also hinders the adsorption process of phosphate zeolite has received widespread attention as an adsorption material due to its high specific surface area 31 the addition of zeolite during material preparation can increase the specific surface area and porosity of fsc moreover among many researches on the phosphate precipitation by fe iii applications of the newly generated fe iii through the oxidation of cheaper fe ii have received much attention due to the higher efficiency and lower cost than direct using fe iii 32 it was more interesting to note that the slowly generated fresh ferric compositions demonstrated high capacity for phosphate removal without the concern of evident formation of oxyhydroxide to weaken its capacity 19 regarding phosphorus recovery diverse researches on phosphate removal are divided into two types the struvites precipitation and calcium phosphate cp precipitation struvites precipitation process can simultaneously recover n and p but it is invalid in the absence of nh4 in solution thus the role of ca2 sources materials in political and academic communities has received much attention in recent years additionally cementitious materials contain many essential macronutrients p k ca mg micronutrients fe mn and b and some beneficial elements si na for plant growth which benefits in agricultural management 33 the high cement content of fsc 66 5 provides the possibility of reuse of dephosphorus adsorbent fsc p could be purified and further used in manufacture of detergent emulsifier fertilizer etc above all a sulfoaluminate cement based material was synthesized for its potential for phosphate removal application and recovery 3 2 adsorption capacity of phosphate by fsc in batch and column tests in the batch experiment adsorption process of fsc on po4 3 was more accurately described by the elovich equation where values of r2 were greater than 0 960 fig 1 and table s5 therefore it can be concluded that the adsorption system can be a chemical process such as an ion exchange process 38 elovich s equation has been widely used for the adsorption of pollutants in wastewaters 39 the phosphate adsorption process reached equilibrium after 48 h fig 1 the phosphate adsorption percentage reached approximately 70 of the equilibrium value after 24 h the slow kinetics suggests that other phosphate removal mechanisms besides adsorption such as the formation of surface precipitates have occurred 40 combining with the xrd and edx results figs 2 3 p facilitated dissolution of calcium sulfate caso4 caso4 2h2o in the hydration products of sulfoaluminate cement subsequently the aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate were formed the dissolution precipitation process often requires longer equilibrium time than adsorption which is in accordance with the experimental results 41 42 the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were employed to describe phosphate adsorption behaviors on fsc fig 1 comparing with the freundlich isotherms r2 0 686 0 825 fig 1 and table s6 our experimental data were in good agreement with the langmuir isotherms r2 0 952 0 977 the maximum p adsorption capacity qm at 25 c obtained from the langmuir isotherm data is 46 8 mg g which is superior to some of the reported values for other cementitious materials table 2 comparing with dynamic adsorption experiment the exhaustion adsorption capacity qe was 14 48 21 28 mg p g table s7 which was lower than the maximum capacity in the batch experiments 46 80 mg g the reason is that more sufficient contact between the powdered adsorbent and the adsorbate in the batch tests it is easier to enter the inside of fsc and improve the adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity in the flasks 3 3 fsc characterization and its adsorption mechanisms the ftir spectra before and after adsorption indicated the reactions of p with the newly generated oxyhydroxides processed fig 2 a and characteristic bands of fsc were showed in table s8 previous study indicated vibrations at 1116 cm 1 can be assigned to the so in so4 2 43 as the result of p adsorption the peak at 1116 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of gypsum obviously attenuated after p adsorption both in batch and column samples suggesting exchange reactions of p with the so4 2 the characteristic peaks of carbonate appeared respectively for each samples which was from reaction between ca oh 2 in cement and the atmospheric co2 the carbonates phases were confirmed as caco3 in the results of xrd fig 2 and table s8 notably obviously strengthened and widened band at 1028 cm 1 for p adsorption on fsc could be attributed to the typical characteristic of the asymmetric stretch vibration of po 44 especially in column test implying the metal o p binding between phosphate and fsc similar results were also observed when p adsorption on zr go alg and zr o p was formed 45 after fsc were reacted with phosphate the strength of al o stretching vibration at 557and 683 cm 1 decreased but still could be observed which confirmed the involvement of al o or ca o bonds in phosphate adsorption 46 this result can be verified by the formation of alpo4 and calcium phosphate ca2p2o7 in xrd fig 2 the xrd fig 2b and sem edx fig 3 results testified formation of metal p precipitates surface precipitates on fsc the sem images and elemental compositions of fsc before and after p adsorption are employed to study the changes of morphology on fsc fig 3 10 000 sem results showed that there were holes cave type diameters 5 20 μm and grid openings on the surface of the fsc which would increase the specific surface area available for adsorption different sizes of rhombohedra columnar and block flocculation aggregates are found on the surface of fsc before adsorption the high cement content of fsc combined with the eds and xrd results suggests that the components before p adsorption are mostly composites of sulfoaluminate cement including ye elimite gypsum and calcium carbonate study to show the crystal structure of main products of sulfoaluminate cement sc contains columns and channels parallel to the hexagonal prisms and the h2o molecules and so4 2 groups gathered in the channels several studies indicated that sulfoaluminate cement based material is able to adsorb multiple ions under the help of ca2 al3 and so4 2 in the columnar and channels 47 after p adsorption the s element was not detected in the eds results whereas there was about 5 s element in the fsc absorbent before adsorption fig 3 moreover the caso4 and caso4 2h2o crystalline phases detected in the fsc absorbent disappeared after p adsorption fig 2 and the intensity peak representing for alpo4 at 2θ 22 1 was generated it can be inferred that the addition of p in solution could promote dissolution of calcium sulfate caso4 and caso4 2h2o ksp 3 14 4 93 10 5 instead the more insoluble contents of alpo4 ksp 9 84 10 21 and ca2p2o7 ksp 3 0 10 18 were formed that is to say sulfate was substituted by phosphate and dissolved in solution which is the reason why the s element was not detected in the eds results furthermore the above mechanism can also explain the inhibitory effect of sulfate ions on phosphate adsorption fig 4 c besides of the anion competing effects so4 2 in solution inhibits dissolution of caso4 and caso4 2h2o and reduced the formation of alpo4 this phenomenon is similar to that of the calcium rich slags used in phosphate removal 48 additionally it can be seen from the comparison between the short term batch and the long term column results that the disappearance of ye elimite as the main component of sc during the early hydration period was inferred to the more accumulation of ca p and al p precipitates or its conversion to monosulphoaluminate with no obvious crystal phase 49 in short the p adsorption mechanisms can be attributed to 1 adsorption on iron oxides and the newly formed calcium aluminum oxyhydroxides of fsc and 2 subsequently the adsorbed p can form ca al p precipitates with ca2 or al3 in fsc the occurrence of metal p precipitates would increase the phosphate adsorption capacities and lower the mobility of adsorbed p this hypothesis has been supported by the zn cd as v co precipitation on goethite samples with reduced leachability in previous studies 50 similarly the adsorption and surface precipitation of as iii with fe ii iii could dramatically reduce the solubility of as iii under anoxic conditions 51 3 4 interference of treatment conditions 3 4 1 impacts of coexisting ions and solution ph p removal from natural waters can be enhanced or inhibited in the presence of coexisting ions for example anions such as silicate and bicarbonate could strongly compete with p adsorption and precipitation whereas cations including calcium iron and magnesium have positive effects 52 the influence of coexisting ions such as sulphate chloride and nitrate on the phosphorus adsorption capacity of fsc was investigated fig 4c results testified that there were no obvious influences of cl and no3 to phosphate adsorption capacities resulting from adding 0 01 m of these anions into 40 mg l phosphate solution suggesting that fsc is highly selective for phosphate adsorption and removal from solution with the additions of so4 2 and hco3 the phosphate removal percentages decreased from 83 5 64 9 and 60 2 respectively the decreased phosphate removal could be attributed to the competitive adsorption between anions or to the formation of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate which were occupied with the calcium and could be combined with phosphate 53 as a result of phosphate adsorption the negative charge on the surface of fsc increased which is consistent with the mechanism of anion adsorption the point of zero charge pzc shifted from 5 8 for pristine fsc to approximately 3 1 upon p adsorption fig 4a indicating the formation of negatively charged inner sphere complexes on fsc 54 the interference of initial solution ph to phosphate adsorption was investigated by the ph dependence experiments results showed that p removal on fsc maintained from 29 4 32 0 mg g with initial ph increasing from 3 0 to 8 0 fig 4b regardless of the initial ph values the final ph values of the adsorption samples were stable at 8 1 8 3 fig 4b the h2po4 and hpo4 2 as the predominant p forms in the present ph range would not cause a sharp rise in ph due to adsorption especially from the initial ph 3 0 to the final equilibrium ph 8 1 therefore other p adsorption mechanisms besides adsorption such as the hydrolysis of metal oxides and the formation of metal p fsc surface complexes precipitates also play an important role the steady increasement of ph from 3 0 7 0 to 8 1 8 3 fig 4b can be explained by the incomplete hydrolysis of cao and al2o3 in sulfoaluminate cement table 1 during the fsc synthesis process eq 1 the finding is consistent with previous stydies 34 55 1 mx oy yh 2 o xm 2 y x 2 y o h during phosphate adsorption the secondary hydrolysis in fsc will release hydroxyl groups resulting in the increase of ph eq 1 to study the ph effects to phosphate adsorption and fsc hydration the stationary ph dependent experiments were carried on fig s6 the ph dependence experiments showed that the phosphate adsorption decreased from 38 91 mg g to 28 45 mg g as ph increasing from 4 0 to 8 0 which is consistent with the previous results 56 57 the ph value of the solution is an important factor affecting phosphorus removal on the one hand it affects the form of phosphorus and on the other hand it affects the surface charge of the fsc and the release of metal ions such as ca2 and al3 the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity is of 38 91 mg g at ph 4 0 and then decreases with the increase of ph values at ph 4 8 h2po4 and hpo4 2 are the predominant phosphate forms which can be easily adsorbed on metal oxides comparing with the h3po4 ph 3 and po4 3 ph 12 due to the electronic effects 58 at ph 3 the neutral h3po4 molecules could hardly adsorb on metal oxides nor precipitate with cations via so4 2 exchange at ph 8 0 two factors are adverse to phosphate adsorption firstly the predominant form of phosphate is hpo4 2 which is difficult to adsorb on the negatively charged iron oxides fig 4a secondly hydrolysis reactions of cao and al2o3 are difficult to carry out under alkaline conditions eq 1 as a result less hpo4 2 could precipitate with ca2 and al3 via so4 2 exchange in addition as a function of hydrolysis ca2 and al3 dissolved in the liquid phase and p can be complexed with the dissolved free cations with the increasing of complex amounts and time complexes the ca p al p surface precipitates were formed which is consistent with a previous study 59 moreover oxyhydroxides would be formed due to the hydrolysis of cao and al2o3 eq 2 and subsequently p will be adsorbed on the newly formed oxyhydroxides 19 60 2 mx oy yh 2 o xmooh y x y h 3 4 2 fixed bed filtration studies to determine the dynamic adsorption properties of fsc fixed bed filtration studies were carried on under different influent ph values which lasted about 120 days the complete breakthrough curves presented in fig 5 a are of the classic s shape profile to evaluate the adsorption performance of different adsorbents in fixed bed columns the number of bed volumes bv is an important parameter which influences the replacement frequency and durability of an adsorbent in a fixed bed column bv of fsc before p breakthrough p 18 0 mg l was about 2660 3898 table s6 which surpasses the results of most absorbents such as mg3 fe ldh 61 giant reed based adsorbent 62 and an anion exchange resin pssba 63 our present results show that the fsc absorbent has a broad application prospect the effluent ph of the column was also investigated by the constant assay of the effluent solution fig 5b the tendency of outlet ph in the dynamic column can be divided into two stages the first stage is the period of rapid increase bv 289 998 and the second stage is where the effluent ph gradually stabilizes at ph 8 0 bv 1769 2110 the reason is that the alkaline substances such as cao or ca oh 2 contained in the fsc are leached at the beginning of the operation then the effective contents reacted with phosphate therefore limited alkaline substances was released in solution as time increased 64 based on the weak interference effects of coexisting ions and ph to p adsorption on fsc it is apparent that the fsc adsorbent could be a potential absorbent for longstanding p removal moreover the adsorbent material for the treatment of eutrophic water needs not only the ability to remove pollutants but also to adjust the ph of the sewage 3 5 prospect of practical application 3 5 1 toxic metal release results to testify the safety of fsc the concentrations of possible toxic metals were monitored after 2 weeks according to the actual project concentration of the toxic heavy metals table 3 is below the limits imposed by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao which recommends maximum concentrations in agricultural irrigation water it can be seen that despite the variability the application of fsc in phosphorus removal and recovery is secure to environment management 3 5 2 economic consideration cost is one of the most crucial factor to be taken into account for determining the application of an adsorbent in a wastewater process engineering the precursor of practical application should be effective simple prepared and cheap the estimated cost of materials for fsc synthesis is approximately 0 120 kg according to market price sc 0 065 kg zeolite 0 12 kg feso4 0 060 kg which is substantially lower than the most popular adsorbent commercial activated carbons it can reach 111 kg reza prepared an activated carbons and its costs of preparation is about 14 36 kg 65 another low cost adsorbent by using a bio waste treated with h3po4 can be prepared at the cost of 0 5 kg 66 however the performance of fsc for p removal outstrips most of those materials 52 67 comparing with some powdered materials special reactors for the application of fsc was not necessary even directly adding fsc to the wastewater was also proved to be effective based on its mechanical strength 3 6 potential application of p loaded fsc the possibility of p reutilization from fsc was investigated by using the adsorbed fsc as p source to cultivate ipomoea aquatica forsk the release of p from p loaded fsc composite particles by di water with different ph values was a ph sensitive process fig s7 p desorption at ph 6 0 and 7 0 was 0 67 and 0 22 respectively whereas the release of p increased to 3 17 with the ph decreased to 5 0 the desorption experiments results from this study are comparable with those reported in the literature for other cement based materials based on batch experiments 34 the generally low p desorption rates indicated the strong interactions between phosphate and fsc composite which is not suitable for regeneration 60 study to show 70 of the total operating and maintenance cost is used for regeneration in an adsorption system so the use of p loaded adsorbent as a fertilizer could be more cost effective 68 considering the cost of regeneration the low desorption rate and the nutrient elements it contains fsc may be a potential phosphate fertilizer for agricultural use 33 hence the p loaded fsc composite was further employed as a p based fertilizer substitution in the hydroponic experiment fig 6 the potential recycling and use of fsc p as a phosphate fertilizer for plant growth was assessed in hydroponic experiment for water spinach growth four treatments 1 ck1 hoagland solution 2 ck2 hoagland solution without phosphorus source kcl replaces kh2po4 3 t1 with 5 g l fsc p added in ck2 and 4 t2 with 10 g l fsc p added in ck2 were carried on to study the effect on plant seedling growth fig 6 the plant dry weight of t1 and t2 samples after 14 days of culture were 0 40 0 41 0 05 g which were dramatically increased comparing with the non p source samples average plant dry weight 0 19 0 07 g p laden fsc improved the available p content of water spinach which is ranked as follows h 0 61 t2 0 58 t1 0 53 np 0 49 indicating that fsc p promoted the accumulation of plant nutrients in addition the leaves and roots were stronger and longer in fsc p treatment than the non p source samples and the fibrous roots of spinach under fsc p conditions are more and fresher than others previous study indicated that a large root system and more fibrous roots benefit to oxidizing the rhizosphere and increase their availability to pollutants 69 which manifested the possibility of the recovered fsc as a kind of substitute for phosphate based fertilizers 4 conclusions the paper provides a new choice for p removal and recovery from natural waters the adsorption of p obviously facilitated the release of so4 2 from the mineral surface and the lattice structure via so4 2 exchange and formation of ca al p precipitates with dissolved ca2 and al3 was the predominant p removal mechanism based on this mechanism the performance of fsc for p removal outstrips most of those materials weak interference effects of coexisting ions and ph were observed to p adsorption on fsc which apparent that the fsc adsorbent could be a potential absorbent for longstanding p removal the adsorbed fsc could replace the p source for ipomoea aquatica forsk which manifested the possibility of the recovered fsc as a kind of substitute for phosphate based fertilizers especially in the cultivation of hydroponic crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

biochar and ceramsite 8 9 however the direct use of raw materials will have shortcomings such as small adsorption capacity poor mechanical strength and low chemical stability on the other hand the high costly of specifically synthesized adsorption materials makes its implement challenging several adsorbents mentioned above for example the powdered materials carbon based composites and natural mineral etc and the materials with poor swelling property may cause secondary pollution due to the difficulty of solid liquid separation sulfoaluminate cement sc has been widely used in architecture due to its early strength low alkali and less co2 release characteristics in recent years 10 11 it contains elements including ca oxides 36 43 al oxides 28 40 and fe oxides 1 3 11 which opens up the possibility of adsorption and precipitation of p in the process of sc hydration the amorphous calcium silicate hydrate and aluminum hydroxide are generated which have been used to remove heavy metal ions such as cr iii pb2 and cd2 12 13 concrete fabricated with sc and bottom ash aggregates was testified can remove 70 of the dissolved p however the implementation of the sc cement was inhibited by the clogging effect 14 the cement and concrete waste were also employed for phosphate removal and the mechanism involved was formation of the ca3 po4 2 precipitate according to ion exchange 15 after 1073 k calcination high phosphate adsorption capacity could be achieved by adding alunite to cement 16 another study showed that p can be effectively removed by the cement bound ochre pellets waste due to the formation of calcium phosphate precipitate with the release of ca2 in solution 17 however the lack of functional groups with positive charge in cement based materials limits their application in comparison to commercial adsorbents phosphorus adsorption can usually be achieved via long electrical interaction force firstly hence metal cations e g iron salts manganese salts and aluminum salts attract much attention because of their high point of zero charge and rich surface functional groups 18 several studies reported enhanced phosphate removal was considered due to the facilitated generation of fe iii through oxidation of fe ii in the presence of feso4 19 and fecl2 20 to date most previous studies were focused on the cement based demolition waste modification and its utilization 21 22 limited research is available on the comprehensive study of p removal mechanisms influencing factors and practical application with cement based materials meanwhile few studies involved modification of the cement based materials it is of great significance to establish such knowledge system for p removal and recovery from natural waters the objective of this study was to develop a new adsorption efficiency low cost and recoverable sc based material for p removal in order to improve the p adsorption capacity ferrous sulfate 7 4 mass weight was added to sc materials to increase adsorption sites in addition the adsorption mechanism and application prospect of p on fe loaded sulfoaluminate cement fsc were studied comprehensively interactions of p on the present adsorbent were studied and compared in batch and fix bed conditions which should improve our knowledge in p immobilization from natural waters to discuss the possibility of p recovery and utilization the adsorbed materials were used as the p source to cultivate ipomoea aquatica forsk 2 materials and methods 2 1 sorbent preparation and characterization 2 1 1 materials used in this study sulfoaluminate cement 42 5 was provided by the yunyan cement company guangxi china a water reducer hr was obtained from glenium basf corporation zeolite powder and standard sand were purchased from aisiou standard sand company xiamen china other chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from sigma aldrich beijing china a standard phosphate stock solution 100 mg l p and coexisting ion solutions were prepared from anhydrous kh2po4 and their corresponding sodium salts in deionized water 18 2 mω 5 g l of sulfuric acid was added to ensure stability other standard phosphate solutions were prepared by diluting this stock solution fsc used in this study was synthetized with sulfoaluminate cement 42 5 as the binder with a water binder ratio of 0 32 the compositions of raw materials for fsc synthesis are shown in table s1 four kinds of materials were chosen as control including sc sc doped with zeolite sc doped with feso4 and iron oxide the iron oxide was prepared by dropping 0 1 m naoh into 1 m feso4 solution 23 the other three materials are obtained by replacing its components in fsc with sc on equal mass ratio all components were stirred by 1 5 min of slow stirring followed by 1 5 min of rapid stirring in a mortar jj 5 wuxi jianyi instrument machinery co ltd china after 3 h the product was dried at 45 c for 12 h the fsc mortar was

malvern instruments uk 2 2 adsorption experiments 2 2 1 batch experiments phosphate adsorption behavior of fsc was investigated by batch adsorption all experiments were carried out at 25 c in 150 ml conical flasks at a shaking rate of 200 rpm for 48 h in triplicate molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method was used to determine the phosphate concentration of each solution 25 the ph of each solution was analyzed with a mettler toledu s210 k instrument mettler switzerland to study the effect of initial solution ph to phosphate removal suspension samples containing 40 mg l phosphate and 1 g l fsc were adjusted to desired ph values in the range 2 12 with naoh and hcl after the samples were mixed in a constant temperature shaking table for 48 h the final ph was measured and the suspension was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter for soluble metal measurements during phosphate adsorption the secondary hydrolysis in fsc will release hydroxyl groups resulting in the increase of ph to study the ph effects to phosphate adsorption and fsc hydration stationary ph dependent experiments were carried on during which the ph values 3 0 8 0 of all batch samples were adjusted and fixed throughout the reaction in addition other experimental conditions are the same as the previous ph dependent experiments the interferences of the coexisting anions were also investigated by addition of nacl nano3 na2so4 or nahco3 0 01 mol l to 40 mg l phosphate solutions for the adsorption kinetic experiments 1 0 g l fsc was added to solutions containing initial phosphate concentrations of 40 80 and 120 mg l phosphate concentrations were analyzed at appropriate times both the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models were used to clarify the adsorption kinetics of phosphate on fsc to study the adsorption capacity of fsc the adsorbents were added to solutions with initial phosphate concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 mg l the adsorption isotherm data was simulated by langmuir and freundlich equations 26 details of kinetic and isotherm modeling related parameters and chemical calculations and bjh results fig s1 and table s2 were reported in the supplementary materials 2 2 2 risk evaluation of harmful component release fsc 1 g was added to a beaker containing 1 l of deionized water and preserved for 2 weeks at room temperature according to the actual project situation the concentrations of harmful heavy metals in solution were monitored by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific usa 2 3 column filtration experiments experiments were conducted with a glass column of 2 0 cm in internal diameter and 20 0 cm in height fig s2 the solutions were flowed through the fixed bed filtration column from bottom to top with a peristaltic pump the experimental conditions was a bed depth of 7 6 7 5 and 15 2 cm a flow rate of 1 0 0 1 ml min an initial solution ph of 5 0 7 0 and 9 1 and an initial phosphate concentration of 20 mg l the ph of the effluents after adsorption was recorded periodically to monitor any changes that might occur during the adsorption the phosphate concentration of the effluent was determined with a smartchem 200 automatic chemical analyzer ams westco italia a schematic view of the experimental set up is presented in fig s2 at last p laden fsc after column experiment was dried and sieved for characterization test including xrd and ftir 2 4 breakthrough curve data calculation ct c 0 mg l was plotted against t min to attain the breakthrough profile where t is the time c0 represents the influent phosphate concentration and ct denotes the effluent concentration the point of column breakthrough and exhaustion was 10 ct c 0 10 and 90 ct c 0 90 of the influent phosphate concentration respectively 2 5 application of the adsorbed fsc 0 1 g recovered fsc was added in 150 ml conical flask with 100 ml di water with ph values of 5 0 6 0 and 7 0 respectively for testing the feasibility of phosphate loaded composite as a phosphate fertilizer substitute a hydroponic experiment was carried out based on a procedure previously described by park et al 27 the variety of spinach used in the experiment was ipomoea aquatica forsk which was purchased from yanjiang third road market haikou china plants were then acclimated in hydroponic tanks 38 5 27 14 cm containing 6 l of 0 2 strength 0 2x hoagland solution see table s3 for component content for 3 days then randomly selected plants and quantitative fsc p powder were cultured with whole nutrient solution and 12 plants per tank four treatments were performed in the test according to preliminary experiments and calculations of the adsorption capacity data 1 ck1 hoagland solution 2 ck2 hoagland solution without phosphorus source kcl insteads

plants were grown in the nutrient solutions for 14 d harvested washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in an oven at 60 c to a constant weight after 30 min at 105 c 28 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of fsc for the perspective of engineering application sulfoaluminate cement sc was used to ensure the compressive strength at the early age of curing the main constituents of the sc are ye elimite c4a3 and calcium sulfoaluminate phase whereas those of ordinary portland cement opc are ccalcium aluminate c3a alcium silicate c3s and c2s and ferrite c4af 29 the ye elimite c4a3 in the sc is a key component which forms the ettringite at an early age of curing accelerating the strength development of the concrete 30 the preparation process of fsc is shown in fig s3 and the chemical composition and physical properties of fsc are shown in table 1 the performance of fast mechanical strength and proper setting time is crucial for the practical application of fsc considering the property of phosphate adsorption feso4 and zeolite was added in sc the results from fig s4 revealed that the addition of iron salt promoted the adsorption rate and adsorption capacities of phosphate adsorption with the addition of iron oxides the adsorption equilibrium time of sc decreased from 45 h sc to 20 h fsc moreover the phosphate adsorption capacities increased from 29 72 mg g sc to 34 12 mg g fsc the addition of iron oxide provides a large number of adsorption sites which makes the concentration of phosphorus on the surface of fsc increase rapidly and precipitate with cations such as ca2 and al3 the characteristics of early strength and good impermeability of sulfoaluminate cement are due to its higher compactness which also hinders the adsorption process of phosphate zeolite has received widespread attention as an adsorption material due to its high specific surface area 31 the addition of zeolite during material preparation can increase the specific surface area and porosity of fsc moreover among many researches on the phosphate precipitation by fe iii applications of the newly generated fe iii through the oxidation of cheaper fe ii have received much attention due to the higher efficiency and lower cost than direct using fe iii 32 it was more interesting to note that the slowly generated fresh ferric compositions demonstrated high capacity for phosphate removal without the concern of evident formation of oxyhydroxide to weaken its capacity 19 regarding phosphorus recovery diverse researches on phosphate removal are divided into two types the struvites precipitation and calcium phosphate cp precipitation struvites precipitation process can simultaneously recover n and p but it is invalid in the absence of nh4 in solution thus the role of ca2 sources materials in political and academic communities has received much attention in recent years additionally cementitious materials contain many essential macronutrients p k ca mg micronutrients fe mn and b and some beneficial elements si na for plant growth which benefits in agricultural management 33 the high cement content of fsc 66 5 provides the possibility of reuse of dephosphorus adsorbent fsc p could be purified and further used in manufacture of detergent emulsifier fertilizer etc above all a sulfoaluminate cement based material was synthesized for its potential for phosphate removal application and recovery 3 2 adsorption capacity of phosphate by fsc in batch and column tests in the batch experiment adsorption process of fsc on po4 3 was more accurately described by the elovich equation where values of r2 were greater than 0 960 fig 1 and table s5 therefore it can be concluded that the adsorption system can be a chemical process such as an ion exchange process 38 elovich s equation has been widely used for the adsorption of pollutants in wastewaters 39 the phosphate adsorption process reached equilibrium after 48 h fig 1 the phosphate adsorption percentage reached approximately 70 of the equilibrium value after 24 h the slow kinetics suggests that other phosphate removal mechanisms besides adsorption such as the formation of surface precipitates have occurred 40 combining with the xrd and edx results figs 2 3 p facilitated dissolution of calcium sulfate caso4 caso4 2h2o in the hydration products of sulfoaluminate cement subsequently the aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate were formed the dissolution precipitation process often requires longer equilibrium time than adsorption which is in accordance with the experimental results 41 42 the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were employed to describe phosphate adsorption behaviors on fsc fig 1 comparing with the freundlich isotherms r2 0 686 0 825 fig 1 and table s6 our experimental data were in good agreement with the langmuir isotherms r2 0 952 0 977 the maximum p adsorption capacity qm at 25 c obtained from the langmuir isotherm data is 46 8 mg g which is superior to some of the reported values for other cementitious materials table 2 comparing with dynamic adsorption experiment the exhaustion adsorption capacity qe was 14 48 21 28 mg p g table s7 which was lower than the maximum capacity in the batch experiments 46 80 mg g the reason is that more sufficient contact between the powdered adsorbent and the adsorbate in the batch tests it is easier to enter the inside of fsc and improve the adsorption efficiency and adsorption capacity in the flasks 3 3 fsc characterization and its adsorption mechanisms the ftir spectra before and after adsorption indicated the reactions of p with the newly generated oxyhydroxides processed fig 2 a and characteristic bands of fsc were showed in table s8 previous study indicated vibrations at 1116 cm 1 can be assigned to the so in so4 2 43 as the result of p adsorption the peak at 1116 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of gypsum obviously attenuated after p adsorption both in batch and column samples suggesting exchange reactions of p with the so4 2 the characteristic peaks of carbonate appeared respectively for each samples which was from reaction between ca oh 2 in cement and the atmospheric co2 the carbonates phases were confirmed as caco3 in the results of xrd fig 2 and table s8 notably obviously strengthened and widened band at 1028 cm 1 for p adsorption on fsc could be attributed to the typical characteristic of the asymmetric stretch vibration of po 44 especially in column test implying the metal o p binding between phosphate and fsc similar results were also observed when p adsorption on zr go alg and zr o p was formed 45 after fsc were reacted with phosphate the strength of al o stretching vibration at 557and 683 cm 1 decreased but still could be observed which confirmed the involvement of al o or ca o bonds in phosphate adsorption 46 this result can be verified by the formation of alpo4 and calcium phosphate ca2p2o7 in xrd fig 2 the xrd fig 2b and sem edx fig 3 results testified formation of metal p precipitates surface precipitates on fsc the sem images and elemental compositions of fsc before and after p adsorption are employed to study the changes of morphology on fsc fig 3 10 000 sem results showed that there were holes cave type diameters 5 20 μm and grid openings on the surface of the fsc which would increase the specific surface area available for adsorption different sizes of rhombohedra columnar and block flocculation aggregates are found on the surface of fsc before adsorption the high cement content of fsc combined with the eds and xrd results suggests that the components before p adsorption are mostly composites of sulfoaluminate cement including ye elimite gypsum and calcium carbonate study to show the crystal structure of main products of sulfoaluminate cement sc contains columns and channels parallel to the hexagonal prisms and the h2o molecules and so4 2 groups gathered in the channels several studies indicated that sulfoaluminate cement based material is able to adsorb multiple ions under the help of ca2 al3 and so4 2 in the columnar and channels 47 after p adsorption the s element was not detected in the eds results whereas there was about 5 s element in the fsc absorbent before adsorption fig 3 moreover the caso4 and caso4 2h2o crystalline phases detected in the fsc absorbent disappeared after p adsorption fig 2 and the intensity peak representing for alpo4 at 2θ 22 1 was generated it can be inferred that the addition of p in solution could promote dissolution of calcium sulfate caso4 and caso4 2h2o ksp 3 14 4 93 10 5 instead the more insoluble contents of alpo4 ksp 9 84 10 21 and ca2p2o7 ksp 3 0 10 18 were formed that is to say sulfate was substituted by phosphate and dissolved in solution which is the reason why the s element was not detected in the eds results furthermore the above mechanism can also explain the inhibitory effect of sulfate ions on phosphate adsorption fig 4 c besides of the anion competing effects so4 2 in solution inhibits dissolution of caso4 and caso4 2h2o and reduced the formation of alpo4 this phenomenon is similar to that of the calcium rich slags used in phosphate removal 48 additionally it can be seen from the comparison between the short term batch and the long term column results that the disappearance of ye elimite as the main component of sc during the early hydration period was inferred to the more accumulation of ca p and al p precipitates or its conversion to monosulphoaluminate with no obvious crystal phase 49 in short the p adsorption mechanisms can be attributed to 1 adsorption on iron oxides and the newly formed calcium aluminum oxyhydroxides of fsc and 2 subsequently the adsorbed p can form ca al p precipitates with ca2 or al3 in fsc the occurrence of metal p precipitates would increase the phosphate adsorption capacities and lower the mobility of adsorbed p this hypothesis has been supported by the zn cd as v co precipitation on goethite samples with reduced leachability in previous studies 50 similarly the adsorption and surface precipitation of as iii with fe ii iii could dramatically reduce the solubility of as iii under anoxic conditions 51 3 4 interference of treatment conditions 3 4 1 impacts of coexisting ions and solution ph p removal from natural waters can be enhanced or inhibited in the presence of coexisting ions for example anions such as silicate and bicarbonate could strongly compete with p adsorption and precipitation whereas cations including calcium iron and magnesium have positive effects 52 the influence of coexisting ions such as sulphate chloride and nitrate on the phosphorus adsorption capacity of fsc was investigated fig 4c results testified that there were no obvious influences of cl and no3 to phosphate adsorption capacities resulting from adding 0 01 m of these anions into 40 mg l phosphate solution suggesting that fsc is highly selective for phosphate adsorption and removal from solution with the additions of so4 2 and hco3 the phosphate removal percentages decreased from 83 5 64 9 and 60 2 respectively the decreased phosphate removal could be attributed to the competitive adsorption between anions or to the formation of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate which were occupied with the calcium and could be combined with phosphate 53 as a result of phosphate adsorption the negative charge on the surface of fsc increased which is consistent with the mechanism of anion adsorption the point of zero charge pzc shifted from 5 8 for pristine fsc to approximately 3 1 upon p adsorption fig 4a indicating the formation of negatively charged inner sphere complexes on fsc 54 the interference of initial solution ph to phosphate adsorption was investigated by the ph dependence experiments results showed that p removal on fsc maintained from 29 4 32 0 mg g with initial ph increasing from 3 0 to 8 0 fig 4b regardless of the initial ph values the final ph values of the adsorption samples were stable at 8 1 8 3 fig 4b the h2po4 and hpo4 2 as the predominant p forms in the present ph range would not cause a sharp rise in ph due to adsorption especially from the initial ph 3 0 to the final equilibrium ph 8 1 therefore other p adsorption mechanisms besides adsorption such as the hydrolysis of metal oxides and the formation of metal p fsc surface complexes precipitates also play an important role the steady increasement of ph from 3 0 7 0 to 8 1 8 3 fig 4b can be explained by the incomplete hydrolysis of cao and al2o3 in sulfoaluminate cement table 1 during the fsc synthesis process eq 1 the finding is consistent with previous stydies 34 55 1 mx oy yh 2 o xm 2 y x 2 y o h during phosphate adsorption the secondary hydrolysis in fsc will release hydroxyl groups resulting in the increase of ph eq 1 to study the ph effects to phosphate adsorption and fsc hydration the stationary ph dependent experiments were carried on fig s6 the ph dependence experiments showed that the phosphate adsorption decreased from 38 91 mg g to 28 45 mg g as ph increasing from 4 0 to 8 0 which is consistent with the previous results 56 57 the ph value of the solution is an important factor affecting phosphorus removal on the one hand it affects the form of phosphorus and on the other hand it affects the surface charge of the fsc and the release of metal ions such as ca2 and al3 the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity is of 38 91 mg g at ph 4 0 and then decreases with the increase of ph values at ph 4 8 h2po4 and hpo4 2 are the predominant phosphate forms which can be easily adsorbed on metal oxides comparing with the h3po4 ph 3 and po4 3 ph 12 due to the electronic effects 58 at ph 3 the neutral h3po4 molecules could hardly adsorb on metal oxides nor precipitate with cations via so4 2 exchange at ph 8 0 two factors are adverse to phosphate adsorption firstly the predominant form of phosphate is hpo4 2 which is difficult to adsorb on the negatively charged iron oxides fig 4a secondly hydrolysis reactions of cao and al2o3 are difficult to carry out under alkaline conditions eq 1 as a result less hpo4 2 could precipitate with ca2 and al3 via so4 2 exchange in addition as a function of hydrolysis ca2 and al3 dissolved in the liquid phase and p can be complexed with the dissolved free cations with the increasing of complex amounts and time complexes the ca p al p surface precipitates were formed which is consistent with a previous study 59 moreover oxyhydroxides would be formed due to the hydrolysis of cao and al2o3 eq 2 and subsequently p will be adsorbed on the newly formed oxyhydroxides 19 60 2 mx oy yh 2 o xmooh y x y h 3 4 2 fixed bed filtration studies to determine the dynamic adsorption properties of fsc fixed bed filtration studies were carried on under different influent ph values which lasted about 120 days the complete breakthrough curves presented in fig 5 a are of the classic s shape profile to evaluate the adsorption performance of different adsorbents in fixed bed columns the number of bed volumes bv is an important parameter which influences the replacement frequency and durability of an adsorbent in a fixed bed column bv of fsc before p breakthrough p 18 0 mg l was about 2660 3898 table s6 which surpasses the results of most absorbents such as mg3 fe ldh 61 giant reed based adsorbent 62 and an anion exchange resin pssba 63 our present results show that the fsc absorbent has a broad application prospect the effluent ph of the column was also investigated by the constant assay of the effluent solution fig 5b the tendency of outlet ph in the dynamic column can be divided into two stages the first stage is the period of rapid increase bv 289 998 and the second stage is where the effluent ph gradually stabilizes at ph 8 0 bv 1769 2110 the reason is that the alkaline substances such as cao or ca oh 2 contained in the fsc are leached at the beginning of the operation then the effective contents reacted with phosphate therefore limited alkaline substances was released in solution as time increased 64 based on the weak interference effects of coexisting ions and ph to p adsorption on fsc it is apparent that the fsc adsorbent could be a potential absorbent for longstanding p removal moreover the adsorbent material for the treatment of eutrophic water needs not only the ability to remove pollutants but also to adjust the ph of the sewage 3 5 prospect of practical application 3 5 1 toxic metal release results to testify the safety of fsc the concentrations of possible toxic metals were monitored after 2 weeks according to the actual project concentration of the toxic heavy metals table 3 is below the limits imposed by food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao which recommends maximum concentrations in agricultural irrigation water it can be seen that despite the variability the application of fsc in phosphorus removal and recovery is secure to environment management 3 5 2 economic consideration cost is one of the most crucial factor to be taken into account for determining the application of an adsorbent in a wastewater process engineering the precursor of practical application should be effective simple prepared and cheap the estimated cost of materials for fsc synthesis is approximately 0 120 kg according to market price sc 0 065 kg zeolite 0 12 kg feso4 0 060 kg which is substantially lower than the most popular adsorbent commercial activated carbons it can reach 111 kg reza prepared an activated carbons and its costs of preparation is about 14 36 kg 65 another low cost adsorbent by using a bio waste treated with h3po4 can be prepared at the cost of 0 5 kg 66 however the performance of fsc for p removal outstrips most of those materials 52 67 comparing with some powdered materials special reactors for the application of fsc was not necessary even directly adding fsc to the wastewater was also proved to be effective based on its mechanical strength 3 6 potential application of p loaded fsc the possibility of p reutilization from fsc was investigated by using the adsorbed fsc as p source to cultivate ipomoea aquatica forsk the release of p from p loaded fsc composite particles by di water with different ph values was a ph sensitive process fig s7 p desorption at ph 6 0 and 7 0 was 0 67 and 0 22 respectively whereas the release of p increased to 3 17 with the ph decreased to 5 0 the desorption experiments results from this study are comparable with those reported in the literature for other cement based materials based on batch experiments 34 the generally low p desorption rates indicated the strong interactions between phosphate and fsc composite which is not suitable for regeneration 60 study to show 70 of the total operating and maintenance cost is used for regeneration in an adsorption system so the use of p loaded adsorbent as a fertilizer could be more cost effective 68 considering the cost of regeneration the low desorption rate and the nutrient elements it contains fsc may be a potential phosphate fertilizer for agricultural use 33 hence the p loaded fsc composite was further employed as a p based fertilizer substitution in the hydroponic experiment fig 6 the potential recycling and use of fsc p as a phosphate fertilizer for plant growth was assessed in hydroponic experiment for water spinach growth four treatments 1 ck1 hoagland solution 2 ck2 hoagland solution without phosphorus source kcl replaces kh2po4 3 t1 with 5 g l fsc p added in ck2 and 4 t2 with 10 g l fsc p added in ck2 were carried on to study the effect on plant seedling growth fig 6 the plant dry weight of t1 and t2 samples after 14 days of culture were 0 40 0 41 0 05 g which were dramatically increased comparing with the non p source samples average plant dry weight 0 19 0 07 g p laden fsc improved the available p content of water spinach which is ranked as follows h 0 61 t2 0 58 t1 0 53 np 0 49 indicating that fsc p promoted the accumulation of plant nutrients in addition the leaves and roots were stronger and longer in fsc p treatment than the non p source samples and the fibrous roots of spinach under fsc p conditions are more and fresher than others previous study indicated that a large root system and more fibrous roots benefit to oxidizing the rhizosphere and increase their availability to pollutants 69 which manifested the possibility of the recovered fsc as a kind of substitute for phosphate based fertilizers 4 conclusions the paper provides a new choice for p removal and recovery from natural waters the adsorption of p obviously facilitated the release of so4 2 from the mineral surface and the lattice structure via so4 2 exchange and formation of ca al p precipitates with dissolved ca2 and al3 was the predominant p removal mechanism based on this mechanism the performance of fsc for p removal outstrips most of those materials weak interference effects of coexisting ions and ph were observed to p adsorption on fsc which apparent that the fsc adsorbent could be a potential absorbent for longstanding p removal the adsorbed fsc could replace the p source for ipomoea aquatica forsk which manifested the possibility of the recovered fsc as a kind of substitute for phosphate based fertilizers especially in the cultivation of hydroponic crops declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13746,due to the phase out of some poly perfluoroalkyl substances pfass different pfass such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs have been adopted as alternatives in the market causing their release into the environment however there is little information about their fate and degradation by advanced oxidation processes aops in literature the aim of the present study is to fill this gap by evaluating the degradability and fate of newly produced polyfluorinated telomer alcohol namely 2 1 1 2 trifluoro 2 hepta fluoropyloxy ethylsulfonyl ethanol tfhfese in different water matrices using various aops including ultraviolet uv photolysis uv h2o2 solar photolysis solar h2o2 o3 and o3 h2o2 while tfhfese was degraded 76 by the ozonation process the presence of h2o2 decreased the process efficiency uv based processes provided 98 7 100 degradation of tfhfese the presence of h2o2 increased the defluorination ratio for uv processes however defluorination ratios were much lower for uv process than that with ozonation process no significant effect of water matrix on the degradation of tfhfese was observed except ozonation the role of hydroxyl radicals for the degradation of tfhfese was investigated using isopropanol i proh the degradation of tfhfese by ozonation was mostly promoted by the reaction of molecular ozone instead of hydroxyl radicals in contrast the presence of i proh quenched the generated hydroxyl radicals during uv based processes indicating degradation was provided by oh the proposed degradation pathways during aops are given which included the loss of ch2 group hf elimination cf2 flake off and oxidative degradations due to volatilization of tfhfese the intermediate m z 327 was also detected for uv based processes keywords aops fluorotelomer alcohol intermediates pfas water matrices 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are extensively recognized as worldwide environmental pollutants due to their bioaccumulative and toxic potential 1 2 long chain length pfass i e c6 for perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas and c7 for perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas are persistent and non biodegradable and have been detected at elevated concentrations in surface waters 3 4 groundwater 5 6 and drinking water 7 8 the manufacture of numerous pfass including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos has been phased out in europe and north america and its precursors were phased out in 2002 9 different pfass have been introduced as replacement chemicals recent production phase outs have led to shifts in formulations frequently to short chain or semi fluorinated substances 10 11 the most common substitute compound used is 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate acid 6 2 fts or its salts and 8 2 fluorotelomer alcohol 8 2 ftoh 12 hence there has been an on going industrial transition for replacement of long chain pfass and their precursors in recent years in addition to this although the manufacture of perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas including pfoa have been mostly controlled they are generated from various precursor compounds such as ftohs 13 15 recent studies showed that atmospheric degradation of ftohs is expected to contribute to the extensive distribution of pfcas 16 17 atmospheric oxidation of ftohs can be originated by reaction with oh radicals 18 it is also observed that cl atoms may initiate the oxidation of ftohs and more than 90 of reactions of both oh radicals and cl atoms with ftohs occur through abstraction of hydrogen atom from the ch2 group 16 to date biotransformation of 6 2 ftoh by microorganisms has been reported in soils 19 20 activated sludge 21 sediments 22 23 and bacterial and fungal cultures 24 25 these studies observed that perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea and perfluorobutyric acid pfba were the final intermediates indicating the formation of pfcas during 6 2 ftoh biotransformation furthermore degradation byproducts including saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer aldehydes and carboxylic acids were detected which have been found to be more toxic than pfcas 26 recent studies also demonstrated that 6 2 ftoh was the biotransformation byproduct of fluorotelomer based compounds such as 6 2 fluorotelomer iodide 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphates and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaine 25 27 28 consequently it is essential to examine the transformation and degradation products of precursors for avoiding the pollution expansion of pfcas the removal and or degradation of pfass is still a challenge since conventional treatment technologies have been reported ineffective 29 30 therefore there is a growing need for the development of novel and effective processes to provide degradation of pfass for environmental protection advanced oxidation processes aops such as electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic ozonation o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 have been reported to effectively decompose most pfass including pfoa pfos perfluoro decanoic acid pfda perfluoro dodecanoic acid pfdda perfluoro tridecanoic acid pftrda perfluoro tetra decanoic acid pfteda perfluoro hexadecenoic acid pfhxda perfluoro octadecanoic acid pfoda and 6 2 fts 31 39 aops are based on the production of free radicals which are capable of degrading organic contaminants among the free radicals hydroxyl radical oh is one of the most reactive and strongest free radical e 2 33 v reacting with several groups of organic compounds 40 41 uv photolysis uv h2o2 ozonation o3 h2o2 and electrochemical oxidation can generate oh and other free radicals and effectively degrade certain organic pollutants it is well known from literature that the combination of uv with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 provides improved oxidative degradation of contaminants by the production of hydroxyl radicals hydroxyl radicals are generated during uv process via absorption of uv light by h2o2 by means of peroxidic bond photolysis according to the following equation 42 43 1 h2o2 hv 2oh uv based aops degrade pollutants in two ways 1 some pollutants directly absorb uv light and absorption of this high energy radiation can provide destruction of chemical bonds and following breakdown of the pollutant 44 and 2 some organics cannot be degraded very rapidly and effectively by direct photolysis hence h2o2 addition to the uv process produces aop conditions and significantly increases the rate of pollutant degradation h2o2 absorbs uv light and breaks down into oh radicals 45 in the case of ozonation organic contaminants are also oxidized in two ways 1 ozone itself which is a very selective oxidant can directly react with dissolved pollutants 46 and 2 ozone decomposes via a chain reaction mechanism to form hydroxyl radicals which in turn can degrade the pollutant 47 when hydrogen peroxide is added to the ozonation process the decomposition of o3 into oh radicals is enhanced basically shifting the process completely to an aop very few studies have been published on degradation of pfas precursors by advanced oxidation processes for example yang et al investigated 6 2 fts degradation under various aops including uv irradiation uv h2o2 alkaline ozonation peroxone o3 h2o2 and fenton reagent oxidation fe2 h2o2 they observed high yields of so4 2 and f indicating 6 2 fts can be almost completely desulfonated and defluorinated during uv h2o2 process 48 another study evaluated photodegradation of 8 2 ftoh in lake water samples it was observed that hydroxyl radical was the main oxidation agent and nitrate enhanced the photolysis whereas natural organic matter nom diminished it the half life of 8 2 ftoh was determined as 0 83 0 20 h in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 however no significant degradation was observed by direct photolysis 49 the major objective of this study was to evaluate the fate and degradation of a newly produced polyfluorinated telomer alcohol tfhfese which is used in the production of textile leather and paper products by different advanced oxidation processes including uv photolysis uv h2o2 ozonation and o3 h2o2 since there is no study in literature solar and solar h2o2 photolysis of tfhfese was also evaluated furthermore the identification of degradation by products was performed to assess environmental fate of tfhfese and for mechanistic degradation pathways tests were also conducted with river water to evaluate the effect of water matrix on degradation efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples 2 1 1 2 trifluoro 2 hepta fluoropyloxy ethylsulfonyl ethanol the novel polyfluorinated telomer alcohol tfhfese was obtained from merck kgaa germany and its chemical structure can be found in fig 1 hydrogen peroxide 30 wt in h2o and isopropanol 70 in water in volume were purchased from sigma aldrich river water samples were collected from the schuylkill river philadelphia pa representing surface water in eastern pennsylvania usa river water samples were spiked with the target level of tfhfese and its characteristics are listed in table 1 2 2 analytical procedures the analysis of the polyfluorinated telomer alcohol and its degradation by products were performed by liquid liquid extraction lle followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis 5 ml of sample was placed into a separation funnel then 5 ml of hexane and 2 g of nacl were added the solution was mixed via vortex mixer and allowed for phase separation for 15 s the aqueous phase was discarded and the organic phase was used for analysis the gc ms analysis was performed by an agilent 7890a gc coupled with a 5975c ms in electron ionization ei mode an agilent j w cp6012 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm film thickness was used high purity helium was used as a carrier gas and purge flow rate was 50 ml min the head pressure was 60 kpa of helium and 5 μl injection volume was used initial oven temperature was 70 c held for 2 min and then ramped to 90 c at a rate of 7 c min finally the oven temperature was ramped to 270 c at 20 c min and held for 5 min while transfer line temperature to the ms was maintained at 230 c ion source temperature was 250 c and electron energy was 70 ev analytes were quantified using a six point calibration curve fig sm 1 calibration standards and one blank sample hexane were run for every batch of 7 samples for quality control spike and recovery experiments were also performed to determine method detection limit mdl and limit of quantification loq for tfhfese and data is presented in table sm 1 mdl and loq were calculated from the concentrations of tfhfese that yielded a signal to noise s n ratio of higher than or equal to 3 and 10 respectively 2 3 aop procedures tfhfese stock solution was made using deionized di water and river water the initial concentration of tfhfese was 10 ppm all the experiments were conducted in a batch mode at room temperature and were duplicated for the ozonation process an ozone generator wedeco usa was used to produce o3 from pure o2 gas 99 9 the o3 concentration in the ozone generator effluent o3 and o2 gas mixture was adjusted by changing the ozone flow rate the reactor column was filled with sample 2 l and the ozone gas was then sparged into the reactor at flow rates of 10 30 and 75 l h through a porous spherical diffuser 30 μm pore diameter placed at the bottom of the reactor mixing was also provided with a magnetic stirrer excess ozone from the reactor was sent to a thermal ozone destruction unit the inlet concentration of ozone in the gas phase was monitored by ozone analyzer and the effluent ozone gas concentration was measured according to the standard method 2350 e the iodometric method with ki solution 50 ozone mass transfer studies were performed for ozonation experiments inlet and outlet ozone concentration in the gas phase was measured via bmt 864c ozone analyzers feed gas flowrates were adjusted as 10 30 and 75 l h the aqueous ozone concentration was also measured in different time intervals using standard iodometry method described elsewhere 51 mass transfer coefficients kla were measured according to the mass balance of ozone at steady state eq 2 2 d c d t k l a c e c where ce is the equilibrium aqueous ozone concentration and c is the dissolved ozone concentration ce values were determined when the concentration of dissolved ozone in water was constant with the ozonation time integration of the equation with boundaries of c 0 at t 0 and c c at t t gives 3 ln c e c c e k l a x t the values of k la min 1 can be determined by plotting ln c e c c e vs time t ozone mass transfer coefficients relative to flow rate can be seen in fig 2 as shown k la values increased with the increase in flow rates for example while ozone mass transfer coefficient was 0 8809 min 1 at 75 l h ozone flow rate it was 0 1659 min 1 for flow rate of 10 l h increase in the gas flow rate enhances the number of bubbles as well as superficial velocity resulting in lower film transfer resistance and higher interfacial surface area this was in agreement with the previously reported studies 52 54 fig 2 for the uv photolysis experiments were conducted using a collimated beam device cbd the uv lamp emitted 244 nm uv light the volume of the solution was 100 ml in each experiment uv intensity was determined with uridine test method and a calibrated radiometer uvx digital radiometer ultraviolet products inc san gabriel ca equipped with 365 or 254 nm sensor to provide accurate results for the uridine test method phosphate buffer solution approx ph 6 88 and 0 007 mol l uridine stock solution were prepared then 0 014 mmol l uridine was prepared by dissolving the stock solution and adding 25 ml of phosphate buffer the petri dish was filled with 100 ml of 0 014 mmol l uridine sample the sample was irradiated for 300 600 900 and 1200 s the samples were then measured at wavelength of 262 nm this protocol was repeated three times and uv intensity was calculated the measured uv intensities by uridine method and a radiometer showed good correlation as indicated in fig sm 2 uv intensity was then adjusted by changing the distance between the petri dish on the base of the stand and the uv lamp for uv h2o2 and o3 h2o2 processes different amounts of h2o2 were added to the solutions the other parts of the experiments were the same as uv photolysis and ozonation processes for the solar photolysis experiments were conducted using a solar lamp emitting 400 nm uv light the power lumen and color temperature of the solar lamp were 1000 w 140 000 lm and 2000 k respectively the volume of the solution was 200 ml in each experiment uv intensity was determined using the approach described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of tfhfese by o3 and o3 h2o2 fig 3 a shows tfhfese degradation efficiencies for different ozone flow rates as shown the ozone flow rate had a significant effect on the fluorotelomer pfas degradation for example ozone flow rate of 30 l h provided higher removal 68 when compared to 50 removal with 10 l h after 120 min of reaction further increase in ozone flow rate to 75 l h also showed an increase on the degradation efficiency approximately 76 this can be expected considering ozone mass transfer coefficients which was determined as the highest with ozone flow rate of 75 l h in literature ozonation process has mostly been found ineffective for well known pfass such as pfoa and pfos with degradation efficiencies ranging between 8 35 32 55 56 on the other hand 6 2 fts was reported as more degradable than pfos in alkaline ozonation process yang 2014 fig 3 a also shows the fluoride release during the ozonation process at 75 l h ozone flow rate after 120 min of process time fluoride concentration was measured as 5 4 ppm which corresponds to almost 98 defluorination huang et al 2016 reported that only 0 5 of fluoride was produced in 4 h by ozonation process 32 lin et al 2012 also stated that pfoa was degraded by 99 in 4 h by altering the ozone dose and solution ph however the ozone flow rate in their study was much higher and provided at higher alkaline condition ph 11 it can be deduced from fig 3 a that the defluorination rate was higher than tfhfese degradation rate during the ozonation process this suggests that the reaction intermediates degraded faster than the parent compound combining o3 with h2o2 to enhance degradation efficiency has been researched for the removal of refractory pollutants 53 57 58 experiments were performed in the presence of h2o2 with concentrations ranging between 5 100 mm as shown in fig 3 b addition of h2o2 reduced the removal of tfhfese the reduction of degradation efficiency was more significant with increasing h2o2 concentrations the negative outcomes with h2o2 addition indicate scavenging of hydroxyl radical by the hydrogen peroxide when h2o2 is in excess relative to aqueous o3 excessive h2o2 would compete with target pollutants for hydroxyl radical 59 61 3 2 degradation of tfhfese by uv photolysis and uv h2o2 aqueous solution of tfhfese was irradiated with uv light of different intensities fig 4 a as shown tfhfese was degraded by almost 50 after 30 min of uv exposure for both uv intensities at the end of process time 2 h the degradation of tfhfese was 93 and 97 8 for uv intensities of 2 1 and 3 mw cm2 respectively the combination of uv irradiation and h2o2 at different concentrations was also examined in this case the uv intensity of 3 mw cm2 was applied the results can be seen in fig 4 b as shown 97 2 degradation efficiency was obtained with 25 mm h2o2 at only 45 min while the degradation efficiency was 73 7 at the same process time with uv photolysis adding h2o2 increased the efficiency and shortened the process time 45 min to achieve similar degradation rate however further increase in h2o2 concentration above 25 mm did not provide additional removal as excess h2o2 may act as a radical scavenger which in turn decreased the degradation efficiency photolysis may occur directly or indirectly the energy provided by the uv rays causes certain chemical reactions such as disintegration isomerization hydrogen atom abstraction intramolecular rearrangements electron transfer in a molecule and dimerization 62 during direct photolysis indirect photolysis occurs when a secondary molecule oxidative radicals undergoes one or more of the above reactions and then reacts with the target pollutant in our case it seems that indirect photolysis is a more likely pathway for tfhfese degradation as uv h2o2 process enhanced the degradation efficiency this may be attributed to the production of oh perhydroxyl radicals ho2 and superoxide anion o2 similar conclusion was stated by another study for the photolysis of 8 2 ftoh 49 for example it was observed that rapid degradation of 8 2 ftoh and simultaneous increase of 8 2 ftal which was determined as degradation byproduct in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 during uv h2o2 aop in 4 h another study reported that uv irradiation was unsuccessful to degrade 6 2 fts as only 10 of removal was achieved using 300 w high pressure mercury lamp 48 however more than 90 degradation efficiency was gained in the presence of h2o2 20 40 mm these studies suggest that oh plays an important role for the degradation of fluorotelomers by uv h2o2 process however this is in contrast to o3 h2o2 process where lower degradation was observed in our study due to presence of hydrogen peroxide fluoride formation was monitored during uv photolysis fig 4 a and uv h2o2 fig 4 b processes for sole uv photolysis sharp increase on fluoride concentration was observed after 60 min of process time the final fluoride concentration was measured as 1 25 ppm corresponding 23 defluorination ratio fig 4 a this ratio was lower than that obtained in ozonation process in spite of much higher degradation rate during uv photolysis this may be attributed to the rapid volatilization of oh group and the formation of lower chained intermediates it seems that formed intermediates cannot be further degraded during uv photolysis fig 4 b shows the fluoride formation during uv h2o2 process as seen much higher fluoride formation of 96 was observed when compared to sole uv photolysis this ratio was very similar to that obtained in sole ozonation process this suggests that with uv light in the presence of h2o2 provided almost complete degradation of tfhfese as well as the formed intermediates during the process to co2 and hf owing to formed hydroxyl radicals 3 3 photodegradation of tfhfese by solar photolysis and solar photolysis h2o2 processes as seen in fig 5 a 76 4 of the initial tfhfese was degraded after only 30 min of solar irradiation with uv intensity of 0 36 mw cm2 increasing light intensity did not increase degradation efficiency 98 2 degradation efficiency was achieved in 45 min final concentration of tfhfese was measured as 0 1 ppm by 99 degradation efficiency for both applied uv intensities in contrast to higher degradation rates only 0 16 ppm fluoride formation was observed after 45 min of process time the final defluorination ratio was only 12 7 similar to uv photolysis while degradation of parent compound was quite high as almost complete degradation was achieved the defluorination ratio was fairly low due to volatilization of oh group and formation of intermediates it can be said that solar photolysis was not efficient to degrade formed intermediates solar photolysis was also applied to tfhfese in the presence of h2o2 and the results are given in fig 5 b as seen tfhfese degradation efficiency was almost the same as single solar photolysis however fluoride release was three times higher during solar photolysis h2o2 process fluoride release was observed within 15 min of process time in contrast to single solar photolysis the defluorination ratio was determined as 35 after 2 h of irradiation time produced hydroxyl radicals may be responsible for higher defluorination ratios obtained in solar photolysis h2o2 process as the solar lamp used in this study has near uv spectra which may be enhanced the absorption of solar photons by h2o2 63 however this ratio was still lower than that obtained in sole ozonation and uv h2o2 processes this can be concluded to inadequate production of hydroxyl radicals during solar photolysis h2o2 process compared to uv h2o2 processes for the process comparison during degradation and defluorination of tfhfese reaction rate constants are given in table 2 the rate constant values of tfhfese degradation were fitted to pseudo first order rate equation and they were determined as 0 0391 0 0526 0 0106 0 0051 0 0566 and 0 063 min 1 for the uv uv h2o2 o3 o3 h2o2 solar photolysis and solar h2o2 respectively for comparison the degradation rate constant was observed as 0 0138 min 1 in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 with uv intensity of 76 5 mw cm2 on photolysis of 8 2 ftoh 49 which was 2 8 order of magnitude lower than the determined value in this study at much lower uv intensity 3 mw cm2 during uv h2o2 process they 49 also determined degradation rate constant in the presence of 100 μm h2o2 at the same uv intensity as 0 0003 min 1 which was 130 order of magnitude lower than found in our study reaction rate of tfhfese defluorination was also calculated by the below equation 4 d f d t k 0 where k 0 is the pseudo zero order rate constant min 1 t is the process time min and f is the fluoride concentration mg l the rate constant values of tfhfese defluorination were determined as 0 0104 0 0420 0 0549 0 0314 0 0029 and 0 0051 mg l 1 min 1 for the uv uv h2o2 o3 o3 h2o2 solar photolysis and solar h2o2 respectively for another comparison of the uv uv h2o2 and o3 processes which provided high degradation defluorination efficiencies energy consumption was also evaluated the energy consumption was calculated for uv based processes as follows 64 5 e u v k w h g t f h f e s e r e m o v e d 1000 x p x t v c 0 c t where e is energy consumption p is power rating of system w t is process time h v is reactor volume l and c0 and ct are initial and final concentration of tfhfese mg l respectively for ozonation following equation is used 6 e o z o n a t i o n k w h g t f h f e s e r e m o v e d r c o 3 p c t 0 p c t t v where r is the energy need for ozone production 15 kw h kg 65 and co3 is the amount of consumed ozone g which was calculated according to eq 7 7 c o 3 q g 0 t o 3 i n l e t d t where qg is the gas ﬂow rate l h and o3 inlet is the inlet o3 concentration mg l accordingly energy consumption values were calculated as 0 93 0 92 and 2 04 kw h g for uv uv h2o2 and ozonation processes respectively the most cost effective process was uv h2o2 in terms of energy consumption however it should be noted that the cost for h2o2 should also be included for operational cost which will increase the cost of uv h2o2 process 3 4 the effect of water matrix on tfhfese degradation by different aops in this part the solution containing the pfas was prepared in river water collected from schuylkill river philadelphia uv photolysis solar photolysis and ozonation processes were performed as seen from fig 6 uv photolysis solar light and ozone can also degrade tfhfese in river water for uv photolysis the removal in di water was higher than that in river water for the initial reaction stage while it became lower than in river water at the late reaction stage for example the removal rates were 57 and 71 in river water and di water respectively at 30 min of process time however at the end of the process the degradation efficiencies were almost identical 98 6 and 97 8 in river water and di water respectively at the initial stage a major percentage of available photon energy may be used for photolysis of inorganic constituents in river water especially nitrite see table 1 once the nitrite is consumed in the solution at the late stage of the reaction the degradation rate of tfhfese may increase in river water besides when nitrite undergoes a photochemical reaction free radicals might be produced which enhance the degradation efficiency at the late stages in the case of ozonation the removal in river water was always lower than in di water the influence of organic and inorganic constituents in river water reduced the degradation rate during ozonation process similar behavior was observed during ozonation of various pollutants for example it was reported that the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene during ozonation process remarkably reduced in tap water as compared to pure water 66 while the degradation efficiency lowered by 12 in 10 min of ozonation higher decrease of 21 was observed at late stage of ozonation it was concluded that the decrease in ozonation was due to the interference of water constituents in particular nom in tap water on ozonation they also observed that high concentrations of nom showed stronger negative effect on the efficiency thus nom may be responsible in the reduction of degradation rate during ozonation because nom would react with ozone 66 it is also known that phosphates can scavenge hydroxyl radicals during ozonation process 67 it was observed that the scavenging effect of phosphates with the concentrations ranging between 7 and 50 mg l during ozonation process was much higher as compared to non buffered system where no phosphates were present 68 in our case since phosphate concentration was about 16 mg l in river water phosphate would reduce the ozonation performance however no significant effect of water matrix was observed for solar photolysis since more than 99 removals were obtained for both di and river water even at the initial stage of the process the removal efficiencies were very similar for instance the removal was 93 3 in di water while it was measured as 93 8 in river water at 30 min of process time the final concentrations of tfhfese were measured as 0 5 0 2 and 3 7 ppm for uv photolysis solar photolysis and ozonation processes respectively very high removal efficiencies were gained for uv processes ozone can also degrade tfhfese but was less effective in river water 3 5 degradation mechanism of tfhfese to further investigate the mechanism of tfhfese degradation by o3 uv uv h2o2 solar and solar h2o2 photolysis processes several experiments were performed using isoproponal as radical scavenger isopropanol i proh is well known as hydroxyl radical scavenger with the reaction rate constant k oh i proh of 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 67 all experiments were conducted under following conditions 3 mw cm2 3 mw cm2 25 mm h2o2 75 l h 75 l h 5 mm h2o2 0 55 mw cm2 and 0 55 mw cm2 25 mm h2o2 for uv uv h2o2 o3 o3 h2o2 solar photolysis and solar h2o2 processes respectively as shown in fig 7 a the defluorination of tfhfese in the presence of i proh was very similar to the results obtained in di water during only ozonation process it is reasonable to suggest that hydroxyl radicals which may be formed by self decomposition of ozone were not the major oxidative species for degradation of tfhfese during ozonation process this can also explain lower degradation ratios in the o3 h2o2 system compared to single ozonation process where higher hydroxyl radical formation can be expected besides as mentioned previously ozonation was less effective in river water which contained nom than in di water due to its possible negative effect of nom thus the degradation of tfhfese by ozone based advanced oxidation processes was mostly promoted by the reaction of ozone and the compound rather than via hydroxyl radicals tfhfese appears to have higher reactivity with ozone than with hydroxyl radicals in the case of solar photolysis and solar photolysis h2o2 system fig 7 b the reduction in defluorination ratio of tfhfese was observed in the presence of i proh however the defluorination ratio decreased more significantly for solar h2o2 system as compared to single solar photolysis while the defluorination ratio of tfhfese was measured as 12 after 2 h of solar photolysis it reduced to 10 with the addition of i proh defluorination ratio was 35 in the solar h2o2 system without i proh but it was noticeably inhibited by addition of i proh with a decrease of 30 this shows that the presence of i proh quenched the generated hydroxyl radicals during solar h2o2 system it may said that tfhfese was degraded by hydroxyl radicals in solar h2o2 process the most significant decrease in the process efficiency was observed for uv h2o2 processes fig 7 c the defluorination ratio decreased to 41 from 96 in the presence of i proh similar to solar photolysis this can be attributed to scavenging activity of i proh which compete with the tfhfese for the hydroxyl radicals in the case of single uv photolysis i proh also decreased the defluorination efficiency however since hydroxyl radical generation was not significant in uv photolysis as it was in uv h2o2 process defluorination ratio decreased by 3 8 resulting in 19 defluorination this demonstrates the lower defluorination ratio obtained in single uv photolysis due to lower hydroxyl radical generation and the role of hydroxyl radicals on the defluorination efficiency of tfhfese further research was performed in order to understand the degradation mechanism during different aops the gc ms chromatogram of uv photolyzed tfhfese is shown in fig sm 3 a the large peaks were observed at m z values of 136 293 313 and 327 based on those identified intermediates the degradation pathway of tfhfese during uv photolysis can be proposed as shown in fig 8 which is indicated by red arrows the formed intermediate m z 327 confirmed the rapid volatilization of the oh group as mentioned in the previous sections then ch2 group abstraction occurs which resulted in the formation of intermediate m z 313 the formed intermediate m z 313 then undergoes hf elimination to give the intermediate m z 293 this is followed by cf2 flake off process causing the formation of intermediate m z 136 the cf2 flake off was also observed during the degradation of ftohs in literature 48 49 the formation of intermediates during ozonation process is shown in fig sm 3 b as seen the large peaks were detected at m z values of 136 293 and 313 it should be noted that the abundance of peaks is much lower comparing both uv processes this explains the higher defluorination ratio of ozonation process and lower defluorination ratios of uv processes it can be said that high amounts of intermediates were formed in uv processes causing lower defluorination ratios comparing uv photolysis the intermediate m z 327 was not observed as vaporization did not take place during ozonation process tfhfese degradation pathway by ozone is shown in fig 8 with blue arrows and as seen the pathway followed the same pathway as occurred in uv photolysis except the formation of intermediate m z 327 the chromatogram of solar irradiated tfhfese is shown in fig sm 3 c as seen in addition to intermediates of uv photolyzed tfhfese the intermediate m z 142 was also identified in solar irradiation process the proposed pathway can be seen in fig 8 with green arrows accordingly degradation pathway of tfhfese by solar irradiation followed the same pathway with uv photolysis process the formation of intermediate m z 327 was also observed in solar irradiation which confirms the volatilization of tfhfese the only difference in degradation pathway compared to uv photolysis process was that after the formation of intermediate m z 293 the degradation could follow two pathways the first one is the formation of intermediate m z 131 due to cf2 flake off and the second one is that the intermediate m z 142 is formed after oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radical and or reactive oxygen species the abundance and number of identified intermediates were higher comparing uv photolysis and ozonation which confirms the much lower defluorination ratio of solar irradiation process 4 conclusion the newly produced replacement pfas 2 1 1 2 trifluoro 2 hepta fluoropyloxy ethylsulfonyl ethanol tfhfese was tested under different processes including aops such as uv photolysis uv h2o2 solar irradiation with and without h2o2 ozonation and o3 h2o2 uv photolysis uv h2o2 solar irradiation and solar irradiation h2o2 provided almost complete degradation efficiencies in terms of parent compound the presence of h2o2 for uv processes increased the defluorination ratio and cut the process time ozonation was also effective with 75 9 degradation efficiency however the degradation efficiency decreased with adding h2o2 in ozonation due to scavenging effect of h2o2 on hydroxyl radical the highest yield of fluoride was obtained for sole ozonation process 98 in spite of complete removal the much lower defluorination ratios for photodegradation processes comparing ozonation was concluded to vaporization of oh group and inadequate degradation of formed intermediates this conclusion was corroborated with the identified degradation by product m z 327 for uv photolysis four intermediates were identified with m z values of 136 293 313 and 327 the mass spectrum of solar irradiated sample showed also an additional by product corresponding m z value of 142 comparing uv photolyzed sample intermediates with m z values of 136 293 and 313 were identified for ozonated sample the degradation pathways during aops involved the loss of ch2 group hf elimination cf2 flake off and oxidative degradations hydroxyl radicals were the main oxidative agents for photodegradation systems however direct reaction with ozone was the major factor for the defluorination and degradation of tfhfese during ozone based aops the effect of water matrix di water and river water on degradation of tfhfese by uv photolysis solar irradiation and ozonation processes was also investigated while inorganic constituents of river water diminished the degradation rate during ozonation no significant effect of water matrix was observed for uv processes except initial stage of uv photolysis in conclusion tfhfese as an alternative to pfas was degradable in aops tested in this study where single ozonation and uv h2o2 processes seemed to be the most effective processes considering degradation and defluorination efficiencies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

13746,due to the phase out of some poly perfluoroalkyl substances pfass different pfass such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs have been adopted as alternatives in the market causing their release into the environment however there is little information about their fate and degradation by advanced oxidation processes aops in literature the aim of the present study is to fill this gap by evaluating the degradability and fate of newly produced polyfluorinated telomer alcohol namely 2 1 1 2 trifluoro 2 hepta fluoropyloxy ethylsulfonyl ethanol tfhfese in different water matrices using various aops including ultraviolet uv photolysis uv h2o2 solar photolysis solar h2o2 o3 and o3 h2o2 while tfhfese was degraded 76 by the ozonation process the presence of h2o2 decreased the process efficiency uv based processes provided 98 7 100 degradation of tfhfese the presence of h2o2 increased the defluorination ratio for uv processes however defluorination ratios were much lower for uv process than that with ozonation process no significant effect of water matrix on the degradation of tfhfese was observed except ozonation the role of hydroxyl radicals for the degradation of tfhfese was investigated using isopropanol i proh the degradation of tfhfese by ozonation was mostly promoted by the reaction of molecular ozone instead of hydroxyl radicals in contrast the presence of i proh quenched the generated hydroxyl radicals during uv based processes indicating degradation was provided by oh the proposed degradation pathways during aops are given which included the loss of ch2 group hf elimination cf2 flake off and oxidative degradations due to volatilization of tfhfese the intermediate m z 327 was also detected for uv based processes keywords aops fluorotelomer alcohol intermediates pfas water matrices 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are extensively recognized as worldwide environmental pollutants due to their bioaccumulative and toxic potential 1 2 long chain length pfass i e c6 for perfluorosulfonic acids pfsas and c7 for perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas are persistent and non biodegradable and have been detected at elevated concentrations in surface waters 3 4 groundwater 5 6 and drinking water 7 8 the manufacture of numerous pfass including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos has been phased out in europe and north america and its precursors were phased out in 2002 9 different pfass have been introduced as replacement chemicals recent production phase outs have led to shifts in formulations frequently to short chain or semi fluorinated substances 10 11 the most common substitute compound used is 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate acid 6 2 fts or its salts and 8 2 fluorotelomer alcohol 8 2 ftoh 12 hence there has been an on going industrial transition for replacement of long chain pfass and their precursors in recent years in addition to this although the manufacture of perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas including pfoa have been mostly controlled they are generated from various precursor compounds such as ftohs 13 15 recent studies showed that atmospheric degradation of ftohs is expected to contribute to the extensive distribution of pfcas 16 17 atmospheric oxidation of ftohs can be originated by reaction with oh radicals 18 it is also observed that cl atoms may initiate the oxidation of ftohs and more than 90 of reactions of both oh radicals and cl atoms with ftohs occur through abstraction of hydrogen atom from the ch2 group 16 to date biotransformation of 6 2 ftoh by microorganisms has been reported in soils 19 20 activated sludge 21 sediments 22 23 and bacterial and fungal cultures 24 25 these studies observed that perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea and perfluorobutyric acid pfba were the final intermediates indicating the formation of pfcas during 6 2 ftoh biotransformation furthermore degradation byproducts including saturated and unsaturated fluorotelomer aldehydes and carboxylic acids were detected which have been found to be more toxic than pfcas 26 recent studies also demonstrated that 6 2 ftoh was the biotransformation byproduct of fluorotelomer based compounds such as 6 2 fluorotelomer iodide 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphates and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaine 25 27 28 consequently it is essential to examine the transformation and degradation products of precursors for avoiding the pollution expansion of pfcas the removal and or degradation of pfass is still a challenge since conventional treatment technologies have been reported ineffective 29 30 therefore there is a growing need for the development of novel and effective processes to provide degradation of pfass for environmental protection advanced oxidation processes aops such as electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic ozonation o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 have been reported to effectively decompose most pfass including pfoa pfos perfluoro decanoic acid pfda perfluoro dodecanoic acid pfdda perfluoro tridecanoic acid pftrda perfluoro tetra decanoic acid pfteda perfluoro hexadecenoic acid pfhxda perfluoro octadecanoic acid pfoda and 6 2 fts 31 39 aops are based on the production of free radicals which are capable of degrading organic contaminants among the free radicals hydroxyl radical oh is one of the most reactive and strongest free radical e 2 33 v reacting with several groups of organic compounds 40 41 uv photolysis uv h2o2 ozonation o3 h2o2 and electrochemical oxidation can generate oh and other free radicals and effectively degrade certain organic pollutants it is well known from literature that the combination of uv with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 provides improved oxidative degradation of contaminants by the production of hydroxyl radicals hydroxyl radicals are generated during uv process via absorption of uv light by h2o2 by means of peroxidic bond photolysis according to the following equation 42 43 1 h2o2 hv 2oh uv based aops degrade pollutants in two ways 1 some pollutants directly absorb uv light and absorption of this high energy radiation can provide destruction of chemical bonds and following breakdown of the pollutant 44 and 2 some organics cannot be degraded very rapidly and effectively by direct photolysis hence h2o2 addition to the uv process produces aop conditions and significantly increases the rate of pollutant degradation h2o2 absorbs uv light and breaks down into oh radicals 45 in the case of ozonation organic contaminants are also oxidized in two ways 1 ozone itself which is a very selective oxidant can directly react with dissolved pollutants 46 and 2 ozone decomposes via a chain reaction mechanism to form hydroxyl radicals which in turn can degrade the pollutant 47 when hydrogen peroxide is added to the ozonation process the decomposition of o3 into oh radicals is enhanced basically shifting the process completely to an aop very few studies have been published on degradation of pfas precursors by advanced oxidation processes for example yang et al investigated 6 2 fts degradation under various aops including uv irradiation uv h2o2 alkaline ozonation peroxone o3 h2o2 and fenton reagent oxidation fe2 h2o2 they observed high yields of so4 2 and f indicating 6 2 fts can be almost completely desulfonated and defluorinated during uv h2o2 process 48 another study evaluated photodegradation of 8 2 ftoh in lake water samples it was observed that hydroxyl radical was the main oxidation agent and nitrate enhanced the photolysis whereas natural organic matter nom diminished it the half life of 8 2 ftoh was determined as 0 83 0 20 h in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 however no significant degradation was observed by direct photolysis 49 the major objective of this study was to evaluate the fate and degradation of a newly produced polyfluorinated telomer alcohol tfhfese which is used in the production of textile leather and paper products by different advanced oxidation processes including uv photolysis uv h2o2 ozonation and o3 h2o2 since there is no study in literature solar and solar h2o2 photolysis of tfhfese was also evaluated furthermore the identification of degradation by products was performed to assess environmental fate of tfhfese and for mechanistic degradation pathways tests were also conducted with river water to evaluate the effect of water matrix on degradation efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples 2 1 1 2 trifluoro 2 hepta fluoropyloxy ethylsulfonyl ethanol the novel polyfluorinated telomer alcohol tfhfese was obtained from merck kgaa germany and its chemical structure can be found in fig 1 hydrogen peroxide 30 wt in h2o and isopropanol 70 in water in volume were purchased from sigma aldrich river water samples were collected from the schuylkill river philadelphia pa representing surface water in eastern pennsylvania usa river water samples were spiked with the target level of tfhfese and its characteristics are listed in table 1 2 2 analytical procedures the analysis of the polyfluorinated telomer alcohol and its degradation by products were performed by liquid liquid extraction lle followed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis 5 ml of sample was placed into a separation funnel then 5 ml of hexane and 2 g of nacl were added the solution was mixed via vortex mixer and allowed for phase separation for 15 s the aqueous phase was discarded and the organic phase was used for analysis the gc ms analysis was performed by an agilent 7890a gc coupled with a 5975c ms in electron ionization ei mode an agilent j w cp6012 capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm film thickness was used high purity helium was used as a carrier gas and purge flow rate was 50 ml min the head pressure was 60 kpa of helium and 5 μl injection volume was used initial oven temperature was 70 c held for 2 min and then ramped to 90 c at a rate of 7 c min finally the oven temperature was ramped to 270 c at 20 c min and held for 5 min while transfer line temperature to the ms was maintained at 230 c ion source temperature was 250 c and electron energy was 70 ev analytes were quantified using a six point calibration curve fig sm 1 calibration standards and one blank sample hexane were run for every batch of 7 samples for quality control spike and recovery experiments were also performed to determine method detection limit mdl and limit of quantification loq for tfhfese and data is presented in table sm 1 mdl and loq were calculated from the concentrations of tfhfese that yielded a signal to noise s n ratio of higher than or equal to 3 and 10 respectively 2 3 aop procedures tfhfese stock solution was made using deionized di water and river water the initial concentration of tfhfese was 10 ppm all the experiments were conducted in a batch mode at room temperature and were duplicated for the ozonation process an ozone generator wedeco usa was used to produce o3 from pure o2 gas 99 9 the o3 concentration in the ozone generator effluent o3 and o2 gas mixture was adjusted by changing the ozone flow rate the reactor column was filled with sample 2 l and the ozone gas was then sparged into the reactor at flow rates of 10 30 and 75 l h through a porous spherical diffuser 30 μm pore diameter placed at the bottom of the reactor mixing was also provided with a magnetic stirrer excess ozone from the reactor was sent to a thermal ozone destruction unit the inlet concentration of ozone in the gas phase was monitored by ozone analyzer and the effluent ozone gas concentration was measured according to the standard method 2350 e the iodometric method with ki solution 50 ozone mass transfer studies were performed for ozonation experiments inlet and outlet ozone concentration in the gas phase was measured via bmt 864c ozone analyzers feed gas flowrates were adjusted as 10 30 and 75 l h the aqueous ozone concentration was also measured in different time intervals using standard iodometry method described elsewhere 51 mass transfer coefficients kla were measured according to the mass balance of ozone at steady state eq 2 2 d c d t k l a c e c where ce is the equilibrium aqueous ozone concentration and c is the dissolved ozone concentration ce values were determined when the concentration of dissolved ozone in water was constant with the ozonation time integration of the equation with boundaries of c 0 at t 0 and c c at t t gives 3 ln c e c c e k l a x t the values of k la min 1 can be determined by plotting ln c e c c e vs time t ozone mass transfer coefficients relative to flow rate can be seen in fig 2 as shown k la values increased with the increase in flow rates for example while ozone mass transfer coefficient was 0 8809 min 1 at 75 l h ozone flow rate it was 0 1659 min 1 for flow rate of 10 l h increase in the gas flow rate enhances the number of bubbles as well as superficial velocity resulting in lower film transfer resistance and higher interfacial surface area this was in agreement with the previously reported studies 52 54 fig 2 for the uv photolysis experiments were conducted using a collimated beam device cbd the uv lamp emitted 244 nm uv light the volume of the solution was 100 ml in each experiment uv intensity was determined with uridine test method and a calibrated radiometer uvx digital radiometer ultraviolet products inc san gabriel ca equipped with 365 or 254 nm sensor to provide accurate results for the uridine test method phosphate buffer solution approx ph 6 88 and 0 007 mol l uridine stock solution were prepared then 0 014 mmol l uridine was prepared by dissolving the stock solution and adding 25 ml of phosphate buffer the petri dish was filled with 100 ml of 0 014 mmol l uridine sample the sample was irradiated for 300 600 900 and 1200 s the samples were then measured at wavelength of 262 nm this protocol was repeated three times and uv intensity was calculated the measured uv intensities by uridine method and a radiometer showed good correlation as indicated in fig sm 2 uv intensity was then adjusted by changing the distance between the petri dish on the base of the stand and the uv lamp for uv h2o2 and o3 h2o2 processes different amounts of h2o2 were added to the solutions the other parts of the experiments were the same as uv photolysis and ozonation processes for the solar photolysis experiments were conducted using a solar lamp emitting 400 nm uv light the power lumen and color temperature of the solar lamp were 1000 w 140 000 lm and 2000 k respectively the volume of the solution was 200 ml in each experiment uv intensity was determined using the approach described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of tfhfese by o3 and o3 h2o2 fig 3 a shows tfhfese degradation efficiencies for different ozone flow rates as shown the ozone flow rate had a significant effect on the fluorotelomer pfas degradation for example ozone flow rate of 30 l h provided higher removal 68 when compared to 50 removal with 10 l h after 120 min of reaction further increase in ozone flow rate to 75 l h also showed an increase on the degradation efficiency approximately 76 this can be expected considering ozone mass transfer coefficients which was determined as the highest with ozone flow rate of 75 l h in literature ozonation process has mostly been found ineffective for well known pfass such as pfoa and pfos with degradation efficiencies ranging between 8 35 32 55 56 on the other hand 6 2 fts was reported as more degradable than pfos in alkaline ozonation process yang 2014 fig 3 a also shows the fluoride release during the ozonation process at 75 l h ozone flow rate after 120 min of process time fluoride concentration was measured as 5 4 ppm which corresponds to almost 98 defluorination huang et al 2016 reported that only 0 5 of fluoride was produced in 4 h by ozonation process 32 lin et al 2012 also stated that pfoa was degraded by 99 in 4 h by altering the ozone dose and solution ph however the ozone flow rate in their study was much higher and provided at higher alkaline condition ph 11 it can be deduced from fig 3 a that the defluorination rate was higher than tfhfese degradation rate during the ozonation process this suggests that the reaction intermediates degraded faster than the parent compound combining o3 with h2o2 to enhance degradation efficiency has been researched for the removal of refractory pollutants 53 57 58 experiments were performed in the presence of h2o2 with concentrations ranging between 5 100 mm as shown in fig 3 b addition of h2o2 reduced the removal of tfhfese the reduction of degradation efficiency was more significant with increasing h2o2 concentrations the negative outcomes with h2o2 addition indicate scavenging of hydroxyl radical by the hydrogen peroxide when h2o2 is in excess relative to aqueous o3 excessive h2o2 would compete with target pollutants for hydroxyl radical 59 61 3 2 degradation of tfhfese by uv photolysis and uv h2o2 aqueous solution of tfhfese was irradiated with uv light of different intensities fig 4 a as shown tfhfese was degraded by almost 50 after 30 min of uv exposure for both uv intensities at the end of process time 2 h the degradation of tfhfese was 93 and 97 8 for uv intensities of 2 1 and 3 mw cm2 respectively the combination of uv irradiation and h2o2 at different concentrations was also examined in this case the uv intensity of 3 mw cm2 was applied the results can be seen in fig 4 b as shown 97 2 degradation efficiency was obtained with 25 mm h2o2 at only 45 min while the degradation efficiency was 73 7 at the same process time with uv photolysis adding h2o2 increased the efficiency and shortened the process time 45 min to achieve similar degradation rate however further increase in h2o2 concentration above 25 mm did not provide additional removal as excess h2o2 may act as a radical scavenger which in turn decreased the degradation efficiency photolysis may occur directly or indirectly the energy provided by the uv rays causes certain chemical reactions such as disintegration isomerization hydrogen atom abstraction intramolecular rearrangements electron transfer in a molecule and dimerization 62 during direct photolysis indirect photolysis occurs when a secondary molecule oxidative radicals undergoes one or more of the above reactions and then reacts with the target pollutant in our case it seems that indirect photolysis is a more likely pathway for tfhfese degradation as uv h2o2 process enhanced the degradation efficiency this may be attributed to the production of oh perhydroxyl radicals ho2 and superoxide anion o2 similar conclusion was stated by another study for the photolysis of 8 2 ftoh 49 for example it was observed that rapid degradation of 8 2 ftoh and simultaneous increase of 8 2 ftal which was determined as degradation byproduct in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 during uv h2o2 aop in 4 h another study reported that uv irradiation was unsuccessful to degrade 6 2 fts as only 10 of removal was achieved using 300 w high pressure mercury lamp 48 however more than 90 degradation efficiency was gained in the presence of h2o2 20 40 mm these studies suggest that oh plays an important role for the degradation of fluorotelomers by uv h2o2 process however this is in contrast to o3 h2o2 process where lower degradation was observed in our study due to presence of hydrogen peroxide fluoride formation was monitored during uv photolysis fig 4 a and uv h2o2 fig 4 b processes for sole uv photolysis sharp increase on fluoride concentration was observed after 60 min of process time the final fluoride concentration was measured as 1 25 ppm corresponding 23 defluorination ratio fig 4 a this ratio was lower than that obtained in ozonation process in spite of much higher degradation rate during uv photolysis this may be attributed to the rapid volatilization of oh group and the formation of lower chained intermediates it seems that formed intermediates cannot be further degraded during uv photolysis fig 4 b shows the fluoride formation during uv h2o2 process as seen much higher fluoride formation of 96 was observed when compared to sole uv photolysis this ratio was very similar to that obtained in sole ozonation process this suggests that with uv light in the presence of h2o2 provided almost complete degradation of tfhfese as well as the formed intermediates during the process to co2 and hf owing to formed hydroxyl radicals 3 3 photodegradation of tfhfese by solar photolysis and solar photolysis h2o2 processes as seen in fig 5 a 76 4 of the initial tfhfese was degraded after only 30 min of solar irradiation with uv intensity of 0 36 mw cm2 increasing light intensity did not increase degradation efficiency 98 2 degradation efficiency was achieved in 45 min final concentration of tfhfese was measured as 0 1 ppm by 99 degradation efficiency for both applied uv intensities in contrast to higher degradation rates only 0 16 ppm fluoride formation was observed after 45 min of process time the final defluorination ratio was only 12 7 similar to uv photolysis while degradation of parent compound was quite high as almost complete degradation was achieved the defluorination ratio was fairly low due to volatilization of oh group and formation of intermediates it can be said that solar photolysis was not efficient to degrade formed intermediates solar photolysis was also applied to tfhfese in the presence of h2o2 and the results are given in fig 5 b as seen tfhfese degradation efficiency was almost the same as single solar photolysis however fluoride release was three times higher during solar photolysis h2o2 process fluoride release was observed within 15 min of process time in contrast to single solar photolysis the defluorination ratio was determined as 35 after 2 h of irradiation time produced hydroxyl radicals may be responsible for higher defluorination ratios obtained in solar photolysis h2o2 process as the solar lamp used in this study has near uv spectra which may be enhanced the absorption of solar photons by h2o2 63 however this ratio was still lower than that obtained in sole ozonation and uv h2o2 processes this can be concluded to inadequate production of hydroxyl radicals during solar photolysis h2o2 process compared to uv h2o2 processes for the process comparison during degradation and defluorination of tfhfese reaction rate constants are given in table 2 the rate constant values of tfhfese degradation were fitted to pseudo first order rate equation and they were determined as 0 0391 0 0526 0 0106 0 0051 0 0566 and 0 063 min 1 for the uv uv h2o2 o3 o3 h2o2 solar photolysis and solar h2o2 respectively for comparison the degradation rate constant was observed as 0 0138 min 1 in the presence of 10 mm h2o2 with uv intensity of 76 5 mw cm2 on photolysis of 8 2 ftoh 49 which was 2 8 order of magnitude lower than the determined value in this study at much lower uv intensity 3 mw cm2 during uv h2o2 process they 49 also determined degradation rate constant in the presence of 100 μm h2o2 at the same uv intensity as 0 0003 min 1 which was 130 order of magnitude lower than found in our study reaction rate of tfhfese defluorination was also calculated by the below equation 4 d f d t k 0 where k 0 is the pseudo zero order rate constant min 1 t is the process time min and f is the fluoride concentration mg l the rate constant values of tfhfese defluorination were determined as 0 0104 0 0420 0 0549 0 0314 0 0029 and 0 0051 mg l 1 min 1 for the uv uv h2o2 o3 o3 h2o2 solar photolysis and solar h2o2 respectively for another comparison of the uv uv h2o2 and o3 processes which provided high degradation defluorination efficiencies energy consumption was also evaluated the energy consumption was calculated for uv based processes as follows 64 5 e u v k w h g t f h f e s e r e m o v e d 1000 x p x t v c 0 c t where e is energy consumption p is power rating of system w t is process time h v is reactor volume l and c0 and ct are initial and final concentration of tfhfese mg l respectively for ozonation following equation is used 6 e o z o n a t i o n k w h g t f h f e s e r e m o v e d r c o 3 p c t 0 p c t t v where r is the energy need for ozone production 15 kw h kg 65 and co3 is the amount of consumed ozone g which was calculated according to eq 7 7 c o 3 q g 0 t o 3 i n l e t d t where qg is the gas ﬂow rate l h and o3 inlet is the inlet o3 concentration mg l accordingly energy consumption values were calculated as 0 93 0 92 and 2 04 kw h g for uv uv h2o2 and ozonation processes respectively the most cost effective process was uv h2o2 in terms of energy consumption however it should be noted that the cost for h2o2 should also be included for operational cost which will increase the cost of uv h2o2 process 3 4 the effect of water matrix on tfhfese degradation by different aops in this part the solution containing the pfas was prepared in river water collected from schuylkill river philadelphia uv photolysis solar photolysis and ozonation processes were performed as seen from fig 6 uv photolysis solar light and ozone can also degrade tfhfese in river water for uv photolysis the removal in di water was higher than that in river water for the initial reaction stage while it became lower than in river water at the late reaction stage for example the removal rates were 57 and 71 in river water and di water respectively at 30 min of process time however at the end of the process the degradation efficiencies were almost identical 98 6 and 97 8 in river water and di water respectively at the initial stage a major percentage of available photon energy may be used for photolysis of inorganic constituents in river water especially nitrite see table 1 once the nitrite is consumed in the solution at the late stage of the reaction the degradation rate of tfhfese may increase in river water besides when nitrite undergoes a photochemical reaction free radicals might be produced which enhance the degradation efficiency at the late stages in the case of ozonation the removal in river water was always lower than in di water the influence of organic and inorganic constituents in river water reduced the degradation rate during ozonation process similar behavior was observed during ozonation of various pollutants for example it was reported that the degradation efficiency of nitrobenzene during ozonation process remarkably reduced in tap water as compared to pure water 66 while the degradation efficiency lowered by 12 in 10 min of ozonation higher decrease of 21 was observed at late stage of ozonation it was concluded that the decrease in ozonation was due to the interference of water constituents in particular nom in tap water on ozonation they also observed that high concentrations of nom showed stronger negative effect on the efficiency thus nom may be responsible in the reduction of degradation rate during ozonation because nom would react with ozone 66 it is also known that phosphates can scavenge hydroxyl radicals during ozonation process 67 it was observed that the scavenging effect of phosphates with the concentrations ranging between 7 and 50 mg l during ozonation process was much higher as compared to non buffered system where no phosphates were present 68 in our case since phosphate concentration was about 16 mg l in river water phosphate would reduce the ozonation performance however no significant effect of water matrix was observed for solar photolysis since more than 99 removals were obtained for both di and river water even at the initial stage of the process the removal efficiencies were very similar for instance the removal was 93 3 in di water while it was measured as 93 8 in river water at 30 min of process time the final concentrations of tfhfese were measured as 0 5 0 2 and 3 7 ppm for uv photolysis solar photolysis and ozonation processes respectively very high removal efficiencies were gained for uv processes ozone can also degrade tfhfese but was less effective in river water 3 5 degradation mechanism of tfhfese to further investigate the mechanism of tfhfese degradation by o3 uv uv h2o2 solar and solar h2o2 photolysis processes several experiments were performed using isoproponal as radical scavenger isopropanol i proh is well known as hydroxyl radical scavenger with the reaction rate constant k oh i proh of 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 67 all experiments were conducted under following conditions 3 mw cm2 3 mw cm2 25 mm h2o2 75 l h 75 l h 5 mm h2o2 0 55 mw cm2 and 0 55 mw cm2 25 mm h2o2 for uv uv h2o2 o3 o3 h2o2 solar photolysis and solar h2o2 processes respectively as shown in fig 7 a the defluorination of tfhfese in the presence of i proh was very similar to the results obtained in di water during only ozonation process it is reasonable to suggest that hydroxyl radicals which may be formed by self decomposition of ozone were not the major oxidative species for degradation of tfhfese during ozonation process this can also explain lower degradation ratios in the o3 h2o2 system compared to single ozonation process where higher hydroxyl radical formation can be expected besides as mentioned previously ozonation was less effective in river water which contained nom than in di water due to its possible negative effect of nom thus the degradation of tfhfese by ozone based advanced oxidation processes was mostly promoted by the reaction of ozone and the compound rather than via hydroxyl radicals tfhfese appears to have higher reactivity with ozone than with hydroxyl radicals in the case of solar photolysis and solar photolysis h2o2 system fig 7 b the reduction in defluorination ratio of tfhfese was observed in the presence of i proh however the defluorination ratio decreased more significantly for solar h2o2 system as compared to single solar photolysis while the defluorination ratio of tfhfese was measured as 12 after 2 h of solar photolysis it reduced to 10 with the addition of i proh defluorination ratio was 35 in the solar h2o2 system without i proh but it was noticeably inhibited by addition of i proh with a decrease of 30 this shows that the presence of i proh quenched the generated hydroxyl radicals during solar h2o2 system it may said that tfhfese was degraded by hydroxyl radicals in solar h2o2 process the most significant decrease in the process efficiency was observed for uv h2o2 processes fig 7 c the defluorination ratio decreased to 41 from 96 in the presence of i proh similar to solar photolysis this can be attributed to scavenging activity of i proh which compete with the tfhfese for the hydroxyl radicals in the case of single uv photolysis i proh also decreased the defluorination efficiency however since hydroxyl radical generation was not significant in uv photolysis as it was in uv h2o2 process defluorination ratio decreased by 3 8 resulting in 19 defluorination this demonstrates the lower defluorination ratio obtained in single uv photolysis due to lower hydroxyl radical generation and the role of hydroxyl radicals on the defluorination efficiency of tfhfese further research was performed in order to understand the degradation mechanism during different aops the gc ms chromatogram of uv photolyzed tfhfese is shown in fig sm 3 a the large peaks were observed at m z values of 136 293 313 and 327 based on those identified intermediates the degradation pathway of tfhfese during uv photolysis can be proposed as shown in fig 8 which is indicated by red arrows the formed intermediate m z 327 confirmed the rapid volatilization of the oh group as mentioned in the previous sections then ch2 group abstraction occurs which resulted in the formation of intermediate m z 313 the formed intermediate m z 313 then undergoes hf elimination to give the intermediate m z 293 this is followed by cf2 flake off process causing the formation of intermediate m z 136 the cf2 flake off was also observed during the degradation of ftohs in literature 48 49 the formation of intermediates during ozonation process is shown in fig sm 3 b as seen the large peaks were detected at m z values of 136 293 and 313 it should be noted that the abundance of peaks is much lower comparing both uv processes this explains the higher defluorination ratio of ozonation process and lower defluorination ratios of uv processes it can be said that high amounts of intermediates were formed in uv processes causing lower defluorination ratios comparing uv photolysis the intermediate m z 327 was not observed as vaporization did not take place during ozonation process tfhfese degradation pathway by ozone is shown in fig 8 with blue arrows and as seen the pathway followed the same pathway as occurred in uv photolysis except the formation of intermediate m z 327 the chromatogram of solar irradiated tfhfese is shown in fig sm 3 c as seen in addition to intermediates of uv photolyzed tfhfese the intermediate m z 142 was also identified in solar irradiation process the proposed pathway can be seen in fig 8 with green arrows accordingly degradation pathway of tfhfese by solar irradiation followed the same pathway with uv photolysis process the formation of intermediate m z 327 was also observed in solar irradiation which confirms the volatilization of tfhfese the only difference in degradation pathway compared to uv photolysis process was that after the formation of intermediate m z 293 the degradation could follow two pathways the first one is the formation of intermediate m z 131 due to cf2 flake off and the second one is that the intermediate m z 142 is formed after oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radical and or reactive oxygen species the abundance and number of identified intermediates were higher comparing uv photolysis and ozonation which confirms the much lower defluorination ratio of solar irradiation process 4 conclusion the newly produced replacement pfas 2 1 1 2 trifluoro 2 hepta fluoropyloxy ethylsulfonyl ethanol tfhfese was tested under different processes including aops such as uv photolysis uv h2o2 solar irradiation with and without h2o2 ozonation and o3 h2o2 uv photolysis uv h2o2 solar irradiation and solar irradiation h2o2 provided almost complete degradation efficiencies in terms of parent compound the presence of h2o2 for uv processes increased the defluorination ratio and cut the process time ozonation was also effective with 75 9 degradation efficiency however the degradation efficiency decreased with adding h2o2 in ozonation due to scavenging effect of h2o2 on hydroxyl radical the highest yield of fluoride was obtained for sole ozonation process 98 in spite of complete removal the much lower defluorination ratios for photodegradation processes comparing ozonation was concluded to vaporization of oh group and inadequate degradation of formed intermediates this conclusion was corroborated with the identified degradation by product m z 327 for uv photolysis four intermediates were identified with m z values of 136 293 313 and 327 the mass spectrum of solar irradiated sample showed also an additional by product corresponding m z value of 142 comparing uv photolyzed sample intermediates with m z values of 136 293 and 313 were identified for ozonated sample the degradation pathways during aops involved the loss of ch2 group hf elimination cf2 flake off and oxidative degradations hydroxyl radicals were the main oxidative agents for photodegradation systems however direct reaction with ozone was the major factor for the defluorination and degradation of tfhfese during ozone based aops the effect of water matrix di water and river water on degradation of tfhfese by uv photolysis solar irradiation and ozonation processes was also investigated while inorganic constituents of river water diminished the degradation rate during ozonation no significant effect of water matrix was observed for uv processes except initial stage of uv photolysis in conclusion tfhfese as an alternative to pfas was degradable in aops tested in this study where

13747,coke oven wastewater contains an array of hazardous pollutants like cyanide phenol ammoniacal n etc the main objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of phycoremediation technique as tertiary treatment for simultaneous removal of three model pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from secondary treated coke oven wastewater a green route was employed for the treatment of coke oven wastewater via the use of tetraspora sp nitd 18 collected from a contaminated site strain susceptibility was tested for the growth in the simulated solution of phenol 10 300 mg l ammoniacal n 100 800 mg l and cyanide 1 10 mg l and subsequently optimum concentration was assessed as 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively ph 7 and inoculum concentration 10 was found suitable for the removal of phenol 79 02 6 93 ammoniacal n 74 7 5 07 and cyanide 80 4 0 015 from their individual solution at optimal initial concentrations after 14 days for solutions of individual pollutants preferred pollutants were examined on the basis of production of biomass with respect to time and found the following order ammoniacal n phenol cyanide the solution of mixed pollutants was prepared by mixing the said pollutants at their optimal level of initial concentrations at a suitable ph 7 such a solution was termed as simulated coke oven wastewater scow while the present investigation deals with co current removal of pollutants from simulated coke oven wastewater scow and real secondary treated coke oven wastewater at laboratory scale the continuous study on real wastewater at industrial scale with the isolated algal strain is the scope of the future work keywords phycoremediation coke oven wastewater phenol ammoniacal n cyanide 1 introduction coke production is an important process in the steel and iron industry which is done in the coke oven plant two types of coke oven plants are operated in industries they are beehive type and by product recovery type while coke is the only product in the beehive type plant a number of by products are produced in by product recovery type coke oven plant and hence a huge amount of water is used in different units such as quenching of coke ammonia stripping scrubbing of gas and by product recovery and subsequently the major fraction of this water is transformed to wastewater containing an array of hazardous pollutants such as ammoniacal n cyanide thiocyanate phenol heterocyclic compounds poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs etc 1 3 such wastewater is termed as coke oven wastewater cow generally 1000 tons of coke production requires approximately 4000 m3 of water and finally around 1000 m3 water is transformed as coke oven wastewater 3 4 the presence of different pahs and heterocyclic compounds along with ammoniacal n cyanide and phenol in coke oven wastewater depend on the different factors such as raw coal quality carbonization temperature and byproduct recovery methods 2 4 a typical raw cow composition ammoniacal n 120 790 mg l phenol 150 1200 mg l and cyanide 5 20 mg l was described by kwiecińska et al 5 cyanide is a highly toxic ion that inhibits cellular respiration and adversely affects the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem 6 organic pollutants such as phenol pahs are carcinogenic and highly toxic in nature 1 phenol has adverse effects on the replication and synthesis of dna in the cells 7 according to the environmental protection agency epa phenol is listed as a priority pollutant 8 ammoniacal n also deteriorates the quality of water and aquatic lives thus cow can be considered as a major problem from environmental perspectives the standard values of cyanide ammoniacal n and phenol in effluent wastewater are set as 0 2 mg l 50 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively is 2490 and for drinking water the permissible limit of phenol is 0 001 mg l is 10 500 cyanide is 0 05 mg l is 10 500 and ammoniacal n is 0 2 mg l 9 conventional treatment methods in the coke oven effluent treatment plant are as follows firstly removal of suspended solids grease and oil is done in the equalization tank pre primary treatment chemical oxygen demand cod of wastewater is removed next using physico chemical methods primary treatment and finally biological secondary treatment method is employed for the removal of biologically degradable pollutants 10 physico chemical methods as used for treatment of coke oven wastewater are as follows i adsorption 10 ii coagulation 2 iii oxidation 11 iv precipitation 12 v ozonation 13 vi electrolysis 14 and v membrane based techniques 15 16 etc while physico chemical primary treatment is advertently used for the reduction of the ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod to biological oxygen demand bod below or equal to 0 5 i e cod bod 0 5 scientists pointed out on the limitations of such processes chang et al 13 compared ion exchange chemical oxidation and adsorption using activated carbon methods for removal of organic matter and colour from coke oven wastewater after a thorough study they opined that these processes are having the disadvantages of the high cost of sludge management the cost involved for activated carbon regeneration and sludge disposal 13 in a separate study sharma et al 2 stated that the physico chemical methods for treatment of coke oven wastewater are costly and unsustainable methods while biological treatment processes are preferred choice for treatment of coke oven wastewater due to its efficiency and cost effectiveness singh et al 11 reviewed different methods for treatment of coke oven wastewater such as coagulation adsorption nano filtration and reverse osmosis combined biological and ultra filtration etc and opined that these processes are costly and complicated li et al 17 indicated the advanced oxidation process as more effective one for degradation and mineralization of industrial wastewater than other treatment processes such as adsorption coagulation precipitation and membrane separation in a recent study panigrahy et al 18 assessed different methods such as photocatalysis adsorption electrolysis advanced oxidation and membrane based techniques for phenol treatment from coke oven wastewater and commented that all have some limitations such as production of secondary toxic byproducts unsustainability and high cost recently developed efficient methods for treatment of coke oven wastewater have been reviewed and incorporated in table s1 and attached as annexure i in supplementary file while physico chemical primary treatment is used for the reduction of cod bod ratio biological secondary treatment is used for removal of biodegradable pollutants the biological treatment unit employing bacteria is an integrated part of the effluent treatment plant etp for secondary treatment of coke oven wastewater biological treatment process is widely used due to its high removal efficiency and relatively low cost 2 13 even though the biological treatment is relatively cheap and environmentally friendly well established process it fails to decrease the pollutant concentration below the permissible limit as set by regulatory authorities cpcb bis epa etc due to poor maintenance of the treatment plant and here lies the importance of tertiary treatment of wastewater to meet the statutory limit in the present study secondary treated coke oven wastewater coming from bod plant was found to contain higher concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide than their corresponding permissible limits industries generally use the chlorinated compound for further treatment of wastewater which is highly undesirable from the following perspectives 1 generation of secondary pollutants owing to the addition of chlorine in wastewater 2 increase in the cost of the process 3 non recyclable nature of treated wastewater in the process due to presence of chlorinated compounds 19 therefore a green environmentally benign cheap tertiary treatment method is in search to achieve the goal of 3 r s reduce recover and reuse in the present article authors have proposed phycoremediation technique employing microalgae as tertiary treatment of coke oven wastewater to meet the standard limits as set by regulatory bodies the autotrophic nutrition via the usage of solar power for the production of food utilization of the pollutants present in wastewater as their nutrient source and capability of growth in natural condition 20 and thereby reduction in operating cost make the algal system a suitable choice for tertiary treatment of wastewater in addition to the secondary treatment employing bacterial community moreover the produced biomass can further be used for the production of value added products depending on its biomolecules content the advantages of phycoremediation technology can be summarized as follows i reduction of the pollutants to meet the standard values ii relatively cheaper and eco friendly iii having the prospect of production of value added products from spent algal biomass and finally iv reusability of tertiary treated water for the same purpose or others therefore phycoremediation can be considered as a clean tertiary treatment technology for the removal of toxic pollutants present in the secondary treated wastewater without emitting any toxic gases in the present work tetraspora sp nitd 18 a microalgal strain collected from the contaminated site was used for the treatment of priority pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide both from individual simulated solutions and from mixed solutions designated as simulated coke oven wastewater scow while the usage of tetraspora sp in the field of hydrogen production is quite common in literature 21 23 the effectiveness of the same in the treatment of wastewater has not been studied much hence there is a scope to explore the possible usages of tetraspora sp in phycoremediation field the adaptive laboratory evolution method 24 was followed to attain the desired efficiency of the collected strain for the efficient treatment of wastewater the growth rate and biomass productivity of tetraspora sp nitd 18 have also been examined in the present article as far as known only a limited research work was carried out for simultaneous removal of pollutants from real secondary treated coke oven wastewater using microalgae 25 26 however few works were reported on phycoremediation of individual pollutants from wastewater several articles on the removal of phenol from different sources using microalgae were reported in the literature 27 28 the microalgal strains used for such purpose were chlorella sp sendesmus sp tribonema minus isochrysis galbana etc 27 29 a comparative study was performed by gurbuz et al 30 for cyanide detoxification using three different algal strains such as chlorella sp scenedesmus sp and arthrospira maxima where scenedesmus obliquus showed maximum 99 removal in another study the efficiency of scenedesmus obliquus was examined by gurbuz et al 31 for removal of cyanide from mining process wastewater sen et al 25 proclaimed 96 5 cyanide removal from synthetic coke oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium liu et al 32 examined the tolerance of scenedesmus obliquus for different ammonium concentrations 30 70 mg l in free and immobilized forms in recent work simultaneous removal of ammoniacal n phenol and nitrate from coke oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium was investigated by rai et al 26 the main objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of phycoremediation technique as tertiary treatment for simultaneous removal of three model pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from secondary treated coke oven wastewater the novelty of the present work is as follows i phycoremediation technique was applied for simultaneous removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from coke oven wastewater ii produced biomass was used for the assessment of its macromolecule content iii tetraspora sp nitd 18 was tested for treatment of real secondary treated coke oven wastewater 2 materials and methods experiments

maintained at 9 to avoid the growth of other organisms 34 algal incubator lab x m s atlanta drugs and chemicals kolkata west bengal india was used for the incubation of laboratory culture for 12 days at specified conditions such as light intensity 2400 lx at the regular cycle of the day night 16 8 at temperature 25 2 flasks were placed in a shaker with shaking speed 110 rpm to ensure the well mixing of the culture during cultivation about 1 0 ml of grown culture was added to luria bertani lb medium himedia india and incubated in the bod incubator modern instrument kolkata india for checking the bacterial contamination however bacterial growth was not found a small pinch of 10 days old axenic microalgal sample was then poured and spread on bg 11 agar containing plates the plates were then placed in the algal incubator after 4 days the grown algal sample was picked from the plates and streaked on fresh bg 11 agar plates the streaking process was followed for getting uniculture which was examined using a trinocular microscope leica dm 2500 uk lastly the microalgal sample was cultured in sterile bg 11 medium and kept in the incubator for cultivation 35 such culture was considered as the main culture it was maintained by changing the medium after every 12 days interval molecular identification was done after dna isolation from the cells and 18s rrna gene sequencing

isolate an axenic and unicultured microalgal isolate 30 ml was taken from the main culture and subcultured in 500 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 270 ml of sterile bg 11 medium at ph 7 in the algal incubator for 18 days for growth study 12 days grown sample selected based on the green colour of culture was inoculated in bg 11 medium and a specific amount of samples were collected at regular intervals samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min to harvest the produced biomass the supernatant was decanted and the pellet was washed with distilled water twice the pellets were used for measurement of dry biomass concentration dbc and extraction of chlorophyll and biomolecules such as carbohydrate and protein for measurement of dbc biomass was kept in hot air oven universal hot air oven ambala india at temperature 65 2 for overnight chlorophyll content was estimated following hot extraction method 36 37 the homogenized algal suspension 10 ml was taken and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the washed biomass was mixed with 10 ml of 95 methanol the mixture was placed in a hot water bath 60 for 30 min the green coloured sample was extracted in methanol solution finally the chlorophyll content was determined by measuring absorbance at 650 nm and 665 nm using a spectrophotometer genesys 20 thermo scientific india for protein estimation the folin lowry method was used 38 a specified amount of culture broth was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the pellet was mixed with 1 0 ml of lowery reagent and incubated in dark condition for 20

carbohydrate was assessed using the phenol h2so4 method 39 the suitable amount of harvested biomass was treated with 0 5 ml of 5 phenol and 2 5 ml of concentrated h2so4 was then added the solution was thoroughly mixed using vortex an mx 100 antech india the mixture was placed in hot water for 15 min and transferred to ice chilled water for a colour generation absorbance was taken at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer 2 3 studies of phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide 2 3 1 susceptibility test of algal isolate in simulated solutions of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide appropriate treatment of cow is the need of the hour the presence of pollutants and concentration of pollutants vary from one plant to other plants it mainly depends on different factors such as the quality of raw coal carbonization temperature byproducts recovery methods treatment methods of wastewater etc 40 41 the capacity of degradability and tolerance level of microalgae towards the pollutants differ from one species to another 8 42 43 therefore the isolated algal sample was tested in the presence of different concentrations of phenol 10 250 mg l ammoniacal n 100 800 mg l and cyanide 1 10 mg l the lower range of concentration was selected based both on the results of physico chemical analysis of collected real secondary treated coke oven wastewater and on the data available in the literature 44 45 the higher range was chosen based on the range of concentrations of the pollutants in the raw coke oven wastewater as available in the literature 5 40 44 standard 1000 mg l solutions of phenol and ammoniacal n were prepared by adding 1 0 g and 3 819 g of phenol merck india and ammonium chloride merck india respectively in 1000 ml of sterile mili q water standard 1000 mg l of cyanide solution merck india was used for the preparation of a simulated cyanide solution specified volume was taken from standard solution and requisite dilution was prepared by the addition of sterile bg 11 medium isolated algal sample 12 days aged culture was inoculated in simulated solutions of these three pollutants separately initial ph was maintained at 7 and 10 v v was used as inoculum from the growth study it is seen that microalgae enter the death phase after 14 days therefore biomass was harvested after 14 days of incubation by centrifugation and kept in hot air oven overnight to get the dbc the growth of algal sample at different concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide was measured in terms of produced biomass the supernatant was used for measurement of the residual concentration of cyanide phenol and ammoniacal n phenol and ammoniacal n were examined using standard american public health association apha protocols 46 phenol reacts with 4 amino antipyrine in presence of potassium ferricyanide at ph 10 to form a stable reddish brown coloured antipyrine dye the amount of colour produced is a function of the concentration of phenol absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer genesys 20 thermo scientific india ammoniacal n was analysed by spectrophotometric nesserlers reagent method and absorbance was measured at 425 nm wavelength cyanide was examined using ion chromatography system metrohm ag switzerland herisau in the present study two controls were used for comparing all the experimental data the bg 11 medium inoculated with the microalgal isolate biotic control and the simulated solutions of these three pollutants without inoculation abiotic control were incubated in the algal incubator under identical conditions the initial concentrations of pollutants phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide were chosen on the basis of optimum dbc and removal of pollutants for carrying out further experiments 2 3 2 effects of environmental factors on phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide bioremoval of pollutants and growth of microalgae are dependent on macro and micro environmental factors they are ph inoculum concentration of culture initial concentration of pollutants etc the initial concentration of phenol 100 mg l ammoniacal n 400 mg l and cyanide 2 mg l were decided from the results of subsection 2 3 1 thus the effect of ph and inoculum concentration of algae was assessed next for the betterment of phycoremediation process and growth of algae in order to know the effect of environmental factors culture was incubated for 12 days in the algal incubator at the specific environmental condition the initial ph of the medium was varied from 7 to 9 keeping inoculum concentration of algae 10 initial concentration of phenol 100 mg l ammoniacal n 400 mg l and cyanide 2 mg l constant next the inoculum concentration of algae was changed in the range of 5 15 at a suitable ph finally suitable values of factors were chosen judiciously based on the maximum removal of pollutants maximum produced biomass and economic point of view 2 3 3 variation of phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from individual solutions using microalgal isolate with time the isolated strain was cultured separately in each of the model pollutants like phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at their initial concentrations of 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively inoculum concentration and initial ph of medium were set at 10 and 7 respectively the isolated sample was cultured in 100 ml flasks containing 50 ml of the simulated solution of each pollutant all flasks were kept in the algal incubator for 14 days under aseptic conditions to ensure for proper mixing the flasks were shaken at a shaking speed of 110 rpm flasks were placed according to the number of incubation days on every two days of intervals three sets of flasks were taken for sample analysis samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was analysed for residual concentration of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide and harvested biomass was used for measurement of dbc finally a comparative study was performed on the basis of produced biomass to decide the preferred pollutants for the growth of test strain 2 4 biomass characterization the isolated algal sample was cultured in both bg 11 untreated sample and in simulated solutions of individual pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide and kept in the algal incubator for 14 days treated sample after the incubation period sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min harvested biomass was dried in a hot air oven dry biomass samples treated and untreated were analysed using chns analyser thermo scientific flashsmart elemental analysers india using methionine as the reference standard for calibration 2 5 phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from simulated and real wastewater and assessment of concentrations of biomolecules from produced biomass cow was found contaminated mainly with phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide therefore in present work simulated coke oven wastewater scow 2 l was prepared by adding phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide solution in a requisite volume to sterile bg 11 medium to attain the initial concentrations 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively ph was adjusted at 7 scow was then inoculated with isolated algal strain with optimal inoculum concentration 10 and incubated in the algal incubator under the aseptic condition for 14 days samples were collected at every two days intervals and used for the analysis of residual concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide the produced biomass was harvested and used for the measurement of dbc chlorophyll content and concentrations of biomolecules such as carbohydrate and protein real secondary treated coke oven wastewater rcow was collected from the outfall of the coke oven plant west bengal india rcow was analysed to assess its contamination load after collection raw wastewater was filtered with 42 graded whatman paper to remove the suspended solids the filtrate was further filtered with sterile 0 2 μm pore sized axiva pvdf syringe 25 mm filter to restrict the microbes and to prevent the degradation of heat sensitive pollutants like phenol and cyanide finally the filtrate was analysed for ph using ph meter gold 533 digital instruments corporation india the concentrations of ammoniacal n phenol and cyanide were measured following the protocols as mentioned in subsection 2 3 1 the isolated algal sample was inoculated in 100 ml of both undiluted and diluted rcow 1 1 diluted with sterile bg 11 medium the algal cultures were incubated in the algal incubator for 14 days under germ free conditions the samples were collected after two days interval and analysed for concentrations of residual pollutants biomass and biomolecules 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using graph pad prism 5 01 one way anova tukey test was tested for the removal of pollutants phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at initial different ph and inoculum concentration a nonparametric t test unpaired t test was performed to examine the significance between individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater solution scow for removal of pollutants 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification and growth study of microalgae in bg 11 medium the morphological study of the axenic microalgal sample has shown that it is round shaped single celled green algae fig 1 a molecular identification has been done after 18s rrna sequencing the phylogenetic tree is shown in fig 1 b the sequence has been deposited to national center for biotechnology information ncbi database https www ncbi nlm nih gov and an accession number mh793465 of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been generated the growth of tetraspora sp nitd 18 in bg 11 medium is shown in fig 1 c four distinct phases have clearly been observed in the growth curve of the algal culture they are i preparatory phase 0th to 4th day here cells have been adapted to the new surrounding environmental conditions and a minute increase in biomass concentration 67 5 0 063 mg l to 125 0 057 mg l has been seen ii exponential phase 4th to 14thday cells starts to produce primary metabolites which they use in their growth and metabolic activities and maximum increase in biomass concentration 125 0 057 mg l to 520 5 0 121 mg l is observed in this phase iii plateau phase 14th to 16th day cell biomass production rate and cell death rate become equal and secondary metabolites are produced in this stage to avoid the stress condition nutrients limitation and a biomass concentration 520 5 0 121 mg l to 521 0 184 mg l remains almost constant and finally iv decline phase 16th to 18th day due to lack of nutrients active cells become die and a decrease in concentration is observed during this stage 521 0 184 mg l to 503 0 086 mg l following similar trend as that of dbc concentrations of chlorophyll 0 46 0 047 mg l to 1 47 0 143 mg l carbohydrate 32 5 2 88 mg l to 217 5 8 66 mg l and protein 12 5 7 21 mg l to 158 8 1 44 mg l initially increase from 0th to 14th days and then they decrease chlorophyll 1 47 0 143 mg l to 1 25 0 181 mg l carbohydrate 217 5 8 66 mg l to 198 10 96 mg l and protein 158 8 1 44 mg l to 123 7 5 77 mg l during 14th to 18th days of culturing 33 during the exponential stage of culture the growth rate of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been calculated mathematically 47 for the calculation of the specific growth rate the following equation has been used 1 d x d t μ x where μ specific growth rate day 1 x biomass concentration g l and t time after integration of eq 1 with following limits at t 0 x x 0 and t t x x the following equation is obtained 2 ln x x 0 μ t eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 x x 0 e μ t by curve fitting of the growth data of tetraspora sp nitd 18 using microsoft excel office 2016 the specific growth rate has been found as μ 0 2272 day 1 the overall productivity of biomass has been calculated for the present strain in a specified condition of culture using the following equation 48 49 4 y o v e r a l l x n x 0 t n t 0 where y o v e r a l l overall productivity g l day x n dry biomass concentration obtained at 14 days of incubation g l x 0 initial dry biomass concentration as obtained on 0th day g l t n total incubation time 14 days day and t 0 initial time 0th day of the experiment day the overall productivity of dry biomass of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been obtained after 14 days of incubation as 0 024 g l day 3 2 susceptibility test of microalgae in simulated solutions of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide tetraspora sp nitd 18 was tested for its survivability on different pollutants at varying concentrations of the pollutants such as phenol 10 250 mg l ammoniacal n 100 800 mg l and cyanide 1 10 mg l fig 2 a c the lower range of concentration was selected based both on the results of physico chemical analysis of collected real secondary treated coke oven wastewater and on the data available in the literature 44 45 the higher range was chosen based on the range of concentrations of the pollutants as available in the literature 5 40 44 the maximum increase in dbc has been obtained as 5 3 5 9 and 4 5 fold when the strain has been grown in phenol 10 mg l ammoniacal n 100 mg l and cyanide 1 mg l solutions separately after 14 days of incubation an increase in the dbc of algal strain in the presence of pollutants has set a presumption that phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide may be utilized as a nutrient source for its growth 25 growth of the algal strain has been restricted beyond the concentration of 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l for phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide respectively dry biomass concentrations decrease from 0 404 0 001 g l to 0 131 0 012 g l from 0 444 0 019 g l to 0 301 0 009 g l and from 0 35 0 006 g l to 0 179 0 011 g l when initial concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide varies in the range of 10 300 mg l 100 800 mg l and 1 3 mg l respectively after 14 days of incubation this may be due to the interference of the pollutants to the metabolic activity of the algae at their higher concentrations 27 50 after the judicial inspection of fig 2 a c 100 mg l phenol 400 mg l ammoniacal n and 2 mg l cyanide have been selected as suitable initial concentrations such selection has been based on the production of optimum dbc phenol 0 351 0 008 g l ammoniacal n 0 402 0 007 g l and cyanide 0 34 0 015 g l the corresponding consumption of the pollutants are as follows 3 73 3 17 mg for phenol 14 16 13 04 mg for ammoniacal n and 0 074 0 94 mg for cyanide the next set of experiments have been performed at these concentrations the biomass productivity has been calculated using eq 4 for different pollutants at different initial concentrations table 1 shows overall productivities of tetraspora sp nitd 18 at different concentrations of pollutants the biomass productivities of tetraspora sp nitd 18 for phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at different concentration have been tested for checking the tolerance level of pollutants biomass productivity increases with a decrease in the initial concentrations of pollutant as shown in table 1 maximum productivity for individual pollutants has been obtained at the lowest initial concentration of phenol 10 mg l ammoniacal n 100 mg l and cyanide 1 mg l based on the data of overall productivity table 1 ammoniacal n is found most suitable for the growth of algae as compared to phenol and cyanide 3 3 effects of environmental factors on phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide the performance of biological agents in the removal of pollutants depends on micro and macro environmental factors such as ph inoculum concentration etc 28 51 hence ph 7 9 and inoculum concentration of test strain 5 15 have been varied in a judicial manner the variation of algal growth in terms of dbc and removal of different pollutants with respect to such factors have been examined the effect of ph and inoculum concentrations are showed in figs 3 a c and 4 a c respectively 3 3 1 effect of ph tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been grown in simulated solutions of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at variable initial ph 7 9 fig 3 a c an increase in both dbc 0 345 0 006 g l to 0 364 0 005 g l and removal of phenol 69 9 1 08 76 5 0 055 have been observed when ph increases from 7 to 9 fig 3 a the degradation of phenol and growth of microorganisms both depend on the ph and the microbial species 28 the microalgal degradation of phenol from synthetic coke oven wastewater in alkaline condition ph 10 was found optimum 52 visviki and santikul 53 reported that several algal species prefer neutral ph like 7 7 6 whereas surkatti et al 28 reviewed that chlorella sp and spirulina sp prefer ph 8 9 therefore effective ph for growth of algae and phenol degradation varies from species to species similarly the present strain prefers to grow at ph 7 and prefers to remove phenol at ph 9 when algal strain has been grown in ammoniacal n solution with the increase in ph from 7 to 9 a decrease in dbc 0 389 0 003 g l to 0 326 0 005 g l is found while an increase in removal 68 78 3 80 75 18 0 35 is obtained fig 3 b maximum dbc 0 389 0 003 g l has been obtained at ph 7 while maximum ammoniacal n removal 75 18 0 35 has been achieved at ph 9 equilibrium ratio of nh3 nh4 mainly relies on the ph of the solution at higher ph ammonium ion converts to ammonia which volatilizes out from the solution 54 ammonia gas is permeable to the cell membrane of microalgae and it inhibits the photosynthetic activity of microalgae and thus cell growth is restricted 55 maximum cyanide removal 73 9 0 01 and maximum dbc 0 327 0 003 g l have been obtained at ph 9 fig 3 c the biomass at ph 7 is observed as 0 303 0 006 g l which is comparatively the same as that obtained at ph 9 from an economic point of view it is preferred to treat real wastewater at its own ph therefore ph 7 has been selected for further studies on phycoremediation of pollutants from cow the removal of phenol 69 9 1 08 ammoniacal n 68 78 3 80 and cyanide 68 65 0 002 and their respective dbc of 0 345 0 006 g l 0 389 0 003 g l and 0 303 0 006 g l have been obtained at ph 7 one way anova tukey test using software graph pad prism 5 01 has been performed for examining the effect of initial ph on the removal of different concentration of the pollutants as shown in table s2 attached as annexure ii in supplementary file it is seen that change in initial ph from 7 to 8 and 9 change the removal of phenol and ammoniacal n significantly but change in initial ph from 8 to 9 do not for cyanide enhancement of initial ph to 9 from 7 and 8 change the removal ability significantly the research group also tested the ph before and after the treatment of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide individually only in case of ammoniacal n after removal major ph drop was observed as 9 to 6 9 8 to 6 8 and 7 to 6 8 however in case of phenol and cyanide the ph drop was not higher final ph lies in the range of initial ph 0 05 the import of ammoniacal n via transporter protein from simulated ammoniacal n solutions to inside the cell is coupled with efflux of proton 26 therefore the decrease in ph during ammoniacal n removal using tetraspora sp nitd 18 is obvious and it also helps in less conversion of nh4 ion to nh3 gas 3 3 2 effect of inoculum concentration inoculum concentration of microalgal sample can be defined as the number of cells present in a specific volume of culture 49 inoculum concentration of algae is an important factor for the growth of algae and survivability of strain in adverse condition 56 the suitable amount of inoculum concentration is required for the proper treatment of wastewater 57 gani et al 56 advocated for optimum cell concentration of botryococcus sp for the maximum productivity in domestic wastewater treatment removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide using tetraspora sp nitd 18 at various inoculum concentrations are showed in fig 4 a c respectively inoculum concentration has shown a direct effect on the removal of three pollutants and also on the growth of cells the increase in removal of phenol 53 2 2 56 75 8 0 11 ammoniacal n 60 29 1 15 73 86 16 39 cyanide 56 7 0 005 74 4 0 001 and an increase in dbc from 0 146 0 05 g l to 0 396 0 006 g l from 0 21 0 001 g l to 0 472 0 002 g l and from 0 128 0 005 g l to 0 34 0 01 g l in their respective culture have been seen when inoculum concentration increases from 5 to 15 after 12 days of incubation higher inoculum concentration reflects the high content of cells and thus more removal of pollutants and more biomass generation are expected the values of dbc 0 345 0 006 g l 0 389 0 003 g l and 0 303 0 006 g l and removal of phenol 69 9 1 08 ammoniacal n 68 78 3 80 and cyanide 68 65 0 002 have been observed at 10 inoculum concentration which are comparatively close to that obtained at 15 inoculum concentration therefore 10 of inoculum concentration has been chosen for further phycoremediation studies the statistical analyses have been applied for analyzing the effect of inoculum concentration on the removal of different pollutants using one way anova tukey test and results are shown in table s3 attached as annexure iii in supplementary file the statistical analysis shows that the removal of pollutants with different inoculum concentration is significant 3 4 variation of phycoremediation of pollutants from individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater with time the variation of phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide both from their individual simulated solutions and mixed solution simulated coke oven wastewater scow and production of biomass dbc with time are shown in fig 5 a c further a comparative chart to show the effect of loading of pollutants on the time variation of produced dbc is depicted in fig 5 d from fig 5 a c it is seen that after 14 days of incubation the concentration of pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide decrease from 102 3 1 45 mg l to 21 5 6 93 mg l from 399 84 1 85 mg l to 101 15 5 08 mg l and from 2 05 0 09 mg l to 0 411 0 012 mg l respectively while corresponding dry biomass concentrations dbc increase 6 0 7 74 and 5 6 fold respectively a comparative study has been done on the basis of biomass production in the simulated solutions of individual pollutants phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide with time fig 5 d the variation of growth of biomass in bg 11 medium biotic control with time has been superimposed on the same graph to assess the effect of the loading of pollutants fig 5 d production of biomass has been found to follow the following order ammoniacal n bg 11 phenol cyanide after 14 days of incubation phenol is a highly toxic pollutant for microorganisms the higher concentration of phenol causes a toxic effect on the growth of microalgae 58 in the present case the selected strain can sustain a higher concentration of phenol 10 300 mg l it is clear that a higher concentration of phenol causes an inhibitory effect on the growth of present strain which is reflected in lower dbc fig 2 a to resist the stress conditions and for the degradation of phenol microbes synthesize enzymes which require extra energy moreover to grow under the stress condition extra maintenance energy is required 28 it may be one of the causes to get the lower dbc in the presence of a higher concentration of phenol even it is a carbon source maximum growth has been obtained in the presence of ammoniacal n than bg 11 media hence it can be stated that the algal strain utilizes ammoniacal n as a nutrient source in addition to the usage of nutrients as present in bg 11 nitrogen is required for microalgal growth though both ammoniacal n and cyanide can be considered as the probable nitrogen source the most preferred one is ammoniacal n because of its reduced form the growth of test strain has also been found in the presence of phenol and cyanide the removal of both pollutants phenol and cyanide are quite rare to be tested as compared to the other nutrients removal like phosphate nitrate etc using microalgae several studies addressed the removal of different nutrient removal using microalgae from different wastewater sources 20 very few research groups explored phycoremediation of phenol and cyanide individually from different wastewater 27 30 in the present work phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide using tetraspora sp nitd 18 from both individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater have been performed cyanide and phenol provide carbon chains to be incorporated in the biomass phenol and cyanide degradation and its utilization follow a cascade of reaction and finally it is linked with the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle and calvin cycle for energy production simulated coke oven wastewater scow has been prepared by mixing three pollutants at their suitable initial concentrations such as phenol 100 mg l ammoniacal n 400 mg l and cyanide 2 mg l removal of pollutants the concentrations of dry biomass dbc and the concentrations of biomolecules extracted from produced biomass have been investigated during phycoremediation of these pollutants from socw for 14 days of incubation fig 6 a and b from fig 6 a it is observed that for the increase in contact time from 0 to 14 days the concentration of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide decrease from 100 6 1 10 mg l to 46 85 5 86 mg l from 401 7 0 57 mg l to 167 7 9 23 mg l and from 2 05 0 098 mg l to 0 81 0 044 mg l respectively the production of biomass and biomolecules during the treatment of scow are shown in fig 6 b maximum concentrations of biomass 0 289 0 04 g l chlorophyll 0 584 0 001 mg l carbohydrate 100 75 1 44 mg l and protein 67 81 2 52 mg l have been achieved after 14 days of treatment of scow few reports on usage of microalgal community to treat coke oven wastewater and thereby the production of value added products from spent algal biomass are available in the literature sen et al 25 applied phycoremediation technique via the usage of cyanobacterial consortium for the removal of cyanide from coke oven wastewater and lipid was extracted from the produced biomass during the phycoremediation process thakurata et al 52 used leptolyngbya sp for the removal of phenol from coke oven wastewater and assessed the lipid content from the produced biomass during the treatment of coke oven wastewater for the production of value added product the growth of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been found less in mixed pollutant scow 0 289 0 04 g l as compared to that in individual simulated solutions of all pollutants such as phenol 0 43 0 002 g l ammoniacal n 0 59 0 008 g l and cyanide 0 41 0 003 g l further maximum removal of phenol 53 43 5 86 ammoniacal n 58 87 9 23 and cyanide 60 65 0 04 from mixed solution scow have also been found less as compared to those phenol 79 02 6 93 ammoniacal n 74 7 5 07 and cyanide 80 4 0 015 from their individual solutions after 14 days of incubation during the treatment of scow the decrease in biomass production and the less pollutants removal may be due to the negative interaction of these three pollutants with the test strain at the same time removal of one pollutant may get affected by the presence of other pollutants 28 to check the significance nonparametric t test unpaired t test have been performed and two tailed p values were obtained using graph pad prism software version 5 01 between removal efficiency from individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater scow as shown in table s4 attached as annexure iv in supplementary file it is found that removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from simulated individual solution with respect to scow is found the most significant with at 2nd 2 4th and 2 14th days respectively 3 5 biomass characterization elemental analysis has been performed for untreated and treated biomass table 2 it is seen that in all the treated biomass carbon percentage has been enhanced as compared to untreated biomass therefore produced biomass may be useful for the production of biofuels higher content of carbon and hydrogen and the low percentage of nitrogen and sulfur aid an extra advantage in the production of biofuels with lesser emission of nox and sox in the environment 59 60 3 6 application of microalgal isolate for treatment of real secondary treated coke oven wastewater in batch mode in the present study the adaptive laboratory evolution method 24 has been applied for increasing the robustness and effectiveness of the present strain for removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide the collected wastewater has been found to contain phenol 7 3 mg l ammoniacal n 157 3 mg l and cyanide 0 65 mg l tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been used to treat real wastewater in its undiluted form and diluted real wastewater bg 11 1 1 one fig 7 a and b removal of phenol 76 0 0 17 and 96 6 0 085 ammoniacal n 59 9 0 609 and 75 6 0 592 and cyanide 75 5 0 002 and 97 8 0 003 and the growth of test strain in terms of dbc 0 301 0 003 g l and 0 35 0 001 g l and chlorophyll 0 836 0 003 and 1 06 0 04 mg l have been obtained with undiluted and diluted wastewater respectively less biomass production in real undiluted wastewater may be due to following reasons i dark colour of real wastewater which causes less penetration of light in the solution ii less nutrient availability in wastewater tetraspora sp is well explored green algae for hydrogen production 21 23 mustaffa et al 61 used the tetraspora sp and spirogyra sp for the treatment of phosphate and nitrate from artificial wastewater very few studies were performed for the treatment of wastewater using tetraspora sp therefore the use of tetraspora sp for the removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide is a new research area from the present work it is clear that tetrspora sp nitd 18 is efficient to reduce the concentration of pollutants below the permissible limit when tested with real secondary treated coke oven wastewater other several microalgal strains were used for the removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide individually from different wastewater chlorella pyrenoidosa was used for the degradation of phenolic compounds coming from the coal gasification plant 8 linder et al 62 reviewed the phycoremediation process for treatment of olive mill wastewater in different conditions several articles were reported for the phycoremediation of ammoniacal n from different wastewater 63 gurbuz et al 31 suggested that s obliquus is effective for the degradation of cyanide from gold mine wastewater sen et al 25 studied the phycoremediation of cyanide from coke oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium the limited number of studies were performed for the simultaneous removal of pollutants using microalgae 26 based on the results obtained during the treatment of real wastewater the economic evaluation has been done for tertiary treatment of 1 0 l of secondary treated coke oven wastewater using present strain in batch mode the total cost of treatment has come as inr 3 65 the detailed calculation is shown in the supplementary file as annexure v it is to be noted that during the treatment of wastewater microalgal spent biomass 0 35 g was produced from 1 0 l of wastewater which can be utilized further for the treatment of wastewater as well as for production of value added products such as biofuel biofertilizer etc further it should be noted that i for continuous operation the cost of phycoremediation process as a tertiary treatment method should be less than that of the batch process ii in the field trial natural light will also make the process cheaper due to absence of electricity charge for artificial light iii the biomass obtained during field trial can effectively be used for other purposes 3 7 probable mechanistic pathways for phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from real wastewater microalgal growth has been seen in the presence of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide therefore it can be stated that the test strain is utilizing these three pollutants for its growth in fig 8 it is seen that ammoniacal n phenol and cyanide are assimilated in cells using some probable pathways 26 30 63 ammoniacal n is taken into the cells by the help of transporter protein and it is then assimilated using glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase enzymes gs gogat pathway into the cells glutamate is involved in chlorophyll synthesis and fatty acid synthesis in the chloroplast which helps in light reaction light reaction provide energy in the calvin cycle gs gogat cycle is linked with the tca cycle via alpha ketoglutarate 63 phenol degradation requires a chain of reactions and is ultimately converted into co2 and pyruvate pyruvate goes directly in the tca cycle for biochemical synthesis and co2 is directly fixed with the help of rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase enzyme in the calvin cycle 26 cyanide is metabolized as a carbon and nitrogen source for microalgal growth cyanide conversion into organic and inorganic chemical requires a cascade of reaction and finally it produces co2 and ammonium ion which are assimilated using the calvin cycle and gs gogat cycle respectively 30 3 8 practical applications and future scope of research therefore it can be stated that phycoremediation is a clean tertiary treatment technology for simultaneous removal of toxic pollutants present in the secondary treated real wastewater without emitting any toxic gases however the application of phycoremediation techniques with efficient bioagent in the real field will succeed if all the challenges in maintaining the treatment plant with very close monitoring of the treatment process parameters are properly met since the present study was carried out on the laboratory scale the problem of frothing did not appear during experimentation however for real field operation the frothing problem if appeared should be taken care of using an appropriate measure like maintaining ph at 7 additionally the obtained spent biomass can be used as a source of biofuel the investigation on macromolecule contents of spent microalgal biomass during treatment of wastewater was carried out to get the idea of possible types of value added products which can be produced further since the present microalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrate content the bulk amount of algal biomass obtained during field study may be processed further for bioethanol production the techno economic analysis of the production of such value added product from spent microalgal biomass is another interesting field of new research work 4 conclusion in the present article phycoremediation technique employing a novel indigenous algal strain tetraspora sp nitd 18 is applied as a tertiary treatment method of coke oven wastewater for removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide maximum removal was obtained for phenol 79 02 6 93 ammoniacal n 74 7 5 07 and cyanide 80 4 0 015 at ph 7 and inoculum concentration 10 from the simulated solution of the individual pollutants having initial concentrations as 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively real secondary treated coke oven wastewater was treated with present strain and found to meet the statutory limit thus it can be affirmed that tetraspora sp nitd 18 is a promising bioagent for tertiary treatment vis à vis end of pipe treatment for the effective removal of these three pollutants it is an easy and efficient method for the betterment of the quality of wastewater to achieve the goal of zero liquid discharge data availability statement some or all data

13747,coke oven wastewater contains an array of hazardous pollutants like cyanide phenol ammoniacal n etc the main objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of phycoremediation technique as tertiary treatment for simultaneous removal of three model pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from secondary treated coke oven wastewater a green route was employed for the treatment of coke oven wastewater via the use of tetraspora sp nitd 18 collected from a contaminated site strain susceptibility was tested for the growth in the simulated solution of phenol 10 300 mg l ammoniacal n 100 800 mg l and cyanide 1 10 mg l and subsequently optimum concentration was assessed as 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively ph 7 and inoculum concentration 10 was found suitable for the removal of phenol 79 02 6 93 ammoniacal n 74 7 5 07 and cyanide 80 4 0 015 from their individual solution at optimal initial concentrations after 14 days for solutions of individual pollutants preferred pollutants were examined on the basis of production of biomass with respect to time and found the following order ammoniacal n phenol cyanide the solution of mixed pollutants was prepared by mixing the said pollutants at their optimal level of initial concentrations at a suitable ph 7 such a solution was termed as simulated coke oven wastewater scow while the present investigation deals with co current removal of pollutants from simulated coke oven wastewater scow and real secondary treated coke oven wastewater at laboratory scale the continuous study on real wastewater at industrial scale with the isolated algal strain is the scope of the future work keywords phycoremediation coke oven wastewater phenol ammoniacal n cyanide 1 introduction coke production is an important process in the steel and iron industry which is done in the coke oven plant two types of coke oven plants are operated in industries they are beehive type and by product recovery type while coke is the only product in the beehive type plant a number of by products are produced in by product recovery type coke oven plant and hence a huge amount of water is used in different units such as quenching of coke ammonia stripping scrubbing of gas and by product recovery and subsequently the major fraction of this water is transformed to wastewater containing an array of hazardous pollutants such as ammoniacal n cyanide thiocyanate phenol heterocyclic compounds poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs etc 1 3 such wastewater is termed as coke oven wastewater cow generally 1000 tons of coke production requires approximately 4000 m3 of water and finally around 1000 m3 water is transformed as coke oven wastewater 3 4 the presence of different pahs and heterocyclic compounds along with ammoniacal n cyanide and phenol in coke oven wastewater depend on the different factors such as raw coal quality carbonization temperature and byproduct recovery methods 2 4 a typical raw cow composition ammoniacal n 120 790 mg l phenol 150 1200 mg l and cyanide 5 20 mg l was described by kwiecińska et al 5 cyanide is a highly toxic ion that inhibits cellular respiration and adversely affects the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem 6 organic pollutants such as phenol pahs are carcinogenic and highly toxic in nature 1 phenol has adverse effects on the replication and synthesis of dna in the cells 7 according to the environmental protection agency epa phenol is listed as a priority pollutant 8 ammoniacal n also deteriorates the quality of water and aquatic lives thus cow can be considered as a major problem from environmental perspectives the standard values of cyanide ammoniacal n and phenol in effluent wastewater are set as 0 2 mg l 50 mg l and 1 0 mg l respectively is 2490 and for drinking water the permissible limit of phenol is 0 001 mg l is 10 500 cyanide is 0 05 mg l is 10 500 and ammoniacal n is 0 2 mg l 9 conventional treatment methods in the coke oven effluent treatment plant are as follows firstly removal of suspended solids grease and oil is done in the equalization tank pre primary treatment chemical oxygen demand cod of wastewater is removed next using physico chemical methods primary treatment and finally biological secondary treatment method is employed for the removal of biologically degradable pollutants 10 physico chemical methods as used for treatment of coke oven wastewater are as follows i adsorption 10 ii coagulation 2 iii oxidation 11 iv precipitation 12 v ozonation 13 vi electrolysis 14 and v membrane based techniques 15 16 etc while physico chemical primary treatment is advertently used for the reduction of the ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod to biological oxygen demand bod below or equal to 0 5 i e cod bod 0 5 scientists pointed out on the limitations of such processes chang et al 13 compared ion exchange chemical oxidation and adsorption using activated carbon methods for removal of organic matter and colour from coke oven wastewater after a thorough study they opined that these processes are having the disadvantages of the high cost of sludge management the cost involved for activated carbon regeneration and sludge disposal 13 in a separate study sharma et al 2 stated that the physico chemical methods for treatment of coke oven wastewater are costly and unsustainable methods while biological treatment processes are preferred choice for treatment of coke oven wastewater due to its efficiency and cost effectiveness singh et al 11 reviewed different methods for treatment of coke oven wastewater such as coagulation adsorption nano filtration and reverse osmosis combined biological and ultra filtration etc and opined that these processes are costly and complicated li et al 17 indicated the advanced oxidation process as more effective one for degradation and mineralization of industrial wastewater than other treatment processes such as adsorption coagulation precipitation and membrane separation in a recent study panigrahy et al 18 assessed different methods such as photocatalysis adsorption electrolysis advanced oxidation and membrane based techniques for phenol treatment from coke oven wastewater and commented that all have some limitations such as production of secondary toxic byproducts unsustainability and high cost recently developed efficient methods for treatment of coke oven wastewater have been reviewed and incorporated in table s1 and attached as annexure i in supplementary file while physico chemical primary treatment is used for the reduction of cod bod ratio biological secondary treatment is used for removal of biodegradable pollutants the biological treatment unit employing bacteria is an integrated part of the effluent treatment plant etp for secondary treatment of coke oven wastewater biological treatment process is widely used due to its high removal efficiency and relatively low cost 2 13 even though the biological treatment is relatively cheap and environmentally friendly well established process it fails to decrease the pollutant concentration below the permissible limit as set by regulatory authorities cpcb bis epa etc due to poor maintenance of the treatment plant and here lies the importance of tertiary treatment of wastewater to meet the statutory limit in the present study secondary treated coke oven wastewater coming from bod plant was found to contain higher concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide than their corresponding permissible limits industries generally use the chlorinated compound for further treatment of wastewater which is highly undesirable from the following perspectives 1 generation of secondary pollutants owing to the addition of chlorine in wastewater 2 increase in the cost of the process 3 non recyclable nature of treated wastewater in the process due to presence of chlorinated compounds 19 therefore a green environmentally benign cheap tertiary treatment method is in search to achieve the goal of 3 r s reduce recover and reuse in the present article authors have proposed phycoremediation technique employing microalgae as tertiary treatment of coke oven wastewater to meet the standard limits as set by regulatory bodies the autotrophic nutrition via the usage of solar power for the production of food utilization of the pollutants present in wastewater as their nutrient source and capability of growth in natural condition 20 and thereby reduction in operating cost make the algal system a suitable choice for tertiary treatment of wastewater in addition to the secondary treatment employing bacterial community moreover the produced biomass can further be used for the production of value added products depending on its biomolecules content the advantages of phycoremediation technology can be summarized as follows i reduction of the pollutants to meet the standard values ii relatively cheaper and eco friendly iii having the prospect of production of value added products from spent algal biomass and finally iv reusability of tertiary treated water for the same purpose or others therefore phycoremediation can be considered as a clean tertiary treatment technology for the removal of toxic pollutants present in the secondary treated wastewater without emitting any toxic gases in the present work tetraspora sp nitd 18 a microalgal strain collected from the contaminated site was used for the treatment of priority pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide both from individual simulated solutions and from mixed solutions designated as simulated coke oven wastewater scow while the usage of tetraspora sp in the field of hydrogen production is quite common in literature 21 23 the effectiveness of the same in the treatment of wastewater has not been studied much hence there is a scope to explore the possible usages of tetraspora sp in phycoremediation field the adaptive laboratory evolution method 24 was followed to attain the desired efficiency of the collected strain for the efficient treatment of wastewater the growth rate and biomass productivity of tetraspora sp nitd 18 have also been examined in the present article as far as known only a limited research work was carried out for simultaneous removal of pollutants from real secondary treated coke oven wastewater using microalgae 25 26 however few works were reported on phycoremediation of individual pollutants from wastewater several articles on the removal of phenol from different sources using microalgae were reported in the literature 27 28 the microalgal strains used for such purpose were chlorella sp sendesmus sp tribonema minus isochrysis galbana etc 27 29 a comparative study was performed by gurbuz et al 30 for cyanide detoxification using three different algal strains such as chlorella sp scenedesmus sp and arthrospira maxima where scenedesmus obliquus showed maximum 99 removal in another study the efficiency of scenedesmus obliquus was examined by gurbuz et al 31 for removal of cyanide from mining process wastewater sen et al 25 proclaimed 96 5 cyanide removal from synthetic coke oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium liu et al 32 examined the tolerance of scenedesmus obliquus for different ammonium concentrations 30 70 mg l in free and immobilized forms in recent work simultaneous removal of ammoniacal n phenol and nitrate from coke oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium was investigated by rai et al 26 the main objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of phycoremediation technique as tertiary treatment for simultaneous removal of three model pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from secondary treated coke oven wastewater the novelty of the present work is as follows i phycoremediation technique was applied for simultaneous removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from coke oven wastewater ii produced biomass was used for the assessment of its macromolecule content iii tetraspora sp nitd 18 was tested for treatment of real secondary treated coke oven wastewater 2 materials and methods experiments were performed in the triplicates all results were provided as mean sd all analytical reagent ar graded chemical reagents were used in the present work all the biosafety protocols applicable under laboratory culture was followed 2 1 collection isolation and cultivation of microalgal isolate microalgal sample along with native wastewater was collected in sample bottles from the runoff of the coke oven plant 23 5204 n 87 3119 e west bengal india the collected sample was transferred to 250 ml of erlenmeyer flask and kept it for 2 3 days in the presence of natural sunlight to prevent the microalgal cells from sudden environmental shocks after three days the microalgal sample was transferred to native water runoff of the coke oven effluent treatment plant diluted with bg 11 1 1 himedia

the sample was found acclimatized in only bg 11 medium 33 centrifugation technique was used for separation and washing of biomass from the culture broth the cultured medium was centrifuged eltek tc8100 f kolkata west bengal india at 5000 rpm for 15 min the pellet was washed three times with distilled water and then transferred to a sterile bg 11 medium the initial ph of the medium was maintained at 9 to avoid the growth of other organisms 34 algal incubator lab x m s atlanta drugs and chemicals kolkata west bengal india was used for the incubation of laboratory culture for 12 days at specified conditions such as light intensity 2400 lx at the regular cycle of the day night 16 8 at temperature 25 2 flasks were placed in a shaker with shaking speed 110 rpm to ensure the well mixing of the culture during cultivation about 1 0 ml of grown culture was added to luria bertani lb medium himedia india and incubated in the bod incubator modern instrument kolkata india for checking the bacterial contamination however bacterial growth was not found a small pinch of 10 days old axenic microalgal sample was then poured and spread on bg 11 agar containing plates the plates were then placed in the algal incubator after 4 days the grown algal sample was picked from the plates and streaked on fresh bg 11 agar plates the streaking process was followed for getting uniculture which was examined using a trinocular microscope leica dm 2500 uk lastly the microalgal sample was cultured in sterile bg 11 medium and kept in the incubator for cultivation 35 such culture was considered as the main culture it was maintained by changing the medium after every 12 days interval molecular identification was done after dna isolation from the cells and 18s rrna gene sequencing

isolate an axenic and unicultured microalgal isolate 30 ml was taken from the main culture and subcultured in 500 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 270 ml of sterile bg 11 medium at ph 7 in the algal incubator for 18 days for growth study 12 days grown sample selected based on the green colour of culture was inoculated in bg 11 medium and a specific amount of samples were collected at regular intervals samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min to harvest the produced biomass the supernatant was decanted and the pellet was washed with distilled water twice the pellets were used for measurement of dry biomass concentration dbc and extraction of chlorophyll and biomolecules such as carbohydrate and protein for measurement of dbc biomass was kept in hot air oven universal hot air oven ambala india at temperature 65 2 for overnight chlorophyll content was estimated following hot extraction method 36 37 the homogenized algal suspension 10 ml was taken and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the washed biomass was mixed with 10 ml of 95 methanol the mixture was placed in a hot water bath 60 for 30 min the green coloured sample was extracted in methanol solution finally the chlorophyll content was determined by measuring absorbance at 650 nm and 665 nm using a spectrophotometer genesys 20 thermo scientific india for protein estimation the folin lowry method was used 38 a specified amount of culture broth was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the pellet was mixed with 1 0 ml of lowery reagent and incubated in dark condition for 20 min follin s reagent 0 5 ml was added to the above solution and incubated again in dark condition for 20 min finally the absorbance of the solution was measured at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer

spectrophotometer 2 3 studies of phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide 2 3 1 susceptibility test of algal isolate in simulated solutions of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide appropriate treatment of cow is the need of the hour the presence of pollutants and concentration of pollutants vary from one plant to other plants it mainly depends on different factors such as the quality of raw coal carbonization temperature byproducts recovery methods treatment methods of wastewater etc 40 41 the capacity of degradability and tolerance level of microalgae towards the pollutants differ from one species to another 8 42 43 therefore the isolated algal sample was tested in the presence of different concentrations of phenol 10 250 mg l ammoniacal n 100 800 mg l and cyanide 1 10 mg l the lower range of concentration was selected based both on the results of physico chemical analysis of collected real secondary treated coke oven wastewater and on the data available in the literature 44 45 the higher range was chosen based on the range of concentrations of the pollutants in the raw coke oven wastewater as available in the literature 5 40 44 standard 1000 mg l solutions of phenol and ammoniacal n were prepared by adding 1 0 g and 3 819 g of phenol merck india and ammonium chloride merck india respectively in 1000 ml of sterile mili q water standard 1000 mg l of cyanide solution merck india was used for the preparation of a simulated cyanide solution specified volume was taken from standard solution and requisite dilution was prepared by the addition of sterile bg 11 medium isolated algal sample 12 days aged culture was inoculated in simulated solutions of these three pollutants separately initial ph was maintained at 7 and 10 v v was used as inoculum from the growth study it is seen that microalgae enter the death phase after 14 days therefore biomass was harvested after 14 days of incubation by centrifugation and kept in hot air oven overnight to get the dbc the growth of algal sample at different concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide was measured in terms of produced biomass the supernatant was used for measurement of the residual concentration of cyanide phenol and ammoniacal n phenol and ammoniacal n were examined using standard american public health association apha protocols 46 phenol reacts with 4 amino antipyrine in presence of potassium ferricyanide at ph 10 to form a stable reddish brown coloured antipyrine dye the amount of colour produced is a function of the concentration of phenol absorbance was measured at 510 nm using a spectrophotometer genesys 20 thermo scientific india ammoniacal n was analysed by spectrophotometric nesserlers reagent method and absorbance was measured at 425 nm wavelength cyanide was examined using ion chromatography system metrohm ag switzerland herisau in the present study two controls were used for comparing all the experimental data the bg 11 medium inoculated with the microalgal isolate biotic control and the simulated solutions of these three pollutants without inoculation abiotic control were incubated in the algal incubator under identical conditions the initial concentrations of pollutants phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide were chosen on the basis of optimum dbc and removal of pollutants for carrying out further experiments 2 3 2 effects of environmental factors on phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide bioremoval of pollutants and growth of microalgae are dependent on macro and micro environmental factors they are ph inoculum concentration of culture initial concentration of pollutants etc the initial concentration of phenol 100 mg l ammoniacal n 400 mg l and cyanide 2 mg l were decided from the results of subsection 2 3 1 thus the effect of ph and inoculum concentration of algae was assessed next for the betterment of phycoremediation process and growth of algae in order to know the effect of environmental factors culture was incubated for 12 days in the algal incubator at the specific environmental condition the initial ph of the medium was varied from 7 to 9 keeping inoculum concentration of algae 10 initial concentration of phenol 100 mg l ammoniacal n 400 mg l and cyanide 2 mg l constant next the inoculum concentration of algae was changed in the range of 5 15 at a suitable ph finally suitable values of factors were chosen judiciously based on the maximum removal of pollutants maximum produced biomass and economic point of view 2 3 3 variation of phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from individual solutions using microalgal isolate with time the isolated strain was cultured separately in each of the model pollutants like phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at their initial concentrations of 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively inoculum concentration and initial ph of medium were set at 10 and 7 respectively the isolated sample was cultured in 100 ml flasks containing 50 ml of the simulated solution of each pollutant all flasks were kept in the algal incubator for 14 days under aseptic conditions to ensure for proper mixing the flasks were shaken at a shaking speed of 110 rpm flasks were placed according to the number of incubation days on every two days of intervals three sets of flasks were taken for sample analysis samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was analysed for residual concentration of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide and harvested biomass was used for measurement of dbc finally a comparative study was performed on the basis of produced biomass to decide the preferred pollutants for the growth of test strain 2 4 biomass characterization the isolated algal sample was cultured in both bg 11 untreated sample and in simulated solutions of individual pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide and kept in the algal incubator for 14 days treated sample after the incubation period sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min harvested biomass was dried in a hot air oven dry biomass samples treated and untreated were analysed using chns analyser thermo scientific flashsmart elemental analysers india using methionine as the reference standard for calibration 2 5 phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from simulated and real wastewater and assessment of concentrations of biomolecules from produced biomass cow was found contaminated mainly with phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide therefore in present work simulated coke oven wastewater scow 2 l was prepared by adding phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide solution in a requisite volume to sterile bg 11 medium to attain the initial concentrations 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l respectively ph was adjusted at 7 scow was then inoculated with isolated algal strain with optimal inoculum concentration 10 and incubated in the algal incubator under the aseptic condition for 14 days samples were collected at every two days intervals and used for the analysis of residual concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide the produced biomass was harvested and used for the measurement of dbc chlorophyll content and concentrations of biomolecules such as carbohydrate and protein real secondary treated coke oven wastewater rcow was collected from the outfall of the coke oven plant west bengal india rcow was analysed to assess its contamination load after collection raw wastewater was filtered with 42 graded whatman paper to remove the suspended solids the filtrate was further filtered with sterile 0 2 μm pore sized axiva pvdf syringe 25 mm filter to restrict the microbes and to prevent the degradation of heat sensitive pollutants like phenol and cyanide finally the filtrate was analysed for ph using ph meter gold 533 digital instruments corporation india the concentrations of ammoniacal n phenol and cyanide were measured following the protocols as mentioned in subsection 2 3 1 the isolated algal sample was inoculated in 100 ml of both undiluted and diluted rcow 1 1 diluted with sterile bg 11 medium the algal cultures were incubated in the algal incubator for 14 days under germ free conditions the samples were collected after two days interval and analysed for concentrations of residual pollutants biomass and biomolecules 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using graph pad prism 5 01 one way anova tukey test was tested for the removal of pollutants phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at initial different ph and inoculum concentration a nonparametric t test unpaired t test was performed to examine the significance between individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater solution scow for removal of pollutants 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification and growth study of microalgae in bg 11 medium the morphological study of the axenic microalgal sample has shown that it is round shaped single celled green algae fig 1 a molecular identification has been done after 18s rrna sequencing the phylogenetic tree is shown in fig 1 b the sequence has been deposited to national center for biotechnology information ncbi database https www ncbi nlm nih gov and an accession number mh793465 of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been generated the growth of tetraspora sp nitd 18 in bg 11 medium is shown in fig 1 c four distinct phases have clearly been observed in the growth curve of the algal culture they are i preparatory phase 0th to 4th day here cells have been adapted to the new surrounding environmental conditions and a minute increase in biomass concentration 67 5 0 063 mg l to 125 0 057 mg l has been seen ii exponential phase 4th to 14thday cells starts to produce primary metabolites which they use in their growth and metabolic activities and maximum increase in biomass concentration 125 0 057 mg l to 520 5 0 121 mg l is observed in this phase iii plateau phase 14th to 16th day cell biomass production rate and cell death rate become equal and secondary metabolites are produced in this stage to avoid the stress condition nutrients limitation and a biomass concentration 520 5 0 121 mg l to 521 0 184 mg l remains almost constant and finally iv decline phase 16th to 18th day due to lack of nutrients active cells become die and a decrease in concentration is observed during this stage 521 0 184 mg l to 503 0 086 mg l following similar trend as that of dbc concentrations of chlorophyll 0 46 0 047 mg l to 1 47 0 143 mg l carbohydrate 32 5 2 88 mg l to 217 5 8 66 mg l and protein 12 5 7 21 mg l to 158 8 1 44 mg l initially increase from 0th to 14th days and then they decrease chlorophyll 1 47 0 143 mg l to 1 25 0 181 mg l carbohydrate 217 5 8 66 mg l to 198 10 96 mg l and protein 158 8 1 44 mg l to 123 7 5 77 mg l during 14th to 18th days of culturing 33 during the exponential stage of culture the growth rate of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been calculated mathematically 47 for the calculation of the specific growth rate the following equation has been used 1 d x d t μ x where μ specific growth rate day 1 x biomass concentration g l and t time after integration of eq 1 with following limits at t 0 x x 0 and t t x x the following equation is obtained 2 ln x x 0 μ t eq 2 can be rewritten as 3 x x 0 e μ t by curve fitting of the growth data of tetraspora sp nitd 18 using microsoft excel office 2016 the specific growth rate has been found as μ 0 2272 day 1 the overall productivity of biomass has been calculated for the present strain in a specified condition of culture using the following equation 48 49 4 y o v e r a l l x n x 0 t n t 0 where y o v e r a l l overall productivity g l day x n dry biomass concentration obtained at 14 days of incubation g l x 0 initial dry biomass concentration as obtained on 0th day g l t n total incubation time 14 days day and t 0 initial time 0th day of the experiment day the overall productivity of dry biomass of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been obtained after 14 days of incubation as 0 024 g l day 3 2 susceptibility test of microalgae in simulated solutions of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide tetraspora sp nitd 18 was tested for its survivability on different pollutants at varying concentrations of the pollutants such as phenol 10 250 mg l ammoniacal n 100 800 mg l and cyanide 1 10 mg l fig 2 a c the lower range of concentration was selected based both on the results of physico chemical analysis of collected real secondary treated coke oven wastewater and on the data available in the literature 44 45 the higher range was chosen based on the range of concentrations of the pollutants as available in the literature 5 40 44 the maximum increase in dbc has been obtained as 5 3 5 9 and 4 5 fold when the strain has been grown in phenol 10 mg l ammoniacal n 100 mg l and cyanide 1 mg l solutions separately after 14 days of incubation an increase in the dbc of algal strain in the presence of pollutants has set a presumption that phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide may be utilized as a nutrient source for its growth 25 growth of the algal strain has been restricted beyond the concentration of 100 mg l 400 mg l and 2 mg l for phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide respectively dry biomass concentrations decrease from 0 404 0 001 g l to 0 131 0 012 g l from 0 444 0 019 g l to 0 301 0 009 g l and from 0 35 0 006 g l to 0 179 0 011 g l when initial concentrations of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide varies in the range of 10 300 mg l 100 800 mg l and 1 3 mg l respectively after 14 days of incubation this may be due to the interference of the pollutants to the metabolic activity of the algae at their higher concentrations 27 50 after the judicial inspection of fig 2 a c 100 mg l phenol 400 mg l ammoniacal n and 2 mg l cyanide have been selected as suitable initial concentrations such selection has been based on the production of optimum dbc phenol 0 351 0 008 g l ammoniacal n 0 402 0 007 g l and cyanide 0 34 0 015 g l the corresponding consumption of the pollutants are as follows 3 73 3 17 mg for phenol 14 16 13 04 mg for ammoniacal n and 0 074 0 94 mg for cyanide the next set of experiments have been performed at these concentrations the biomass productivity has been calculated using eq 4 for different pollutants at different initial concentrations table 1 shows overall productivities of tetraspora sp nitd 18 at different concentrations of pollutants the biomass productivities of tetraspora sp nitd 18 for phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at different concentration have been tested for checking the tolerance level of pollutants biomass productivity increases with a decrease in the initial concentrations of pollutant as shown in table 1 maximum productivity for individual pollutants has been obtained at the lowest initial concentration of phenol 10 mg l ammoniacal n 100 mg l and cyanide 1 mg l based on the data of overall productivity table 1 ammoniacal n is found most suitable for the growth of algae as compared to phenol and cyanide 3 3 effects of environmental factors on phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide the performance of biological agents in the removal of pollutants depends on micro and macro environmental factors such as ph inoculum concentration etc 28 51 hence ph 7 9 and inoculum concentration of test strain 5 15 have been varied in a judicial manner the variation of algal growth in terms of dbc and removal of different pollutants with respect to such factors have been examined the effect of ph and inoculum concentrations are showed in figs 3 a c and 4 a c respectively 3 3 1 effect of ph tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been grown in simulated solutions of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide at variable initial ph 7 9 fig 3 a c an increase in both dbc 0 345 0 006 g l to 0 364 0 005 g l and removal of phenol 69 9 1 08 76 5 0 055 have been observed when ph increases from 7 to 9 fig 3 a the degradation of phenol and growth of microorganisms both depend on the ph and the microbial species 28 the microalgal degradation of phenol from synthetic coke oven wastewater in alkaline condition ph 10 was found optimum 52 visviki and santikul 53 reported that several algal species prefer neutral ph like 7 7 6 whereas surkatti et al 28 reviewed that chlorella sp and spirulina sp prefer ph 8 9 therefore effective ph for growth of algae and phenol degradation varies from species to species similarly the present strain prefers to grow at ph 7 and prefers to remove phenol at ph 9 when algal strain has been grown in ammoniacal n solution with the increase in ph from 7 to 9 a decrease in dbc 0 389 0 003 g l to 0 326 0 005 g l is found while an increase in removal 68 78 3 80 75 18 0 35 is obtained fig 3 b maximum dbc 0 389 0 003 g l has been obtained at ph 7 while maximum ammoniacal n removal 75 18 0 35 has been achieved at ph 9 equilibrium ratio of nh3 nh4 mainly relies on the ph of the solution at higher ph ammonium ion converts to ammonia which volatilizes out from the solution 54 ammonia gas is permeable to the cell membrane of microalgae and it inhibits the photosynthetic activity of microalgae and thus cell growth is restricted 55 maximum cyanide removal 73 9 0 01 and maximum dbc 0 327 0 003 g l have been obtained at ph 9 fig 3 c the biomass at ph 7 is observed as 0 303 0 006 g l which is comparatively the same as that obtained at ph 9 from an economic point of view it is preferred to treat real wastewater at its own ph therefore ph 7 has been selected for further studies on phycoremediation of pollutants from cow the removal of phenol 69 9 1 08 ammoniacal n 68 78 3 80 and cyanide 68 65 0 002 and their respective dbc of 0 345 0 006 g l 0 389 0 003 g l and 0 303 0 006 g l have been obtained at ph 7 one way anova tukey test using software graph pad prism 5 01 has been performed for examining the effect of initial ph on the removal of different concentration of the pollutants as shown in table s2 attached as annexure ii in supplementary file it is seen that change in initial ph from 7 to 8 and 9 change the removal of phenol and ammoniacal n significantly but change in initial ph from 8 to 9 do not for cyanide enhancement of initial ph to 9 from 7 and 8 change the removal ability significantly the research group also tested the ph before and after the treatment of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide individually only in case of ammoniacal n after removal major ph drop was observed as 9 to 6 9 8 to 6 8 and 7 to 6 8 however in case of phenol and cyanide the ph drop was not higher final ph lies in the range of initial ph 0 05 the import of ammoniacal n via transporter protein from simulated ammoniacal n solutions to inside the cell is coupled with efflux of proton 26 therefore the decrease in ph during ammoniacal n removal using tetraspora sp nitd 18 is obvious and it also helps in less conversion of nh4 ion to nh3 gas 3 3 2 effect of inoculum concentration inoculum concentration of microalgal sample can be defined as the number of cells present in a specific volume of culture 49 inoculum concentration of algae is an important factor for the growth of algae and survivability of strain in adverse condition 56 the suitable amount of inoculum concentration is required for the proper treatment of wastewater 57 gani et al 56 advocated for optimum cell concentration of botryococcus sp for the maximum productivity in domestic wastewater treatment removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide using tetraspora sp nitd 18 at various inoculum concentrations are showed in fig 4 a c respectively inoculum concentration has shown a direct effect on the removal of three pollutants and also on the growth of cells the increase in removal of phenol 53 2 2 56 75 8 0 11 ammoniacal n 60 29 1 15 73 86 16 39 cyanide 56 7 0 005 74 4 0 001 and an increase in dbc from 0 146 0 05 g l to 0 396 0 006 g l from 0 21 0 001 g l to 0 472 0 002 g l and from 0 128 0 005 g l to 0 34 0 01 g l in their respective culture have been seen when inoculum concentration increases from 5 to 15 after 12 days of incubation higher inoculum concentration reflects the high content of cells and thus more removal of pollutants and more biomass generation are expected the values of dbc 0 345 0 006 g l 0 389 0 003 g l and 0 303 0 006 g l and removal of phenol 69 9 1 08 ammoniacal n 68 78 3 80 and cyanide 68 65 0 002 have been observed at 10 inoculum concentration which are comparatively close to that obtained at 15 inoculum concentration therefore 10 of inoculum concentration has been chosen for further phycoremediation studies the statistical analyses have been applied for analyzing the effect of inoculum concentration on the removal of different pollutants using one way anova tukey test and results are shown in table s3 attached as annexure iii in supplementary file the statistical analysis shows that the removal of pollutants with different inoculum concentration is significant 3 4 variation of phycoremediation of pollutants from individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater with time the variation of phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide both from their individual simulated solutions and mixed solution simulated coke oven wastewater scow and production of biomass dbc with time are shown in fig 5 a c further a comparative chart to show the effect of loading of pollutants on the time variation of produced dbc is depicted in fig 5 d from fig 5 a c it is seen that after 14 days of incubation the concentration of pollutants such as phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide decrease from 102 3 1 45 mg l to 21 5 6 93 mg l from 399 84 1 85 mg l to 101 15 5 08 mg l and from 2 05 0 09 mg l to 0 411 0 012 mg l respectively while corresponding dry biomass concentrations dbc increase 6 0 7 74 and 5 6 fold respectively a comparative study has been done on the basis of biomass production in the simulated solutions of individual pollutants phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide with time fig 5 d the variation of growth of biomass in bg 11 medium biotic control with time has been superimposed on the same graph to assess the effect of the loading of pollutants fig 5 d production of biomass has been found to follow the following order ammoniacal n bg 11 phenol cyanide after 14 days of incubation phenol is a highly toxic pollutant for microorganisms the higher concentration of phenol causes a toxic effect on the growth of microalgae 58 in the present case the selected strain can sustain a higher concentration of phenol 10 300 mg l it is clear that a higher concentration of phenol causes an inhibitory effect on the growth of present strain which is reflected in lower dbc fig 2 a to resist the stress conditions and for the degradation of phenol microbes synthesize enzymes which require extra energy moreover to grow under the stress condition extra maintenance energy is required 28 it may be one of the causes to get the lower dbc in the presence of a higher concentration of phenol even it is a carbon source maximum growth has been obtained in the presence of ammoniacal n than bg 11 media hence it can be stated that the algal strain utilizes ammoniacal n as a nutrient source in addition to the usage of nutrients as present in bg 11 nitrogen is required for microalgal growth though both ammoniacal n and cyanide can be considered as the probable nitrogen source the most preferred one is ammoniacal n because of its reduced form the growth of test strain has also been found in the presence of phenol and cyanide the removal of both pollutants phenol and cyanide are quite rare to be tested as compared to the other nutrients removal like phosphate nitrate etc using microalgae several studies addressed the removal of different nutrient removal using microalgae from different wastewater sources 20 very few research groups explored phycoremediation of phenol and cyanide individually from different wastewater 27 30 in the present work phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide using tetraspora sp nitd 18 from both individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater have been performed cyanide and phenol provide carbon chains to be incorporated in the biomass phenol and cyanide degradation and its utilization follow a cascade of reaction and finally it is linked with the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle and calvin cycle for energy production simulated coke oven wastewater scow has been prepared by mixing three pollutants at their suitable initial concentrations such as phenol 100 mg l ammoniacal n 400 mg l and cyanide 2 mg l removal of pollutants the concentrations of dry biomass dbc and the concentrations of biomolecules extracted from produced biomass have been investigated during phycoremediation of these pollutants from socw for 14 days of incubation fig 6 a and b from fig 6 a it is observed that for the increase in contact time from 0 to 14 days the concentration of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide decrease from 100 6 1 10 mg l to 46 85 5 86 mg l from 401 7 0 57 mg l to 167 7 9 23 mg l and from 2 05 0 098 mg l to 0 81 0 044 mg l respectively the production of biomass and biomolecules during the treatment of scow are shown in fig 6 b maximum concentrations of biomass 0 289 0 04 g l chlorophyll 0 584 0 001 mg l carbohydrate 100 75 1 44 mg l and protein 67 81 2 52 mg l have been achieved after 14 days of treatment of scow few reports on usage of microalgal community to treat coke oven wastewater and thereby the production of value added products from spent algal biomass are available in the literature sen et al 25 applied phycoremediation technique via the usage of cyanobacterial consortium for the removal of cyanide from coke oven wastewater and lipid was extracted from the produced biomass during the phycoremediation process thakurata et al 52 used leptolyngbya sp for the removal of phenol from coke oven wastewater and assessed the lipid content from the produced biomass during the treatment of coke oven wastewater for the production of value added product the growth of tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been found less in mixed pollutant scow 0 289 0 04 g l as compared to that in individual simulated solutions of all pollutants such as phenol 0 43 0 002 g l ammoniacal n 0 59 0 008 g l and cyanide 0 41 0 003 g l further maximum removal of phenol 53 43 5 86 ammoniacal n 58 87 9 23 and cyanide 60 65 0 04 from mixed solution scow have also been found less as compared to those phenol 79 02 6 93 ammoniacal n 74 7 5 07 and cyanide 80 4 0 015 from their individual solutions after 14 days of incubation during the treatment of scow the decrease in biomass production and the less pollutants removal may be due to the negative interaction of these three pollutants with the test strain at the same time removal of one pollutant may get affected by the presence of other pollutants 28 to check the significance nonparametric t test unpaired t test have been performed and two tailed p values were obtained using graph pad prism software version 5 01 between removal efficiency from individual simulated solution and simulated coke oven wastewater scow as shown in table s4 attached as annexure iv in supplementary file it is found that removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from simulated individual solution with respect to scow is found the most significant with at 2nd 2 4th and 2 14th days respectively 3 5 biomass characterization elemental analysis has been performed for untreated and treated biomass table 2 it is seen that in all the treated biomass carbon percentage has been enhanced as compared to untreated biomass therefore produced biomass may be useful for the production of biofuels higher content of carbon and hydrogen and the low percentage of nitrogen and sulfur aid an extra advantage in the production of biofuels with lesser emission of nox and sox in the environment 59 60 3 6 application of microalgal isolate for treatment of real secondary treated coke oven wastewater in batch mode in the present study the adaptive laboratory evolution method 24 has been applied for increasing the robustness and effectiveness of the present strain for removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide the collected wastewater has been found to contain phenol 7 3 mg l ammoniacal n 157 3 mg l and cyanide 0 65 mg l tetraspora sp nitd 18 has been used to treat real wastewater in its undiluted form and diluted real wastewater bg 11 1 1 one fig 7 a and b removal of phenol 76 0 0 17 and 96 6 0 085 ammoniacal n 59 9 0 609 and 75 6 0 592 and cyanide 75 5 0 002 and 97 8 0 003 and the growth of test strain in terms of dbc 0 301 0 003 g l and 0 35 0 001 g l and chlorophyll 0 836 0 003 and 1 06 0 04 mg l have been obtained with undiluted and diluted wastewater respectively less biomass production in real undiluted wastewater may be due to following reasons i dark colour of real wastewater which causes less penetration of light in the solution ii less nutrient availability in wastewater tetraspora sp is well explored green algae for hydrogen production 21 23 mustaffa et al 61 used the tetraspora sp and spirogyra sp for the treatment of phosphate and nitrate from artificial wastewater very few studies were performed for the treatment of wastewater using tetraspora sp therefore the use of tetraspora sp for the removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide is a new research area from the present work it is clear that tetrspora sp nitd 18 is efficient to reduce the concentration of pollutants below the permissible limit when tested with real secondary treated coke oven wastewater other several microalgal strains were used for the removal of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide individually from different wastewater chlorella pyrenoidosa was used for the degradation of phenolic compounds coming from the coal gasification plant 8 linder et al 62 reviewed the phycoremediation process for treatment of olive mill wastewater in different conditions several articles were reported for the phycoremediation of ammoniacal n from different wastewater 63 gurbuz et al 31 suggested that s obliquus is effective for the degradation of cyanide from gold mine wastewater sen et al 25 studied the phycoremediation of cyanide from coke oven wastewater using cyanobacterial consortium the limited number of studies were performed for the simultaneous removal of pollutants using microalgae 26 based on the results obtained during the treatment of real wastewater the economic evaluation has been done for tertiary treatment of 1 0 l of secondary treated coke oven wastewater using present strain in batch mode the total cost of treatment has come as inr 3 65 the detailed calculation is shown in the supplementary file as annexure v it is to be noted that during the treatment of wastewater microalgal spent biomass 0 35 g was produced from 1 0 l of wastewater which can be utilized further for the treatment of wastewater as well as for production of value added products such as biofuel biofertilizer etc further it should be noted that i for continuous operation the cost of phycoremediation process as a tertiary treatment method should be less than that of the batch process ii in the field trial natural light will also make the process cheaper due to absence of electricity charge for artificial light iii the biomass obtained during field trial can effectively be used for other purposes 3 7 probable mechanistic pathways for phycoremediation of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide from real wastewater microalgal growth has been seen in the presence of phenol ammoniacal n and cyanide therefore it can be stated that the test strain is utilizing these three pollutants for its growth in fig 8 it is seen that ammoniacal n phenol and cyanide are assimilated in cells using some probable pathways 26 30 63 ammoniacal n is taken into the cells by the help of transporter protein and it is then assimilated using glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase enzymes gs gogat pathway into the cells glutamate is involved in chlorophyll synthesis and fatty acid synthesis in the chloroplast which helps in light reaction light reaction provide energy in the calvin cycle gs gogat cycle is linked with the tca cycle via alpha ketoglutarate 63 phenol degradation requires a chain of reactions and is ultimately converted into co2 and pyruvate pyruvate goes directly in the tca cycle for biochemical synthesis and co2 is directly fixed with the help of rubisco ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase enzyme in the calvin cycle 26 cyanide is metabolized as a carbon and nitrogen source for microalgal growth cyanide conversion into organic and inorganic chemical requires a cascade of reaction and finally it produces co2 and ammonium ion which are assimilated using the calvin cycle and gs gogat cycle respectively 30 3 8 practical applications and future scope of research therefore it can be stated that phycoremediation is a clean tertiary treatment technology for simultaneous removal of toxic pollutants present in the secondary treated real wastewater without emitting any toxic gases however the application of phycoremediation techniques with efficient bioagent in the real field will succeed if all the challenges in maintaining the treatment plant with very close monitoring of the treatment process parameters are properly met since the present study was carried out on the laboratory scale the problem of frothing did not appear during experimentation however for real field operation the frothing problem if appeared should be taken care of using an appropriate measure like maintaining ph at 7 additionally the obtained spent biomass can be used as a source of biofuel the investigation on macromolecule contents of spent microalgal biomass during treatment of wastewater was carried out to get the idea of possible types of value added products which can be produced further since the present microalgal biomass is rich in carbohydrate content the bulk amount of algal biomass obtained during field study may be processed further for bioethanol production the techno economic analysis of the production of such value added product from spent microalgal biomass is another interesting field of

13748,the present study deals with a gram positive and rod shaped bacterium scrb 19 isolated from chromium contaminated tannery wastewater of common effluent treatment plant cetp kanpur u p india based on 16s rrna gene sequencing investigation the bacterium was recognized as microbacterium paraoxydans this bacterium exhibits relatively elevated tolerance to cr vi 1000 mg l the cr vi reduction potential of isolated bacterium was studied at 100 200 300 and 500 mg l of cr vi and the results revealed that bacterium reduced 93 45 87 28 72 01 and 39 24 of cr vi at their respective concentrations the bacterial cell exterior showed the morphological changes and intracellular accumulation during the reduction of cr vi was evidenced by sem and edx analysis the cr vi reduced product was bound with membrane functional groups such as amide and carboxyl group were determined through ftir spectroscopy the prominent peaks determined by xrd and xps analysis corroborate the presence of possible reduced chromium species the suspended culture of microbacterium paraoxydans scrb19 also showed chromate reductase enzyme activity of 1 603 0 041 u ml hence this strain can be a promising bio agent for ecofriendly clean up strategies of toxic cr vi from polluted environments keywords cr vi reduction microbacterium paraoxydans sem edx ft ir xrd and xps analysis 1 introduction in developing and underdeveloped countries inappropriate discharge of industrial effluents into natural water resources and soil pose a serious threat to the existing environment due to the high concentrations of heavy metal such as copper cadmium chromium lead nickel and mercury 1 heavy metals are highly toxic persistent and potent inhibitors of ecological and biological activities chromium is one of the environmental pollutants that extensively used in leather tanning steel manufacturing plants mining and metal finishing wood preservatives textile ceramics and chemical industries etc 2 chromium exists in a number of valence states ranging from 2 to 6 however the most ordinary and steady form is trivalent cr iii as cation whereas hexavalent chromium cr vi as divalent oxyanion chromate form cr vi is 100 times toxic than cr iii because of its high solubility and transportability in water 3 4 high levels of cr vi leads to itching and corrosion of the respiratory tract nasal and skin irritation ulceration and lung carcinoma in humans it also reduces soil fertility affects the soil microbial communities adversely and retarded plant growth in view of such toxicity and carcinogenicity of cr vi contamination on human health plants and other organisms can be considered as priority pollutant in class a human carcinogen among hazardous substances 5 it is well known that tannery industries use a huge amount of chromium salts in chrome tanning process this chrome tanning usually takes up small amount of applied chromium and nearly 2000 3200 tones of chromium discharged annually as waste into the environment elevated chromium concentration ranging from 2000 to 5000 mg l reported in tannery wastewater shown to be significantly higher than its permissible limit 2 mg l for wastewater release 6 the tannery effluent serves as a main resource of chromium pollution in the environment and also contains other inorganic pollutants and proteins which make it an ideal medium for bacterial growth 7 the release of inadequately treated tannery wastewater into the environment causes detrimental water and soil pollution which imposes negatives effects on animal and plant health the genotoxic cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of tannery wastewater are also well reported 8 9 as a metal cr is non biodegradable and can only be transformed from its highly toxic state of cr vi to a non toxic state of cr iii or it might be removed by conventional treatment processes of adsorption accumulation ion exchange and chemical precipitation 10 13 nano zero valent iron nzvi remediation technology is of great interest for chromium reduction due to the strong dependence of chromium toxicity on its oxidation state 14 coated and uncoated nano valent iron nzvi biomass are effectively employed for the large scale elimination of cr vi from synthetic wastewaters 15 moreover nano filteration membrane techniques are also developed which are efficiently useful for chromium recovery from tannery wastewater streams 11 however these conventional methods are of high cost and produce enormous quantity of toxic sludge and derived pollutants thus the study of metal resistant microorganisms isolated from tannery wastewater for the detoxification reduction of cr vi has recently gained importance and offers a safe and eco friendly option to achieve bioremediation of chromium contaminated environments 16 18 a large number of microorganisms have been reported including pseudomonas enterococcus bacillus and escherichia that resist and reduce cr vi by developing metal resistance mechanisms of periplasmic biosorption intracellular bioaccumulation dna methylation metal resistant plasmids and biotransformation to cr iii all the way through enzymatic reaction or in some way by making complex metabolites 19 chromate reductases are highly efficient in the alteration of highly toxic cr vi into a less toxic and stable cr iii under aerobic and anaerobic environments the aim of the present investigation is to isolate and illustrate a cr vi resistant bacterial strain that is capable to reduce cr vi at high concentration and to explore the reduction potentiality and characterization of its reduced product 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals and reagents utilized for this investigation are of molecular or analytical grade procured from

and screening of chromium vi resistant bacterial strains substantial use of chromium in tannery industries has resulted in considerable source of environment contamination due to superfluous usage of chromium salts in chrome tanning process tannery wastewater contains chromates and dichromate oxyanions of cr vi according to the alkaline and acidic nature of the effluent 28 however in tannery wastewater chromium does not only exist in the hexavalent form but in these two forms cr vi and cr iii the cr iii from is predominant which is not surprising since it is one of the main tanning reagent cr2 oh 2 so4 2 during tanning processing only 60 80 of chromium reacts with the leather and remaining gets discharged into the sewage system therefore tannery wastewater sample was used to isolate of bacterial that can abide and reduce cr vi proficiently primarily five cr vi resistant bacterial strains were isolated by means of enrichment culture technique followed by serial dilution method on lb agar plates contained 100 mg l cr vi these five isolates were subjected to mic screening to check their resistance against high concentration of cr vi ranges from 100 to 1000 mg l among the five cr vi resistant bacterial isolates isolate scrb 19 exhibited the highest cr vi tolerance at 500 mg l this bacterial strain was further selected for cr vi reduction studies bacterial strains exhibited high chromium tolerance were more capable to reduce cr vi to cr iii and be able to developed as good bio agent for remediation of chromium pollution 29 3 1 1 characteristics of isolated chromium vi resistant bacterium the colony of bacterial isolate scrb 19 had light yellow coloration when grown on lb agar medium this yellow colour did not disperse into the medium the microscopic observation and gram s staining tests showed that the bacterium was gram positive rod shaped non spore forming and motile in nature moreover numbers of biochemical tests were performed for the biochemical characterization of bacterial isolate with the help of bergey s manual as presented in table 1 the freshly grown culture displayed negative test for indole mr vp citrate utilization and triple sugar iron ager test the bacterium was also failed to give h2s production and did not capable to produce amylase enzymes as it gives negative test for starch hydrolysis moreover bacterium gives positive oxidase test which suggested that bacterium possesses the cytochrome oxidase enzyme and aerobic in nature capable of utilizing o2 as final hydrogen receptor catalase test was also found positive for the bacterium which also indicated that bacterium was capable to respire using o2 as a terminal electron acceptor this bacterium also showed positive reactions for cellulose lipase nitrate reductase and gelatinase enzymes the bacterium is capable to hydrolyze milk protein as it gives positive test for casein hydrolysis further 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis of the isolated bacterium was matched with known sequences of ncbi database using blast n showed 99 closest similarity to the member of genus microbacterium and identified as microbacterium paraoxydans with accession number kx710178 fig a1 supplementary material 3 2 effect of chromium vi concentration on growth of m paraoxydans scrb 19 the effects of chromium vi on bacterial growth of m paraoxydans scrb 19 towards different cr vi concentrations was studies in lb broth the bacterial strain was capable to grow and tolerate low to high 100 500 mg l cr vi concentration the results showed no noteworthy divergence in bacterial growth at lowered concentrations as shown in fig 1 however at higher concentration 500 mg l cr vi appeared to affects bacterial growth negatively the results showed that at 100 200 and 300 mg l cr vi concentration bacterial growth found to be resistant and achieved maximum bacterial growth whereas at 500 mg l cr vi concentration the bacterial growth was reduced and results in slow growth period mostly with the increased cr vi concentration the inhibition of growth also gets increased however excellent growth was observed in the medium containing up to 500 mg l of cr vi concentration 29 high cr vi concentration exhibits toxic and inhibitory effects on bacterial growth results in reduced biomass and prolonged lag period to acclimatizes higher stress condition 30 the effect of cr vi concentration 5 100 mg l on bacterial growth of bacillus sp strain xw 4 was evaluated by liu et al 31 indicated that bacterial growth got significantly affected at 100 mg l cr vi the bacterial cell growth was remarkably influenced when the higher cr vi concentration was increased up to 100 mg l while initial lower cr vi concentration at 5 10 and 20 mg l showed moderate effect on bacterial growth 31 shekhar et al 32 also studied the bacterial growth kinetics of pseudomonas sp strain v3 at increasing cr vi concentration from 20 200 mg l this study indicated that the maximum bacterial cell growth was achieved at initial lower concentration of 20 mg l whereas bacterial growth was drastically reduced at higher cr vi concentration of 200 mg l moreover increasing cr vi concentration results in prolonged lag phase of bacterial growth this extended lag period could be because of the adaptation of bacterial cells with the higher cr vi concentration in the medium 32 thus it is advised that high cr vi concentration can cause significant decrease in bacterial growth in comparison to low concentration with extended lag phase condition to survive and grow during the revelation of cr vi concentration the growth tolerance and simultaneous reduction of cr vi by bacillus cereus was studied at various increasing concentration ranging from 25 400 mg l this study presented that the growth of bacterial stain gets stimulated up to 75 mg l of cr vi concentration in the medium further increase in the concentration bacterial growth declined drastically in comparison to without cr vi control medium 8 the viability of the cells at high cr vi concentration was most likely associated with the alteration of genetic property or morphology of bacteria and altered metabolic reactions in bacteria the evaluation of cr vi toxicity on bacterial growth was also influenced by nutrient rich media the nutrient rich media with higher peptides amino acids and vitamins support good bacterial growth at higher concentration 33 bacillus strain tcl isolated from coalmine could tolerate upto 2000 mg l of cr vi showed remarkable stress response at 500 mg l cr vi concentration the results revealed that at 500 mg l cr vi concentration bacterium showed a sustained lag phase with a number of noticeable adaptations which were relieved by utilising 2xyt nutrient rich medium however chromium free medium cells exhibited normal growth with significant cell viability 33 moreover a gram negative strain s maltophila evaluated for chromium reduction potential at 10 70 80 300 and 500 mg l concentration at ph 7 and 37 c temperature the chromate reduction studies demonstrated that increasing concentration of cr vi in the medium decreased the growth rate but was not directly related with the quantity of cr vi reduced 17 sanjay et al 7 reported two different bacterial species klebsiella pnenumoniae and mangrovibacter yixingensis isolated from tannery effluent showed high tolerance potential for cr vi up to 80 mg l and 100 mg l respectively 3 3 chromium vi reduction by microbacterium paraoxydans scrb 19 the cr vi reducing capability of the bacterial isolate microbacterium paraoxydans was also monitored in lb broth batch culture medium at 100 200 300 and 500 mg l cr vi under aerobic condition and at regular time interval over 96 h the bacterium could reduce maximum 100 200 300 and 500 mg l cr vi by 93 45 87 28 72 01 and 39 24 respectively after 96 h as shown in fig 2 a the chromium reduction capability of bacterium was directly proportional to the cell density as demonstrated in fig 2b more than 50 of cr vi got reduced in 48 h when the initial concentration of cr vi ranged from 100 300 mg l however at 500 mg l the reduction was found to be only 30 after 48 h of incubation after 96 h of incubation achieved 93 45 maximum cr vi reduction at 100 mg l and 39 24 at 500 mg l meanwhile during the reduction period as the chromium concentration increases from 100 mg l to higher 500 mg l the bacterial growth gradually decreases by 60 from lower to higher cr vi concentration therefore the rate of chromium reduction is significantly affected by initial cr vi concentration the differentiation in percentage of reduction among different treatments are statistically different and significant p 0 05 evaluated by using one way anova our results clearly indicate that rate of chromium reduction was purely dependent on bacterial growth in our experiment maximum cr vi reduction was observed up to 24 h conforming the exponential bacterial cell growth phase as the concentration increases bacterial cell density slightly decreases due to inhibitory action of cr vi 34 this phenomena of chromium reduction with increase in cell density at lower cr vi concentration and decrease at higher cr vi concentration was also reported in several studies 32 35 however the cr vi reduction showed a proportional relationship with increasing time period so the kinetic study of cr vi reduction was evaluated at various cr vi concentrations with incubating time intervals to know the reduction rate of reaction fig 2c according to the previous experimental studies the kinetic course study of different concentration of cr vi reduction fit well with pseudo first order kinetics and follows the exponential decay of respective concentration with time 36 y a e k t c o c t a e k t linearized form become l n c o c t l n a k t where a is constant y co ct is the fraction of cr vi reduction at time t co is the initial concentration of cr vi and ct is the concentration after exposing to cr vi at time t and k is the rate constant of reduction process kinetics study showed that the time course reduction data fitted well r2 0 98 to the linearized appearance of exponential rate of equation 37 38 it was noted that the greater reduction 9 7 10 1 h 1 at the lowest primary concentration of 100 mg l and least rate of reduction 4 1 10 1 h 1 at highest concentration of cr vi i e 500 mg l fig 2c depicts the r2 values i e r2 0 97 0 97 0 94 and 0 98 for 100 200 300 and 500 mg l respectively the statistical analysis of linear model significantly showed higher f value and lower p value p 0 01 for respective cr vi reduction which evidenced that the model was most significant and fitted quite well on reduction kinetics moreover the rate constants values reported for cr vi reduction at 50 250 mg l with vigribacillus sp were found highest 5 56 10 2 h 1 at 50 mg l to lowest 0 69 10 2 h 1 at 250 mg l isolated from mangrove soil 39 similar type of results was reported by das et al 37 using linearized from of exponential rate equation r2 0 97 in the kinetic study of cr vi reduction with bacillius amyloliquefaciens the bacterium displayed the greater amount of reduction rate 2 8 10 2 h 1 at lowest cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and the lowest reduction rate i e 0 44 10 2 h 1 at 100 mg l cr vi concentration 37 bacillus and pseudomonads are extensively reported for cr vi reduction investigations although a rare literature was available regarding the reduction potential of cr vi by the members of microbacterium genus desai et al 40 isolated three bacillus sp strains from chromium contaminated site of industrial estate and identified as bacillus cereus bacillus fusiformis and bacillus sphericus all the three bacillus sp were effectively reported to reduce 250 mm of cr vi completely within 30 h elangovan et al 41 reported reduction of cr vi from 80 mg l to 40 mg l by using bacillus sp subsequently following 42 h in nutrient medium while bacillus sp conveyed by chandhuru et al 42 reduce 80 mg l of cr vi to 30 mg l at 35 c after 72 h at alkaline ph 8 0 alcaligenes faecalis was also found to reduce 60 of 50 mg l of cr vi after 62 h of incubation 43 pseudomonas sp crb 5 was capable to reduce 20 mg l of cr vi to zero cr vi after 120 h but did not show any reduction at increased concentration of 100 mg l as studied by mcclean and beveridge 44 microbacterium sp mp30 reported by pattanapipaisal et al 45 showed complete reduction of 20 mg l of cr vi in 72 h under anaerobic condition bacillus firmus strain te7 obtained from tannery effluent by bachate et al 46 elucidated the cr vi reduction under static condition and shaking condition the strain te7 was found capable to show complete reduction of 100 mg l of cr vi at static condition however at shaking condition it showed only 40 cr vi reduction of 100 mg l the cr vi reduction efficiency of free and immobilized cells of bacillus cerus strain cr1 was investigated in tannery effluent by kumari et al 8 this study demonstrates that immobilized cells are more proficient in chromium removal 92 as compared to free cells 73 after 48 h a cr vi resistant bacterial strain microbacterium testaceum b hs2 isolated from tannery wastewater by elahi et al 47 the bacterium could resist upto 48 mm concentration of cr vi and exhibited optimum growth at 37 c and ph 7 the pilot scale study inferred the strain b hs2 was efficiently remove 96 of cr vi from tannery wastewater within 6 days of incubation 47 the reduction potential of cr vi was performed and reported by all these investigators were studies at various conditions but at a low concentration whereas our isolated bacterium microbacterium paraoxydans scrb 19 exhibits higher tolerance 1000 mg l against chromium and effectively reduce hexavalent chromium at higher concentration ranged from 200 500 mg l 3 4 chromate reductase enzyme activity enzyme mediated reduction of cr vi is a redox reaction which involves nadh or nadph as an electron donor that rapidly reduces cr vi to cr v with one electron donor followed by transfer of two electron to form stable cr iii 48 to determine the chromate reductase activity of m paraoxydans the extracellular and cell free extract fractions were used and heat denatured supernatant were used as control mostly bacterial chromate reductase were described either contained in the cytosolic or membrane bound fraction where as a small literature is reported on extracellular chromate reductase activity 27 49 in present study the chromate reductase activity was observed in extracellular fraction 1 603 0 041 u ml and 0 856 0 041u ml in cell free extract respectively as presented in table 2 however there is no chromate reductase activity observed in the control containing heat denatured heat killed cells the maximum reduction in cr vi i e 81 86 was correlate to the maximum activity of chromate reductase enzyme whereas only 44 14 reduction of cr vi was recorded in intracellular fraction chromate reductase enzyme were reported in a number of bacterial species but very few of them have been characterized 50 the bacillus qc1 2 strains showed soluble reductase enzyme as the enzyme activity was found in supernatant fluid rather than in membrane fraction further chromate reductase activity was reported by illias et al 29 in the culture supernatant and cell lysate rather than cell extract fraction of their two isolate ifr 2 and ifr 3 the resulting chromate reductase activity of in present study corroborates in similar way with earlier reported bacterial strains those having both membrane bound extracellular and soluble proteins to reduce cr vi chromate reductase activity also reported in bacillus sp es 29 in cfe with nadh 16 membrane associated chromate reductase activity was described in pseudomonas fluorescence lb 300 and in bacillus megaterium tkw3 all these data indicated that chromate reductase enzyme can be associated with extracellular intracellular and membrane fraction 3 5 instrumental analysis of chromium vi reduced product 3 5 1 sem edx analysis the sem analysis inferred the presence of elongated rod shape and uniform size of the bacterial cells along with smooth cell surface fig 3 a in control whereas shape of chromium contaminated cells were considerably change enlarged with rough surface when exposed to cr vi fig 3b similar surface morphology and topology was also noted in acinotobacter haemolyticus and e coli k 12 cells when grown with and without chromium treatments 48 49 51 the cells developed in the occurrence of cr vi were notably larger than the cells grown in the absence of cr vi enlargement of cells due to exposure of cr vi which may imply the retardation of cell separation and ultimately lead to cell elongation edx analysis of chromium treated cells showed prominent peak of chromium at binding energy of 5 4 kev which attributed to chromium for the intracellular absorption to the bacterial strain those treated with cr vi fig 4 b however no single peak of chromium was noted in the control samples fig 4a therefore the edx analysis of cr treated cells confirms the presence of cr on bacterial cell surface whereas non treated cells confirms the absence of cr the similar results of sem edx analysis were also demonstrated by elahi et al 47 investigated the interaction of cr vi on the surface of m testaceum b sh2 and its intracellular accumulation during the bioremediation process by the edx and sem analysis 3 5 2 ft ir analysis ftir analysis was performed to identify the functional groups attached to the bacterial cell wall and their synchronization with reduced cr iii products 52 53 peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell wall constituted to be potent binder of cr iii complexes binding of such reduced cr iii is mainly dependent of the distribution of reactive functional groups present on the bacterial cell surface chatterjee et al 54 reported two foremost functional groups on bacterial cell surface that are primarily accountable for reduced cr iii binding are cooh and nh in pseudomonas aeruginosa the ft ir analysis of bacillus sp revealed the shift of peak position of reduced cr iii in coordination with surface functional group 55 the ftir spectrum of each peak of treated and untreated cells of m paraoxydans was presented in fig a2 supplementary material the broad absorption bands found around 3450 3200 cm 1 were indicative of oh and nh group were 56 the absorption peaks in the range of 1540 1640 cm 1 represents the primary and secondary amide bands of the amide bond of protein peptide bonds correlates to nh bending while the peaks observed at 1239 and 1083 cm 1 attributed to so3 group and co stretching of cooh the comparative study of chromium treated and untreated ft ir spectra of the m paraoxydans isolate used in this study showed several changes in the frequencies from 3450 2800 cm 1 and 1600 618 cm 1 shifting of higher frequency peak from 3425 cm 1 control to lower frequency 3401 cm 1 in cr vi treated sample designated for the involvement of hydroxyl and amide stretching of protein a shift in the peak at 2969 to 2964 cm 1 is assigned to the ch stretching such changes in frequencies were happened due to binding of chromium metal with several functional groups exhibited on the surface of the bacterial cell 57 the treated m paraoxydans cells exhibited significant shift in frequency from 1408 to to lower range 1400 cm 1 which inferred the strong interaction of oc o group in the chromium binding the slight shifting of lower 1649 cm 1 frequency to a higher frequency of 1650 cm 1 correlated to the intervention of c o group of the amide i bond and shifting of 1549 cm 1 to lower frequency 1547 cm 1 indicating involvement of amide ii bond in the chromium adsorption process 3 5 3 xrd and xps analysis sem edx and ftir analysis evidenced that chromium was available on bacterial cell surface and carboxyl and amino groups bind with the reduced cr iii species further xrd and xps was employed to study the nature and characterization of cr iii species the x ray diffraction was recorded by using cu kα radiation 40 ma 45 kv at 2θ min scanning speed and the peak pattern of bacterial cells treated with cr vi was showed in fig a3 supplementary material the diffractogram of cr vi exposed cells showed various peaks at 2θ 25 77 27 22 31 65 45 27 38 2 suggested the presence of possible reduce cr iii compound the cr vi might be reduced to chromium oxide calcium chromium hydroxide sodium chromium phosphate and calcium chromium oxide as the peak values reported by srivastava and thakur 58 and karthik et al 59 reduction of cr vi to cr iii precipitates by bacillus sp was also confirmed by xrd analysis 37 38 mohite et al 60 elucidated the biotransformation of cr vi into cr iii nanoparticles in schwanniomyces occidentalis by using xrd analysis the xps spectral analysis of cr vi exposed cells showed convoluted peak in the chromium region fig 5 the prominent peaks at binding energy of 578 3 577 8 and 576 ev probably attributed for chromium oxide and chromium hydroxide which evidence the reduction of vi valance state to iii valance state of chromium 61 these binding energies correspond to cr 2p 3 2 orbital which assigned to cr iii forms 62 xps analysis of cr vi treated cells of oceanobacillus oncorhynchi 18 cellulosimicrobium funkei 59 and bacillus subtilis strains confirms the cr iii speciation form 55 bioremediation employs bacteria could provide an alternative to restore polluted environments or helps conventional methods of metal removal and recovery in an eco friendly manner in addition to chromium removal microbial reduction of cr vi to cr iii offers a key solution towards chromium recovery also chromium recovery from industrial wastewaters is greatly important for environmental and economic reasons 63 64 microorganisms possess high metal binding capacity for chromium due to the presence of carboxyl hydroxyl and amine function groups involved in the complexation of chromium metals 54 55 interaction among microbes and metals primarily includes metal assimilation and metal dissimilation process in case of assimilation microbesassimilates metals into cellular materials as enzyme cofactor the metal recovery process involves dissimilatory metal reduction using metal as an external electron acceptor 65 the cr vi may act as terminal electron acceptor getting reduced into cr iii ions and binds to the bacterial cell wall 28 reduced chromium ions accumulated on the surface of microbial cells can be easily recovered by eluting with an acidic solution 66 hence the utilization of bacterial cells is significantly applicable for the treatment of contaminated tannery effluent and sludge from the perspectives of bioremediation since this is also applied in the metal recovery techniques the major findings of this paper indicated that the isolated bacterium microbacterium paraoxydans exhibits higher cr vi reduction potential and reduced upto 93 45 of cr vi from batch study experiments the microbial reduction of toxic cr vi to less toxic cr iii by microbacterium paraoxydans was also analyzed by sem edx ftir xps and xrd instrumental analysis thus this chromium reducing bacterium can be practiced for the reduction of chromium contaminated tannery effluent and metal recovery process 4 conclusions cr vi resistant bacterium sceb 19 was isolated from chromium contaminated tannery wastewater and assessed capability for chromium reduction results revealed that the bacterium could effectively reduce cr vi at higher lethal concentration from 100 to 500 mg l the bacterium showed maximum reduction potential i e 93 45 at 100 mg l and lowest reduction potential 39 24 at 500 mg l the analytical studies of cr vi exposed cell by sem edx ft ir and xrd and xps provides greater understanding of cr vi tolerance and reduction phenomenon the results evidenced that chromium was reduced to cr iii by microbacterium paraoxydans and reduced product was bound to the bacterial cell surface via amino and carboxyl functional groups further the bacterium also exhibits chromate reductase enzyme activity which might be a possible way for reduction of toxic cr vi to less toxic cr iii thus the obtained results explored that the genus microbacterium with significant cr vi reduction potential and can be a promising bio agent for ecofriendly clean up strategies of toxic cr vi an enzyme mediated reduction process of chromium explores the new sources of bioremediation of toxic chromium contaminated environment hence further more detailed studies on the molecular characterization and optimization of chromate reductase enzyme activityin this isolate could be a vital step to exploit the key insights of cr vi mechanism by microbacterium paraoxydans declaration of

for ecofriendly clean up strategies of toxic cr vi from polluted environments keywords cr vi reduction microbacterium paraoxydans sem edx ft ir xrd and xps analysis 1 introduction in developing and underdeveloped countries inappropriate discharge of industrial effluents into natural water resources and soil pose a serious threat to the existing environment due to the high concentrations of heavy metal such as copper cadmium chromium lead nickel and mercury 1 heavy metals are highly toxic persistent and potent inhibitors of ecological and biological activities chromium is one of the environmental pollutants that extensively used in leather tanning steel manufacturing plants mining and metal finishing wood preservatives textile ceramics and chemical industries etc 2 chromium exists in a number of valence states ranging from 2 to 6 however the most ordinary and steady form is trivalent cr iii as cation whereas hexavalent chromium cr vi as divalent oxyanion chromate form cr vi is 100 times toxic than cr iii because of its high solubility and transportability in water 3 4 high levels of cr vi leads to itching and corrosion of the respiratory tract nasal and skin irritation ulceration and lung carcinoma in humans it also reduces soil fertility affects the soil microbial communities adversely and retarded plant growth in view of such toxicity and carcinogenicity of cr vi contamination on human health plants and other organisms can be considered as priority pollutant in class a human carcinogen among hazardous substances 5 it is well known that tannery industries use a huge amount of chromium salts in chrome tanning process this chrome tanning usually takes up small amount of applied chromium and nearly 2000 3200 tones of chromium discharged annually as waste into the environment elevated chromium concentration ranging from 2000 to 5000 mg l reported in tannery wastewater shown to be significantly higher than its permissible limit 2 mg l for wastewater release 6 the tannery effluent serves as a main resource of chromium pollution in the environment and also contains other inorganic pollutants and proteins which make it an ideal medium for bacterial growth 7 the release of inadequately treated tannery wastewater into the environment causes detrimental water and soil pollution which imposes negatives effects on animal and plant health the genotoxic cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of tannery wastewater are also well reported 8 9 as a metal cr is non biodegradable and can only be transformed from its highly toxic state of cr vi to a non toxic state of cr iii or it might be removed by conventional treatment processes of adsorption accumulation ion exchange and chemical precipitation 10 13 nano zero valent iron nzvi remediation technology is of great interest for chromium reduction due to the strong dependence of chromium toxicity on its oxidation state 14 coated and uncoated nano valent iron nzvi biomass are effectively employed for the large scale elimination of cr vi from synthetic wastewaters 15 moreover nano filteration membrane techniques are also developed which are efficiently useful for chromium recovery from tannery wastewater streams 11 however these conventional methods are of high cost and produce enormous quantity of toxic sludge and derived pollutants thus the study of metal resistant microorganisms isolated from tannery wastewater for the detoxification reduction of cr vi has recently gained importance and offers a safe and eco friendly option to achieve bioremediation of chromium contaminated environments 16 18 a large number of microorganisms have been reported including pseudomonas enterococcus bacillus and escherichia that resist and reduce cr vi by developing metal resistance mechanisms of periplasmic biosorption intracellular bioaccumulation dna methylation metal resistant plasmids and biotransformation to cr iii all the way through enzymatic reaction or in some way by making complex metabolites 19 chromate reductases are highly efficient in the alteration of highly toxic cr vi into a less toxic and stable cr iii under aerobic and anaerobic environments the aim of the present investigation is to isolate and illustrate a cr vi resistant bacterial strain that is capable to reduce cr vi at high concentration and to explore the reduction potentiality and characterization of its reduced product 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals and reagents utilized for this investigation are of molecular or analytical grade procured from

and screening of chromium vi resistant bacterial strains substantial use of chromium in tannery industries has resulted in considerable source of environment contamination due to superfluous usage of chromium salts in chrome tanning process tannery wastewater contains chromates and dichromate oxyanions of cr vi according to the alkaline and acidic nature of the effluent 28 however in tannery wastewater chromium does not only exist in the hexavalent form but in these two forms cr vi and cr iii the cr iii from is predominant which is not surprising since it is one of the main tanning reagent cr2 oh 2 so4 2 during tanning processing only 60 80 of chromium reacts with the leather and remaining gets discharged into the sewage system therefore tannery wastewater sample was used to isolate of bacterial that can abide and reduce cr vi proficiently primarily five cr vi resistant bacterial strains were isolated by means of enrichment culture technique followed by serial dilution method on lb agar plates contained 100 mg l cr vi these five isolates were subjected to mic screening to check their resistance against high concentration of cr vi ranges from 100 to 1000 mg l among the five cr vi resistant bacterial isolates isolate scrb 19 exhibited the highest cr vi tolerance at 500 mg l this bacterial strain was further selected for cr vi reduction studies bacterial strains exhibited high chromium tolerance were more capable to reduce cr vi to cr iii and be able to developed as good bio agent for remediation of chromium pollution 29 3 1 1 characteristics of isolated chromium vi resistant bacterium the colony of bacterial isolate scrb 19 had light yellow coloration when grown on lb agar medium this yellow colour did not disperse into the medium the microscopic observation and gram s staining tests showed that the bacterium was gram positive rod shaped non spore forming and motile in nature moreover numbers of biochemical tests were performed for the biochemical characterization of bacterial isolate with the help of bergey s manual as presented in table 1 the freshly grown culture displayed negative test for indole mr vp citrate utilization and triple sugar iron ager test the bacterium was also failed to give h2s production and did not capable to produce amylase enzymes as it gives negative test for starch hydrolysis moreover bacterium gives positive oxidase test which suggested that bacterium possesses the cytochrome oxidase enzyme and aerobic in nature capable of utilizing o2 as final hydrogen receptor catalase test was also found positive for the bacterium which also indicated that bacterium was capable to respire using o2 as a terminal electron acceptor this bacterium also showed positive reactions for cellulose lipase nitrate reductase and gelatinase enzymes the bacterium is capable to hydrolyze milk protein as it gives positive test for casein hydrolysis further 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis of the isolated bacterium was matched with known sequences of ncbi database using blast n showed 99 closest similarity to the member of genus microbacterium and identified as microbacterium paraoxydans with accession number kx710178 fig a1 supplementary material 3 2 effect of chromium vi concentration on growth of m paraoxydans scrb 19 the effects of chromium vi on bacterial growth of m paraoxydans scrb 19 towards different cr vi concentrations was studies in lb broth the bacterial strain was capable to grow and tolerate low to high 100 500 mg l cr vi concentration the results showed no noteworthy divergence in bacterial growth at lowered concentrations as shown in fig 1 however at higher concentration 500 mg l cr vi appeared to affects bacterial growth negatively the results showed that at 100 200 and 300 mg l cr vi concentration bacterial growth found to be resistant and achieved maximum bacterial growth whereas at 500 mg l cr vi concentration the bacterial growth was reduced and results in slow growth period mostly with the increased cr vi concentration the inhibition of growth also gets increased however excellent growth was observed in the medium containing up to 500 mg l of cr vi concentration 29 high cr vi concentration exhibits toxic and inhibitory effects on bacterial growth results in reduced biomass and prolonged lag period to acclimatizes higher stress condition 30 the effect of cr vi concentration 5 100 mg l on bacterial growth of bacillus sp strain xw 4 was evaluated by liu et al 31 indicated that bacterial growth got significantly affected at 100 mg l cr vi the bacterial cell growth was remarkably influenced when the higher cr vi concentration was increased up to 100 mg l while initial lower cr vi concentration at 5 10 and 20 mg l showed moderate effect on bacterial growth 31 shekhar et al 32 also studied the bacterial growth kinetics of pseudomonas sp strain v3 at increasing cr vi concentration from 20 200 mg l this study indicated that the maximum bacterial cell growth was achieved at initial lower concentration of 20 mg l whereas bacterial growth was drastically reduced at higher cr vi concentration of 200 mg l moreover increasing cr vi concentration results in prolonged lag phase of bacterial growth this extended lag period could be because of the adaptation of bacterial cells with the higher cr vi concentration in the medium 32 thus it is advised that high cr vi concentration can cause significant decrease in bacterial growth in comparison to low concentration with extended lag phase condition to survive and grow during the revelation of cr vi concentration the growth tolerance and simultaneous reduction of cr vi by bacillus cereus was studied at various increasing concentration ranging from 25 400 mg l this study presented that the growth of bacterial stain gets stimulated up to 75 mg l of cr vi concentration in the medium further increase in the concentration bacterial growth declined drastically in comparison to without cr vi control medium 8 the viability of the cells at high cr vi concentration was most likely associated with the alteration of genetic property or morphology of bacteria and altered metabolic reactions in bacteria the evaluation of cr vi toxicity on bacterial growth was also influenced by nutrient rich media the nutrient rich media with higher peptides amino acids and vitamins support good bacterial growth at higher concentration 33 bacillus strain tcl isolated from coalmine could tolerate upto 2000 mg l of cr vi showed remarkable stress response at 500 mg l cr vi concentration the results revealed that at 500 mg l cr vi concentration bacterium showed a sustained lag phase with a number of noticeable adaptations which were relieved by utilising 2xyt nutrient rich medium however chromium free medium cells exhibited normal growth with significant cell viability 33 moreover a gram negative strain s maltophila evaluated for chromium reduction potential at 10 70 80 300 and 500 mg l concentration at ph 7 and 37 c temperature the chromate reduction studies demonstrated that increasing concentration of cr vi in the medium decreased the growth rate but was not directly related with the quantity of cr vi reduced 17 sanjay et al 7 reported two different bacterial species klebsiella pnenumoniae and mangrovibacter yixingensis isolated from tannery effluent showed high tolerance potential for cr vi up to 80 mg l and 100 mg l respectively 3 3 chromium vi reduction by microbacterium paraoxydans scrb 19 the cr vi reducing capability of the bacterial isolate microbacterium paraoxydans was also monitored in lb broth batch culture medium at 100 200 300 and 500 mg l cr vi under aerobic condition and at regular time interval over 96 h the bacterium could reduce maximum 100 200 300 and 500 mg l cr vi by 93 45 87 28 72 01 and 39 24 respectively after 96 h as shown in fig 2 a the chromium reduction capability of bacterium was directly proportional to the cell density as demonstrated in fig 2b more than 50 of cr vi got reduced in 48 h when the initial concentration of cr vi ranged from 100 300 mg l however at 500 mg l the reduction was found to be only 30 after 48 h of incubation after 96 h of incubation achieved 93 45 maximum cr vi reduction at 100 mg l and 39 24 at 500 mg l meanwhile during the reduction period as the chromium concentration increases from 100 mg l to higher 500 mg l the bacterial growth gradually decreases by 60 from lower to higher cr vi concentration therefore the rate of chromium reduction is significantly affected by initial cr vi concentration the differentiation in percentage of reduction among different treatments are statistically different and significant p 0 05 evaluated by using one way anova our results clearly indicate that rate of chromium reduction was purely dependent on bacterial growth in our experiment maximum cr vi reduction was observed up to 24 h conforming the exponential bacterial cell growth phase as the concentration increases bacterial cell density slightly decreases due to inhibitory action of cr vi 34 this phenomena of chromium reduction with increase in cell density at lower cr vi concentration and decrease at higher cr vi concentration was also reported in several studies 32 35 however the cr vi reduction showed a proportional relationship with increasing time period so the kinetic study of cr vi reduction was evaluated at various cr vi concentrations with incubating time intervals to know the reduction rate of reaction fig 2c according to the previous experimental studies the kinetic course study of different concentration of cr vi reduction fit well with pseudo first order kinetics and follows the exponential decay of respective concentration with time 36 y a e k t c o c t a e k t linearized form become l n c o c t l n a k t where a is constant y co ct is the fraction of cr vi reduction at time t co is the initial concentration of cr vi and ct is the concentration after exposing to cr vi at time t and k is the rate constant of reduction process kinetics study showed that the time course reduction data fitted well r2 0 98 to the linearized appearance of exponential rate of equation 37 38 it was noted that the greater reduction 9 7 10 1 h 1 at the lowest primary concentration of 100 mg l and least rate of reduction 4 1 10 1 h 1 at highest concentration of cr vi i e 500 mg l fig 2c depicts the r2 values i e r2 0 97 0 97 0 94 and 0 98 for 100 200 300 and 500 mg l respectively the statistical analysis of linear model significantly showed higher f value and lower p value p 0 01 for respective cr vi reduction which evidenced that the model was most significant and fitted quite well on reduction kinetics moreover the rate constants values reported for cr vi reduction at 50 250 mg l with vigribacillus sp were found highest 5 56 10 2 h 1 at 50 mg l to lowest 0 69 10 2 h 1 at 250 mg l isolated from mangrove soil 39 similar type of results was reported by das et al 37 using linearized from of exponential rate equation r2 0 97 in the kinetic study of cr vi reduction with bacillius amyloliquefaciens the bacterium displayed the greater amount of reduction rate 2 8 10 2 h 1 at lowest cr vi concentration of 10 mg l and the lowest reduction rate i e 0 44 10 2 h 1 at 100 mg l cr vi concentration 37 bacillus and pseudomonads are extensively reported for cr vi reduction investigations although a rare literature was available regarding the reduction potential of cr vi by the members of microbacterium genus desai et al 40 isolated three bacillus sp strains from chromium contaminated site of industrial estate and identified as bacillus cereus bacillus fusiformis and bacillus sphericus all the three bacillus sp were effectively reported to reduce 250 mm of cr vi completely within 30 h elangovan et al 41 reported reduction of cr vi from 80 mg l to 40 mg l by using bacillus sp subsequently following 42 h in nutrient medium while bacillus sp conveyed by chandhuru et al 42 reduce 80 mg l of cr vi to 30 mg l at 35 c after 72 h at alkaline ph 8 0 alcaligenes faecalis was also found to reduce 60 of 50 mg l of cr vi after 62 h of incubation 43 pseudomonas sp crb 5 was capable to reduce 20 mg l of cr vi to zero cr vi after 120 h but did not show any reduction at increased concentration of 100 mg l as studied by mcclean and beveridge 44 microbacterium sp mp30 reported by pattanapipaisal et al 45 showed complete reduction of 20 mg l of cr vi in 72 h under anaerobic condition bacillus firmus strain te7 obtained from tannery effluent by bachate et al 46 elucidated the cr vi reduction under static condition and shaking condition the strain te7 was found capable to show complete reduction of 100 mg l of cr vi at static condition however at shaking condition it showed only 40 cr vi reduction of 100 mg l the cr vi reduction efficiency of free and immobilized cells of bacillus cerus strain cr1 was investigated in tannery effluent by kumari et al 8 this study demonstrates that immobilized cells are more proficient in chromium removal 92 as compared to free cells 73 after 48 h a cr vi resistant bacterial strain microbacterium testaceum b hs2 isolated from tannery wastewater by elahi et al 47 the bacterium could resist upto 48 mm concentration of cr vi and exhibited optimum growth at 37 c and ph 7 the pilot scale study inferred the strain b hs2 was efficiently remove 96 of cr vi from tannery wastewater within 6 days of incubation 47 the reduction potential of cr vi was performed and reported by all these investigators were studies at various conditions but at a low concentration whereas our isolated bacterium microbacterium paraoxydans scrb 19 exhibits higher tolerance 1000 mg l against chromium and effectively reduce hexavalent chromium at higher concentration ranged from 200 500 mg l 3 4 chromate reductase enzyme activity enzyme mediated reduction of cr vi is a redox reaction which involves nadh or nadph as an electron donor that rapidly reduces cr vi to cr v with one electron donor followed by transfer of two electron to form stable cr iii 48 to determine the chromate reductase activity of m paraoxydans the extracellular and cell free extract fractions were used and heat denatured supernatant were used as control mostly bacterial chromate reductase were described either contained in the cytosolic or membrane bound fraction where as a small literature is reported on extracellular chromate reductase activity 27 49 in present study the chromate reductase activity was observed in extracellular fraction 1 603 0 041 u ml and 0 856 0 041u ml in cell free extract respectively as presented in table 2 however there is no chromate reductase activity observed in the control containing heat denatured heat killed cells the maximum reduction in cr vi i e 81 86 was correlate to the maximum activity of chromate reductase enzyme whereas only 44 14 reduction of cr vi was recorded in intracellular fraction chromate reductase enzyme were reported in a number of bacterial species but very few of them have been characterized 50 the bacillus qc1 2 strains showed soluble reductase enzyme as the enzyme activity was found in supernatant fluid rather than in membrane fraction further chromate reductase activity was reported by illias et al 29 in the culture supernatant and cell lysate rather than cell extract fraction of their two isolate ifr 2 and ifr 3 the resulting chromate reductase activity of in present study corroborates in similar way with earlier reported bacterial strains those having both membrane bound extracellular and soluble proteins to reduce cr vi chromate reductase activity also reported in bacillus sp es 29 in cfe with nadh 16 membrane associated chromate reductase activity was described in pseudomonas fluorescence lb 300 and in bacillus megaterium tkw3 all these data indicated that chromate reductase enzyme can be associated with extracellular intracellular and membrane fraction 3 5 instrumental analysis of chromium vi reduced product 3 5 1 sem edx analysis the sem analysis inferred the presence of elongated rod shape and uniform size of the bacterial cells along with smooth cell surface fig 3 a in control whereas shape of chromium contaminated cells were considerably change enlarged with rough surface when exposed to cr vi fig 3b similar surface morphology and topology was also noted in acinotobacter haemolyticus and e coli k 12 cells when grown with and without chromium treatments 48 49 51 the cells developed in the occurrence of cr vi were notably larger than the cells grown in the absence of cr vi enlargement of cells due to exposure of cr vi which may imply the retardation of cell separation and ultimately lead to cell elongation edx analysis of chromium treated cells showed prominent peak of chromium at binding energy of 5 4 kev which attributed to chromium for the intracellular absorption to the bacterial strain those treated with cr vi fig 4 b however no single peak of chromium was noted in the control samples fig 4a therefore the edx analysis of cr treated cells confirms the presence of cr on bacterial cell surface whereas non treated cells confirms the absence of cr the similar results of sem edx analysis were also demonstrated by elahi et al 47 investigated the interaction of cr vi on the surface of m testaceum b sh2 and its intracellular accumulation during the bioremediation process by the edx and sem analysis 3 5 2 ft ir analysis ftir analysis was performed to identify the functional groups attached to the bacterial cell wall and their synchronization with reduced cr iii products 52 53 peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell wall constituted to be potent binder of cr iii complexes binding of such reduced cr iii is mainly dependent of the distribution of reactive functional groups present on the bacterial cell surface chatterjee et al 54 reported two foremost functional groups on bacterial cell surface that are primarily accountable for reduced cr iii binding are cooh and nh in pseudomonas aeruginosa the ft ir analysis of bacillus sp revealed the shift of peak position of reduced cr iii in coordination with surface functional group 55 the ftir spectrum of each peak of treated and untreated cells of m paraoxydans was presented in fig a2 supplementary material the broad absorption bands found around 3450 3200 cm 1 were indicative of oh and nh group were 56 the absorption peaks in the range of 1540 1640 cm 1 represents the primary and secondary amide bands of the amide bond of protein peptide bonds correlates to nh bending while the peaks observed at 1239 and 1083 cm 1 attributed to so3 group and co stretching of cooh the comparative study of chromium treated and untreated ft ir spectra of the m paraoxydans isolate used in this study showed several changes in the frequencies from 3450 2800 cm 1 and 1600 618 cm 1 shifting of higher frequency peak from 3425 cm 1 control to lower frequency 3401 cm 1 in cr vi treated sample designated for the involvement of hydroxyl and amide stretching of protein a shift in the peak at 2969 to 2964 cm 1 is assigned to the ch stretching such changes in frequencies were happened due to binding of chromium metal with several functional groups exhibited on the surface of the bacterial cell 57 the treated m paraoxydans cells exhibited significant shift in frequency from 1408 to to lower range 1400 cm 1 which inferred the strong interaction of oc o group in the chromium binding the slight shifting of lower 1649 cm 1 frequency to a higher frequency of 1650 cm 1 correlated to the intervention of c o group of the amide i bond and shifting of 1549 cm 1 to lower frequency 1547 cm 1 indicating involvement of amide ii bond in the chromium adsorption process 3 5 3 xrd and xps analysis sem edx and ftir analysis evidenced that chromium was available on bacterial cell surface and carboxyl and amino groups bind with the reduced cr iii species further xrd and xps was employed to study the nature and characterization of cr iii species the x ray diffraction was recorded by using cu kα radiation 40 ma 45 kv at 2θ min scanning speed and the peak pattern of bacterial cells treated with cr vi was showed in fig a3 supplementary material the diffractogram of cr vi exposed cells showed various peaks at 2θ 25 77 27 22 31 65 45 27 38 2 suggested the presence of possible reduce cr iii compound the cr vi might be reduced to chromium oxide calcium chromium hydroxide sodium chromium phosphate and calcium chromium oxide as the peak values reported by srivastava and thakur 58 and karthik et al 59 reduction of cr vi to cr iii precipitates by bacillus sp was also confirmed by xrd analysis 37 38 mohite et al 60 elucidated the biotransformation of cr vi into cr iii nanoparticles in schwanniomyces occidentalis by using xrd analysis the xps spectral analysis of cr vi exposed cells showed convoluted peak in the chromium region fig 5 the prominent peaks at binding energy of 578 3 577 8 and 576 ev probably attributed for chromium oxide and chromium hydroxide which evidence the reduction of vi valance state to iii valance state of chromium 61 these binding energies correspond to cr 2p 3 2 orbital which assigned to cr iii forms 62 xps analysis of cr vi treated cells of oceanobacillus oncorhynchi 18 cellulosimicrobium funkei 59 and bacillus subtilis strains confirms the cr iii speciation form 55 bioremediation employs bacteria could provide an alternative to restore polluted environments or helps conventional methods of metal removal and recovery in an eco friendly manner in addition to chromium removal microbial reduction of cr vi to cr iii offers a key solution towards chromium recovery also chromium recovery from industrial wastewaters is greatly important for environmental and economic reasons 63 64 microorganisms possess high metal binding capacity for chromium due to the presence of carboxyl hydroxyl and amine function groups involved in the complexation of chromium metals 54 55 interaction among microbes and metals primarily includes metal assimilation and metal dissimilation process in case of assimilation microbesassimilates metals into cellular materials as enzyme cofactor the metal recovery process involves dissimilatory metal reduction using metal as an external electron acceptor 65 the cr vi may act as terminal electron acceptor getting reduced into cr iii ions and binds to the bacterial cell wall 28 reduced chromium ions accumulated on the surface of microbial cells can be easily recovered by eluting with an acidic solution 66 hence the utilization of bacterial cells is significantly applicable for the treatment of contaminated tannery effluent and sludge from the perspectives of bioremediation since this is also applied in the metal recovery techniques the major findings of this paper indicated that the isolated bacterium microbacterium paraoxydans exhibits higher cr vi reduction potential and reduced upto 93 45 of cr vi from batch study experiments the microbial reduction of toxic cr vi to less toxic cr iii by microbacterium paraoxydans was also analyzed by sem edx ftir xps and xrd instrumental analysis thus this chromium reducing bacterium can be practiced for the reduction of chromium contaminated tannery effluent and metal recovery process 4 conclusions cr vi resistant bacterium sceb 19 was isolated from chromium contaminated tannery wastewater and assessed capability for chromium reduction results revealed that the bacterium could effectively reduce cr vi at higher lethal concentration from 100 to 500 mg l the bacterium showed maximum reduction potential i e 93 45 at 100 mg l and lowest reduction potential 39 24 at 500 mg l the analytical studies of cr vi exposed cell by sem edx ft ir and xrd and xps provides greater understanding of cr vi tolerance and reduction phenomenon the results evidenced that chromium was reduced to cr iii by microbacterium paraoxydans and reduced product was bound to the bacterial cell surface via amino and carboxyl functional groups further the bacterium also exhibits chromate reductase enzyme activity which might be a possible way for reduction of toxic cr vi to less toxic cr iii thus the obtained results explored that the genus microbacterium with significant cr vi reduction potential and can be a promising bio agent for ecofriendly clean up strategies of toxic cr vi an enzyme mediated reduction process of chromium explores the new sources of bioremediation of toxic chromium contaminated environment hence further more detailed studies on the molecular characterization and optimization of chromate reductase enzyme activityin this isolate could be a vital step to exploit the key insights of cr vi mechanism by microbacterium paraoxydans declaration of

13749,petroleum produced water has raised considerable environmental concerns due to the large amount of contaminants containing wastewater generated during petrol and gas extraction the present work proposes for the first time the use of vermiculite modified by magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles vmt mag as adsorbent for the extraction of metals and btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene pollutants and toxicity reduction thermally treated vermiculite was modified by fe3o4 nanoparticles of 20 nm which were strongly adhered to the surface contributing to the magnetization of the material and adsorption of the metals a 5 min exposure of wastewater to vmt mag at 15 mg ml 1 led to the removal of 93 of dissolved organic carbon 85 of btex compounds and a reduction of 30 87 of metals ba al ag hg and pb at low concentration an investigation was also conducted regarding the efficiency of vmt mag in reducing toxicity via toxicity assays using the water flea daphnia similis abtn nbr 12713 protocol the results showed a reduction of lethal concentration at 50 death lc50 from 5 80 v v to 13 3 v v respectively for the samples before and after treatment the findings show that the application of the proposed vmt mag can lead to a significant reduction of toxicity and the removal of btex and metals in petroleum produced water keywords petroleum produced water magnetite modified vermiculite emerging pollutants btex metals 1 introduction petroleum produced water is the name given to the water generated during the flooding process of crude oil extraction which involves water injection into the stratum to drive the crude oil out of the ground 1 the water produced in the oil extraction or drilling process may also merge with the wastewater formed during the process involving the separation of hydrocarbons leading to the formation of water oil composition in the ratio of 3 1 in 2017 petrobrás the brazilian petroleum multinational corporation reported to have disposed of 293 2 million m3 of wastewater containing 1 9 thousand tons of oil and grease and 5 4 thousand tons in terms of chemical oxygen demand 1 based on the data reported in 2018 once implemented the water recycling policy initiative proposed by the corporation would result in a reduction in the volume of produced water of approximately 289 million m3 the safe management of the wastewater disposal process requires significant improvements in the water treatment as a way of addressing this grave environmental issue in order to accomplish the globally sustainable development goals on green water recycling proposed by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco the composition of petroleum produced water is found to be complex and it generally consists of a mixture of organic and inorganic materials oils and grease 2 the quantities of these compounds present in the water depend on a variety of factors including the geological location of the basin and operational conditions in general the major compounds found in petroleum produced water consist of a mixture of dissolved and dispersed compounds in water these include hydrocarbons like benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex naphthalene phenanthrene dibenzothiophene polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and phenols 2 3 in addition produced water also contains dissolved oils such as pahs and c6 c9 alkylated phenols heavy metals such as cadmium chromium copper lead mercury nickel silver zinc naturally occurring radioactive materials a wide range of polar and charged compounds at low concentration dissolved gases 2 3 and extra chemicals added for the treatment or prevention of operational problems such as corrosion inhibitors biocides emulsion breakers antifoam and other substances employed in the water treatment process 4 5 the high volume of wastewater and the negative impact of produced water discharged in the environment have become an issue of great concern due to the danger and risks they pose to human health as well as to other living organisms and the biosphere as a whole 3 many conventional methods based on physical chemical and biological techniques have been proposed in the literature as part of environmental policies with a view to treating produced water by way of recycling and reutilization of the water after adequate degradation or removal of the pollutants present therein 2 among these methods the combined application of some physical treatment techniques based on adsorption coagulation and flotation gravity separation 6 and separation by membranes 7 has demonstrated good efficiency in terms of pollutants removal in this wastewater to date there is still no single and simple technique capable of removing the contaminants present in produced water or minimizing the risks they pose to human health and to the environment 8 with the aim of contributing to the extraction of organic inorganic and metallic compounds in produced water multi stage systems have been employed through the application of techniques targeted at removing oils greases and dissolved gas from the water as part of the materials employed in the treatment of produced water adsorbents have gained prominence owing to their low costs and potential for the removal of a variety of substances including activated carbon bentonite peat sand coal fiberglass polypropylene amberlite and organo clay from wastewater 9 studies reported in the literature 10 11 have shown that some minerals such as activated carbon organo clay zeolite resins and other adsorbents and polymers have been employed specifically for the removal of organic compounds or metals in produced wastewater despite the low costs and the ease of application of these materials the results obtained have demonstrated their restrictive efficiency interestingly the use of vermiculite has gained considerable attention among researchers because of its lightweight ph neutrality inertness and high absorbance and these properties contribute enormously toward the efficient treatment of wastewater 9 12 13 vermiculite is a planar hydrous phyllosilicate mineral that contains tetrahedral and octahedral sheets as a layer made of metal oxides mainly of aluminum ii or magnesium ii and silicon and some interlayer hydrated cations located in the space between layers 14 17 the structure of the brazilian vermiculite was previously determined by da fonseca et al 12 who demonstrated that the mineral was composed of the following si3 43al0 57 al0 26fe0 32mg2 34 o10 oh 2ca0 064na0 016k0 047 as can be noted the chemical composition of the brazilian vermiculite shows a relatively larger charge of octahedral sheet and interlayer region compared to other compositions presented by valášková and martynková et al 17 vermiculite in the form of shiny flakes are widely used in several industrial and chemical applications e g gardens horticulture animal feedstuff loose fill insulation lightweight concretes etc 9 that require the use of a low cost product because of the high demand for these services and for the treatment of large amount of contaminated water studies have demonstrated the ability of thermally treated vermiculite to remove oils and waxes from contaminated water 13 18 several reports in the literature have also pointed out the potential of vermiculite when it comes to the removal of metals in aqueous solution such as hg 19 ni 20 cs 21 zn 20 22 cu 20 23 cr 20 22 23 pb 20 22 24 and cd 20 and specific substances like phthalate 25 dibenzothiophene 26 and benzodiazepine 27 although there is considerable evidence regarding the ability of vermiculite to adsorb metal ions and organic compounds its application as adsorbent in petroleum contaminated water remains limited 11 modified minerals have been studied aiming at effecting changes in their physical and chemical properties with the incorporation of new characteristics and promoting better applicability of these materials 28 29 some studies reported in the literature have investigated the use of magnetite modified vermiculite with the objective of improving the applicability of the adsorbent in the treatment of wastewater 30 31 the addition of magnetite fe3o4 as superparamagnetic nanoparticles to the vermiculite contributes to their application in a large sample volume apart from promoting changes in the zeta potential of the material and magnifying its potential of adsorption of nonpolar molecules one also needs to take into account the ease of removal of the mineral after treatment through the use of magnet externally 30 32 thus the aim of the present work is to assess the efficiency of thermally treated vermiculite modified by magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 nps in the removal of dissolved organic compounds mainly btex and some heavy metals present in petroleum produced water as aforementioned one of the remarkable advantages of vermiculite lies in the fact that it is a low cost material with suitable properties that can contribute meaningfully toward the treatment of this complex wastewater the characterization of the minerals was carried out using scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd analyses were conducted regarding the surface areas and the magnetization of the modified mineral the removal of dissolved organic compounds was evaluated by the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and mainly by the variations of the chromatographic peak areas in this sense a qualitative analysis was conducted regarding the capacity of the mineral to adsorb organic compounds mass spectrometry analyses were performed in order to identify aromatic compounds and some metals which were separated from each other using gas chromatograph and an inductively coupled plasma system the modified vermiculites were compared in terms of their capacity to extract organic and inorganic substances from petroleum produced water in order to explicitly determine the influence of fe3o4 nps bound to the vermiculite 2 experimental 2 1 materials the expanded vermiculite vmt sample commercialized for horticultural applications was acquired from agrometana co a farm products company located in araraquara são paulo brazil the sample was smashed into small particles passed through a 0 50 mm sieve calcined at a temperature of 900 c for 3 min with scan rate of 10 c min 1 and kept in a glass container at room temperature the sample was named thermally treated vermiculite vmt tt the petroleum produced water was collected in april 2017 from petrobrás offshore platform in natal rio grande do norte brazil stored in polypropylene bottles and kept in a refrigerator 2 2 vermiculite modification with magnetite nanoparticles the incorporation of fe3o4 nps into the vmt tt suspension was carried out by mixing the mineral suspension in a solution containing 100 ml of iron ii and iron iii chloride hydrate under nitrogen gas in a ratio of 1 1 w w 33 the solutions of ferrous and ferric chloride in the form of tetrahydrate and hexahydrate respectively were prepared based on the molar ratio 1 2 total mass of 3 2 g in 30 ml of ultrapure water after inert bubbling the solid suspension of 2 5 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide was added slowly to the solution forming a brownish black suspended powder magnetic vermiculite vmt mag was obtained by the separation of the excess of fe3o4 nps the successive washing of the powder with ultrapure water and decanting it with magnet helped distinguish vmt mag from fe3o4 nps the desired material was dried at 60 c and stored in a glass container at room temperature fig 1 illustrates the steps involved in each modification 2 3 equipment

acid solution this acid solution was applied as the blank solution the calibration curves were constructed using triplicate measurements with a relative standard deviation below 10 the real sample was also evaluated in triplicate using the analytical curves to determine the concentration of each metal the results are displayed with error bars representing the standard deviation 2 4 evaluation of vmt mag as adsorbent of organic compounds and dissolved metals the extraction of organic compounds from the thermally treated vmt tt or modified vmt mag vermiculites was carried out by putting 30 mg of each vermiculite in 2 ml of petroleum produced water sample without previous treatment the suspension was stirred and the supernatant of vmt tt was filtered with a 0 45 μm particle size while vmt mag was separated by a magnet placed outside the eppendorf the filtered solution was evaluated by toc the removal of btex and metals from the petroleum produced water was performed based on the following procedure keeping the ratio mineral sample wastewater of 15 mg ml 1 constant with an exposure period of 30 min the extraction of btex was carried out by gc ms hs under previously optimized conditions the dissolved metals including ba al cu ag hg and pb present in the petroleum produced water sample were analyzed by icp ms before and after treatment using vmt tt and vmt mag for comparison purposes 2 5 aquatic acute toxicity assay of petroleum produced water before and after treatment daphnia similis species were obtained from the state run environmental company of são paulo companhia ambiental do estado de são paulo cetesb in ribeirão preto são paulo brazil the specimens were kept at 20 2 c with light intensity of 1000 lm under a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod and were fed daily with the green algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata acute toxicity tests with daphnia similis were performed in line with the abtn nbr 12713 regulations and protocol abnt 2009 to perform the tests neonates obtained by parthenogenesis from the second posture aged between 6 h and 24 h from females aged between 7 and 28 days were employed the experiments were performed in triplicate with 7 concentrations of each sample in the range of 0 78 12 5 v v in cultivated water chosen according to preliminary assays date not shown cultivated water was established as negative control and a control chart was used to validate the test twenty neonates spread in 4 containers with 5 specimens per container were exposed to each concentration for 48 h under temperatures between 18 c and 22 c in dark room without feeding after a 48 h exposure period immobilized daphnia specimens were counted manually statistical analysis was performed using one way anova with dunnett s post hoc test the results obtained with p 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 magnetic vermiculite characteristics the bet mesurements obtained for vmt tt and vmt mag presented a surface area of 6 6 m2 g 1 and medium pores of 9 nm both related to n2 desorption by the bjh method nonetheless the same vermiculite in magnetized form exhibited a surface area of 64 m2 g 1 and medium pores of 7 nm this shows that there was a change in relative porosity of the material after the magnetic modification due to the high porosity of magnetic nanoparticles the morphological alterations before and after the modification of vmt with fe3o4 nps can be seen in the sem feg images shown in fig 2 images a and b both modified vermiculites are constituted by flake like blocks and lamellar structure these features are found to contribute to the adsorptivity of the material 18 but the magnetized material is characterized by a large amount of nanoparticles adhered to the surface as seen in fig 2 images c 1 and d 1 this increases its porous character leading to the increase in its surface area detected by bet tem images were used to investigate the crystallinity and size of the nanoparticles adhered on the surface of vmt mag see fig 2 images c and d one can observe the presence of nanoparticles of sizes smaller than 20 nm deposited on the mineral and their crystallinity from the input image obtained by tem saed see fig 2 insert in image d 2 based on this image one is able to obtain the interplanar distances from the values of the diameters of the circles measured using the imagej program and conversion by equation as described in the literature 32 camera constant λl 1210 pxlå see table s1 the results obtained are in close agreement with the expected crystalline form compatible with the crystal spacings of fe3o4 icsd nº026410 nanoparticles deposited on vmt tt fig 3 a illustrates the xrd pattern obtained for the vmt and vmt tt vermiculite samples the interplanar peak appears at 14 4 å and shifts to 10 1 å due to dehydration 15 indicating the presence of new enstatite phase 34 35 according to mouzdahir et al 15 after heating up to 900 c deformation of the surface occurs due to spontaneous escape of the interlayer molecule water which may improve the adsorption potential of vermiculite both vmt tt and vmt mag exhibited similar patterns of behavior results not shown to help elucidate the magnetic property of vmt mag a comparison was made between the magnetograms see fig 3b of thermally treated vermiculite vmt tt curve b and vmt mag curve c the results show that the vermiculites have superparamagnetic properties due to lack of hysteresis translated from the coercivity value hc 0 005 oe as well as a sinusoidal pattern in both directions of the magnetic field disturbances thus one observes an increase in response to the magnetic field disturbances after modifying vermiculite with fe3o4 leading to the maximum magnetization of 15 1 emu g 1 for vmt mag 3 2 treatment of petroleum produced water with vmt mag 3 2 1 organic contaminants in order to identify possible btex contaminants in the petroleum produced water a sample of filtered wastewater was analyzed by cg ms hs using optimized conditions in headspace mode fig 4 curve a black line shows the respective chromatograms and the substances detected in the wastewater sample the main btex substances in the wastewater sample were detected at the retention times of 2 75 min benzene 4 15 min toluene 5 25 min ethylbenzene and 5 30 and 5 56 min xylenes with the derivatives of tetrahydrothiophenes known as thiolanes detected at 5 13 min 2 methylthiolane and isomers of 2 5 dimethylthiolane detected at 5 45 and 5 50 min the peaks were attributed to the proposed substances using the data from structural probability sp and the formation mechanism of molecular ions obtained from the mass spectrometry of each chromatographic peak these data were analyzed based on the nist library 2014 and literature reports 36 37 benzene presented the peak of the molecular ion m z 78 with low fragmentation and sp of 78 toluene was identified in 4 15 min with sp of 88 its fragmentation is characterized by the presence of molecular ion of m z 92 and base peak of m z 91 attributed to the radical loss of a hydrogen and denoted by highly stable tropylium ion c7h7 6 the tropilium ion was also observed as the base peak of the groups of fragment ions from other chromatographic peaks at retention times of 5 25 min 5 30 min and 5 56 min which were attributed to ethylbenzene and xylene isomers respectively in addition a peak was also detected at 5 13 min with m z 87 as base peak and m z 102 as molecular ion this was associated with the presence of 2 methyl thiolane this peak detected at 5 13 min was related to the fragmentation which corresponded to the loss of radical methyl leading to the formation of stable heterocycle c4h7s at m z 87 and c4h8s at m z 88 all the data related to the main compounds detected in the wastewater are shown in table 1 the analysis was conducted only in comparative terms and not in quantitative basis the effect of the treament with vmt mag was analyzed based on the ratio of vermiculite wastewater of 15 mg ml 1 as previously reported by mysore et al 18 the best results were obtained from the experiments conducted under 2000 ppm with 30 min of treatment these conditions were adopted in subsequent experiments the results obtained from gc ms hs analysis showed a reduction in the quantities of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes isomers btex in the wastewater treated with vmt mag the peak areas of these main compounds decreased by 60 10 85 and 85 respectively both the quantities of 2 methyltiolane and 2 5 dimethyltiolane isomers in the wastewater were also found to decrease by 83 and 75 respectively after the treatment see table 1 the findings show that magnetized vermiculite is a cheap suitable material that can be employed for the treatment of pollutants such as btex and thiolate derivatives present in petroleum produced water using a simple procedure with short period of exposure new experiments were conducted using the wastewater sample in order to analyse the effects of fe3o4 nps bound to the vermiculite on the sorption of organic substances based on the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc these experiments sought to monitor the removal of dissolved organic compounds in both the original and treated sample of petroleum produced water toc analyses conducted on raw petroleum produced water sample after filtration indicated the presence of 13 940 ppm of doc subsequently the contaminated water was treated using both minerals each time as described in the experimental section fig 5 compares the variation of doc in the supernatant relative to the time of exposure to the minerals the results show that in the case of vmt tt the removal rate of organic compounds reached 90 after 5 min but the rate of desorption was found to increase for periods longer than 30 min furthermore a dissolution rate of 45 was obtained after 90 min of treatment the illustrated comparison indicates that after 5 min of exposure the application of vmt mag led to 93 removal of toc while no significant desorption was observed after 2 h of treatment 120 min it is worth pointing out that since the limit of toc detection occurs at 1 ppm a dilution factor was used in all the calculations for adjustment purposes the results show that the use of vmt mag leads to a greater efficiency in the removal of dissolved organic contaminants from petroleum produced water this behavior reflects the presence of a greater surface area observed in the material after the incorporation of the nanoparticles which is likely to be associated with the increase in adsorptive properties of the mineral the manner in which the substances are adsorbed depends on their polarity as summarized in fig 6 in this sense magnetized vermiculite presents great removal potential for nonpolar molecules due to the positively charged interlayer interaction with π electrons of aromatic substances and the rehydration tendency that also contributes to this interaction 38 in addition btex intercalation in the vermiculite occurs based on the hydrophobicity and molecular weight of the substances 39 3 2 2 heavy metals it is well known in the literature that hydroxy interlayered minerals such as vermiculites can incorporate zn 40 or diminish the uptake of metal pollutants by plants in metal contaminated soils 41 thus an analysis was conducted regarding the adsorption of metal naturally occurring in the petroleum produced water using vmt tt and vmt mag and based on the procedure described in the experimental section via the icp ms technique as shown in fig 7 analytical curves were constructed see table s2 by analytical standards in the range of 0 5 10 ppb using the icp ms technique the background alignment was not considered when the linear correlation coefficient r was greater than 99 8 the limits of detection lod and the background equivalent concentrations bec for each metal m z were defined and calculated based on the following bec iblank istandard iblank x cblank and lod 3 x sd slope where sd is the standard deviation and i is the signal intensity of the blank or the standard the mean values of these limits along with the equations were used to analyse the validity of the concentrations cmetal lod and cmetal bec the concentration of each metal was determined based on these results see fig 7 the raw sample presented high concentrations of ba reaching 979 ppb and required dilution with a factor of 150 lower concentrations of 631 ppt 316 ppt 235 ppt 45 ppt and 32 ppt were obtained for the following metals al ag hg cu and pb respectively after water treatment with vmt mag removal rates of 30 50 63 67 and 87 were obatined for ba al ag hg and pb and without significant change in copper concentration the differences in the overall removal efficiency between the two materials for each metal were less than 20 and vmt mag was found to exhibit a better performance only in the case of ba and al the only exception was copper which saw an increase in its concentration from the exposure to vermiculite indicating a limitation of the mineral to remove this chemical element when present in low concentation the obstacle encountered by the mineral in the removal of copper can be attributed to the leaching of the copper present in the mineral in the form of copper oxide as impurity at low concentration 42 43 which under the experimental conditions employed is displaced from the material to the solution natural vermiculite is able to adsorb certain cations and anions depending on positive or negative charge balance locally or overall by doing so the ions are retained around the outer area of the structural unit generally without affecting the basic silicate structure see scheme in fig 6 the cations and metals can be attached to the structure by interactions between the metal ions and negative permanent charge of the mineral or they can be exchanged with others from the silicate sheets 44 the interactions are more likely to suffer influence of metal size which can be observed through a comparison of the removal of ba al ag and hg the radius of this group of metals decreases in the order previously stated as their removal rates from petroleum produced water increase in contrast pb does not follow that rule so it is suggested that this heavy metal is removed by an exchangeable ion mechanism as pointed out by malandrino et al 45 the addition of fe3o4 nps may affect the preferable interaction of metals but not the exchangeable mechanisms of heavy metals fe3o4 nps with typical amphoteric surface activity also offers an extra mechanism for adsorption of metals in this sense it thus provides an explanation regarding an increase of removal percentage for some metals after they are used as modifiers of vermiculite however heavier metals are more sensitive to be influenced by water ph when they interact with fe3o4 nps whose negative charge 46 subtly counteracts the capacity of magnetized vermiculite to remove metals at low concentration by competition with the sites on the vermiculite petroleum produced water sample ph 8 3 2 3 toxicity zooplankton microcrustaceans are among the groups regarded most sensitive to stressors 47 among the group of microcrustaceans cladocera species are widely used as test organisms in ecotoxicological assessments mainly due to their small size sensitivity to various toxic substances parthenogenetic reproduction wide distribution high density and rapid population growth 48 daphnia crustacea cladocera commonly referred to as water fleas are filter feeding organisms found in aquatic environments and occupy an important position in the food chain as they are one of the main sources of food for predatory fish and invertebrates in addition these fleas play a vital role in the population control of algae which can interfere with the quality of water bodies 49 according to buratini et al 49 organisms of this genus are suitable for performing ecotoxicological assays these authors reported the use of daphnia similis in the conduct of standard experimental procedures established by the united states environmental protection agency usepa the results of the present study show that petroleum produced water sample without treatment induces immobility in 16 out of 20 of the organisms average of three individual experiments at concentrations as low as 6 25 v v see fig 8 under the maximum concentration investigated 12 5 v v the same effect was observed in all the organisms exposed to the treated water fig 8 shows that after 3 h of treatment following the exposure of the raw wastewater to magnetite modified vermiculite a significant immobility was observed in relation to the negative control at the highest tested concentration of 12 5 v v in view of that the calculated lethal concentration for 50 of death lc50 before treatment was 5 78 0 52 v v while the lc50 was found to increase by 2 3 times 13 3 0 70 after the treatment of the wastewater with vmt mag this shows that the level of toxicity in daphnia similis was drastically reduced after treatment moreover a significant toxic effect was still observed in the final concentration of 12 5 indicating that the treatment significantly reduces toxicity in the petroleum produced water but does not eliminate toxic agents completely 4 conclusions the findings of the present study showed that the application of vermiculite even after magnetization with magnetite nanoparticles presented good efficiency in terms of the extraction of two different types of contaminants from petroleum produced water btex type organic compounds and some metals such as ba al ag hg and pb the application of the method also led to a decrease in toxicity of the produced water sample using the ratio of 15 mg ml 1 modified vermiculite vmt mag petroleum produced water nearly 93 of total dissolved organic carbon removal was reached in 5 min of treatment and the organic charge was found to remain constant up to 1 h in this case vmt mag is found to exhibit a better performance compared to vmt tt which absorbs 90 of the organic contaminants but releases 55 of them after 90 min of exposure this behavior is indicative that vmt mag improves absorption probably due to the fact that it promotes an increase in the surface area and specific interaction with the fe3o4 which stabilizes the retention of some of the dissolved organic contaminants in addition there was a reduction of up to 85 in the chromathographic peaks identified for btex confirming the efficiency of the material in the removal of these compounds both the magnetic material and the non magnetized material were found to be inefficient for the removal of cu however the magnetic material was capable of removing more than 60 of some metals at low concentration including ag hg and pb and at even higher concentrations of ba 30 and al 50 furthermore the use of the magnetic material also helped improve the capacity of adsorption of ba and al compared to the non magnetized mineral with regard to toxicity analysis the use of daphnia similis exposed to the treated petroleum produced water in the presence of the modified vermiculite resulted in a significant reduction in toxicity though it did not lead to a complete removal of toxicity despite the efficiency of the wastewater treatment method proposed here considerable attention ought to be paid when dealing with petroleum produced water released into the environment the reduction of toxicity was only obtained under the proposed method after a high dilution of the original wastewater in order to maintain a tolerable toxicity in relation to the aquatic biota in addition the superparamagnetic properties of the magnetized vmt mag were intensified by the addition of fe3o4 nps which was able to improve or maintain the sorption capacity of the vermiculite to sum up vermiculite has been shown to be a low cost product which could be magnetized and applied with an easy degree of recovery as an alternative adsorbent of aromatics and metals for the partial

13749,petroleum produced water has raised considerable environmental concerns due to the large amount of contaminants containing wastewater generated during petrol and gas extraction the present work proposes for the first time the use of vermiculite modified by magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles vmt mag as adsorbent for the extraction of metals and btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene pollutants and toxicity reduction thermally treated vermiculite was modified by fe3o4 nanoparticles of 20 nm which were strongly adhered to the surface contributing to the magnetization of the material and adsorption of the metals a 5 min exposure of wastewater to vmt mag at 15 mg ml 1 led to the removal of 93 of dissolved organic carbon 85 of btex compounds and a reduction of 30 87 of metals ba al ag hg and pb at low concentration an investigation was also conducted regarding the efficiency of vmt mag in reducing toxicity via toxicity assays using the water flea daphnia similis abtn nbr 12713 protocol the results showed a reduction of lethal concentration at 50 death lc50 from 5 80 v v to 13 3 v v respectively for the samples before and after treatment the findings show that the application of the proposed vmt mag can lead to a significant reduction of toxicity and the removal of btex and metals in petroleum produced water keywords petroleum produced water magnetite modified vermiculite emerging pollutants btex metals 1 introduction petroleum produced water is the name given to the water generated during the flooding process of crude oil extraction which involves water injection into the stratum to drive the crude oil out of the ground 1 the water produced in the oil extraction or drilling process may also merge with the wastewater formed during the process involving the separation of hydrocarbons leading to the formation of water oil composition in the ratio of 3 1 in 2017 petrobrás the brazilian petroleum multinational corporation reported to have disposed of 293 2 million m3 of wastewater containing 1 9 thousand tons of oil and grease and 5 4 thousand tons in terms of chemical oxygen demand 1 based on the data reported in 2018 once implemented the water recycling policy initiative proposed by the corporation would result in a reduction in the volume of produced water of approximately 289 million m3 the safe management of the wastewater disposal process requires significant improvements in the water treatment as a way of addressing this grave environmental issue in order to accomplish the globally sustainable development goals on green water recycling proposed by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco the composition of petroleum produced water is found to be complex and it generally consists of a mixture of organic and inorganic materials oils and grease 2 the quantities of these compounds present in the water depend on a variety of factors including the geological location of the basin and operational conditions in general the major compounds found in petroleum produced water consist of a mixture of dissolved and dispersed compounds in water these include hydrocarbons like benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex naphthalene phenanthrene dibenzothiophene polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs and phenols 2 3 in addition produced water also contains dissolved oils such as pahs and c6 c9 alkylated phenols heavy metals such as cadmium chromium copper lead mercury nickel silver zinc naturally occurring radioactive materials a wide range of polar and charged compounds at low concentration dissolved gases 2 3 and extra chemicals added for the treatment or prevention of operational problems such as corrosion inhibitors biocides emulsion breakers antifoam and other substances employed in the water treatment process 4 5 the high volume of wastewater and the negative impact of produced water discharged in the environment have become an issue of great concern due to the danger and risks they pose to human health as well as to other living organisms and the biosphere as a whole 3 many conventional methods based on physical chemical and biological techniques have been proposed in the literature as part of environmental policies with a view to treating produced water by way of recycling and reutilization of the water after adequate degradation or removal of the pollutants present therein 2 among these methods the combined application of some physical treatment techniques based on adsorption coagulation and flotation gravity separation 6 and separation by membranes 7 has demonstrated good efficiency in terms of pollutants removal in this wastewater to date there is still no single and simple technique capable of removing the contaminants present in produced water or minimizing the risks they pose to human health and to the environment 8 with the aim of contributing to the extraction of organic inorganic and metallic compounds in produced water multi stage systems have been employed through the application of techniques targeted at removing oils greases and dissolved gas from the water as part of the materials employed in the treatment of produced water adsorbents have gained prominence owing to their low costs and potential for the removal of a variety of substances including activated carbon bentonite peat sand coal fiberglass polypropylene amberlite and organo clay from wastewater 9 studies reported in the literature 10 11 have shown that some minerals such as activated carbon organo clay zeolite resins and other adsorbents and polymers have been employed specifically for the removal of organic compounds or metals in produced wastewater despite the low costs and the ease of application of these materials the results obtained have demonstrated their restrictive efficiency interestingly the use of vermiculite has gained considerable attention among researchers because of its lightweight ph neutrality inertness and high absorbance and these properties contribute enormously toward the efficient treatment of wastewater 9 12 13 vermiculite is a planar hydrous phyllosilicate mineral that contains tetrahedral and octahedral sheets as a layer made of metal oxides mainly of aluminum ii or magnesium ii and silicon and some interlayer hydrated cations located in the space between layers 14 17 the structure of the brazilian vermiculite was previously determined by da fonseca et al 12 who demonstrated that the mineral was composed of the following si3 43al0 57 al0 26fe0 32mg2 34 o10 oh 2ca0 064na0 016k0 047 as can be noted the chemical composition of the brazilian vermiculite shows a relatively larger charge of octahedral sheet and interlayer region compared to other compositions presented by valášková and martynková et al 17 vermiculite in the form of shiny flakes are widely used in several industrial and chemical applications e g gardens horticulture animal feedstuff loose fill insulation lightweight concretes etc 9 that require the use of a low cost product because of the high demand for these services and for the treatment of large amount of contaminated water studies have demonstrated the ability of thermally treated vermiculite to remove oils and waxes from contaminated water 13 18 several reports in the literature have also pointed out the potential of vermiculite when it comes to the removal of metals in aqueous solution such as hg 19 ni 20 cs 21 zn 20 22 cu 20 23 cr 20 22 23 pb 20 22 24 and cd 20 and specific substances like phthalate 25 dibenzothiophene 26 and benzodiazepine 27 although there is considerable evidence regarding the ability of vermiculite to adsorb metal ions and organic compounds its application as adsorbent in petroleum contaminated water remains limited 11 modified minerals have been studied aiming at effecting changes in their physical and chemical properties with the incorporation of new characteristics and promoting better applicability of these materials 28 29 some studies reported in the literature have investigated the use of magnetite modified vermiculite with the objective of improving the applicability of the adsorbent in the treatment of wastewater 30 31 the addition of magnetite fe3o4 as superparamagnetic nanoparticles to the vermiculite contributes to their application in a large sample volume apart from promoting changes in the zeta potential of the material and magnifying its potential of adsorption of nonpolar molecules one also needs to take into account the ease of removal of the mineral after treatment through the use of magnet externally 30 32 thus the aim of the present work is to assess the efficiency of thermally treated vermiculite modified by magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 nps in the removal of dissolved organic compounds mainly btex and some heavy metals present in petroleum produced water as aforementioned one of the remarkable advantages of vermiculite lies in the fact that it is a low cost material with suitable properties that can contribute meaningfully toward the treatment of this complex wastewater the characterization of the minerals was carried out using scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray diffraction xrd analyses were conducted regarding the surface areas and the magnetization of the modified mineral the removal of dissolved organic compounds was evaluated by the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and mainly by the variations of the chromatographic peak areas in this sense a qualitative analysis was conducted regarding the capacity of the mineral to adsorb organic compounds mass spectrometry analyses were performed in order to identify aromatic compounds and some metals which were separated from each other using gas chromatograph and an inductively coupled plasma system the modified vermiculites were compared in terms of their capacity to extract organic and inorganic substances from petroleum produced water in order to explicitly determine the influence of fe3o4 nps bound to the vermiculite 2 experimental 2 1 materials the expanded vermiculite vmt sample commercialized for horticultural applications was acquired from agrometana co a farm products company located in araraquara são paulo brazil the sample was smashed into small particles passed through a 0 50 mm sieve calcined at a temperature of 900 c for 3 min with scan rate of 10 c min 1 and kept in a glass container at room temperature the sample was named thermally treated vermiculite vmt tt the petroleum produced water was collected in april 2017 from petrobrás offshore platform in natal rio grande do norte brazil stored in polypropylene bottles and kept in a refrigerator 2 2 vermiculite modification with magnetite nanoparticles the incorporation of fe3o4 nps into the vmt tt suspension was carried out by mixing the mineral suspension in a solution containing 100 ml of iron ii and iron iii chloride hydrate under nitrogen gas in a ratio of 1 1 w w 33 the solutions of ferrous and ferric chloride in the form of tetrahydrate and hexahydrate respectively were prepared based on the molar ratio 1 2 total mass of 3 2 g in 30 ml of ultrapure water after inert bubbling the solid suspension of 2 5 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide was added slowly to the solution forming a brownish black suspended powder magnetic vermiculite vmt mag was obtained by the separation of the excess of fe3o4 nps the successive washing of the powder with ultrapure water and decanting it with magnet helped distinguish vmt mag from fe3o4 nps the desired material was dried at 60 c and stored in a glass container at room temperature fig 1 illustrates the steps involved in each modification 2 3 equipment

inorganic carbon ic concentration the results correspond to the average of three replicates of the total organic carbon toc which is equal to tc minus ic the calibration curves were constructed using triplicate measurements of each final medium concentration with acceptance criteria 99 5 and the determination of the toc concentration in real samples was performed using the same analytical criteria

elmer inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms model nezion 2000b the samples were injected by aerosol in argon the mass spectrum was obtained and the m z ratios were determined by the fixed isotope ratio mechanism analytical working solutions for each metal were prepared by the dilution of 1000 mg l 1 stock standard solutions specsol quimlab brazil and acidified in 0 5 v v nitric acid solution this acid solution was applied as the blank solution the calibration curves were constructed using triplicate measurements with a relative standard deviation below 10 the real sample was also evaluated in triplicate using the analytical curves to determine the concentration of each metal the results are displayed with error bars representing the standard deviation 2 4 evaluation of vmt mag as adsorbent of organic compounds and dissolved metals the extraction of organic compounds from the thermally treated vmt tt or modified vmt mag vermiculites was carried out by putting 30 mg of each vermiculite in 2 ml of petroleum produced water sample without previous treatment the suspension was stirred and the supernatant of vmt tt was filtered with a 0 45 μm particle size while vmt mag was separated by a magnet placed outside the eppendorf the filtered solution was evaluated by toc the removal of btex and metals from the petroleum produced water was performed based on the following procedure keeping the ratio mineral sample wastewater of 15 mg ml 1 constant with an exposure period of 30 min the extraction of btex was carried out by gc ms hs under previously optimized conditions the dissolved metals including ba al cu ag hg and pb present in the petroleum produced water sample were analyzed by icp ms before and after treatment using vmt tt and vmt mag for comparison purposes 2 5 aquatic acute toxicity assay of petroleum produced water before and after treatment daphnia similis species were obtained from the state run environmental company of são paulo companhia ambiental do estado de são paulo cetesb in ribeirão preto são paulo brazil the specimens were kept at 20 2 c with light intensity of 1000 lm under a 16 8 h light dark photoperiod and were fed daily with the green algae pseudokirchneriella subcapitata acute toxicity tests with daphnia similis were performed in line with the abtn nbr 12713 regulations and protocol abnt 2009 to perform the tests neonates obtained by parthenogenesis from the second posture aged between 6 h and 24 h from females aged between 7 and 28 days were employed the experiments were performed in triplicate with 7 concentrations of each sample in the range of 0 78 12 5 v v in cultivated water chosen according to preliminary assays date not shown cultivated water was established as negative control and a control chart was used to validate the test twenty neonates spread in 4 containers with 5 specimens per container were exposed to each concentration for 48 h under temperatures between 18 c and 22 c in dark room without feeding after a 48 h exposure period immobilized daphnia specimens were counted manually statistical analysis was performed using one way anova with dunnett s post hoc test the results obtained with p 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 magnetic vermiculite characteristics the bet mesurements obtained for vmt tt and vmt mag presented a surface area of 6 6 m2 g 1 and medium pores of 9 nm both related to n2 desorption by the bjh method nonetheless the same vermiculite in magnetized form exhibited a surface area of 64 m2 g 1 and medium pores of 7 nm this shows that there was a change in relative porosity of the material after the magnetic modification due to the high porosity of magnetic nanoparticles the morphological alterations before and after the modification of vmt with fe3o4 nps can be seen in the sem feg images shown in fig 2 images a and b both modified vermiculites are constituted by flake like blocks and lamellar structure these features are found to contribute to the adsorptivity of the material 18 but the magnetized material is characterized by a large amount of nanoparticles adhered to the surface as seen in fig 2 images c 1 and d 1 this increases its porous character leading to the increase in its surface area detected by bet tem images were used to investigate the crystallinity and size of the nanoparticles adhered on the surface of vmt mag see fig 2 images c and d one can observe the presence of nanoparticles of sizes smaller than 20 nm deposited on the mineral and their crystallinity from the input image obtained by tem saed see fig 2 insert in image d 2 based on this image one is able to obtain the interplanar distances from the values of the diameters of the circles measured using the imagej program and conversion by equation as described in the literature 32 camera constant λl 1210 pxlå see table s1 the results obtained are in close agreement with the expected crystalline form compatible with the crystal spacings of fe3o4 icsd nº026410 nanoparticles deposited on vmt tt fig 3 a illustrates the xrd pattern obtained for the vmt and vmt tt vermiculite samples the interplanar peak appears at 14 4 å and shifts to 10 1 å due to dehydration 15 indicating the presence of new enstatite phase 34 35 according to mouzdahir et al 15 after heating up to 900 c deformation of the surface occurs due to spontaneous escape of the interlayer molecule water which may improve the adsorption potential of vermiculite both vmt tt and vmt mag exhibited similar patterns of behavior results not shown to help elucidate the magnetic property of vmt mag a comparison was made between the magnetograms see fig 3b of thermally treated vermiculite vmt tt curve b and vmt mag curve c the results show that the vermiculites have superparamagnetic properties due to lack of hysteresis translated from the coercivity value hc 0 005 oe as well as a sinusoidal pattern in both directions of the magnetic field disturbances thus one observes an increase in response to the magnetic field disturbances after modifying vermiculite with fe3o4 leading to the maximum magnetization of 15 1 emu g 1 for vmt mag 3 2 treatment of petroleum produced water with vmt mag 3 2 1 organic contaminants in order to identify possible btex contaminants in the petroleum produced water a sample of filtered wastewater was analyzed by cg ms hs using optimized conditions in headspace mode fig 4 curve a black line shows the respective chromatograms and the substances detected in the wastewater sample the main btex substances in the wastewater sample were detected at the retention times of 2 75 min benzene 4 15 min toluene 5 25 min ethylbenzene and 5 30 and 5 56 min xylenes with the derivatives of tetrahydrothiophenes known as thiolanes detected at 5 13 min 2 methylthiolane and isomers of 2 5 dimethylthiolane detected at 5 45 and 5 50 min the peaks were attributed to the proposed substances using the data from structural probability sp and the formation mechanism of molecular ions obtained from the mass spectrometry of each chromatographic peak these data were analyzed based on the nist library 2014 and literature reports 36 37 benzene presented the peak of the molecular ion m z 78 with low fragmentation and sp of 78 toluene was identified in 4 15 min with sp of 88 its fragmentation is characterized by the presence of molecular ion of m z 92 and base peak of m z 91 attributed to the radical loss of a hydrogen and denoted by highly stable tropylium ion c7h7 6 the tropilium ion was also observed as the base peak of the groups of fragment ions from other chromatographic peaks at retention times of 5 25 min 5 30 min and 5 56 min which were attributed to ethylbenzene and xylene isomers respectively in addition a peak was also detected at 5 13 min with m z 87 as base peak and m z 102 as molecular ion this was associated with the presence of 2 methyl thiolane this peak detected at 5 13 min was related to the fragmentation which corresponded to the loss of radical methyl leading to the formation of stable heterocycle c4h7s at m z 87 and c4h8s at m z 88 all the data related to the main compounds detected in the wastewater are shown in table 1 the analysis was conducted only in comparative terms and not in quantitative basis the effect of the treament with vmt mag was analyzed based on the ratio of vermiculite wastewater of 15 mg ml 1 as previously reported by mysore et al 18 the best results were obtained from the experiments conducted under 2000 ppm with 30 min of treatment these conditions were adopted in subsequent experiments the results obtained from gc ms hs analysis showed a reduction in the quantities of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes isomers btex in the wastewater treated with vmt mag the peak areas of these main compounds decreased by 60 10 85 and 85 respectively both the quantities of 2 methyltiolane and 2 5 dimethyltiolane isomers in the wastewater were also found to decrease by 83 and 75 respectively after the treatment see table 1 the findings show that magnetized vermiculite is a cheap suitable material that can be employed for the treatment of pollutants such as btex and thiolate derivatives present in petroleum produced water using a simple procedure with short period of exposure new experiments were conducted using the wastewater sample in order to analyse the effects of fe3o4 nps bound to the vermiculite on the sorption of organic substances based on the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc these experiments sought to monitor the removal of dissolved organic compounds in both the original and treated sample of petroleum produced water toc analyses conducted on raw petroleum produced water sample after filtration indicated the presence of 13 940 ppm of doc subsequently the contaminated water was treated using both minerals each time as described in the experimental section fig 5 compares the variation of doc in the supernatant relative to the time of exposure to the minerals the results show that in the case of vmt tt the removal rate of organic compounds reached 90 after 5 min but the rate of desorption was found to increase for periods longer than 30 min furthermore a dissolution rate of 45 was obtained after 90 min of treatment the illustrated comparison indicates that after 5 min of exposure the application of vmt mag led to 93 removal of toc while no significant desorption was observed after 2 h of treatment 120 min it is worth pointing out that since the limit of toc detection occurs at 1 ppm a dilution factor was used in all the calculations for adjustment purposes the results show that the use of vmt mag leads to a greater efficiency in the removal of dissolved organic contaminants from petroleum produced water this behavior reflects the presence of a greater surface area observed in the material after the incorporation of the nanoparticles which is likely to be associated with the increase in adsorptive properties of the mineral the manner in which the substances are adsorbed depends on their polarity as summarized in fig 6 in this sense magnetized vermiculite presents great removal potential for nonpolar molecules due to the positively charged interlayer interaction with π electrons of aromatic substances and the rehydration tendency that also contributes to this interaction 38 in addition btex intercalation in the vermiculite occurs based on the hydrophobicity and molecular weight of the substances 39 3 2 2 heavy metals it is well known in the literature that hydroxy interlayered minerals such as vermiculites can incorporate zn 40 or diminish the uptake of metal pollutants by plants in metal contaminated soils 41 thus an analysis was conducted regarding the adsorption of metal naturally occurring in the petroleum produced water using vmt tt and vmt mag and based on the procedure described in the experimental section via the icp ms technique as shown in fig 7 analytical curves were constructed see table s2 by analytical standards in the range of 0 5 10 ppb using the icp ms technique the background alignment was not considered when the linear correlation coefficient r was greater than 99 8 the limits of detection lod and the background equivalent concentrations bec for each metal m z were defined and calculated based on the following bec iblank istandard iblank x cblank and lod 3 x sd slope where sd is the standard deviation and i is the signal intensity of the blank or the standard the mean values of these limits along with the equations were used to analyse the validity of the concentrations cmetal lod and cmetal bec the concentration of each metal was determined based on these results see fig 7 the raw sample presented high concentrations of ba reaching 979 ppb and required dilution with a factor of 150 lower concentrations of 631 ppt 316 ppt 235 ppt 45 ppt and 32 ppt were obtained for the following metals al ag hg cu and pb respectively after water treatment with vmt mag removal rates of 30 50 63 67 and 87 were obatined for ba al ag hg and pb and without significant change in copper concentration the differences in the overall removal efficiency between the two materials for each metal were less than 20 and vmt mag was found to exhibit a better performance only in the case of ba and al the only exception was copper which saw an increase in its concentration from the exposure to vermiculite indicating a limitation of the mineral to remove this chemical element when present in low concentation the obstacle encountered by the mineral in the removal of copper can be attributed to the leaching of the copper present in the mineral in the form of copper oxide as impurity at low concentration 42 43 which under the experimental conditions employed is displaced from the material to the solution natural vermiculite is able to adsorb certain cations and anions depending on positive or negative charge balance locally or overall by doing so the ions are retained around the outer area of the structural unit generally without affecting the basic silicate structure see scheme in fig 6 the cations and metals can be attached to the structure by interactions between the metal ions and negative permanent charge of the mineral or they can be exchanged with others from the silicate sheets 44 the interactions are more likely to suffer influence of metal size which can be observed through a comparison of the removal of ba al ag and hg the radius of this group of metals decreases in the order previously stated as their removal rates from petroleum produced water increase in contrast pb does not follow that rule so it is suggested that this heavy metal is removed by an exchangeable ion mechanism as pointed out by malandrino et al 45 the addition of fe3o4 nps may affect the preferable interaction of metals but not the exchangeable mechanisms of heavy metals fe3o4 nps with typical amphoteric surface activity also offers an extra mechanism for adsorption of metals in this sense it thus provides an explanation regarding an increase of removal percentage for some metals after they are used as modifiers of vermiculite however heavier metals are more sensitive to be influenced by water ph when they interact with fe3o4 nps whose negative charge 46 subtly counteracts the capacity of magnetized vermiculite to remove metals at low concentration by competition with the sites on the vermiculite petroleum produced water sample ph 8 3 2 3 toxicity zooplankton microcrustaceans are among the groups regarded most sensitive to stressors 47 among the group of microcrustaceans cladocera species are widely used as test organisms in ecotoxicological assessments mainly due to their small size sensitivity to various toxic substances parthenogenetic reproduction wide distribution high density and rapid population growth 48 daphnia crustacea cladocera commonly referred to as water fleas are filter feeding organisms found in aquatic environments and occupy an important position in the food chain as they are one of the main sources of food for predatory fish and invertebrates in addition these fleas play a vital role in the population control of algae which can interfere with the quality of water bodies 49 according to buratini et al 49 organisms of this genus are suitable for performing ecotoxicological assays these authors reported the use of daphnia similis in the conduct of standard experimental procedures established by the united states environmental protection agency usepa the results of the present study show that petroleum produced water sample without treatment induces immobility in 16 out of 20 of the organisms average of three individual experiments at concentrations as low as 6 25 v v see fig 8 under the maximum concentration investigated 12 5 v v the same effect was observed in all the organisms exposed to the treated water fig 8 shows that after 3 h of treatment following the exposure of the raw wastewater to magnetite modified vermiculite a significant immobility was observed in relation to the negative control at the highest tested concentration of 12 5 v v in view of that the calculated lethal concentration for 50 of death lc50 before treatment was 5 78 0 52 v v while the lc50 was found to increase by 2 3 times 13 3 0 70 after the treatment of the wastewater with vmt mag this shows that the level of toxicity in daphnia similis was drastically reduced after treatment moreover a significant toxic effect was still observed in the final concentration of 12 5 indicating that the treatment significantly reduces toxicity in the petroleum produced water but does not eliminate toxic agents completely 4 conclusions the findings of the present study showed that the application of vermiculite even after magnetization with magnetite nanoparticles presented good efficiency in terms of the extraction of two different types of contaminants from petroleum produced water btex type organic compounds and some metals such as ba al ag hg and pb the application of the method also led to a decrease in toxicity of the produced water sample using the ratio of 15 mg ml 1 modified vermiculite vmt mag petroleum produced water nearly 93 of total dissolved organic carbon removal was reached in 5 min of treatment and the organic charge was found to remain constant up to 1 h in this case vmt mag is found to exhibit a better performance compared to vmt tt which absorbs 90 of the organic contaminants but releases 55 of them after 90 min of exposure this behavior is indicative that vmt mag improves absorption probably due to the fact that it promotes an increase in the surface area and specific interaction with the fe3o4 which stabilizes the retention of some of the dissolved organic contaminants in addition there was a reduction of up to 85 in the chromathographic peaks identified for btex confirming the efficiency of the material in the removal of these compounds both the magnetic material and the non magnetized material were found to be inefficient for the removal of cu however the magnetic material was capable of removing more than 60 of some metals at low concentration including ag hg and pb and at even higher concentrations of ba 30 and al 50 furthermore the use of the magnetic material also helped improve the capacity of adsorption of ba and al compared to the non magnetized mineral with regard to toxicity analysis the use of daphnia similis exposed to the treated petroleum produced water in the presence of the modified vermiculite resulted in a significant reduction in toxicity though it did not lead to a complete removal of toxicity despite the efficiency of the wastewater treatment method proposed here considerable attention ought to be paid when dealing with petroleum produced water released into the environment the reduction of toxicity was only obtained under the proposed method after a high dilution of the original wastewater in order to maintain a tolerable toxicity in relation to the aquatic biota in addition the superparamagnetic properties of the magnetized vmt mag were intensified by the addition of fe3o4 nps which was able to improve or maintain the sorption capacity of the vermiculite to sum up vermiculite has been shown to be a low cost product which could be magnetized and applied with an easy degree of recovery as an alternative adsorbent of aromatics and metals for the partial
