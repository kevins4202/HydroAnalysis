13320,microplastics mps have been recently detected in the surabaya river indonesia which is used as raw water for water supply this condition has aroused concern about mp presence in the treated water in surabaya drinking water treatment plants dwtps this study aimed to investigate the mp abundance and characteristics of the raw and treated water and the removal efficiencies in each treatment unit in two selected sub dwtps sdwtps in surabaya water supply enterprise these sdwtps apply conventional technology comprising aeration pre sedimentation coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and disinfection stages the mp abundance values in the raw and treated water in sdwtps i and ii were 26 8 35 and 8 5 12 3 particles l respectively the mp was dominated by 93 95 fiber in the raw water and 84 100 in the treated water the mp dominant size in the raw and treated water was 351 1000 μm with the percentages of 45 50 and 36 69 respectively the dominant polymer types of mps in the raw water were polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and low density polyethylene ldpe the total mp removal efficiencies in sdwtps i and ii were 54 and 76 respectively keywords conventional drinking water treatment microplastic raw water removal efficiency treated water 1 introduction microplastics mps as environmental contaminants have been investigated since 1970 1 recently the occurrence of mps in freshwater environments including river surface water reservoir and groundwater has been profoundly studied 2 3 4 the mps in the freshwater varied in abundance size distribution shape and composition because the categories in those studies were different 5 in regard to the mp shape fibers were the most abundant in freshwater environments 6 meanwhile the mp size of 1001 5000 μm was extensively identified in freshwater 7 8 9 mp pollution in freshwater might lead to raw and treated water contamination because rivers are commonly used as a raw water source for drinking water treatment 5 pivokonsky et al 10 studied the mp abundances in three drinking water treatment plants dwtps in the czech republic where surface water was used as the raw water source the results showed that the mp abundances were 1473 3605 particles l in the raw water and 338 628 particles l in the treated water meanwhile wang et al 11 investigated the abundance of mps in an advanced dwtp in china the abundances of mps in the raw and treated waters were 6614 and 930 particles l respectively besides shen et al 12 conducted research on the mp occurrence in drinking water from freshwater in cangsha china the mp abundance in freshwater and drinking water was 2173 3998 and 338 400 particles l respectively mintenig et al 4 performed another investigation on mp presence in raw and treated water in 5 dwtps in germany the study found less mp abundance either in the raw or treated water which was 0 7 particles l this condition occurred because the dwtps employed groundwater as the raw water source 13 the dwtps in indonesia commonly apply conventional technology supported by aeration pre sedimentation coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and disinfection tanks 14 it was proven that the mp removal could occur through the conventional technology of dwtp 13 15 effective removal of mp contaminant in dwtp requires an appropriate configuration of technology 10 however a particular technology may provide different capabilities in removing the mps 16 therefore it is essential to explore the technology s ability either a conventional or an advanced one in dwtp application for mp removal this information is beneficial for determining the right technology for producing free mps in treated water in the dwtps evidence revealed that 12 mp fragments were detected in four human placentas 17 the mp sizes were 5 10 μm it was presumed that mps could enter the placentas through the gastrointestinal tract 17 even though the potentially toxic effects of the mps on human health have not been clearly investigated the mp pollution in treated water becomes concern since it is used for human consumption 2 the ingested mps into the human body were possibly inert hazardous material for cells and tissues because it led to inflammation and cytotoxicity oxidative stress the injury and viability of cells and tissues 18 these potential adverse effects could be influenced by the mp characteristics size shape and polymer type mp exposure time and the response of cells and tissues to the mps 19 however thorough research on the human impacts of mps should be performed to observe the adverse effects intensively the surabaya river is used as a raw water source for drinking water treatment in surabaya city which serves 92 5 of the population from a total of three million 20 there are two main dwtps in surabaya city namely ngagel and karangpilang each of the ngagel and karangpilang dwtps has three sub dwtps sdwtps the total water treatment capacities of ngagel and karangpilang dwtps were 4550 and 5950 l s respectively 14 among these sdwtps only 1 sdwtp in ngagel dwtp uses advanced treatment technology 21 unfortunately no study has been conducted concerning the mp abundance and removal in the dwtp and water supply systems in this country very few mp studies had been carried out in the surabaya river 22 23 24 lestari and trihadiningrum 22 studied that the surabaya river had been impacted by mps due to improper solid waste management firdaus et al 23 investigated the mp pollution in the sediment of jagir estuary surabaya meanwhile lestari et al 24 studied the mp distribution in the surabaya river water the mps in the sediment of jagir estuary ranged from 92 to 590 particles kg dry weight dw sediment with 1001 5000 μm mp size range 68 the fiber 57 and the polyester pes 56 7 as the dominant mps 23 the mp presence in the jagir estuary were most probably due to the plastic waste generation in the settlements around the study site 23 lestari et al 24 revealed that the mp abundance in the surabaya river varied from 1 47 43 11 particles m3 the mps were dominated by the mp size of 1001 5000 μm 43 1 93 2 with film shape 45 8 92 9 and low density polyethylene ldpe polymer type 44 68 the mp presence in the surabaya river raised concern since this might lead to water supply contamination based on the abovementioned consideration the study of mp occurrence in the treated water and effluent of each treatment unit in dwtp was important for a better understanding the mp contamination and removal in dwtps however there were insufficient data of mp abundance and characteristics in indonesian dwtps this study was focused on the presence of mp in the raw water effluent water of each treatment unit and treated water in the two sdwtps in surabaya city the data could provide a new insight to improve the dwtp performance in reducing mp contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and water sample collection the sampling sites were two conventional sdwtps namely sdwtps i and ii in the water supply enterprise of surabaya city which used the surabaya river as raw water source fig 1 the water treatment capacities of sdwtps i and ii were 1450 and 2000 l s respectively water treatment technologies that were applied in both sdwtps were aeration pre sedimentation coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration disinfection as shown in fig 2 water samples were collected at raw water intake all outlets of each treatment unit including at the reservoir outlet of the treated water fig 2 samples were collected in the mid of april 2020 sample collection of 2 5 l volume was conducted using rinsed glass bottle with the grab sampling technique all samples were collected in duplicate in two different days the samples were then stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 2 sample oxidation and filtration the ambient air was potential contamination in the laboratory work therefore cotton clothes were worn during work 25 the samples were first oxidized using wet peroxide oxidation wpo to remove organic identifying and characterization of the mps 26 twenty ml of 30 merck hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and 20 ml of fe ii 0 05 m were added to the samples the mixed solutions were then heated to 75 c for about an hour until h2o2 entirely vaporized 27 the oxidized samples were subsequently extracted using a glass vacuum filtration device equipped with a ptfe membrane filter hawach scientific with a pore size of 0 2 μm and a diameter of 47 mm the ptfe membranes were put in the glass petri dishes and air dried while covered loosely with aluminum foil for approximately 24 h this step aimed to reduce the potential airborne contamination then these ptfe membranes were used to identify the number size shape and color of mps 2 3 mp identification and characterization the mps were sorted manually from the filter membranes using a tweezer under a dissecting microscope sunshine szm45t b1 and dino capture 2 0 with 40 60 x magnifications these sorted mps were then analyzed to characterize the polymer types using an ftir nicolet i10 spectrophotometer the modified method of hosseini et al 28 was applied in the characterization of mps with ftir eight to ten sorted mp particles were randomly chosen from each sample for ftir analysis the total number of selected mp particles from the dwtp i and ii samples were 112 140 pieces respectively the particles that experienced ftir characterization were only about large mps with the size of 351 5000 μm the hummel polymer sample library was used for the polymer reference to match the resulted spectra from the chosen mp pieces mp abundance was determined according to the number of mps in the samples which was counted manually the size of the mps was classified into 1 100 μm 101 350 μm 351 1000 μm and 1001 5000 μm 29 the shape was categorized into the fiber fragment film and pellet 30 31 32 fibers were measured according to the fiber length whereas pellets and foams were determid regarding the particle diameter while those of films and fragments were based on the distance of two remote points of a particle 33 the mp colors were classified into black blue red yellow and transparent according to peng et al 34 2 4 quality control and assurance quality control and assurance aimed to limit the potential contamination in the laboratory 28 all glassware and equipment were rinsed with distilled water before these were used the dried glassware and equipment were then covered with aluminum foil cotton clothes and gloves were worn to avoid the suspected fiber contamination from the ambient air all the surfaces of the benches in the laboratory and the microscope were wiped before analyzing in the laboratory 2 5 data analyses data were analyzed using software of ibm spss statistics 21 and microsoft excel 2010 the significance of mp removal efficiency status in each treatment stage was analyzed with kruskal wallis non parametric test removal efficiency of the mps was calculated according to the following equation 1 removal efficiency initial mp abundance mp abundance after treatment initial mp abundance 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastic content in the raw and treated water this study revealed that the mps were found in all samples from sdwtps i and ii the content of mps in raw and treated water varied in terms of size shape and color table 1 shows the average abundances of the mps in the raw and treated water samples of sdwtps i and ii the abundance values in table 1 were classified into mp size shape and color data in table 1 present that the total mp abundance values in sdwtps i and ii were 26 8 35 particles l in the raw water and 8 5 12 3 in the treated water the mp value in the raw water was lower than those in other related studies in the czech republic and china 10 11 12 the different range of mp abundance in the raw water in this study was most probably due to the different anthropogenic activities and environmental condition around the raw water source 13 regarding the treated water the different technologies in dwtps may be influenced the mp removal efficiency 12 as shown in table 1 the main mp particles were within the large size category particles with 351 1000 μm size category were dominant both in in the raw and treated water with percentage values of 45 50 and 36 69 respectively the predominant size of mps in the raw water was different from those found in the study conducted in the surabaya river in which large mp particles of 1001 5000 μm size were the most dominant 24 this difference was most possibly because of the difference in sampling time the mp sizes in the raw water were consecutively 1001 5000 μm 31 37 101 350 μm 14 17 and 1 100 μm 2 4 meanwhile the mp sizes in treated water were 101 350 μm 10 32 followed by 1001 5000 μm 18 24 and 1 100 μm 2 8 the highest mp removal efficiency 72 84 was of particle size 1001 5000 μm this phenomenon possibly occurred since the large size mp particles were easier to adhere than that of the small mp particles on the formation of flocs 35 similar cases were also experienced in previous research works in three dwtps in the czech republic 10 and in an advanced dwtp in china 11 however the fate of mps according to particle size in each treatment unit of dwtp should be profoundly explored through laboratory simulation to precisely determine the real mp removal efficiency 5 the mp shapes in the raw water were fibers fragments films and pellets fig 3 fibers were the most dominant particle shape in both of raw and treated water accounting for respectively 93 95 and 84 100 similarly the previous studies reported that the main mp shape was fiber in the sediment in the jagir estuary surabaya 57 23 domestic washing activities by communities along the river potentially discharge wastewater containing synthetic fiber into the raw water source 23 additionally fragments were much less abundant than fiber 5 7 followed by films 1 1 and pellets 0 3 the fragment film and pellet shapes were also less abundant than fiber in the treated water accounting for 15 15 and 1 respectively the film shaped mp particles were found in the treated water even though it was not found in the raw water in sdwtp ii the sampling at the outlet of each treatment unit was conducted without adjusting the retention time used as the design criteria in the sdwtp therefore it was possible to find the different mp shape either in the effluent of each unit or treated water this different shape of mp contaminants probably originated from the raw water entering the dwtps before the sampling time at the inlet the mp removal efficiencies in the treated water based on the shape were 50 79 3 for fibers and 28 for fragments meanwhile the pellet shaped were not removed overall the abundance of the mps in the treated water was much lower than that in the raw water this points out that mp removal has occurred during the water treatment process within the sdwtps the total mp removal efficiencies within sdwtps i and ii were 54 and 76 respectively pivokonsky et al 10 reported that the mp removal efficiencies in the previous study in three dwtps in the czech republic were 70 81 and 82 respectively the first mp removal efficiency was resulted in the dwtp i with the treatment units of coagulation flocculation and sand filtration meanwhile the processes of coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand and granular activated carbon gac filtration in the dwtp ii enhanced the mp removal efficiency up to 81 the dwtp iii using the similar processes with the dwtp ii that of flotation replacing the sedimentation experienced slightly different mp removal efficiency than dwtp ii 82 other mp study in dwtp in changsha china which operated aeration coagulation sedimentation sand and gac filtration treatment units showed the mp removal efficiency of 85 90 12 another research in china s dwtp in the yangtze river applying the treatment stages of coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand and gac filtration ozonation found that the mp removal efficiency was 82 1 88 6 11 data in table 1 show that the black and blue mp colors were mostly detected in the raw water the dominant colors of black and blue mps in the freshwater environment were also observed in the previous study 36 the black and blue mp sources were presumed from fiber clothes and packaging materials 9 the ftir results of several representative samples identified different types of polymers the polymers are cellophane pe polypropylene pp ldpe polytrimolithicamide polyamide pa 6 pa 6 6 and pes the cellophane polymer was found in the effluent of each unit stage and the treated water in dwtps i and ii meanwhile the polytrimelithicamide was present in the pre sedimentation effluent the pa 6 pa 6 6 polymers were present in the pre sedimentation and coagulation flocculation unit effluents the pes was detected in the filter unit effluent the pe pp ldpe were dominantly found in the raw water these were the same as the result of the previous study conducted in the segment of driyorejo to karangpilang in the surabaya river 24 37 the condition was also similar to the several types of mp polymers found in the raw water of the previous studies 3 research conducted by wang et al 11 in the dwtp of yangtze river delta china revealed mp types of pe pet pam ps and pvc in the raw and treated water in addition the pet was still detected in the treated water 11 this type of pet plastic was also reported in the previous studies which were in the raw water in lake taihu 33 and the czech republic 10 the polymers of pe pp ldpe were the common types found in the surface water environments due to the high level of daily use 3 5 the ftir spectra of pe pp ldpe pa 6 pa 6 6 pes and cellophane presented in figs 4 5 the validation method using the determination of mp recovery was not performed in this study this became the study limitation of this research the aim of recovery rate is actually to assess the number of particle losses in the rinsing activity and mp sortation 38 it was estimated that the presence of polymer types figs 4 5 in sdwtps i and ii derived from the plastic contamination in the freshwater as drinking water source 12 the polymers of pe pp ldpe cellophane were commonly used for food packaging and drinking water bottle 39 3 2 abundance and removal efficiency of microplastics in each treatment stage the abundance and removal efficiency of mps in each treatment stage at sdwtps i and ii fluctuated and varied detailed mp abundance and removal in each treatment stages were presented in tables 2 and 3 as shown in tables 2 and 3 in some processing stages the resulting mp removal efficiencies were not present this condition might be caused by the effluent sample collection was conducted without considering the retention time in each treatment stage shahi et al 40 and wang et al 11 further added that removal process of the mps was determined by the design criteria of each treatment unit and was affected by the mp sizes and shapes for instance in the coagulation and flocculation sedimentation units the type and dose of coagulant and mixing interfere the interaction of mp particle and coagulant to form flocs 41 42 in addition the criteria of filter media and backwash process also influence the mp removal in dwtps therefore it is probable that there is a relationship between the mp characteristics and the design criteria of each treatment unit in removing the mps 5 even though the works on mps in drinking water are currently developed however intensive study on the mp removal mechanism in each treatment stage of dwtps is still limited 13 the distribution of mp abundance and removal efficiency by size and shape in each treatment stage of sdwtps i and ii is shown in tables 2 3 the mps with 351 1000 μm size was the most abundant particle in sdwtps i and ii meanwhile the mp particles of 1 100 μm size was the lowest mp abundance in the raw water treatment stages and treated water in sdwtps i and ii as shown in table 3 the most common mp shapes in sdwtps i and ii were fiber followed by fragment film and pellet the film shape was detected in the raw water in sdwtp i and in the treated water in sdwtp ii however the pellet shape was merely found in sdwtp ii the mp abundance decreased gradually toward the end of treatment process however in the effluent of filtration unit in sdwtp ii the number of mp particles increased mp particles of 351 1000 μm were dominant in the effluent of each treatment unit in both sdwtps i and ii 32 69 meanwhile mp particles with 1001 5000 μm size were dominantly detected in the effluent of flocculation sedimentation unit about 36 47 the particle abundance of 1001 5000 μm size decreased in the effluents of aeration pre sedimentation and coagulation units then increased after passing through the flocculation sedimentation unit these particles then decreased in the effluent of filtration unit and treated water this was similar to the fate of mp particles with 351 1000 μm size meanwhile mp values of 1 100 μm 101 350 μm and 1001 5000 μm sizes fluctuated in the the treatment stage effluents which were 2 19 7 33 and 18 47 respectively fibers dominantly prevailed in all effluent of each treatment unit which ranged from 81 to 100 fragments were found 3 20 in almost all effluents of each treatment stage nevertheless no fragment was detected in the effluent of flocculation sedimentation unit in sdwtp i in addition fragments were observed in the filtration effluent this might be due to the turbulency of water flow in the filtration unit which could possibly lift up the mp particles which were retained in between the filter media 43 film shaped mps were removed in the aeration unit meanwhile the pellets appeared in the effluents of coagulation and flocculation sedimentation stage with the same value of 0 1 particles l as in the raw water the reason might be the gradient velocity of water flow in coagulation and flocculation sedimentation unit led to the shearing force breaking the pellets 11 however this phenomenon should be simulated in a controlled laboratory scale to investigate the actual removal mechanism 3 2 1 aeration the mp abundance in the aeration unit effluent decreased tables 2 and 3 the mp removal efficiency in the aeration stage was 45 47 as shown in table 2 the 351 1000 μm sized mps attained the highest mp removal efficiency 69 in sdwtp i meanwhile in sdwtp ii the highest mp removal efficiency was of 1 100 μm size 93 there was no removal efficiency of the 1 100 μm size particles occurred in the aeration unit in sdwtp i most probably these particles were mechanically degraded into smaller particles due to turbulent flow the aeration process in sdwtps i and ii was hydraulic aeration which involved turbulent flow 20 this resulted in the possibility of a mechanical degradation process by friction between mp particles and other solid contaminant in the waters which rose the abundance of smaller mp sizes 42 in addition the shear among mps which happened due to the turbulence might cause the weathering of mp surface and lower the settling velocity of the buoyant mp 44 with respect to the shape the removal efficiencies of fibers fragments films and pellets during aeration were 45 47 29 57 100 and 100 respectively table 3 3 2 2 pre sedimentation pre sedimentation is a pre treatment stage aiming to settle discrete particle of contaminant in raw water such as gravel sand and coarse particles 45 the size of discrete particles was 1001 5000 μm which could be settled by gravity the settling process is one of the mp removal mechanisms that might occur in the pre sedimentation treatment unit 46 therefore the pre sedimentation unit plays an important role for removing mps in dwtp 47 the mp removal efficiencies in the pre sedimentation unit in sdwtps i and ii were 39 and 37 respectively tables 2 and 3 as shown in table 2 in sdwtp i the mps of 101 350 μm size reached the highest removal efficiency 73 in contrast the particle size of 101 350 μm in sdwtp ii was not removed whereas the highest mp removal efficiency was achieved by the 351 1000 μm size class 55 fibers were the most particles removed in pre sedimentation unit in sdwtp ii whereas fragments were the main particles being removed in sdwtp i table 3 in sdwtp ii the fragment abundance increased to about three times from the earlier stage the water flow in pre sedimentation unit is supposed to be controlled in laminar flow to settle the discrete particles 45 the increase of fragments might occur due to the negligence of retention time during sample collection 3 2 3 coagulation and flocculation sedimentation the sdwtps i and ii used aluminum sulfate as coagulant and hydraulic mixing 20 the mp abundance decreased in the coagulant unit followed by an increase in the flocculation sedimentation unit in sdwtp i the removal efficiency during coagulation was 17 whereas that of the flocculation sedimentation was not present this condition was different from the sdwtp ii in which the mp values increased in both coagulation and flocculation sedimentation unit there were no mp removal efficiencies in both coagulation and flocculation sedimentation units this might be because of hydraulic mixing in the process leading to mp degradation process to a smaller size 41 this condition possibly increased the abundance of the small size particle leading to an increase of mp abundance in the effluent data in table 2 show that the 1001 5000 μm particle size owned the highest removal efficiency in the coagulation stage 91 36 this was in contrast with the previous work by skaf et al 42 which was conducted at laboratory scale using alum coagulation to remove mps this study reported that the smaller particle size the higher the removal efficiency 42 the particle with the small size class was more effectively captured in a floc 47 however the mp removal process in coagulation units was not only influenced by the floc but also the gradient velocity 41 the hydraulic mixing might cause turbulence in the coagulation unit stage which could possibly degrade the mp of the large size class into the small size category therefore the removal efficiency of the large size class particle was expectedly high this led to increase the mp abundance of small class particle as shown in table 3 the removal efficiencies of fiber and fragment shapes in the coagulation stage in sdwtp i were 24 and 0 whereas in sdwtp ii the removal efficiency was 0 and 20 data in table 3 show that there were no removal efficiencies of fibers in the flocculation sedimentation units in sdwtps i and ii meanwhile the removal efficiencies of fragments in the flocculation sedimentation units in sdwtp i and ii were 100 and 61 3 2 4 filtration filtration units in sdwtps i and ii were dual media rapid sand filters with silica and anthracite sand media 20 the filtration media had specific gravity range of 1 4 1 65 grain size of 0 5 1 9 mm effective size of 0 7 and uniform coefficient of 1 5 20 the mp removal mechanism in filtration unit depends on the pore size and structure of filter media 48 in sdwtp i the removal efficiency was 26 tables 2 and 3 this was lower than those of the previous study results in three dwtps in china 29 44 11 however an increase of mp abundance occurred in filtration unit effluent in sdwtp ii regarding the particle size it was interesting to note that the smallest size class 1 100 μm attained the highest increase of mp abundance both in sdwtps i and ii table 2 this indicated that there might be a fragmentation process presumably due to the friction between mp surface and the filter media of silica and anthracite the fragmentation process of mps into smaller particles resulted in the mp was not restrained in the pore of filter media according to the mp shape the fiber removal efficiency in sdwtp i was 31 table 3 by contrast there were no fibers and fragments removed in sdwtp ii the pellets were 100 removed in the filtration unit in sdwtp ii 3 2 5 disinfection the disinfection process in sdwtps i and ii was chlorination using chlorine gas which was injected into the treated water reservoir 14 the addition of chlorine gas did not directly give impact to mp degradation 49 however the reaction of chlorine gas in water produced hypochlorous acid and chloride anions which could degrade mp 50 the contact of chlorine to the plastic possibly changed the physical characteristic and structure however all polymer type demonstrated high resistance to chlorine 50 the alteration of physical characteristic and structure of plastic required high dose and contact time of chlorine the mp removal efficiencies in the treated water outlet after exposing the chlorination process were 11 in sdwtp i and 71 in sdwtp ii the varied results in this study were common because there were the difference of sampling time period point and method 5 therefore this requires a validation through simulation either laboratory or pilot scale representing the dwtp treatment units the simulation under the controlled design parameter is suggested to determine the definite mp behavior in each treatment unit of dwtp 3 2 6 removal efficiency significance of each treatment unit the significance test of kruskal wallis was performed to show the mp removal efficiency status there was no significant difference of mp removal efficiency was shown in each treatment stage with the p value of 0 17 p 0 05 the sampling collection without considering the retention time and the replication number most probably affected the statistical analysis 4 practical application to the current water treatment currently the mp contamination has attracted utmost attention especially in relation to the human consumption this study was the first investigation of mp contamination in drinking water supply in surabaya city the conventional technologies of dwtps in this study represented the current technology applied in the most indonesian dwtps the conventional technologies are not originally employed to remove the emerging mp pollutant it was proven from the previous study in the czech republic that the total mp removal efficiency of conventional dwtp with the coagulation flocculation sedimentation and rapid sand filter was up to 70 10 it is considered a big challenge for the dwtps employing conventional technologies to control the mp pollution in water supply this study is significant to understand the mp fate in each stage of conventional dwtps therefore the conventional technology performance still could be developed by optimizing proper conventional technologies to eliminate the mp in the treated water besides the certain design criteria of the existing conventional technologies could be appropriately adjusted to diminish the mp presence in the treated water however mp removal process in the dwtps still could not guarantee that the mp pollution would terminate the dwtps result in the sludge containing mp from the units of pre sedimentation flocculation sedimentation and filtration part of the sludge has been treated using sludge drying bed method however another part has been discharged to the river due to land unavailability this led to the returned mp pollution to the surabaya river the study on the mp removal using conventional technology in dwtp is still lacking the future research is required to explore the proper conventional technology in removing mp in the dwtps therefore the problem of mp pollution in water supply could be addressed 5 conclusion the mp has contaminated the water supply in two sdwtps in surabaya city the mp abundances in the raw and treated water in sdwtps i and ii were 26 8 35 and 8 5 12 3 particles l respectively the existing conventional dwtps have minimized the mp contamination in water supply from 54 to 76 previous study in other country proved that conventional technology could achieve up to 70 mp removal efficiency application of gac filtration and ozone could enhance the mp removal efficiency up to 88 6 therefore the performance of existing conventional technology in surabaya dwtps should be evaluated and improved in order to limit the mp presence in the water supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13320,microplastics mps have been recently detected in the surabaya river indonesia which is used as raw water for water supply this condition has aroused concern about mp presence in the treated water in surabaya drinking water treatment plants dwtps this study aimed to investigate the mp abundance and characteristics of the raw and treated water and the removal efficiencies in each treatment unit in two selected sub dwtps sdwtps in surabaya water supply enterprise these sdwtps apply conventional technology comprising aeration pre sedimentation coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and disinfection stages the mp abundance values in the raw and treated water in sdwtps i and ii were 26 8 35 and 8 5 12 3 particles l respectively the mp was dominated by 93 95 fiber in the raw water and 84 100 in the treated water the mp dominant size in the raw and treated water was 351 1000 μm with the percentages of 45 50 and 36 69 respectively the dominant polymer types of mps in the raw water were polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and low density polyethylene ldpe the total mp removal efficiencies in sdwtps i and ii were 54 and 76 respectively keywords conventional drinking water treatment microplastic raw water removal efficiency treated water 1 introduction microplastics mps as environmental contaminants have been investigated since 1970 1 recently the occurrence of mps in freshwater environments including river surface water reservoir and groundwater has been profoundly studied 2 3 4 the mps in the freshwater varied in abundance size distribution shape and composition because the categories in those studies were different 5 in regard to the mp shape fibers were the most abundant in freshwater environments 6 meanwhile the mp size of 1001 5000 μm was extensively identified in freshwater 7 8 9 mp pollution in freshwater might lead to raw and treated water contamination because rivers are commonly used as a raw water source for drinking water treatment 5 pivokonsky et al 10 studied the mp abundances in three drinking water treatment plants dwtps in the czech republic where surface water was used as the raw water source the results showed that the mp abundances were 1473 3605 particles l in the raw water and 338 628 particles l in the treated water meanwhile wang et al 11 investigated the abundance of mps in an advanced dwtp in china the abundances of mps in the raw and treated waters were 6614 and 930 particles l respectively besides shen et al 12 conducted research on the mp occurrence in drinking water from freshwater in cangsha china the mp abundance in freshwater and drinking water was 2173 3998 and 338 400 particles l respectively mintenig et al 4 performed another investigation on mp presence in raw and treated water in 5 dwtps in germany the study found less mp abundance either in the raw or treated water which was 0 7 particles l this condition occurred because the dwtps employed groundwater as the raw water source 13 the dwtps in indonesia commonly apply conventional technology supported by aeration pre sedimentation coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration and disinfection tanks 14 it was proven that the mp removal could occur through the conventional technology of dwtp 13 15 effective removal of mp contaminant in dwtp requires an appropriate configuration of technology 10 however a particular technology may provide different capabilities in removing the mps 16 therefore it is essential to explore the technology s ability either a conventional or an advanced one in dwtp application for mp removal this information is beneficial for determining the right technology for producing free mps in treated water in the dwtps evidence revealed that 12 mp fragments were detected in four human placentas 17 the mp sizes were 5 10 μm it was presumed that mps could enter the placentas through the gastrointestinal tract 17 even though the potentially toxic effects of the mps on human health have not been clearly investigated the mp pollution in treated water becomes concern since it is used for human consumption 2 the ingested mps into the human body were possibly inert hazardous material for cells and tissues because it led to inflammation and cytotoxicity oxidative stress the injury and viability of cells and tissues 18 these potential adverse effects could be influenced by the mp characteristics size shape and polymer type mp exposure time and the response of cells and tissues to the mps 19 however thorough research on the human impacts of mps should be performed to observe the adverse effects intensively the surabaya river is used as a raw water source for drinking water treatment in surabaya city which serves 92 5 of the population from a total of three million 20 there are two main dwtps in surabaya city namely ngagel and karangpilang each of the ngagel and karangpilang dwtps has three sub dwtps sdwtps the total water treatment capacities of ngagel and karangpilang dwtps were 4550 and 5950 l s respectively 14 among these sdwtps only 1 sdwtp in ngagel dwtp uses advanced treatment technology 21 unfortunately no study has been conducted concerning the mp abundance and removal in the dwtp and water supply systems in this country very few mp studies had been carried out in the surabaya river 22 23 24 lestari and trihadiningrum 22 studied that the surabaya river had been impacted by mps due to improper solid waste management firdaus et al 23 investigated the mp pollution in the sediment of jagir estuary surabaya meanwhile lestari et al 24 studied the mp distribution in the surabaya river water the mps in the sediment of jagir estuary ranged from 92 to 590 particles kg dry weight dw sediment with 1001 5000 μm mp size range 68 the fiber 57 and the polyester pes 56 7 as the dominant mps 23 the mp presence in the jagir estuary were most probably due to the plastic waste generation in the settlements around the study site 23 lestari et al 24 revealed that the mp abundance in the surabaya river varied from 1 47 43 11 particles m3 the mps were dominated by the mp size of 1001 5000 μm 43 1 93 2 with film shape 45 8 92 9 and low density polyethylene ldpe polymer type 44 68 the mp presence in the surabaya river raised concern since this might lead to water supply contamination based on the abovementioned consideration the study of mp occurrence in the treated water and effluent of each treatment unit in dwtp was important for a better understanding the mp contamination and removal in dwtps however there were insufficient data of mp abundance and characteristics in indonesian dwtps this study was focused on the presence of mp in the raw water effluent water of each treatment unit and treated water in the two sdwtps in surabaya city the data could provide a new insight to improve the dwtp performance in reducing mp contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and water sample collection the sampling sites were two conventional sdwtps namely sdwtps i and ii in the water supply enterprise of surabaya city which used the surabaya river as raw water source fig 1 the water treatment capacities of sdwtps i and ii were 1450 and 2000 l s respectively water treatment technologies that were applied in both sdwtps were aeration pre sedimentation coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration disinfection as shown in fig 2 water samples were collected at raw water intake all outlets of each treatment unit including at the reservoir outlet of the treated water fig 2 samples were collected in the mid of april 2020 sample collection of 2 5 l volume was conducted using rinsed glass bottle with the grab sampling technique all samples were collected in duplicate in two different days the samples were then stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 2 sample oxidation and filtration the ambient air was potential contamination in the laboratory work therefore cotton clothes were worn during work 25 the samples were first oxidized using wet peroxide oxidation wpo to remove organic identifying and characterization of the mps 26 twenty ml of 30 merck hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and 20 ml of fe ii 0 05 m were added to the samples the mixed solutions were then heated to 75 c for about an hour until h2o2 entirely vaporized 27 the oxidized samples were subsequently extracted using a glass vacuum filtration device equipped with a ptfe membrane filter hawach scientific with a pore size of 0 2 μm and a diameter of 47 mm the ptfe membranes were put in the glass petri dishes and air dried while covered loosely with aluminum foil for approximately 24 h this step aimed to reduce the potential airborne contamination then these ptfe membranes were used to identify the number size shape and color of mps 2 3 mp identification and characterization the mps were sorted manually from the filter membranes using a tweezer under a dissecting microscope sunshine szm45t b1 and dino capture 2 0 with 40 60 x magnifications these sorted mps were then analyzed to characterize the polymer types using an ftir nicolet i10 spectrophotometer the modified method of hosseini et al 28 was applied in the characterization of mps with ftir eight to ten sorted mp particles were randomly chosen from each sample for ftir analysis the total number of selected mp particles from the dwtp i and ii samples were 112 140 pieces respectively the particles that experienced ftir characterization were only about large mps with the size of 351 5000 μm the hummel polymer sample library was used for the polymer reference to match the resulted spectra from the chosen mp pieces mp abundance was determined according to the number of mps in the samples which was counted manually the size of the mps was classified into 1 100 μm 101 350 μm 351 1000 μm and 1001 5000 μm 29 the shape was categorized into the fiber fragment film and pellet 30 31 32 fibers were measured according to the fiber length whereas pellets and foams were determid regarding the particle diameter while those of films and fragments were based on the distance of two remote points of a particle 33 the mp colors were classified into black blue red yellow and transparent according to peng et al 34 2 4 quality control and assurance quality control and assurance aimed to limit the potential contamination in the laboratory 28 all glassware and equipment were rinsed with distilled water before these were used the dried glassware and equipment were then covered with aluminum foil cotton clothes and gloves were worn to avoid the suspected fiber contamination from the ambient air all the surfaces of the benches in the laboratory and the microscope were wiped before analyzing in the laboratory 2 5 data analyses data were analyzed using software of ibm spss statistics 21 and microsoft excel 2010 the significance of mp removal efficiency status in each treatment stage was analyzed with kruskal wallis non parametric test removal efficiency of the mps was calculated according to the following equation 1 removal efficiency initial mp abundance mp abundance after treatment initial mp abundance 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastic content in the raw and treated water this study revealed that the mps were found in all samples from sdwtps i and ii the content of mps in raw and treated water varied in terms of size shape and color table 1 shows the average abundances of the mps in the raw and treated water samples of sdwtps i and ii the abundance values in table 1 were classified into mp size shape and color data in table 1 present that the total mp abundance values in sdwtps i and ii were 26 8 35 particles l in the raw water and 8 5 12 3 in the treated water the mp value in the raw water was lower than those in other related studies in the czech republic and china 10 11 12 the different range of mp abundance in the raw water in this study was most probably due to the different anthropogenic activities and environmental condition around the raw water source 13 regarding the treated water the different technologies in dwtps may be influenced the mp removal efficiency 12 as shown in table 1 the main mp particles were within the large size category particles with 351 1000 μm size category were dominant both in in the raw and treated water with percentage values of 45 50 and 36 69 respectively the predominant size of mps in the raw water was different from those found in the study conducted in the surabaya river in which large mp particles of 1001 5000 μm size were the most dominant 24 this difference was most possibly because of the difference in sampling time the mp sizes in the raw water were consecutively 1001 5000 μm 31 37 101 350 μm 14 17 and 1 100 μm 2 4 meanwhile the mp sizes in treated water were 101 350 μm 10 32 followed by 1001 5000 μm 18 24 and 1 100 μm 2 8 the highest mp removal efficiency 72 84 was of particle size 1001 5000 μm this phenomenon possibly occurred since the large size mp particles were easier to adhere than that of the small mp particles on the formation of flocs 35 similar cases were also experienced in previous research works in three dwtps in the czech republic 10 and in an advanced dwtp in china 11 however the fate of mps according to particle size in each treatment unit of dwtp should be profoundly explored through laboratory simulation to precisely determine the real mp removal efficiency 5 the mp shapes in the raw water were fibers fragments films and pellets fig 3 fibers were the most dominant particle shape in both of raw and treated water accounting for respectively 93 95 and 84 100 similarly the previous studies reported that the main mp shape was fiber in the sediment in the jagir estuary surabaya 57 23 domestic washing activities by communities along the river potentially discharge wastewater containing synthetic fiber into the raw water source 23 additionally fragments were much less abundant than fiber 5 7 followed by films 1 1 and pellets 0 3 the fragment film and pellet shapes were also less abundant than fiber in the treated water accounting for 15 15 and 1 respectively the film shaped mp particles were found in the treated water even though it was not found in the raw water in sdwtp ii the sampling at the outlet of each treatment unit was conducted without adjusting the retention time used as the design criteria in the sdwtp therefore it was possible to find the different mp shape either in the effluent of each unit or treated water this different shape of mp contaminants probably originated from the raw water entering the dwtps before the sampling time at the inlet the mp removal efficiencies in the treated water based on the shape were 50 79 3 for fibers and 28 for fragments meanwhile the pellet shaped were not removed overall the abundance of the mps in the treated water was much lower than that in the raw water this points out that mp removal has occurred during the water treatment process within the sdwtps the total mp removal efficiencies within sdwtps i and ii were 54 and 76 respectively pivokonsky et al 10 reported that the mp removal efficiencies in the previous study in three dwtps in the czech republic were 70 81 and 82 respectively the first mp removal efficiency was resulted in the dwtp i with the treatment units of coagulation flocculation and sand filtration meanwhile the processes of coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand and granular activated carbon gac filtration in the dwtp ii enhanced the mp removal efficiency up to 81 the dwtp iii using the similar processes with the dwtp ii that of flotation replacing the sedimentation experienced slightly different mp removal efficiency than dwtp ii 82 other mp study in dwtp in changsha china which operated aeration coagulation sedimentation sand and gac filtration treatment units showed the mp removal efficiency of 85 90 12 another research in china s dwtp in the yangtze river applying the treatment stages of coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand and gac filtration ozonation found that the mp removal efficiency was 82 1 88 6 11 data in table 1 show that the black and blue mp colors were mostly detected in the raw water the dominant colors of black and blue mps in the freshwater environment were also observed in the previous study 36 the black and blue mp sources were presumed from fiber clothes and packaging materials 9 the ftir results of several representative samples identified different types of polymers the polymers are cellophane pe polypropylene pp ldpe polytrimolithicamide polyamide pa 6 pa 6 6 and pes the cellophane polymer was found in the effluent of each unit stage and the treated water in dwtps i and ii meanwhile the polytrimelithicamide was present in the pre sedimentation effluent the pa 6 pa 6 6 polymers were present in the pre sedimentation and coagulation flocculation unit effluents the pes was detected in the filter unit effluent the pe pp ldpe were dominantly found in the raw water these were the same as the result of the previous study conducted in the segment of driyorejo to karangpilang in the surabaya river 24 37 the condition was also similar to the several types of mp polymers found in the raw water of the previous studies 3 research conducted by wang et al 11 in the dwtp of yangtze river delta china revealed mp types of pe pet pam ps and pvc in the raw and treated water in addition the pet was still detected in the treated water 11 this type of pet plastic was also reported in the previous studies which were in the raw water in lake taihu 33 and the czech republic 10 the polymers of pe pp ldpe were the common types found in the surface water environments due to the high level of daily use 3 5 the ftir spectra of pe pp ldpe pa 6 pa 6 6 pes and cellophane presented in figs 4 5 the validation method using the determination of mp recovery was not performed in this study this became the study limitation of this research the aim of recovery rate is actually to assess the number of particle losses in the rinsing activity and mp sortation 38 it was estimated that the presence of polymer types figs 4 5 in sdwtps i and ii derived from the plastic contamination in the freshwater as drinking water source 12 the polymers of pe pp ldpe cellophane were commonly used for food packaging and drinking water bottle 39 3 2 abundance and removal efficiency of microplastics in each treatment stage the abundance and removal efficiency of mps in each treatment stage at sdwtps i and ii fluctuated and varied detailed mp abundance and removal in each treatment stages were presented in tables 2 and 3 as shown in tables 2 and 3 in some processing stages the resulting mp removal efficiencies were not present this condition might be caused by the effluent sample collection was conducted without considering the retention time in each treatment stage shahi et al 40 and wang et al 11 further added that removal process of the mps was determined by the design criteria of each treatment unit and was affected by the mp sizes and shapes for instance in the coagulation and flocculation sedimentation units the type and dose of coagulant and mixing interfere the interaction of mp particle and coagulant to form flocs 41 42 in addition the criteria of filter media and backwash process also influence the mp removal in dwtps therefore it is probable that there is a relationship between the mp characteristics and the design criteria of each treatment unit in removing the mps 5 even though the works on mps in drinking water are currently developed however intensive study on the mp removal mechanism in each treatment stage of dwtps is still limited 13 the distribution of mp abundance and removal efficiency by size and shape in each treatment stage of sdwtps i and ii is shown in tables 2 3 the mps with 351 1000 μm size was the most abundant particle in sdwtps i and ii meanwhile the mp particles of 1 100 μm size was the lowest mp abundance in the raw water treatment stages and treated water in sdwtps i and ii as shown in table 3 the most common mp shapes in sdwtps i and ii were fiber followed by fragment film and pellet the film shape was detected in the raw water in sdwtp i and in the treated water in sdwtp ii however the pellet shape was merely found in sdwtp ii the mp abundance decreased gradually toward the end of treatment process however in the effluent of filtration unit in sdwtp ii the number of mp particles increased mp particles of 351 1000 μm were dominant in the effluent of each treatment unit in both sdwtps i and ii 32 69 meanwhile mp particles with 1001 5000 μm size were dominantly detected in the effluent of flocculation sedimentation unit about 36 47 the particle abundance of 1001 5000 μm size decreased in the effluents of aeration pre sedimentation and coagulation units then increased after passing through the flocculation sedimentation unit these particles then decreased in the effluent of filtration unit and treated water this was similar to the fate of mp particles with 351 1000 μm size meanwhile mp values of 1 100 μm 101 350 μm and 1001 5000 μm sizes fluctuated in the the treatment stage effluents which were 2 19 7 33 and 18 47 respectively fibers dominantly prevailed in all effluent of each treatment unit which ranged from 81 to 100 fragments were found 3 20 in almost all effluents of each treatment stage nevertheless no fragment was detected in the effluent of flocculation sedimentation unit in sdwtp i in addition fragments were observed in the filtration effluent this might be due to the turbulency of water flow in the filtration unit which could possibly lift up the mp particles which were retained in between the filter media 43 film shaped mps were removed in the aeration unit meanwhile the pellets appeared in the effluents of coagulation and flocculation sedimentation stage with the same value of 0 1 particles l as in the raw water the reason might be the gradient velocity of water flow in coagulation and flocculation sedimentation unit led to the shearing force breaking the pellets 11 however this phenomenon should be simulated in a controlled laboratory scale to investigate the actual removal mechanism 3 2 1 aeration the mp abundance in the aeration unit effluent decreased tables 2 and 3 the mp removal efficiency in the aeration stage was 45 47 as shown in table 2 the 351 1000 μm sized mps attained the highest mp removal efficiency 69 in sdwtp i meanwhile in sdwtp ii the highest mp removal efficiency was of 1 100 μm size 93 there was no removal efficiency of the 1 100 μm size particles occurred in the aeration unit in sdwtp i most probably these particles were mechanically degraded into smaller particles due to turbulent flow the aeration process in sdwtps i and ii was hydraulic aeration which involved turbulent flow 20 this resulted in the possibility of a mechanical degradation process by friction between mp particles and other solid contaminant in the waters which rose the abundance of smaller mp sizes 42 in addition the shear among mps which happened due to the turbulence might cause the weathering of mp surface and lower the settling velocity of the buoyant mp 44 with respect to the shape the removal efficiencies of fibers fragments films and pellets during aeration were 45 47 29 57 100 and 100 respectively table 3 3 2 2 pre sedimentation pre sedimentation is a pre treatment stage aiming to settle discrete particle of contaminant in raw water such as gravel sand and coarse particles 45 the size of discrete particles was 1001 5000 μm which could be settled by gravity the settling process is one of the mp removal mechanisms that might occur in the pre sedimentation treatment unit 46 therefore the pre sedimentation unit plays an important role for removing mps in dwtp 47 the mp removal efficiencies in the pre sedimentation unit in sdwtps i and ii were 39 and 37 respectively tables 2 and 3 as shown in table 2 in sdwtp i the mps of 101 350 μm size reached the highest removal efficiency 73 in contrast the particle size of 101 350 μm in sdwtp ii was not removed whereas the highest mp removal efficiency was achieved by the 351 1000 μm size class 55 fibers were the most particles removed in pre sedimentation unit in sdwtp ii whereas fragments were the main particles being removed in sdwtp i table 3 in sdwtp ii the fragment abundance increased to about three times from the earlier stage the water flow in pre sedimentation unit is supposed to be controlled in laminar flow to settle the discrete particles 45 the increase of fragments might occur due to the negligence of retention time during sample collection 3 2 3 coagulation and flocculation sedimentation the sdwtps i and ii used aluminum sulfate as coagulant and hydraulic mixing 20 the mp abundance decreased in the coagulant unit followed by an increase in the flocculation sedimentation unit in sdwtp i the removal efficiency during coagulation was 17 whereas that of the flocculation sedimentation was not present this condition was different from the sdwtp ii in which the mp values increased in both coagulation and flocculation sedimentation unit there were no mp removal efficiencies in both coagulation and flocculation sedimentation units this might be because of hydraulic mixing in the process leading to mp degradation process to a smaller size 41 this condition possibly increased the abundance of the small size particle leading to an increase of mp abundance in the effluent data in table 2 show that the 1001 5000 μm particle size owned the highest removal efficiency in the coagulation stage 91 36 this was in contrast with the previous work by skaf et al 42 which was conducted at laboratory scale using alum coagulation to remove mps this study reported that the smaller particle size the higher the removal efficiency 42 the particle with the small size class was more effectively captured in a floc 47 however the mp removal process in coagulation units was not only influenced by the floc but also the gradient velocity 41 the hydraulic mixing might cause turbulence in the coagulation unit stage which could possibly degrade the mp of the large size class into the small size category therefore the removal efficiency of the large size class particle was expectedly high this led to increase the mp abundance of small class particle as shown in table 3 the removal efficiencies of fiber and fragment shapes in the coagulation stage in sdwtp i were 24 and 0 whereas in sdwtp ii the removal efficiency was 0 and 20 data in table 3 show that there were no removal efficiencies of fibers in the flocculation sedimentation units in sdwtps i and ii meanwhile the removal efficiencies of fragments in the flocculation sedimentation units in sdwtp i and ii were 100 and 61 3 2 4 filtration filtration units in sdwtps i and ii were dual media rapid sand filters with silica and anthracite sand media 20 the filtration media had specific gravity range of 1 4 1 65 grain size of 0 5 1 9 mm effective size of 0 7 and uniform coefficient of 1 5 20 the mp removal mechanism in filtration unit depends on the pore size and structure of filter media 48 in sdwtp i the removal efficiency was 26 tables 2 and 3 this was lower than those of the previous study results in three dwtps in china 29 44 11 however an increase of mp abundance occurred in filtration unit effluent in sdwtp ii regarding the particle size it was interesting to note that the smallest size class 1 100 μm attained the highest increase of mp abundance both in sdwtps i and ii table 2 this indicated that there might be a fragmentation process presumably due to the friction between mp surface and the filter media of silica and anthracite the fragmentation process of mps into smaller particles resulted in the mp was not restrained in the pore of filter media according to the mp shape the fiber removal efficiency in sdwtp i was 31 table 3 by contrast there were no fibers and fragments removed in sdwtp ii the pellets were 100 removed in the filtration unit in sdwtp ii 3 2 5 disinfection the disinfection process in sdwtps i and ii was chlorination using chlorine gas which was injected into the treated water reservoir 14 the addition of chlorine gas did not directly give impact to mp degradation 49 however the reaction of chlorine gas in water produced hypochlorous acid and chloride anions which could degrade mp 50 the contact of chlorine to the plastic possibly changed the physical characteristic and structure however all polymer type demonstrated high resistance to chlorine 50 the alteration of physical characteristic and structure of plastic required high dose and contact time of chlorine the mp removal efficiencies in the treated water outlet after exposing the chlorination process were 11 in sdwtp i and 71 in sdwtp ii the varied results in this study were common because there were the difference of sampling time period point and method 5 therefore this requires a validation through simulation either laboratory or pilot scale representing the dwtp treatment units the simulation under the controlled design parameter is suggested to determine the definite mp behavior in each treatment unit of dwtp 3 2 6 removal efficiency significance of each treatment unit the significance test of kruskal wallis was performed to show the mp removal efficiency status there was no significant difference of mp removal efficiency was shown in each treatment stage with the p value of 0 17 p 0 05 the sampling collection without considering the retention time and the replication number most probably affected the statistical analysis 4 practical application to the current water treatment currently the mp contamination has attracted utmost attention especially in relation to the human consumption this study was the first investigation of mp contamination in drinking water supply in surabaya city the conventional technologies of dwtps in this study represented the current technology applied in the most indonesian dwtps the conventional technologies are not originally employed to remove the emerging mp pollutant it was proven from the previous study in the czech republic that the total mp removal efficiency of conventional dwtp with the coagulation flocculation sedimentation and rapid sand filter was up to 70 10 it is considered a big challenge for the dwtps employing conventional technologies to control the mp pollution in water supply this study is significant to understand the mp fate in each stage of conventional dwtps therefore the conventional technology performance still could be developed by optimizing proper conventional technologies to eliminate the mp in the treated water besides the certain design criteria of the existing conventional technologies could be appropriately adjusted to diminish the mp presence in the treated water however mp removal process in the dwtps still could not guarantee that the mp pollution would terminate the dwtps result in the sludge containing mp from the units of pre sedimentation flocculation sedimentation and filtration part of the sludge has been treated using sludge drying bed method however another part has been discharged to the river due to land unavailability this led to the returned mp pollution to the surabaya river the study on the mp removal using conventional technology in dwtp is still lacking the future research is required to explore the proper conventional technology in removing mp in the dwtps therefore the problem of mp pollution in water supply could be addressed 5 conclusion the mp has contaminated the water supply in two sdwtps in surabaya city the mp abundances in the raw and treated water in sdwtps i and ii were 26 8 35 and 8 5 12 3 particles l respectively the existing conventional dwtps have minimized the mp contamination in water supply from 54 to 76 previous study in other country proved that conventional technology could achieve up to 70 mp removal efficiency application of gac filtration and ozone could enhance the mp removal efficiency up to 88 6 therefore the performance of existing conventional technology in surabaya dwtps should be evaluated and improved in order to limit the mp presence in the water supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13321,catalytic combustion method was proposed in this study for the continuous treatment of the biodiesel wastewater over the pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst the components of biodiesel wastewater and the pt based catalyst were analyzed excellent catalyst activity and stability were observed during the wastewater treatment the chemical oxygen demand cod of biodiesel wastewater was significantly reduced through the catalytic combustion with the cod value still lower than 500 mg l after 200 h continuous run no organic gas was found in the gas product and all organic compounds removed were converted to carbon dioxide and water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic combustion high cod biodiesel wastewater pt based catalyst stability 1 introduction with the rapid development of world s economy and industrialization the emission of industrial wastewater has also gradually increased high chemical oxygen demand cod organic wastewater is a type of common industrial wastewater especially in food paper and oil industries the high cod organic wastewater with cod of thousands to hundreds of thousands mg l usually has properties of complex composition strong color large odor and serious environmental hazard 1 2 therefore the treatment of high cod organic wastewater has become an inevitable demand biodiesel wastewater is a typical high cod organic wastewater which mainly contains residual oil soluble salts soaps and large amounts of organic impurities 3 4 through pretreatments such as coagulation and heat pump distillation salts soaps oil and grease can be easily removed however most soluble organic compounds remain in the biodiesel wastewater after pretreatment with the cod still being up to hundreds of thousands mg l the main soluble organic components include alcohols ketones carboxylic acids and other volatile organic compounds voc at present the processes for biodiesel wastewater treatment mainly include physico chemical electrochemical biological advanced oxidation oxy cracking methods and their combination 3 5 6 among these the physico chemical methods including adsorption 7 acidification 8 coagulation 9 and dissolved air floatation 10 are usually adopted as a pretreatment process 3 the electrochemical treatment process applies electrical current to coagulate or oxidize the compounds of biodiesel wastewater it has the advantages of no expense of chemicals and fast reaction rate yet with the disadvantages of low efficiency high energy consumption and cost 5 11 organic compounds can be converted through the biological treatment process into stable inorganic under mild reaction conditions however the presence of microbial growth inhibitor makes it hard to treat the wastewater with higher cod 3 12 the advanced oxidation technologies use strong oxidants to decompose the organic matters yet the consumption of oxidant increases the investment 3 13 in addition the oxy cracking process can convert the organic compounds of wastewater into value added products under high temperature and pressure 6 catalytic combustion is a widely used method in the treatment of vocs which can completely oxidize and decompose organic compounds into co2 and h2o without secondary pollution the use of catalyst significantly reduces the temperature compared with the thermal incineration process resulting in lower energy consumption 14 15 the main organic components remaining in the biodiesel wastewater after pretreatment are compounds with low boiling point which belong to vocs however few studies on treatment of biodiesel wastewater by catalytic combustion were reported the main reason is probably that the vaporization of biodiesel wastewater prior to catalytic combustion would consume much energy in fact most latent heat of wastewater vapor can be reused by heat pump distillation in the industrial practices 16 therefore it is economically feasible to use the catalytic combustion method in the treatment of biodiesel wastewater the catalytic combustion method adopts the fix bed reactor to continuously treat the biodiesel wastewater using easily acquired air as the oxidant which can be easily achieved in continuous industrial processes thus it is a technical feasible method in this study catalytic combustion was used in the continuous treatment of high cod biodiesel wastewater over the pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst the cod removal rate with 200 h time on stream was examined to evaluate the reliability of this process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the biodiesel wastewater distilled to remove the solid was obtained from yantai green energy technology co ltd the catalyst was a commercial pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst with particle size of 0 85 mm to 2 mm the fe2o3 with particle size of 2 36 mm to 4 mm was purchased from chengdu chuanzhao technology co ltd silicon carbide sic with particle size from 1 to 3 mm was obtained from weifang kaihua silicon carbide micropowder co ltd the reagents for measuring cod were purchased from the beijing lianhua yongxing science and technology co ltd 2 2 experimental the experimental apparatus for catalytic combustion is shown in fig 1 composed of 1 feedstock bottle 2 peristaltic pump 3 air pump 4 preheating section 5 7 9 temperature controller 6 pretreatment section 8 catalytic combustion section 10 product collection flask 11 condenser 12 water seal first approximately 50 g of sic 20 g of fe2o3 and 5 g of pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst were loaded in the preheating section pretreatment section and catalytic combustion section with the void fractions of 0 35 0 49 and 0 42 respectively the dimensions of sic fe2o3 and pt al2o3 cordierite sections were 140 100 and 26 mm in length and all 20 mm in diameter next the experimental apparatus was connected and checked for tightness then the sic bed in the preheating section the fe2o3 bed in the pretreatment section and the pt al2o3 cordierite bed in the catalytic combustion section were heated to 320 c with the control accuracy of 1 c the temperatures of the three sections measured by the thermocouples were stabilized at 320 c by automatically turning the electric heating on or off the high cod biodiesel wastewater at the flow rate of 15 g h and air at the flow rate of 800 ml min were continuously pumped into the preheating section the wastewater was vaporized heated and completely mixed with the heated air in the preheating section the pressure drops in the preheating pretreatment and catalytic combustion sections were 622 116 and 63 pa respectively calculated by ergun equation thus the high temperature gas mixture of voc water vapor and air was then easily flowed into the pretreatment section and catalytic combustion section for sulfur removal and reaction the temperatures of preheating section pretreatment section and the catalytic combustion section were kept at 320 c during the experiment the gas mixture was condensed after reaction the liquid and gas products were collected once per hour for offline analysis 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 biodiesel wastewater analysis a multi parameter water quality analyzer 5b 6c v8

biodiesel wastewater was 180 000 mg l which can be classified as high cod organic wastewater 2 as listed in table 1 the main components of biodiesel wastewater were mainly alcohols 72 7 and fatty acids 22 5 the sulfur content of the biodiesel wastewater was 30 mg l which was much higher than those specified in some national standards e g 1 mg l according to the chinese wastewater discharge standard 18 3 2 characterization of fe2o3 and pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst the surface morphology and crystalline phases of fresh and 200 h pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst are shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 a different sizes of particles aggregated in clusters and adhered to the surface of cordierite the high resolution tem images as shown in fig 2 b indicated uniform distribution of al and pt fig

respectively 3 3 feasibility analysis of catalytic combustion the catalyst stability was examined in 200 h continuous treatment of the biodiesel wastewater as shown in fig 3 the cod of treated biodiesel wastewater was maintained at lower than 500 mg l even after 200 h continuous run indicating excellent catalyst activity and stability during the catalytic combustion of biodiesel wastewater the components in the gas product were n2 co2 and o2 the contents of n2 co2 were 94 54 and 3 57 while the content of o2 was 1 89 calculated by difference all organic compounds removed were converted

curve of the pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst after 200 h run the weight loss of the used catalyst was only 0 832 which suggested little carbon deposit on the catalyst and thus confirmed the good stability of the pt based catalyst during the biodiesel wastewater treatment moreover the sulfur containing compounds in the wastewater would be mostly converted into sox during the catalytic combustion process the sulfur content of the treated biodiesel wastewater was significantly reduced from 30 mg l to less than 1 mg l the xrf results showed an increase in sulfur content of fe2o3 after the 200 h run suggesting the removal of sulfur by the pretreatment section it would prevent the pt based catalyst from sulfur poisoning 20 which could improve the catalyst stability according to the results of gc ms the main compound in the biodiesel wastewater is alcohols in particular methanol thus methanol is taken as an example to illustrate the reaction mechanism the reaction equations are

surface adsorbed oxygen atom under the activation of surface adsorbed oxygen atom the oh bond of methanol is firstly broken to form the surface adsorbed methoxy group then the ch bond in the methoxy group is broken to form the surface adsorbed formaldehyde molecule followed by the desorption of formaldehyde 21 23 the formation of formaldehyde could be confirmed by the results of treated wastewater according to the gc ms meanwhile the surface adsorbed methoxy group could be also transformed to methylenedioxy and formate in turn and finally transformed to co2 the surface adsorbed h atom and hydroxyl group produced in the reaction could be combined to form water 23 24 as shown in table 2 compared with other biodiesel wastewater treatment methods higher cod removal rate was achieved using the catalytic combustion approach without addition of other chemical reagents such as acids and strong oxidant or microorganism in addition the heat consumed in the process and heat released from the reaction can be reused by heat exchange as shown in fig 4 the temperature of the catalytic bed was approximately 320 c by heat exchange between the gas before reaction and the gas after reaction in the tubular reactor during the catalytic combustion the vaporization of wastewater can be realized by the heat exchange between the liquid water and the gas after reaction to a certain extent the catalytic combustion process was totally low energy consumption without additional energy after the system being stabilized thus the catalytic combustion proved to be an efficient and economically feasible method for the biodiesel wastewater treatment this work can provide a new strategy for the continuous treatment of biodiesel wastewater and other high cod organic wastewaters

13321,catalytic combustion method was proposed in this study for the continuous treatment of the biodiesel wastewater over the pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst the components of biodiesel wastewater and the pt based catalyst were analyzed excellent catalyst activity and stability were observed during the wastewater treatment the chemical oxygen demand cod of biodiesel wastewater was significantly reduced through the catalytic combustion with the cod value still lower than 500 mg l after 200 h continuous run no organic gas was found in the gas product and all organic compounds removed were converted to carbon dioxide and water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic combustion high cod biodiesel wastewater pt based catalyst stability 1 introduction with the rapid development of world s economy and industrialization the emission of industrial wastewater has also gradually increased high chemical oxygen demand cod organic wastewater is a type of common industrial wastewater especially in food paper and oil industries the high cod organic wastewater with cod of thousands to hundreds of thousands mg l usually has properties of complex composition strong color large odor and serious environmental hazard 1 2 therefore the treatment of high cod organic wastewater has become an inevitable demand biodiesel wastewater is a typical high cod organic wastewater which mainly contains residual oil soluble salts soaps and large amounts of organic impurities 3 4 through pretreatments such as coagulation and heat pump distillation salts soaps oil and grease can be easily removed however most soluble organic compounds remain in the biodiesel wastewater after pretreatment with the cod still being up to hundreds of thousands mg l the main soluble organic components include alcohols ketones carboxylic acids and other volatile organic compounds voc at present the processes for biodiesel wastewater treatment mainly include physico chemical electrochemical biological advanced oxidation oxy cracking methods and their combination 3 5 6 among these the physico chemical methods including adsorption 7 acidification 8 coagulation 9 and dissolved air floatation 10 are usually adopted as a pretreatment process 3 the electrochemical treatment process applies electrical current to coagulate or oxidize the compounds of biodiesel wastewater it has the advantages of no expense of chemicals and fast reaction rate yet with the disadvantages of low efficiency high energy consumption and cost 5 11 organic compounds can be converted through the biological treatment process into stable inorganic under mild reaction conditions however the presence of microbial growth inhibitor makes it hard to treat the wastewater with higher cod 3 12 the advanced oxidation technologies use strong oxidants to decompose the organic matters yet the consumption of oxidant increases the investment 3 13 in addition the oxy cracking process can convert the organic compounds of wastewater into value added products under high temperature and pressure 6 catalytic combustion is a widely used method in the treatment of vocs which can completely oxidize and decompose organic compounds into co2 and h2o without secondary pollution the use of catalyst significantly reduces the temperature compared with the thermal incineration process resulting in lower energy consumption 14 15 the main organic components remaining in the biodiesel wastewater after pretreatment are compounds with low boiling point which belong to vocs however few studies on treatment of biodiesel wastewater by catalytic combustion were reported the main reason is probably that the vaporization of biodiesel wastewater prior to catalytic combustion would consume much energy in fact most latent heat of wastewater vapor can be reused by heat pump distillation in the industrial practices 16 therefore it is economically feasible to use the catalytic combustion method in the treatment of biodiesel wastewater the catalytic combustion method adopts the fix bed reactor to continuously treat the biodiesel wastewater using easily acquired air as the oxidant which can be easily achieved in continuous industrial processes thus it is a technical feasible method in this study catalytic combustion was used in the continuous treatment of high cod biodiesel wastewater over the pt al2o3 cordierite catalyst the cod removal rate with 200 h time on stream was examined to evaluate the reliability of this process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the biodiesel wastewater

diameter next the experimental apparatus was connected and checked for tightness then the sic bed in the preheating section the fe2o3 bed in the pretreatment section and the pt al2o3 cordierite bed in the catalytic combustion section were heated to 320 c with the control accuracy of 1 c the temperatures of the three sections measured by the thermocouples were stabilized at 320 c by automatically turning the electric heating on or off the high cod biodiesel wastewater at the flow rate of 15 g h and air at the flow rate of 800 ml min were continuously pumped into the preheating section the wastewater was vaporized heated and completely mixed with the heated air in the preheating section the pressure drops in the preheating pretreatment and catalytic combustion sections were 622 116 and 63 pa respectively calculated by ergun equation thus the high temperature gas mixture of voc water vapor and air was then easily flowed into the pretreatment section and catalytic combustion section

13322,wastewater treatment plants wwtps influent conditions can dramatically affect a treatment unit s state and effluent quality wwtp sensors may record faulty measurements due to abnormal events or the malfunction of the system leading to serious problems in the system s operation and the violation of effluent discharge standards therefore automatic fault detection and faulty data reconciliation are crucial for an efficient and stable wwtp monitoring in this study a holistic framework for sensor validation of wwtp influent conditions is presented considering the non linearity measurement

wwtp model to determine the proposed method s resilience potential keywords fault detection stacked denoising autoencoder sensor validation smart monitoring wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are essential for improving water quality to discharge to the environment prioritizing the plants resilience to ensure long term effective performance 1 3 strict discharge limits and rising operational costs as well as intrinsic nonstationary and non linear processes pose challenges to wwtps for meeting desired safety standards and protocols 4 8 thus wastewater influent measurements from wwtps such as chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss affect the state of treatment units process mechanisms and product quality 5 9 anomalies at influent sensor measurements can be triggered by major disturbances that must be promptly detected to provide smart environments avoiding operational failure maintaining effluent quality downstream operations improving system s resilience the potential for resource recovery and cleaner production while reducing labor costs 5 10 12 due to rapid industrialization trends wwtp process monitoring has become essential to ensure regular operation and product quality 1 in this regard sensors are crucial components for process monitoring and they commonly suffer from poor data quality due to the harsh hostile environment faulty information retrieved by sensors leads to the system s deterioration in environmental impact and energy costs 13 in addition concerns of sensor measurements used for data monitoring are often ignored due to the low storage capacity cost 14 thus data driven multivariate statistical process monitoring for fault diagnosis in industrial processes 14 18 surface water quality and wwtps in particular 6 11 19 have attracted research attention recent decades a wwtp smart environment should detect failures promptly identify faulty sensors and reconcile data to ensure more realistic measurements in an online fashion 17 20 over the past decade researchers have applied enhanced data science and machine learning techniques to sensor fault detection to improve the system s operation and safety 6 20 31 given the overflowing requirements for modern industrial engineering stability the fault detection problem in dynamic systems is widely investigated 22 despite numerous studies evaluating effective influent condition monitoring techniques advanced control of wwtps lacks robustness for online monitoring within a sensor validation framework 6 influent conditions are complex and non linear and principal component analysis pca and independent component analysis ica cannot extract important features from the data resulting in low quality monitoring performance 15 17 statistical monitoring has been developed for wwtps for fault detection in a previous study pca monitoring has been applied by abiri linse edén ohlsson 23 and xiao et al 22 to improve data quality for multi output predictions for wwtp variables used in fault detection here pca improved cod predictions biological oxygen demand bod5 and tn by extracting similar multilinear regression mlr patterns similarly the ica technique has been utilized to detect data faults to minimize wwtp operating costs 1 however many drawbacks can appear from the utilization of conventional techniques such as the time required for data processing in conventional diagnosis methods biased monitoring results are obtained due to the sensitivity to disturbances the raw data s important features cannot be effectively extracted due to process complexity and nonlinearity 30 thus research has been conducted on applying artificial intelligence ai technologies to overcome wwtp sensor monitoring limitations and meet discharge standards 20 within the deep neural networks dnns field autoencoder ae models have attracted considerable attention due to their data reconciliation abilities which can accommodate non linear relationships and dynamism of the data 24 25 the main challenge of influent measurements in fault detection is the nonlinearity of the disturbances to which they are exposed 21 25 26 therefore scholars have introduced ae models variations performing well against extremely noisy and corrupted process engineering measurements these models include denoising autoencoder dae and stacked denoising autoencoder sdae 27 in recent years many efforts have been made to apply dae and sdae to the study of the restoration of sensor data for indoor air and wastewater treatment quality 19 24 28 29 the sdae is an unsupervised learning method often used for feature extraction and non linear problems it performs a layer wise pretraining procedure stacks consecutive layers together and develops global fine tuning 29 30 this model usually exhibits superior performance in data reconciliation as it can improve feature discrimination in conditions of input fluctuation 31 32 showing better learning from the data 24 33 to cope with sensor data issues in wwtps this study proposes an influent condition sensor monitoring approach based on the recently emerged algorithm sdae toward a sensor validation framework for wwtps in the present study the following contributions are covered first develop an sdae structure that can detect identify

constructed in the residual space a statistic constructed in the feature space t 2 i 2 and h 2 are used to detect the faulty measurements moreover the detection rate dr is utilized to assess the performance of each method second the sensor validity index svi is estimated for each model to identify the fault source among all the possible sensors data reconciliation is then developed from the models structures by forcing the faulty data into normal influent measurements after that the reconciliation performance is evaluated using root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape finally the reconciled data is evaluated in a wwtp model layout benchmark simulation model no 1 bsm1 to analyze system resilience with the proposed model output the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the preliminary theoretical background of the methodology implemented and the methods utilized to develop a pseudo validation of the sdae model to evaluate its performance section3 follows up the experimentation developed on the m city data and bsm1 model section 4 presents the results and discussion of the models and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology the methodology is comprised of three primary parts first a theoretical background of the methods second the sensor validation framework detailed steps third the development of sdae based sensor validation for monitoring the wwtps 2 1 background before describing the proposed sdae based sensor validation model the algorithm s theoretical computation and its training process are discussed in this part following the dae algorithm is first described then the sdae algorithm and the training procedure are similarly detailed this approach aims to encode hidden latent structures in noisy data and robustly reconstruct the original data the proposed method s advantage is to capture non linear correlations among multivariate variables enabling improved fault detection ability 2 1 1 denoising autoencoder model an autoencoder ae model is a fully connected three layer feedforward neural network with one hidden layer based on an encoder trained to encode input data into a lower dimensional representation and the decoder that is trained to reconcile the input data 24 the ae model has a butterfly construction with an encoder and decoder of equal sizes 24 34 the input vector x 0 1 t is first mapped to a hidden representation h 0 1 t defined by h f s wx b where w is a t t weight matrix b is the bias vector and f s is an activation function generally non linear to encode the input to the hidden representation the reconciled vector z 0 1 t is obtained by decoding the hidden representation as z g s w h b in which g s is a decoding function applied to the hidden representation to obtain a reconstruction ideally similar to the input in summary each training x i is mapped to each h i and a reconciliation z i 34 the dae model extracts crucial features from noisy or partially destroyed input data 34 in this sense dae reverts the data s corruption by reconciliation fig 1 35 similar to ae the dae model corrupts the original input x to be represented as x by a stochastic mapping x g n x x then x is mapped to a hidden representation h by h f s w x b then a similar transformation g s then maps h back to a reconciliation represented by z g s w h b 34 35 the dae training is conducted by optimizing an objective function that comprises the sum of all the reconciliation errors between the input x and the reconciled z the objective function θ is defined as θ argmi n θ 1 n i 1 n l x i z i argmi n θ 1 n i 1 n l x i g s f s x i where n is the training sample number and l is the reconciliation error the mean squared error mse was used as the reconciliation error eq 1 finally the objective function minimization was conducted through optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent sgd 35 or adam 17 18 1 l x z i 1 n x i z i 2 n 2 1 2 stacked denoising autoencoder model the sdae model is composed of multiple stacked layers fig 2 the sdae has been widely applied to automatically identify features that reflect real data characteristics from complex actual data 19 36 the training process of the entire network was divided into two phases unsupervised stacked pretraining and supervised global fine tuning 27 29 the dae s first hidden layer is trained to obtain the parameters w 1 w 1 b 1 b 1 and h 1 f 1 x where h 1 is the input for the next layer with one hidden layer to train a network is then formed by a deep encoder and deep decoder functions the deep encoder uses the corrupted version x and transforms it into a deeply hidden representation h through a multilayer non linear mapping eq 2 2 h f s n f s n 1 f s 2 f s 1 x a similar multilayer transformation then maps back the deep hidden representation h to a reconciliation z in the deep decoder eq 3 3 z g s n g s n 1 g s 2 g s 1 x lastly the average reconciliation error l x z is minimized using the objective function as explained for dae to finetune the whole network herein with the first dae trained the hidden layer outputs are used as a training set for the second dae the third dae and so on 19 35 2 2 sensor validation framework the sensor validation framework comprises three main steps sensor fault detection sensor fault identification and sensor fault reconciliation described in this section 2 2 1 sensor fault detection to define if the sensors faulty signals occur two statistics are computed including the spe constructed in the residual space based on the reconciliation error e and the h 2 constructed in the feature space based on the hidden representations the spe statistic is evaluated as an online fault detection measurement 37 computing the variables confidence limits based on the assumption of the normality of data values and their time dependency detecting noise and abnormal variations for instance if a normal operating observation is mapped to a hidden representation following the spe statistic it will be detected as a non faulty observation the spe can capture the correlation changes on the data for the variables considered in a process calculating the error between the normal data values x and their reconciled data values in eq 4 20 7 4 spe e t e x g s f s x t x g s f s x in addition 25 investigated the relationship between pca and autoencoders developing the h 2 statistic to tackle the disadvantage of pca based statistics toward non linear problems the h 2 statistic can be introduced in variant autoencoders analogically compared to the t 2 and i 2 statistics for pca and ica methods h 2 is constructed in the feature space consisting of the sum of squares of hidden representations with respect to the input and is formulated as follows 5 h 2 h t h f s wx b t f s wx b confidence limits for the spe and h 2 statistics namely spe α and h α 2 are estimated via a kernel density estimator kde which is a non parametric method to estimate the probability density function of a random variable with a significance level of α as seen in eq 6 17 38 6 f x 1 ms i 1 m k x x i s where x is the data point x i is an observation point m is the number of observations k is the kernel function and s is the window of observations for the fairness of analysis the significance level was set to α 0 05 for determining the spe and h 2 confidence limits then any measurement that surpasses the determined confidence limits is considered an anomaly to evaluate the capability of the fault detection by the spe and h 2 statistics of each sensor a dr is calculated by eq 7 for each i sensor of the study 20 7 d r i detected faults for i th sensor total faults given to i th sensor 100 for a fair evaluation of the fault detection models the spe statistic is taken as a common fault detection statistic among all methods however for the pca and dpca methods the t 2 statistic is introduced while for ica and dica the i 2 is considered 2 2 2 sensor fault identification once the faulty measurement is detected sensor fault identification is performed to determine the failure source assuming that all the sensors are faulty if the i th variable of the original sample x is faulty and k i the fault direction was not selected properly the spe therefore does not show considerable variation and the sensor validity index svi k is close to the unity however if it is correctly identified svi k approaches zero 17 39 the svi k is proposed to identify the faulty sensor among all possible sensors using the sdae as a reconciliation method eq 8 8 sv i k spe x t n spe x t where spe x t and spe x t n are the spe vectors of the original sample vector x t and the reconciled vector y t b by the ae models and n is the number of sensors 2 2 3 sensor fault reconciliation faulty sensor identification is followed by the faulty signal reconstruction needed to force the abnormal signal to be close to normal conditions in this study the sensor fault reconstruction consists of propagating the faulty and normal sensor data through the trained network with its corresponding parameters obtaining a reconstruction from the input in an autonomous fashion moreover the reconstruction performance is assessed via three metrics the rmse the mean absolute error mae and the mape as in eqs 9 to 11 where x i is the observed data and z i is the reconstructed data 9 rmse 1 m i 1 m x i z i 2 10 mae 1 m i 1 m x i z i 11 mape 100 m i 1 m z i x i x i 2 3 sustainable monitoring using sdae based sensor validation an efficient monitoring operation is based on rapid faulty measurement detection sensor identification and fault sensor reconciliation 17 the monitoring and sensor validation procedure proposed in this study describes three parts 1 data preparation 2 offline modeling and 3 online monitoring fig 3 depicts the scheme of the sensor validation procedure first the data preparation is performed the data are collected from influent quality sensors and pre processed to check for missing data and outliers divided into a 70 training set and a 30 test set in offline modeling the sdae model is trained with data under normal operating conditions corrupted beforehand with gaussian noise the data have been corrupted to evaluate the performance of the model for any condition the statistic for assessing monitoring is the spe for which kde estimates a limit at a confidence level of 95 then in online monitoring the trained sdae model is evaluated with a faulty data set artificially corrupted first sdae based sensor validation is carried out starting with fault detection using the spe then the sensor identification is performed through the sdae based sensor validity index svi sdae following this the fault reconciliation is carried out through the sdae architecture the sdae based sensor validation schema was compared to the pca ica and shallow autoencoders which utilized three principal components and independent components however the pca 2 14 17 25 and ica 7 need an additional iterative step to reconcile faulty sensors reducing these methods autonomous repair capability in the sdae model s training process a training dataset is utilized to learn the characteristics of influent conditions data with noise offline modeling for this purpose the model is trained with input data at normal conditions corrupted by gaussian noise to define the corruption level various ranges of corruption were tested as described in section 4 in the supplementary information si fig s1 illustrate that the sdae showed a significant improved performance at all corruption levels compared to the ae however after a certain level of corruption μ 0 σ 4 the performance decreased with increasing σ therefore the corruption level is defined with a mean of 0 and 4 of standard deviation because it provides the highest dr and reconciliation performance at the same time the output data contained the same input training dataset at normal conditions when fitting the model from input to output the sdae extracts the intrinsic features from the training data learning the necessary parameters for an appropriate reconciliation by forcing the noisy data to normal operating conditions fig 4 illustrates the training process for the sdae architecture first the input data for training the model are corrupted by gaussian noise then the propagation follows the transference encoder decoder the encoder learns a feature representation from noisy influent data x through non linear mapping next the decoder reconstructs a feature vector of the influent quality data using a non linear mapping the sdae structure is modeled using the keras deep learning library the architecture consists of three layers an encoder with four neurons that represent each sensor variable of the influent conditions the hidden representation layers which have a sparse encoding and decoding dimension of neurons as illustrated in fig 4 and the output layer which has four neurons where the reconciled data are stored the layers are fully connected with an activation function between the layers with sigmoid tanh relu and leakyrelu functions for the compilation step the selected optimizer is adam this selection was based on the fine tuning of sdae configuration by the analysis of various activation function and optimizer combinations as shown in table s1 in the si the best parameters were selected considering both the fault detection and reconciliation performances 3 experimentation the proposed monitoring method s efficiency is validated and evaluated using the sdae based sensor validation framework in the bsm1 the influent loadings in the bsm1 were taken from the m city in south korea to represent more realistic results in the wastewater treatment plant this section explains the data preparation for the bsm1 and preliminary analysis stages the model training strategy and the implications for reconciled and faulty measurements in the operational conditions of the wwtp in terms of resilience 3 1 influent data preparation 3 1 1 data pre processing because wwtp management does not regularly integrate data monitoring the systems storage capability is typically cheaper than the basic budget of a wwtp facility operation 13 in this sense much data captured from wwtps are not correctly processed making sensors and their detection capacities of critical importance furthermore the different types of sensors and their correct selection for appropriate water parameters can vary from model to model table 1 and be defined in the wwtp system in this study influent conditions of sensor measurements for cod tp tn and ss variables were taken from a wwtp at m city preliminary analysis was conducted to assess these variables non linear behavior comprising a year of data at an hourly resolution fig 5 the variables data cod tp tn and ss were utilized in hourly resolution to perform better the fault detection methodology the data selected for evaluation were for 1 month 30 days of the whole year 365 days consisting of 720 samples fault detection and data reconciliation capability of pca dpca ica dica ae sae and sdae were evaluated using noisy data measurements given that these methods present different non linear behavioral data outputs a hurst exponent index hi for the influent concentrations was estimated to illustrate the dataset s features the hi is a parameter between 0 and 1 that can determine the dependency of time series data on past values 40 which determines if the data are positively or negatively correlated if hi is equal to 0 5 the time series data have brownian motion properties independent in contrast if hi values are lower or higher than 0 5 there is dependence on past values and existing of correlation for which the data follows an anti persistent 0 hi 0 5 or persistent 0 5 hi 1 behavior 3 1 2 faulty data preparation a total of 720 samples were separated into a training set 70 and the remaining 30 were assigned to the test set the training set with 504 samples was normalized by each variable with a zero mean and a unit variance selecting the proportions for splitting the dataset may affect the performance of any machine learning problem due to high variability in parameter estimates to avoid the overfitting and ensure that adequate training was obtained the training was regularized by weight decay the l2 penalty multiplier set to 1 10 3 the efficient training progress of the sdae model is shown in fig s2 of the si fig s2 shows that the training was adequately performed based on the learning curves of both training and validation loss of the model with loss values approaching zero a variety of sensor failures can occur the most typical include bias failure complete failure drifting failure and precision degradation a test set was prepared with the introduction of four artificial failures as described in table 2 first precision degradation could be seen from the first to the 30th samples of the cod sensor second drifting was integrated from the 55th to the 84th sample of the tp sensor third a bias failure was given from the 110th to the 139th sample of the tn sensor fourth complete failure was subjected from the 163rd to 192nd sample of the ss sensor several percentages of the magnitude s failures were applied including 95 85 and 75 of the average concentration of the cod tp and tn fig s3 of the si describes the introduction of the artificial faulty observations the test set finally the prepared test set was normalized according to the parameters of the training set several faulty magnitudes were applied decreasing each sensor s faulty size percentage cod tp tn and ss by 5 10 and 15 for example the tn sensor was corrupted with 47 35 mg l representing 100 of the faulty size as shown in table 2 the faulty size 47 35 mg l was then decreased to 95 80 and 75 from 100 these magnitudes of tn sensors were equal to 44 98 37 88 and 35 51 mg l respectively moreover fig s4 of the si illustrates the introduction of the artificial faulty observations to the test set finally the prepared test set was normalized according to the parameters of the training set 3 2 influent validation on wastewater treatment benchmark model 3 2 1 benchmark model conditions the wwtp influent conditions simulated in the sdae must be implemented in a wwtp layout to analyze their validity in this study the well known bsm1 was utilized to develop the validation analysis followed by a wwtp system s resilience assessment the bsm1 model was developed by the international water association iwa task group as a benchmarking system to compare wwtp control strategies 45 bsm1 incorporates five reactors two anoxic reactors and three aerobic reactors for conventional activated sludge treatment and a clarifier as depicted in fig s5 of the si 3 2 2 faulty data preparation for bsm1 experimentation bsm1 can be evaluated under different weather influent conditions such as rainy dry and stormy weather constituting 14 days of the influent data with sample intervals of 15 min 45 however in this study the base scenario was chosen to be tested under dry weather conditions for comparison purposes thus the simulation procedure was constituted first by steady state conditions and later by dynamic dry weather as specified for this benchmark model by 45 more influent conditions were tested to develop sensor validation influent data were defined under faulty noisy and reconciled data conditions for 2 weeks for dynamic simulations this data period was divided into two parts the first week of data was utilized as a training set and the remaining data were used as a test set given the different types of faulty signals in a wwtp the selected sensor s performance was analyzed in two faulty signal scenarios for validation cod sensor measurements were corrupted with different faults such as bias precision degradation complete failure gaussian noise signals and laplace noise signals two scenarios were defined to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of the selected sensor validation scenario 1 comprised the integration of complete failure 1107 98 mg l and precision degradation with three times the mean value in the data for samples 127 to 206 and 327 to 427 of the influent data respectively gaussian noise signals were added to the data for further comparison as shown in fig 6 a scenario 2 integrates the bias failure 738 mg l and precision degradation with four times the mean value in the data for samples 127 to 206 and 327 to 427 respectively in addition laplace noise signals were similarly integrated for comparison purposes as shown in fig 6 b 3 2 3 resilience assessment of wastewater treatment plants resilience assessments are necessary to analyze the operational results of a system under previously defined conditions in wastewater treatment resilience refers to a system s capacity to minimize the loss of functionality related to the service failure magnitude and the recovery time related to duration taking into account the system s design life and considering exceptional operating conditions 3 46 47 the overall resilience of a wwtp system can be estimated by measuring the area between the initial system performance level p o and the actual system performance curve p f i t at any time t after the occurrence of a given threat fig 7 focusing on the system performance graph for each effluent parameter the overall resilience can be calculated by eq 12 to eq 14 3 12 re i 1 a i t p i 0 t n t 0 where re i is the system resilience concerning effluent parameter i under the considered threat human activities and a i is the area between the performance at the time of perturbation and initial state represented by the shaded area in fig 7 47 13 a i t o t p 0 i p i t dt t t 0 t n where t 0 is the start of perturbation in the system t n is when the system returns to its initial state p 0 is system s initial state in terms of performance and p i t is system performance at time t the probability of effluent discharge violation can be estimated by eq 14 14 p i t 1 g i t c s i t g i t if g i c i s 1 if g i c i s where p i t is system performance at time t which rescales the effluent concentration between 0 and 1 g i t is the output value effluent concentration at time t c s is the threshold maximum acceptable output at time t and i is the effluent parameter cod tn or tss overall resilience based on magnitude and duration can be integrated to assess the system s performance using eq 15 and eq 16 15 re i mag max t 1 v c i e c i s max t 1 v c i e 16 re i dur 1 max j 1 v t e j i t i j i t where re i mag and re i dur are resilience variables based on magnitude and duration respectively c e is the effluent concentration of parameter i at time t c s is the effluent limitation of parameter i ti j is the initial time of failure of parameter i in failure event j te j is the end time of failure for parameter i in failure event j t is the total duration of the unexpected event and v is the number of time steps the resilience assessment of bsm1 under faulty noisy and reconciled scenarios follows the schematic in fig 8 this validation aims to show the effects of faulty and noisy data on process performance and the effectiveness of soft sensor validation methods to reconcile faulty sensors in a resilient fashion over multiple failures 4 results and discussion 4 1 m city data preliminary analysis preliminary analyses were implemented to check the features of the m city data the red line hurst line indicates the actual tendency of the analyzed measurement sensors in contrast the green dashed line normal line is a reference line that traces a gaussian distribution tendency fig 9 the analysis of 720 measurements in the rescaled range analysis r l values does not fit the normality line and exhibits a non gaussian behavior the hurst index values for the four variables cod tp tn and ss were higher than 0 5 hi cod 0 6469 hi tp 0 6308 hi tn 0 5849 and hi ss 0 5469 indicating a persistent time dependency the calculated his represent positively correlated data thus data show clear signs of non gaussian distribution dynamism and accumulation of influent conditions measurements these analyses reveal that the measurements of influent conditions were complex and need to be evaluated using non linear methods to capture their intrinsic features 4 2 comparison analysis of monitoring techniques sdae based sensor validation advantages are based on comparisons with pca dpca ica dica and shallow autoencoders for the online monitoring of artificial faulty observations the sdae based spe confidence limit for fault detection was defined by the kde spe 0 05 4 89 considering the corruption introduced into the four wwtp sensors the fault detection performance of all the introduced methods including pca dpca ica dica ae sae dae and sdae is shown in fig 10 additionally numerical performance based on the dr is tabulated in table 3 figs 10 a and b depicts the fault detection performance of pca and dpca methods the advantage of the dpca method relies on considering the serial correlation between the measurements nevertheless both of these methods apply a linear transformation on their feature space the dr for each sensor utilizing pca ranges from 56 67 to 96 67 giving an average of 80 utilizing the spe statistic additionally the t 2 yielded a higher overall performance of 85 on the other hand the dpca method could detect 78 33 and 90 of faults utilizing the spe and t 2 statistics from this it can be observed that the dpca yielded a greater performance using the statistic constructed in the feature space similarly figs 10 c and d show the fault detection performance of ica and dica methods in the same way as the pca and dpca dica also incorporates a lagged component to consider the serial correlation of measurements in this case the ica method presented an overall detection performance of 84 17 and 48 33 for the spe and i 2 statistics being superior to the dica method using spe since it could reach 76 67 the contrary happened with the i 2 since based on this the dica method achieved 76 67 furthermore figs 10 e to h account for the neural approaches including the ae dae sae and sdae it can be observed that these methods showed superiority over the conventional static and dynamic methods when utilizing the spe statistic the overall fault detection performance ranged from 83 33 to 98 33 on the other hand when using the h 2 the overall detection performance ranged from 50 83 to 92 50 the ae method yielded the lowest performance for both statistics the performance for fault detection may be deteriorated due to the training procedure as in the regular ae structure the network learns how to create an exact copy of the input instead of discovering an effective way to recognize any erratic behavior and correct it on the contrary the sdae based fault detection showed the highest dr with 98 33 using the spe and 92 50 using the h 2 fig 10 h representing superior performance compared with the neural approaches and conventional methods for all the given faults the reason for the lower performance in conventional diagnosis methods is their susceptibility to disturbances their low capability in the extraction of the important features in raw data leads to biased results considering the detection statistics the h 2 statistic accounted for an improvement of approximately 10 and 42 for the dae and sdae in comparison to the non denoising methods respectively in most cases it can be observed that the spe statistic is more sensitive when capturing a more significant portion of faulty measurements in comparison to the t 2 i 2 and h 2 statistics thus the sdae method is superior to all the exposed methods it combines two valuable features 1 the noise added to the input on the training procedure and 2 the layer stacking for extracting more valuable information as adding noise to the input dataset improves the network s capability to recognize faulty behavior a stacking structure can extract a more robust feature representation four different fault magnitude percentage scenarios were studied to verify the proposed model s ability to detect small magnitude faults as explained in section 3 1 2 results of the overall detection rate for all scenarios are supplied in table 4 the sdae based fault detection showed a higher dr than the conventional methods even at a small percentage fault indicating that sdae based fault detection outperforms other conventional methods under these conditions at higher corruption levels i e 100 and 95 the fault detection procedure captured more than 90 faulty measurements for the lower fault percentage i e 80 and 75 the capability of detecting faults degraded progressively this implies that features such as nonlinearity and dynamism of multivariate influent condition data were captured even at small magnitudes of various types of faults the suggested method could identify approximately 74 14 of the faulty signals the fault detection performances of the different scenarios with the introduced methods are depicted graphically in figs s6 to s13 of the si after analyzing the fault detection performance faulty sensors must be identified by means of the svi which is depicted for each sensor in fig 11 it is expected that the svi goes below the limit of 0 5 for each period of faulty data an inspection of these plots shows that the sensor fault does not appear clearly in the pca driven svi plot fig 11 a despite that the overall dr 80 confirms the identification step s necessity this analysis demonstrates that the pca method presents difficulties when handling noisy and non gaussian influent data in contrast fig 11 b illustrates the svi computed for each sensor using the sdae method for which it can be observed that after introducing faulty signals from the 55th to the 84th samples of the tp sensor the svi showed a significant decrease under the established limit of 0 5 in contrast the remaining sensors tended to maintain an svi close to unity implying that the tp sensor was a corrupted sensor from the 55th to the 84th samples the same tendency with cod tn and ss sensors were observed when sdae based method was used in conclusion the svi plot based sdae successfully separates the faulty data from the four sensors normal operating regions this is mainly because the sdae can discover linear and non linear relationships in multivariate sensor data of wwtp and its capability to deal with noisy and non gaussian influent data once the capability of each method for fault detection and fault identification is assessed the reconstruction performance is evaluated using rmse mae and mape table 5 summarizes the reconciliation performance metrics for each method showing in bold the greatest reconciliation performance among all methods and metrics additionally fig 12 illustrates the produced reconciliation of each sensor using pca and sdae methods with the faulty and actual data also the reconciliation performance using ica dpca dica ae sae and dae methods is presented in fig s14 in the si the static models pca and ica showed the largest values in the tn sensor considering mape which yielded 41 72 and 49 32 for pca and ica respectively while for the rmse metric the ica based reconciliation showed the largest value 36 32 mgn l additionally the dynamic additions to the static methods dpca and dica showed greater performance than those of pca and ica in all sensors implying that considering the lagged augmented matrix aids in learning more accurate multivariate data behaviors the improvement given by the dpca over pca varies in a range of 4 48 to 95 considering all the metrics in the same way dica shows improvement over ica in a range of 9 32 to 82 93 for all metrics the neural approaches were assessed in the reconciliation task as well the metrics show that the sdae method produced the most suitable reconciliation among all the neural methods in terms of the introduced metrics the suitability of the proposed method for reconciling faulty measurements mainly relies on its ability to 1 learn non linear dependencies existing among the multiple variables in the process and 2 force the noisy data to be accurately sent to normal conditions for instance the ae and sae work with the same schema in which the input and output layers contain the same information making the network learn how to copy the input in addition the denoising variations of ae dae and sdae have a particularity in which the input receives a corrupted signal to be transformed to a noiseless signal therefore it is expected that these variations learn more patterns related to forcing the corrupted data into an accurate reconciled measurement it can be observed that the sae method outperformed the dae method as the sae stacked various layers and could learn a more suitable behavior of the data nevertheless the sdae method combines the special features of stacking layers for denoising purposes achieving superior performance over static and neural approaches with respect to the sae a relative improvement in all the metrics can be observed in a range from 9 71 to 96 23 4 3 resilience analysis to demonstrate the advantages of incorporating a sensor validation method to the monitoring of influent conditions in a wwtp an experiment was conducted in bsm1 scenario 1 influent conditions were defined for actual cod data noisy gaussian data faulty data complete failure and precision degradation and reconciled data from sdae which were evaluated by bsm1 as shown in fig 13 a the resilience estimated for the faulty measurements exhibited stable overall performance with relatively strong resilience in the period with non faulty measurements considering the lag of the response as shown in fig 13 b however the system s resilience dropped suddenly to below 0 7 at the complete failure period then recovered to an acceptable level indicating that the performance of the biological parameters was affected by the complete failure period precision degradation failure similarly affected the resilience of the system the system resilience fell to below 0 6 during this period after which it slowly recovered to 1 for the noisy gaussian data a varied low resilience was observed resilience values ranged from 0 85 to 1 and a periodic trend that followed similar periods to the gaussian noise in the influent can be seen in fig 13 a on the other hand for the system under reconciled data from sdae the system s overall resilience remained at 1 an acceptable level of biological parameters system performance in addition energy consumption and effluent quality index eqi were considered to evaluate the performance of the system fig 13 c shows the evaluation performance for scenario 1 the energy consumption and eqi were 4179 37 kwh day and 6123 02 kg poll units day under normal data energy consumption was increased to 4597 31 kwh day and 5433 18 kwh day under the noisy and faulty readings respectively whereas the eqi consequently decreased to 5510 72 kg poll units day and 4286 11 kg poll units day for noisy and faulty data respectively on the other hand under the reconciled data by the sdae model the energy consumption and eqi were 4221 17 kwh day and 6061 79 kg poll units day indicating the sdae model could force the abnormal data to the normal and achieving a sustainable balance between the energy consumption and the eqi by avoiding the loss of energy and meet the environmental standards thus the proper monitoring of the system s influent conditions would decrease the operation cost and meet the effluent discharge standards scenario 2 influent conditions were also evaluated by bsm1 scenario 2 was defined for actual cod data laplace noisy data faulty data precision degradation and bias failure and reconciliation data from sdae fig 14 a resilience for the system with faulty measurements remained acceptable during the non faulty measurements as shown in fig 14 b however the resilience dropped to below 0 85 and returned to normal after the precision degradation fault period similarly for the bias failure period system resilience dropped to below 0 6 besides when evaluating laplace noisy data resilience ranged from 0 85 to 1 showing a trend similar to scenario 1 as shown in fig 14 a for reconciled data the overall resilience improved and was maintained at 1 similar to scenario 1 energy consumption and eqi were utilized to evaluate the system s performance for scenario 2 fig 14 c shows the evaluation performance for scenario 2 under normal data the system showed an energy consumption of 4179 37 kwh day while the eqi was 6123 02 kg poll units day in the cases of noisy and faulty readings the energy consumption increased to 4634 92 kwh day and 5224 22 kwh day respectively therefore the eqi for noisy and faulty readings decreased to 5755 63 kg poll units day and 4592 26 kg poll units day on the other hand under the reconciled data by the sdae model the energy consumption and eqi were 4262 96 kwh day and 6000 56 kg poll units day indicating the sdae model could force the abnormal data to the normal and achieving a sustainable balance between the energy consumption and the eqi to demonstrate sdae based sensor validation s effectiveness comparing the two scenarios in terms of resilience was made based on area magnitude and duration fig 15 overall resilience of the reconciled signals for the two scenarios was close to normal with a value of 1 for the area magnitude and duration indicating a proper operation of the system on the other hand low overall resilience was obtained for the two fault scenarios when estimating resilience by duration and magnitude which delegate the treatment process s unstable operation fig 15 a and b show that the noisy signals led to longer periods of plant operation and indicated a resilience of less than 0 4 for scenario 1 and 0 3 for scenario 2 which reflects the need to improve influent conditions as part of aiming for a more resilient plant operation comparing resilience based on the area to the calculated resilience based on magnitude noisy faulty data were associated with the lowest plant resilience for both scenarios in scenario 1 the overall resilience based on magnitude was approximately 0 5 with the highest magnitude of violations for the plant s performance overall the resilience assessment by bsm1 under faulty and noisy influent data showed low resilience performance for both scenarios however the reconciled influent data improved the performance producing the highest resilience value the reconciled data from sdae outperformed the faulty data on the wwtp when analyzing its resilience for operational performance and discharge standards 5 conclusions in this paper multivariate data driven sensor validation methods were developed to monitor a wwtp s influent measurements this study s main contribution was to showcase the outperformance of the sdae based sensor self validation technique for increasing sensor reliability and plant operation that can be affected by disturbances in the wwtp environment the proposed approach builds a reference model offline using noisy multivariate data capturing non linear correlations embedded in multivariate data then it identified potential faults online by comparing monitoring indicators spe and svi derived from residuals given the limitations of conventional methods pca dpca ica and dica to effectively extract primary features from datasets in noisy conditions ae and dae models were additionally developed to improve extract features and obtain non faulty data values which were compared to the sdae furthermore the sensor model data was validated through experimentation using bsm1 as a wwtp framework for two scenarios demonstrating this methodology s implementation in wwtp monitoring modeling the sdae based sensor model outperformed other methods evaluated due to its ability to represent non linear correlations of the variables of the noisy influent measurements cod tp tn and ss contributing to an accurate model for a wwtp sensor s operation consequently sdae based fault detection performance was superior to conventional methods with a detection rate of 98 resilience assessment under faulty different noise and reconciled measurements was additionally carried out resilience metrics presented a comprehensive tool to evaluate the effects of noise and the faulty measurements on plant resilience by varying the violation s period and magnitude from these analyses it could be corroborated that the sdae based soft sensor validation proposed in this study can effectively improve influent measurements monitoring lower operating costs and ensure a high discharge effluent however one limitation that can be described is the need for further investigation to improve the sdae architecture given the assumption of fixed hyperparameters for the networks that may promote decay in the optimization procedure resulting in a local minima problem certain techniques such as hyperparameter optimization and the sliding window should be applied to obtain a realistic approximation to the sensors normal operating conditions declaration of competing interest

13322,wastewater treatment plants wwtps influent conditions can dramatically affect a treatment unit s state and effluent quality wwtp sensors may record faulty measurements due to abnormal events or the malfunction of the system leading to serious problems in the system s operation and the violation of effluent discharge standards therefore automatic fault detection and faulty data reconciliation are crucial for an efficient and stable wwtp monitoring in this study a holistic framework for sensor validation of wwtp influent conditions is presented considering the non linearity measurement noise and complexity of the wwtp s data a stacked denoising autoencoder sdae model is proposed to detect identify and reconcile faulty data based on data from a real wwtp in south korea the proposed sdae architecture presented a detection rate dr between 74 and 98 the faulty sensor was identified using an sdae based sensor validity index svi data reconciliation showed that the sdae was the most suitable reconciliation method based on the root mean square error rmse for total nitrogen tn influent conditions of 4 04 mg n l finally faulty noisy and reconciled measurements were evaluated in a wwtp model to determine the proposed method s resilience potential keywords fault detection stacked denoising autoencoder sensor validation smart monitoring wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are essential for improving water quality to discharge to the environment prioritizing the plants resilience to ensure long term effective performance 1 3 strict discharge limits and rising operational costs as well as intrinsic nonstationary and non linear processes pose challenges to wwtps for meeting desired safety standards and protocols 4 8 thus wastewater influent measurements from wwtps such as chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and suspended solids ss affect the state of treatment units process mechanisms and product quality 5 9 anomalies at influent sensor measurements can be triggered by major disturbances that must be promptly detected to provide smart environments avoiding operational failure maintaining effluent quality downstream operations improving system s resilience the potential for resource recovery and cleaner production while reducing labor costs 5 10 12 due to rapid industrialization trends wwtp process monitoring has become essential to ensure regular operation and product quality 1 in this regard sensors are crucial components for process monitoring and they commonly suffer from poor data quality due to the harsh hostile environment faulty information retrieved by sensors leads to the system s deterioration in environmental impact and energy costs 13 in addition concerns of sensor measurements used for data monitoring are often ignored due to the low storage capacity cost 14 thus data driven multivariate statistical process monitoring for fault diagnosis in industrial processes 14 18 surface water quality and wwtps in particular 6 11 19 have attracted research attention recent decades a wwtp smart environment should detect failures promptly identify faulty sensors and reconcile data to ensure more realistic measurements in an online fashion 17 20 over the past decade researchers have applied enhanced data science and machine learning techniques to sensor fault detection to improve the system s operation and safety 6 20 31 given the overflowing requirements for modern industrial engineering stability the fault detection problem in dynamic systems is widely investigated 22 despite numerous studies evaluating effective influent condition monitoring techniques advanced control of wwtps lacks robustness for online monitoring within a sensor validation framework 6 influent conditions are complex and non linear and principal component analysis pca and independent component analysis ica cannot extract important features from the data resulting in low quality monitoring performance 15 17 statistical monitoring has been developed for wwtps for fault detection in a previous study pca monitoring has been applied by abiri linse edén ohlsson 23 and xiao et al 22 to improve data quality for multi output predictions for wwtp variables used in fault detection here pca improved cod predictions biological oxygen demand bod5 and tn by extracting similar multilinear regression mlr patterns similarly the ica technique has been utilized to detect data faults to minimize wwtp operating costs 1 however many drawbacks can appear from the utilization of conventional techniques such as the time required for data processing in conventional diagnosis methods biased monitoring results are obtained due to the sensitivity to disturbances the raw data s important features cannot be effectively extracted due to process complexity and nonlinearity 30 thus research has been conducted on applying artificial intelligence ai technologies to overcome wwtp sensor monitoring limitations and meet discharge standards 20 within the deep neural networks dnns field autoencoder ae models have attracted considerable attention due to their data reconciliation abilities which can accommodate non linear relationships and dynamism of the data 24 25 the main challenge of influent measurements in fault detection is the nonlinearity of the disturbances to which they are exposed 21 25 26 therefore scholars have introduced ae models variations performing well against extremely noisy and corrupted process engineering measurements these models include denoising autoencoder dae and stacked denoising autoencoder sdae 27 in recent years many efforts have been made to apply dae and sdae to the study of the restoration of sensor data for indoor air and wastewater treatment quality 19 24 28 29 the sdae is an unsupervised learning method often used for feature extraction and non linear problems it performs a layer wise pretraining procedure stacks consecutive layers together and develops global fine tuning 29 30 this model usually exhibits superior performance in data reconciliation as it can improve feature discrimination in conditions of input fluctuation 31 32 showing better learning from the data 24 33 to cope with sensor data issues in wwtps this study proposes an influent condition sensor monitoring approach based on the recently emerged algorithm sdae toward a sensor validation framework for wwtps in the present study the following contributions are covered first develop an sdae structure that can detect identify and reconcile sensor faults in influent conditions at a wwtp different models pca dpca ica dica ae sae and dae are implemented for comparison purposes the model s squared prediction error spe constructed in the residual space a statistic constructed in the feature space t 2 i 2 and h 2 are used to detect the faulty measurements moreover the detection rate dr is utilized to assess the performance of each method second the sensor validity index svi is estimated for each model to identify the fault source among all the possible sensors data reconciliation is then developed from the models structures by forcing the faulty data into normal influent measurements after that the reconciliation performance is evaluated using root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape finally the reconciled data is evaluated in a wwtp model layout benchmark simulation model no 1 bsm1 to analyze system resilience with the proposed model output the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the preliminary theoretical background of the methodology implemented and the methods utilized to develop a pseudo validation of the sdae model to evaluate its performance section3 follows up the experimentation developed on the m city data and bsm1 model section 4 presents the results and discussion of the models and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology the methodology is comprised of three primary parts first a theoretical background of the methods second the sensor validation framework detailed steps third the development of sdae based sensor validation for monitoring the wwtps 2 1 background before describing the proposed sdae based sensor validation model the algorithm s theoretical computation and its training process are discussed in this part following the dae algorithm is first described then the sdae algorithm and the training procedure are similarly detailed this approach aims to encode hidden latent structures in noisy data and robustly reconstruct the original data the proposed method s advantage is to capture non linear correlations among multivariate variables enabling improved fault detection ability 2 1 1 denoising autoencoder model an autoencoder ae model is a fully connected three layer feedforward neural network with one hidden layer based on an encoder trained to encode input data into a lower dimensional representation and the decoder that is trained to reconcile the input data 24 the ae model has a butterfly construction with an encoder and decoder of equal sizes 24 34 the input vector x 0 1 t is first mapped to a hidden representation h 0 1 t defined by h f s wx b where w is a t t weight matrix b is the bias vector and f s is an activation function generally non linear to encode the input to the hidden representation the reconciled vector z 0 1 t is obtained by decoding the hidden representation as z g s w h b in which g s is a decoding function applied to the hidden representation to obtain a reconstruction ideally similar to the input in summary each training x i is mapped to each h i and a reconciliation z i 34 the dae model extracts crucial features from noisy or partially destroyed input data 34 in this sense dae reverts the data s corruption by reconciliation fig 1 35 similar to ae the dae model corrupts the original input x to be represented as x by a stochastic mapping x g n x x then x is mapped to a hidden representation h by h f s w x b then a similar transformation g s then maps h back to a reconciliation represented by z g s w h b 34 35 the dae training is conducted by optimizing an objective function that comprises the sum of all the reconciliation errors between the input x and the reconciled z the objective function θ is defined as θ argmi n θ 1 n i 1 n l x i z i argmi n θ 1 n i 1 n l x i g s f s x i where n is the training sample number and l is the reconciliation error the mean squared error mse was used as the reconciliation error eq 1 finally the objective function minimization was conducted through optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent sgd 35 or adam 17 18 1 l x z i 1 n x i z i 2 n 2 1 2 stacked denoising autoencoder model the sdae model is composed of multiple stacked layers fig 2 the sdae has been widely applied to automatically identify features that reflect real data characteristics from complex actual data 19 36 the training process of the entire network was divided into two phases unsupervised stacked pretraining and supervised global fine tuning 27 29 the dae s first hidden layer is trained to obtain the parameters w 1 w 1 b 1 b 1 and h 1 f 1 x where h 1 is the input for the next layer with one hidden layer to train a network is then formed by a deep encoder and deep decoder functions the deep encoder uses the corrupted version x and transforms it into a deeply hidden representation h through a multilayer non linear mapping eq 2 2 h f s n f s n 1 f s 2 f s 1 x a similar multilayer transformation then maps back the deep hidden representation h to a reconciliation z in the deep decoder eq 3 3 z g s n g s n 1 g s 2 g s 1 x lastly the average reconciliation error l x z is minimized using the objective function as explained for dae to finetune the whole network herein with the first dae trained the hidden layer outputs are used as a training set for the second dae the third dae and so on 19 35 2 2 sensor validation framework the sensor validation framework comprises three main steps sensor fault detection sensor fault identification and sensor fault reconciliation described in this section 2 2 1 sensor fault detection to define if the sensors faulty signals occur two statistics are computed including the spe constructed in the residual space based on the reconciliation error e and the h 2 constructed in the feature space based on the hidden representations the spe statistic is evaluated as an online fault detection measurement 37 computing the variables confidence limits based on the assumption of the normality of data values and their time dependency detecting noise and abnormal variations for instance if a normal operating observation is mapped to a hidden representation following the spe statistic it will be detected as a non faulty observation the spe can capture the correlation changes on the data for the variables considered in a process calculating the error between the normal data values x and their reconciled data values in eq 4 20 7 4 spe e t e x g s f s x t x g s f s x in addition 25 investigated the relationship between pca and autoencoders developing the h 2 statistic to tackle the disadvantage of pca based statistics toward non linear problems the h 2 statistic can be introduced in variant autoencoders analogically compared to the t 2 and i 2 statistics for pca and ica methods h 2 is constructed in the feature space consisting of the sum of squares of hidden representations with respect to the input and is formulated as follows 5 h 2 h t h f s wx b t f s wx b confidence limits for the spe and h 2 statistics namely spe α and h α 2 are estimated via a kernel density estimator kde which is a non parametric method to estimate the probability density function of a random variable with a significance level of α as seen in eq 6 17 38 6 f x 1 ms i 1 m k x x i s where x is the data point x i is an observation point m is the number of observations k is the kernel function and s is the window of observations for the fairness of analysis the significance level was set to α 0 05 for determining the spe and h 2 confidence limits then any measurement that surpasses the determined confidence limits is considered an anomaly to evaluate the capability of the fault detection by the spe and h 2 statistics of each sensor a dr is calculated by eq 7 for each i sensor of the study 20 7 d r i detected faults for i th sensor total faults given to i th sensor 100 for a fair evaluation of the fault detection models the spe statistic is taken as a common fault detection statistic among all methods however for the pca and dpca methods the t 2 statistic is introduced while for ica and dica the i 2 is considered 2 2 2 sensor fault identification once the faulty measurement is detected sensor fault identification is performed to determine the failure source assuming that all the sensors are faulty if the i th variable of the original sample x is faulty and k i the fault direction was not selected properly the spe therefore does not show considerable variation and the sensor validity index svi k is close to the unity however if it is correctly identified svi k approaches zero 17 39 the svi k is proposed to identify the faulty sensor among all possible sensors using the sdae as a reconciliation method eq 8 8 sv i k spe x t n spe x t where spe x t and spe x t n are the spe vectors of the original sample vector x t and the reconciled vector y t b by the ae models and n is the number of sensors 2 2 3 sensor fault reconciliation faulty sensor identification is followed by the faulty signal reconstruction needed to force the abnormal signal to be close to normal conditions in this study the sensor fault reconstruction consists of propagating the faulty and normal sensor data through the trained network with its corresponding parameters obtaining a reconstruction from the input in an autonomous fashion moreover the reconstruction performance is assessed via three metrics the rmse the mean absolute error mae and the mape as in eqs 9 to 11 where x i is the observed data and z i is the reconstructed data 9 rmse 1 m i 1 m x i z i 2 10 mae 1 m i 1 m x i z i 11 mape 100 m i 1 m z i x i x i 2 3 sustainable monitoring using sdae based sensor validation an efficient monitoring operation is based on rapid faulty measurement detection sensor identification and fault sensor reconciliation 17 the monitoring and sensor validation procedure proposed in this study describes three parts 1 data preparation 2 offline modeling and 3 online monitoring fig 3 depicts the scheme of the sensor validation procedure first the data preparation is performed the data are collected from influent quality sensors and pre processed to check for missing data and outliers divided into a 70 training set and a 30 test set in offline modeling the sdae model is trained with data under normal operating conditions corrupted beforehand with gaussian noise the data have been corrupted to evaluate the performance of the model for any condition the statistic for assessing monitoring is the spe for which kde estimates a limit at a confidence level of 95 then in online monitoring the trained sdae model is evaluated with a faulty data set artificially corrupted first sdae based sensor validation is carried out starting with fault detection using the spe then the sensor identification is performed through the sdae based sensor validity index svi sdae following this the fault reconciliation is carried out through the sdae architecture the sdae based sensor validation schema was compared to the pca ica and shallow autoencoders which utilized three principal components and independent components however the pca 2 14 17 25 and ica 7 need an additional iterative step to reconcile faulty sensors reducing these methods autonomous repair capability in the sdae model s training process a training dataset is utilized to learn the characteristics of influent conditions data with noise offline modeling for this purpose the model is trained with input data at normal conditions corrupted by gaussian noise to define the corruption level various ranges of corruption were tested as described in section 4 in the supplementary information si fig s1 illustrate that the sdae showed a significant improved performance at all corruption levels compared to the ae however after a certain level of corruption μ 0 σ 4 the performance decreased with increasing σ therefore the corruption level is defined with a mean of 0 and 4 of standard deviation because it provides the highest dr and reconciliation performance at the same time the output data contained the same input training dataset at normal conditions when fitting the model from input to output the sdae extracts the intrinsic features from the training data learning the necessary parameters for an appropriate reconciliation by forcing the noisy data to normal operating conditions fig 4 illustrates the training process for the sdae architecture first the input data for training the model are corrupted by gaussian noise then the propagation follows the transference encoder decoder the encoder learns a feature representation from noisy influent data x through non linear mapping next the decoder reconstructs a feature vector of the influent quality data using a non linear mapping the sdae structure is modeled using the keras deep learning library the architecture consists of three layers an encoder with four neurons that represent each sensor variable of the influent conditions the hidden representation layers which have a sparse encoding and decoding dimension of neurons as illustrated in fig 4 and the output layer which has four neurons where the reconciled data are stored the layers are fully connected with an activation function between the layers with sigmoid tanh relu and leakyrelu functions for the compilation step the selected optimizer is adam this selection was based on the fine tuning of sdae configuration by the analysis of various activation function and optimizer combinations as shown in table s1 in the si the best parameters were selected considering both the fault detection and reconciliation performances 3 experimentation the proposed monitoring method s efficiency is validated and evaluated using the sdae based sensor validation framework in the bsm1 the influent loadings in the bsm1 were taken from the m city in south korea to represent more realistic results in the wastewater treatment plant this section explains the data preparation for the bsm1 and preliminary analysis stages the model training strategy and the implications for reconciled and faulty measurements in the operational conditions of the wwtp in terms of resilience 3 1 influent data preparation 3 1 1 data pre processing because wwtp management does not regularly integrate data monitoring the systems storage capability is typically cheaper than the basic budget of a wwtp facility operation 13 in this sense much data captured from wwtps are not correctly processed making sensors and their detection capacities of critical importance furthermore the different types of sensors and their correct selection for appropriate water parameters can vary from model to model table 1 and be defined in the wwtp system in this study influent conditions of sensor measurements for cod tp tn and ss variables were taken from a wwtp at m city preliminary analysis was conducted to assess these variables non linear behavior comprising a year of data at an hourly resolution fig 5 the variables data cod tp tn and ss were utilized in hourly resolution to perform better the fault detection methodology the data selected for evaluation were for 1 month 30 days of the whole year 365 days consisting of 720 samples fault detection and data reconciliation capability of pca dpca ica dica ae sae and sdae were evaluated using noisy data measurements given that these methods present different non linear behavioral data outputs a hurst exponent index hi for the influent concentrations was estimated to illustrate the dataset s features the hi is a parameter between 0 and 1 that can determine the dependency of time series data on past values 40 which determines if the data are positively or negatively correlated if hi is equal to 0 5 the time series data have brownian motion properties independent in contrast if hi values are lower or higher than 0 5 there is dependence on past values and existing of correlation for which the data follows an anti persistent 0 hi 0 5 or persistent 0 5 hi 1 behavior 3 1 2 faulty data preparation a total of 720 samples were separated into a training set 70 and the remaining 30 were assigned to the test set the training set with 504 samples was normalized by each variable with a zero mean and a unit variance selecting the proportions for splitting the dataset may affect the performance of any machine learning problem due to high variability in parameter estimates to avoid the overfitting and ensure that adequate training was obtained the training was regularized by weight decay the l2 penalty multiplier set to 1 10 3 the efficient training progress of the sdae model is shown in fig s2 of the si fig s2 shows that the training was adequately performed based on the learning curves of both training and validation loss of the model with loss values approaching zero a variety of sensor failures can occur the most typical include bias failure complete failure drifting failure and precision degradation a test set was prepared with the introduction of four artificial failures as described in table 2 first precision degradation could be seen from the first to the 30th samples of the cod sensor second drifting was integrated from the 55th to the 84th sample of the tp sensor third a bias failure was given from the 110th to the 139th sample of the tn sensor fourth complete failure was subjected from the 163rd to 192nd sample of the ss sensor several percentages of the magnitude s failures were applied including 95 85 and 75 of the average concentration of the cod tp and tn fig s3 of the si describes the introduction of the artificial faulty observations the test set finally the prepared test set was normalized according to the parameters of the training set several faulty magnitudes were applied decreasing each sensor s faulty size percentage cod tp tn and ss by 5 10 and 15 for example the tn sensor was corrupted with 47 35 mg l representing 100 of the faulty size as shown in table 2 the faulty size 47 35 mg l was then decreased to 95 80 and 75 from 100 these magnitudes of tn sensors were equal to 44 98 37 88 and 35 51 mg l respectively moreover fig s4 of the si illustrates the introduction of the artificial faulty observations to the test set finally the prepared test set was normalized according to the parameters of the training set 3 2 influent validation on wastewater treatment benchmark model 3 2 1 benchmark model conditions the wwtp influent conditions simulated in the sdae must be implemented in a wwtp layout to analyze their validity in this study the well known bsm1 was utilized to develop the validation analysis followed by a wwtp system s resilience assessment the bsm1 model was developed by the international water association iwa task group as a benchmarking system to compare wwtp control strategies 45 bsm1 incorporates five reactors two anoxic reactors and three aerobic reactors for conventional activated sludge treatment and a clarifier as depicted in fig s5 of the si 3 2 2 faulty data preparation for bsm1 experimentation bsm1 can be evaluated under different weather influent conditions such as rainy dry and stormy weather constituting 14 days of the influent data with sample intervals of 15 min 45 however in this study the base scenario was chosen to be tested under dry weather conditions for comparison purposes thus the simulation procedure was constituted first by steady state conditions and later by dynamic dry weather as specified for this benchmark model by 45 more influent conditions were tested to develop sensor validation influent data were defined under faulty noisy and reconciled data conditions for 2 weeks for dynamic simulations this data period was divided into two parts the first week of data was utilized as a training set and the remaining data were used as a test set given the different types of faulty signals in a wwtp the selected sensor s performance was analyzed in two faulty signal scenarios for validation cod sensor measurements were corrupted with different faults such as bias precision degradation complete failure gaussian noise signals and laplace noise signals two scenarios were defined to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of the selected sensor validation scenario 1 comprised the integration of complete failure 1107 98 mg l and precision degradation with three times the mean value in the data for samples 127 to 206 and 327 to 427 of the influent data respectively gaussian noise signals were added to the data for further comparison as shown in fig 6 a scenario 2 integrates the bias failure 738 mg l and precision degradation with four times the mean value in the data for samples 127 to 206 and 327 to 427 respectively in addition laplace noise signals were similarly integrated for comparison purposes as shown in fig 6 b 3 2 3 resilience assessment of wastewater treatment plants resilience assessments are necessary to analyze the operational results of a system under previously defined conditions in wastewater treatment resilience refers to a system s capacity to minimize the loss of functionality related to the service failure magnitude and the recovery time related to duration taking into account the system s design life and considering exceptional operating conditions 3 46 47 the overall resilience of a wwtp system can be estimated by measuring the area between the initial system performance level p o and the actual system performance curve p f i t at any time t after the occurrence of a given threat fig 7 focusing on the system performance graph for each effluent parameter the overall resilience can be calculated by eq 12 to eq 14 3 12 re i 1 a i t p i 0 t n t 0 where re i is the system resilience concerning effluent parameter i under the considered threat human activities and a i is the area between the performance at the time of perturbation and initial state represented by the shaded area in fig 7 47 13 a i t o t p 0 i p i t dt t t 0 t n where t 0 is the start of perturbation in the system t n is when the system returns to its initial state p 0 is system s initial state in terms of performance and p i t is system performance at time t the probability of effluent discharge violation can be estimated by eq 14 14 p i t 1 g i t c s i t g i t if g i c i s 1 if g i c i s where p i t is system performance at time t which rescales the effluent concentration between 0 and 1 g i t is the output value effluent concentration at time t c s is the threshold maximum acceptable output at time t and i is the effluent parameter cod tn or tss overall resilience based on magnitude and duration can be integrated to assess the system s performance using eq 15 and eq 16 15 re i mag max t 1 v c i e c i s max t 1 v c i e 16 re i dur 1 max j 1 v t e j i t i j i t where re i mag and re i dur are resilience variables based on magnitude and duration respectively c e is the effluent concentration of parameter i at time t c s is the effluent limitation of parameter i ti j is the initial time of failure of parameter i in failure event j te j is the end time of failure for parameter i in failure event j t is the total duration of the unexpected event and v is the number of time steps the resilience assessment of bsm1 under faulty noisy and reconciled scenarios follows the schematic in fig 8 this validation aims to show the effects of faulty and noisy data on process performance and the effectiveness of soft sensor validation methods to reconcile faulty sensors in a resilient fashion over multiple failures 4 results and discussion 4 1 m city data preliminary analysis preliminary analyses were implemented to check the features of the m city data the red line hurst line indicates the actual tendency of the analyzed measurement sensors in contrast the green dashed line normal line is a reference line that traces a gaussian distribution tendency fig 9 the analysis of 720 measurements in the rescaled range analysis r l values does not fit the normality line and exhibits a non gaussian behavior the hurst index values for the four variables cod tp tn and ss were higher than 0 5 hi cod 0 6469 hi tp 0 6308 hi tn 0 5849 and hi ss 0 5469 indicating a persistent time dependency the calculated his represent positively correlated data thus data show clear signs of non gaussian distribution dynamism and accumulation of influent conditions measurements these analyses reveal that the measurements of influent conditions were complex and need to be evaluated using non linear methods to capture their intrinsic features 4 2 comparison analysis of monitoring techniques sdae based sensor validation advantages are based on comparisons with pca dpca ica dica and shallow autoencoders for the online monitoring of artificial faulty observations the sdae based spe confidence limit for fault detection was defined by the kde spe 0 05 4 89 considering the corruption introduced into the four wwtp sensors the fault detection performance of all the introduced methods including pca dpca ica dica ae sae dae and sdae is shown in fig 10 additionally numerical performance based on the dr is tabulated in table 3 figs 10 a and b depicts the fault detection performance of pca and dpca methods the advantage of the dpca method relies on considering the serial correlation between the measurements nevertheless both of these methods apply a linear transformation on their feature space the dr for each sensor utilizing pca ranges from 56 67 to 96 67 giving an average of 80 utilizing the spe statistic additionally the t 2 yielded a higher overall performance of 85 on the other hand the dpca method could detect 78 33 and 90 of faults utilizing the spe and t 2 statistics from this it can be observed that the dpca yielded a greater performance using the statistic constructed in the feature space similarly figs 10 c and d show the fault detection performance of ica and dica methods in the same way as the pca and dpca dica also incorporates a lagged component to consider the serial correlation of measurements in this case the ica method presented an overall detection performance of 84 17 and 48 33 for the spe and i 2 statistics being superior to the dica method using spe since it could reach 76 67 the contrary happened with the i 2 since based on this the dica method achieved 76 67 furthermore figs 10 e to h account for the neural approaches including the ae dae sae and sdae it can be observed that these methods showed superiority over the conventional static and dynamic methods when utilizing the spe statistic the overall fault detection performance ranged from 83 33 to 98 33 on the other hand when using the h 2 the overall detection performance ranged from 50 83 to 92 50 the ae method yielded the lowest performance for both statistics the performance for fault detection may be deteriorated due to the training procedure as in the regular ae structure the network learns how to create an exact copy of the input instead of discovering an effective way to recognize any erratic behavior and correct it on the contrary the sdae based fault detection showed the highest dr with 98 33 using the spe and 92 50 using the h 2 fig 10 h representing superior performance compared with the neural approaches and conventional methods for all the given faults the reason for the lower performance in conventional diagnosis methods is their susceptibility to disturbances their low capability in the extraction of the important features in raw data leads to biased results considering the detection statistics the h 2 statistic accounted for an improvement of approximately 10 and 42 for the dae and sdae in comparison to the non denoising methods respectively in most cases it can be observed that the spe statistic is more sensitive when capturing a more significant portion of faulty measurements in comparison to the t 2 i 2 and h 2 statistics thus the sdae method is superior to all the exposed methods it combines two valuable features 1 the noise added to the input on the training procedure and 2 the layer stacking for extracting more valuable information as adding noise to the input dataset improves the network s capability to recognize faulty behavior a stacking structure can extract a more robust feature representation four different fault magnitude percentage scenarios were studied to verify the proposed model s ability to detect small magnitude faults as explained in section 3 1 2 results of the overall detection rate for all scenarios are supplied in table 4 the sdae based fault detection showed a higher dr than the conventional methods even at a small percentage fault indicating that sdae based fault detection outperforms other conventional methods under these conditions at higher corruption levels i e 100 and 95 the fault detection procedure captured more than 90 faulty measurements for the lower fault percentage i e 80 and 75 the capability of detecting faults degraded progressively this implies that features such as nonlinearity and dynamism of multivariate influent condition data were captured even at small magnitudes of various types of faults the suggested method could identify approximately 74 14 of the faulty signals the fault detection performances of the different scenarios with the introduced methods are depicted graphically in figs s6 to s13 of the si after analyzing the fault detection performance faulty sensors must be identified by means of the svi which is depicted for each sensor in fig 11 it is expected that the svi goes below the limit of 0 5 for each period of faulty data an inspection of these plots shows that the sensor fault does not appear clearly in the pca driven svi plot fig 11 a despite that the overall dr 80 confirms the identification step s necessity this analysis demonstrates that the pca method presents difficulties when handling noisy and non gaussian influent data in contrast fig 11 b illustrates the svi computed for each sensor using the sdae method for which it can be observed that after introducing faulty signals from the 55th to the 84th samples of the tp sensor the svi showed a significant decrease under the established limit of 0 5 in contrast the remaining sensors tended to maintain an svi close to unity implying that the tp sensor was a corrupted sensor from the 55th to the 84th samples the same tendency with cod tn and ss sensors were observed when sdae based method was used in conclusion the svi plot based sdae successfully separates the faulty data from the four sensors normal operating regions this is mainly because the sdae can discover linear and non linear relationships in multivariate sensor data of wwtp and its capability to deal with noisy and non gaussian influent data once the capability of each method for fault detection and fault identification is assessed the reconstruction performance is evaluated using rmse mae and mape table 5 summarizes the reconciliation performance metrics for each method showing in bold the greatest reconciliation performance among all methods and metrics additionally fig 12 illustrates the produced reconciliation of each sensor using pca and sdae methods with the faulty and actual data also the reconciliation performance using ica dpca dica ae sae and dae methods is presented in fig s14 in the si the static models pca and ica showed the largest values in the tn sensor considering mape which yielded 41 72 and 49 32 for pca and ica respectively while for the rmse metric the ica based reconciliation showed the largest value 36 32 mgn l additionally the dynamic additions to the static methods dpca and dica showed greater performance than those of pca and ica in all sensors implying that considering the lagged augmented matrix aids in learning more accurate multivariate data behaviors the improvement given by the dpca over pca varies in a range of 4 48 to 95 considering all the metrics in the same way dica shows improvement over ica in a range of 9 32 to 82 93 for all metrics the neural approaches were assessed in the reconciliation task as well the metrics show that the sdae method produced the most suitable reconciliation among all the neural methods in terms of the introduced metrics the suitability of the proposed method for reconciling faulty measurements mainly relies on its ability to 1 learn non linear dependencies existing among the multiple variables in the process and 2 force the noisy data to be accurately sent to normal conditions for instance the ae and sae work with the same schema in which the input and output layers contain the same information making the network learn how to copy the input in addition the denoising variations of ae dae and sdae have a particularity in which the input receives a corrupted signal to be transformed to a noiseless signal therefore it is expected that these variations learn more patterns related to forcing the corrupted data into an accurate reconciled measurement it can be observed that the sae method outperformed the dae method as the sae stacked various layers and could learn a more suitable behavior of the data nevertheless the sdae method combines the special features of stacking layers for denoising purposes achieving superior performance over static and neural approaches with respect to the sae a relative improvement in all the metrics can be observed in a range from 9 71 to 96 23 4 3 resilience analysis to demonstrate the advantages of incorporating a sensor validation method to the monitoring of influent conditions in a wwtp an experiment was conducted in bsm1 scenario 1 influent conditions were defined for actual cod data noisy gaussian data faulty data complete failure and precision degradation and reconciled data from sdae which were evaluated by bsm1 as shown in fig 13 a the resilience estimated for the faulty measurements exhibited stable overall performance with relatively strong resilience in the period with non faulty measurements considering the lag of the response as shown in fig 13 b however the system s resilience dropped suddenly to below 0 7 at the complete failure period then recovered to an acceptable level indicating that the performance of the biological parameters was affected by the complete failure period precision degradation failure similarly affected the resilience of the system the system resilience fell to below 0 6 during this period after which it slowly recovered to 1 for the noisy gaussian data a varied low resilience was observed resilience values ranged from 0 85 to 1 and a periodic trend that followed similar periods to the gaussian noise in the influent can be seen in fig 13 a on the other hand for the system under reconciled data from sdae the system s overall resilience remained at 1 an acceptable level of biological parameters system performance in addition energy consumption and effluent quality index eqi were considered to evaluate the performance of the system fig 13 c shows the evaluation performance for scenario 1 the energy consumption and eqi were 4179 37 kwh day and 6123 02 kg poll units day under normal data energy consumption was increased to 4597 31 kwh day and 5433 18 kwh day under the noisy and faulty readings respectively whereas the eqi consequently decreased to 5510 72 kg poll units day and 4286 11 kg poll units day for noisy and faulty data respectively on the other hand under the reconciled data by the sdae model the energy consumption and eqi were 4221 17 kwh day and 6061 79 kg poll units day indicating the sdae model could force the abnormal data to the normal and achieving a sustainable balance between the energy consumption and the eqi by avoiding the loss of energy and meet the environmental standards thus the proper monitoring of the system s influent conditions would decrease the operation cost and meet the effluent discharge standards scenario 2 influent conditions were also evaluated by bsm1 scenario 2 was defined for actual cod data laplace noisy data faulty data precision degradation and bias failure and reconciliation data from sdae fig 14 a resilience for the system with faulty measurements remained acceptable during the non faulty measurements as shown in fig 14 b however the resilience dropped to below 0 85 and returned to normal after the precision degradation fault period similarly for the bias failure period system resilience dropped to below 0 6 besides when evaluating laplace noisy data resilience ranged from 0 85 to 1 showing a trend similar to scenario 1 as shown in fig 14 a for reconciled data the overall resilience improved and was maintained at 1 similar to scenario 1 energy consumption and eqi were utilized to evaluate the system s performance for scenario 2 fig 14 c shows the evaluation performance for scenario 2 under normal data the system showed an energy consumption of 4179 37 kwh day while the eqi was 6123 02 kg poll units day in the cases of noisy and faulty readings the energy consumption increased to 4634 92 kwh day and 5224 22 kwh day respectively therefore the eqi for noisy and faulty readings decreased to 5755 63 kg poll units day and 4592 26 kg poll units day on the other hand under the reconciled data by the sdae model the energy consumption and eqi were 4262 96 kwh day and 6000 56 kg poll units day indicating the sdae model could force the abnormal data to the normal and achieving a sustainable balance between the energy consumption and the eqi to demonstrate sdae based sensor validation s effectiveness comparing the two scenarios in terms of resilience was made based on area magnitude and duration fig 15 overall resilience of the reconciled signals for the two scenarios was close to normal with a value of 1 for the area magnitude and duration indicating a proper operation of the system on the other hand low overall resilience was obtained for the two fault scenarios when estimating resilience by duration and magnitude which delegate the treatment process s unstable operation fig 15 a and b show that the noisy signals led to longer periods of plant operation and indicated a resilience of less than 0 4 for scenario 1 and 0 3 for scenario 2 which reflects the need to improve influent conditions as part of aiming for a more resilient plant operation comparing resilience based on the area to the calculated resilience based on magnitude noisy faulty data were associated with the lowest plant resilience for both scenarios in scenario 1 the overall resilience based on magnitude was approximately 0 5 with the highest magnitude of violations for the plant s performance overall the resilience assessment by bsm1 under faulty and noisy influent data showed low resilience performance for both scenarios however the reconciled influent data improved the performance producing the highest resilience value the reconciled data from sdae outperformed the faulty data on the wwtp when analyzing its resilience for operational performance and discharge standards 5 conclusions in this paper multivariate data driven sensor validation methods were developed to monitor a wwtp s influent measurements this study s main contribution was to showcase the outperformance of the sdae based sensor self validation technique for increasing sensor reliability and plant operation that can be affected by disturbances in the wwtp environment the proposed approach builds a reference model offline using noisy multivariate data capturing non linear correlations embedded in multivariate data then it identified potential faults online by comparing monitoring indicators spe and svi derived from residuals given the limitations of conventional methods pca dpca ica and dica to effectively extract primary features from datasets in noisy conditions ae and dae models were additionally developed to improve extract features and obtain non faulty data values which were compared to the sdae furthermore the sensor model data was validated through experimentation using bsm1 as a wwtp framework for two scenarios demonstrating this methodology s implementation in wwtp monitoring modeling the sdae based sensor model outperformed other methods evaluated due to its ability to represent non linear correlations of the variables of the noisy influent measurements cod tp tn and ss contributing to an accurate model for a wwtp sensor s operation consequently sdae based fault detection performance was superior to conventional methods with a detection rate of 98 resilience assessment under faulty different noise and reconciled measurements was additionally carried out resilience metrics presented a comprehensive tool to evaluate the effects of noise and the faulty measurements on plant resilience by varying the violation s period and magnitude from these analyses it could be corroborated that the sdae based soft sensor validation proposed in this study can effectively improve influent measurements monitoring lower operating costs and ensure a high discharge effluent however one limitation that can be described is the need for further investigation to improve the sdae architecture given the assumption of fixed hyperparameters for the networks that may promote decay in the optimization procedure resulting in a local minima problem certain techniques such as hyperparameter optimization and the sliding window should be applied to obtain a realistic approximation to the sensors normal operating conditions declaration of competing interest

diclofenac dcf and divalent copper cu2 on the nitrogen removal enzyme activity and bacterial community from a sequencing batch reactor were examined dcf and or cu2 in the influent rendered the decrease of ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand elimination rates the combined inhibition impacts of cu2 and dcf on ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrite reductase nir and nitrate reductase nar contents exhibited synergetic and the amo and nor activities reduced levels were lower than nar and nir as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increment the decreased degrees of amo activities were higher than nor at different mixed cu2 and dcf concentrations the contents of reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase at the mixed cu2 and dcf stress were higher than those at the alone cu2 and dcf stress and they increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase in extracellular polymeric substances eps the content of protein pn was more easily affected by cu2 and mixed cu2 dcf than polysaccharide ps while pn and ps were both sensitive to the stress of dcf compared to seeding sludge the denitrifying bacteria and nitrifying bacteria relative abundance ratio was decreased at the stress of alone cu2 and dcf while the ratio was increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords diclofenac divalent copper combined impacts nitrogen removal enzyme activity 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a kind of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs that could cure ache and inflammation and it has been commonly used in human and animal medicine 1 the annual global dcf consumption is about 1400 tons 2 the unordered use of dcf results in the frequent detection of dcf in municipal wastewater treatment systems 3 4 and its presence could inhibit the removal of pollutants such as organic matters and nitrogen et al in a wastewater treatment system due to its toxicity to organisms metabolisms even at low concentration 5 divalent copper ion cu2 is one of the usual heavy metals contaminants in municipal wastewater treatment systems 6 and it has negative impacts on the wastewater treatment system performance 7 many studies have reported that single dcf or heavy metals could significantly change the contaminants removal bacterial activity and community in a biological wastewater treatment system tables a 1 and a 2 however dcf could bind heavy metal ions through its deprotonic functional groups to form the complexes of heavy metals and dcf and the complexes toxicity to cells differentiates from that of single heavy metals and dcf 8 9 alisir et al 10 found the combination of dcf and silver enhanced the antibacterial properties of dcf against intestinal bacteria such as entrococcus faecalis and escherichia coli refat et al 11 observed the dcf inhibition on intestinal bacteria bacillus subtilis as the addition of mercury dimiza et al 12 found cu2 could increase the dcf bacterial toxicity due to the dna break by the dcf and cu2 complexation the above results suggest the joint influence of cu2 and dcf on the performance of wastewater treatment system might be different from the impact of alone dcf and cu2 and the investigation on the combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on the biological wastewater treatment system performance is essential wang et al 13 reported the combined impacts of zinc and dcf on the organic matters removal in a sequencing batch reactor sbr and found that mixed zinc and dcf had synergistic effects on the chemical oxygen demand cod removal although some researchers have paid close attention to the joint toxicity of dcf and heavy metals on the biological wastewater treatment system performance and relevant information remains very little meanwhile they mostly focus on the organic matters removal in a sbr under the joint stress of dcf and heavy metals and few researches investigate on the joint impacts of dcf and heavy metals on the nitrogen removal bacterial community and enzyme activity in a sbr this study mainly aims to explore the joint impact of cu2 and dcf a on the nitrogen and organic matters removal b on nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes activities c on the contents of reactive oxygen species ros and lactate dehydrogenase ldh d on the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents from loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps e on bacterial community in a sbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and wastewater in the study five plexiglass sbrs a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were set up and their volume exchange rate and working volume height and internal diameter and were 50 7 7 l 50 cm and 14 cm respectively the five sbrs were operated four cycles per day under the same operating conditions and one cycle was 6 h including 0 05 h influent 3 6 h aerobic period 1 8 h anoxic period 0 5 h precipitation and 0 05 h drainage the dissolved oxygen concentrations in aerobic and anoxic periods were more than 2 0 mg l 1 and less than 0 5 mg l 1 respectively in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 the seeding sludge was taken from a sbr that was ran without the stress of cu2 and dcf for a month in our laboratory and the initial mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss in the five sbrs were about 2500 mg l 1 the synthetic wastewaters fed into a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 contained 500 mg l 1 cod 40 mg l 1 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 10 mg l 1 phosphorus po4 3 p and different concentrations of cu2 and dcf and the cu2 and dcf concentrations in the influent from a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were varied in accordance with the plan in table a 3 2 2 measuring methods the nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n cod mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were checked in accordance with chinese n e p a 14 the determinations of ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrite reductase nir nitrate reductase nar were carried out in accordance with deng et al 15 the bacterial community was tested by personalbio company shanghai china through the high throughput sequencing 16 tb eps and lb eps were acquired in accordance with wang et al 17 the pn and ps levels were estimated according as lowry method 18 and as anthrone sulfuric acid method 19 respectively the ros and ldh contents were estimated according as deng et al 15 2 3 statistical analysis data were evaluated through the one way analysis of variance with tukey test using origin software version 2015 and p 0 05 was considered as a statistical significance the data were shown as means standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on the sbr performance the joint impacts of cu2 and dcf on the cod and nitrogen eliminations in sbrs are exhibited in fig 1 in a1 a2 and a3 the mean rates of cod removal were 88 88 66 98 and 62 05 respectively and the mean elimination rates of nh4 n were 76 80 96 92 and 59 34 respectively the cod and nh4 n elimination rates in a1 and a2 were higher than those in a3 indicating the impacts of combined cu2 dcf on the cod and nh4 n elimination were synergetic the mean cod and nh4 n elimination rates in a4 exhibited 58 89 and 51 30 respectively and those in a5 exhibited 32 67 and 46 73 respectively among a3 a4 and a5 the highest mean elimination rates of cod and nh4 n were from a3 while their lowest values were from a4 the changes indicated the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase enhanced their inhibitions on the sbr performance the mean cod removal rate in a3 and a4 were higher than that of nh4 n while the opposite results could be observed in a5 that the mean nh4 n removal rate exhibited higher than cod dcf was refractory organic 13 and the dcf concentration in a5 was higher than that in a3 and a4 this might explain why the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase was not beneficial for the cod removal compared to nh4 n in a5 the mean concentrations of no3 n in the effluent from a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 6 67 7 17 5 55 4 02 and 3 69 mg l 1 respectively the mean effluent no3 n level in a3 was lower than that in a1 and a2 indicating the impacts of joint cu2 and dcf on the no3 n removal were synergetic among a3 a4 and a5 the mean effluent no3 n levels decreased as the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase which were bound up with the nh4 n removal rate decrease in the effluent from a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 no2 n was significantly not accumulated 3 2 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on enzyme activities fig 2 exhibits the nitrification and denitrification enzymes activities variations under the cu2 and or dcf stress in seeding sludge excluding cu2 and dcf the amo nor nar and nir activities exhibited 0 45 0 92 0 58 and 7 28 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively in a1 the amo nor nar and nir activities exhibited 0 29 0 76 0 46 and 4 22 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively and they decreased by 35 56 17 39 20 69 and 42 03 respectively compared with seeding sludge the enzymatic activities decrease was related to the cu2 toxicity to nitrifiers and denitrifiers 20 ouyang et al 21 discovered that cu2 inhibited the amoa transcription functional gene from ammonia oxidizing bacteria more significantly than nxrb functional marker gene from nitrite oxidizing bacteria which could explain why the decreased degree of amo was higher than nor in a1 the inhibitory effect of cu2 on nir was more significant than on nar suggesting that nitrate reducing bacteria had a greater tolerance to cu2 than nitrite reducing bacteria li et al 22 found similar variations that the nar decreased degree activity was lower than nir at a cu2 stress the amo nor nar and nir activities from a2 exhibited 0 41 0 84 0 51 and 7 07 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively and they declined by 8 89 8 70 12 07 and 2 88 respectively compared with seeding sludge the amo nor nar and nir values decline in a2 suggested dcf was toxic to nitrifiers and denitrifiers amo had a higher reduced level than nor in a2 indicating ammonia oxidizing bacteria was more vulnerable to dcf than nitrite oxidizing bacteria previous researcher illustrated similar results that the decreased level of ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance was higher than nitrite oxidizing bacteria at a stress of non steroidal anti inflammatory drug 23 the decreased degree of nar activity was higher than that of nir suggesting that nitrate reducing bacteria was more sensitive to dcf than nitrite reducing bacteria the results were similar to the discovery of yu et al 24 in which ampicillin exerted higher inhibition actions on nitrate reducing bacteria than nitrite reducing bacteria the amo nor nar and nir levels from a3 exhibited 0 27 0 60 0 34 and 3 20 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively in comparison to seeding sludge the amo nor nar and nir values from a3 declined by 40 00 34 78 41 38 and 56 04 respectively and their decreased degrees in a3 were higher than those in a1 and a2 which revealed that mixed cu2 and dcf had synergistic impacts on amo nor nar and nir the changes could be explained by that dcf could combine with cu2 ions via the amino hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups presented on it and the bioavailability and the enzyme activity inhibition efficiency of cu2 dcf complexes were higher than free cu2 ions and dcf 25 26 the amo activity reduced level was higher than nor which demonstrated that ammonia oxidizing bacteria was more easily inhibited by mixed cu2 dcf compared with nitrite oxidizing bacteria similar the nir activity reduced degree was higher than nar suggesting that the inhibitory action of mixed cu2 and dcf on nitrite reducing bacteria was stronger than nitrate reducing bacteria although no literature focused on the combined impacts of dcf and metal ions on nitrification and denitrification enzymes activities the joint impacts of other pharmaceuticals and metal ions on nitrifiers and denitrifiers had been reported similar results in many studies they found that the tetracycline and cu2 or divalent zinc mixture had higher inhibitions on ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite reducing bacteria compared to nitrite oxidizing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria respectively 27 28 however li et al 29 reported contrary results that the inhibition of cu2 and oxytetracycline on nitrite oxidizing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria was more obvious than ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite reducing bacteria respectively previous results were not always coincident suggesting that the changes of pharmaceuticals and metals mixture composition could affect their joint toxicity on bacteria the values of amo nor nar and nir from a4 exhibited 0 19 0 58 0 22 and 3 00 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively and they from a5 were 0 16 0 42 0 21 and 2 47 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively the amo nor nar and nir values from a4 and a5 exhibited lower than those in a3 which was related to the increase of mixed cu2 dcf toxicity as the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase the amo nor nar and nir decreased levels in a4 exhibited 57 10 37 19 61 57 and 58 79 compared with seeding sludge respectively and they in a5 were 63 73 54 39 64 17 and 66 14 respectively among a3 a4 and a5 the nar and nir reduced levels always exhibited more obvious than amo and nor which suggested denitrifying bacteria were more easily inhibited by mixed cu2 dcf than nitrifying bacteria the changes were similar to the results of wang et al 27 that denitrifiers were more susceptible to the mixture of cu2 and tetracycline compared to nitrifiers the decreased degrees of amo activities in a3 a4 and a5 were always higher than nor suggesting that compared to ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria had greater tolerances to mixed cu2 dcf and was not affected by the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase the different results were found in the changes of nar and nir activities from a3 a4 and a5 in a3 the nar decreased degree was significantly lower than nir while in a4 and a5 the difference of reduced levels between nar and nir evidently shrank the results suggested that the tolerance of nitrate reducing bacteria and nitrite reducing bacteria to mixed cu2 dcf could be affected by the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase the nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria responses to the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase were different which need to be studied in the further 3 3 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on ros and ldh the combined impacts of cu2 and dcf on the ros and ldh contents are exhibited in fig 3 ros was produced as a harmful by product in cell metabolism 13 and its excessive accumulation could affect cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis by damaging dna and inhibiting certain essential enzymatic activities 30 compared with seeding sludge the relative ros contents in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 135 6 88 72 159 15 165 22 and 173 65 respectively the ros content in a1 with 10 mg l 1 cu2 was more than that in seeding sludge which was bound up with the fact that cu2 as an active redox metal could stimulate bacteria produce excess ros 31 opposite changes were found in a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf the ros content in a2 was decreased by 11 28 compared with seeding sludge żur et al 32 found that the double bond structure of dcf was beneficial to its reaction with ros which was one of the reasons for the ros level decrease under a 30 mg l 1 dcf stress in a2 the ros content from a3 exhibited more than from a1 and from a2 the changes indicated that the mixed cu2 dcf toxicity to bacteria was stronger than alone cu2 and dcf among a3 a4 and a5 the ros content in a3 was the lowest while the highest value was found in a5 the results suggested the increase of mixed cu2 and dcf toxicity to bacteria as the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase was related to the changes of ros content the ldh content was an indicator to evaluate cell membrane integrity that affected microbial functions 15 compared with seeding sludge the relative ldh content in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 112 06 101 50 121 11 134 17 and 144 72 respectively the increase of ldh release indicated that the cell integrity was destroyed 33 the ldh release in a3 exhibited more than that in a1 and a2 indicating the mixed cu2 dcf damage on cell membrane integrity was more serious than single cu2 and dcf among a3 a4 and a5 the ldh release increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase indicating the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase had more serious damages on cell membrane integrity the ros and ldh contents in a3 were higher than those in a1 and a2 which might explained why mixed cu2 and dcf had synergistic actions on nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities 3 4 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on pn and ps levels from eps the joint impacts of cu2 and dcf on the pn and ps levels from lb eps and tb eps are exhibited in fig 4 in seeding sludge without cu2 and dcf the pn and ps contents from lb eps exhibited 15 86 and 38 19 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 47 09 and 106 22 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps levels from lb eps in a1 were 42 02 and 53 05 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from a2 were 18 85 and 44 18 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps contents from tb eps in a1 were 88 03 and 123 07 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf were 53 71 and 115 96 mg g 1 vss respectively eps was a chemical compound produced by macromolecular cell lysis and microbial secretion and it could protect cells from the damage of toxic substrates 34 the pn and ps levels increase from lb eps and tb eps as the cu2 or dcf addition was related to the bacterial response to the stress of cu2 or dcf 13 27 the pn and ps levels from lb eps in a3 exhibited 47 12 and 65 61 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 105 09 and 166 67 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps contents of lb eps and tb eps from a3 were higher than those from a1 and a2 this could be explained by that the inhibitory action of mixed cu2 and dcf on bacterial activities was synergistic the pn ps ratios of lb eps and tb eps from seeding sludge were 0 42 and 0 44 respectively the pn ps ratios of lb eps and tb eps from a1 were 0 79 and 0 72 respectively and they in a3 exhibited 0 72 and 0 63 respectively eps contained heat shock like proteins and metal ions reductase that altered metals forms and valence states and the changes could weaken the metals toxicity to bacteria 35 this could explain why the pn ps ratio in a1 and a3 significantly increased compared to seeding sludge more significant increase of pn ps ratio from lb eps was found in comparison to tb eps indicating pn from lb eps had more primary roles in protecting cells from the damage of cu2 and mixed cu2 dcf than that from tb eps the pn ps ratios in lb eps and tb eps from a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf were 0 43 and 0 46 respectively and they were not significantly different from seeding sludge the results showed that pn and ps were both susceptive to the dcf stress the pn and ps contents of lb eps from a4 exhibited 53 67 and 69 53 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 111 05 and 174 59 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps contents of lb eps from a5 exhibited 63 56 and 77 96 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 130 44 and 178 27 mg g 1 vss respectively in a4 the pn ps ratios of lb eps and tb eps exhibited 0 77 and 0 64 respectively and they in a5 were 0 82 and 0 73 respectively among a3 a4 and a5 the pn and ps contents and the pn ps ratios from lb eps and tb eps rose as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase and the pn ps ratios increase from lb eps was more evident than from tb eps the changes indicated that the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase did not change the role of eps in the bacterial response to the mixed cu2 dcf stress 3 5 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on bacterial community the joint impacts of cu2 and dcf on bacterial diversity shannon and simpson and richness chao1 and ace are exhibited in table 1 good s coverage of different samples all exhibited higher than 0 993 suggesting the sequence libraries were able to cover bacterial diversity in seeding sludge without cu2 and dcf the chao1 ace shannon and simpson values exhibited 1023 1086 6 86 and 0 98 respectively in a1 with 10 mg l 1 cu2 the chao1 ace shannon and simpson levels exhibited 1000 1000 7 48 and 0 98 respectively compared to seeding sludge the simpson index in a1 did not change and the shannon index was increased while the values of chao1 and ace in a1 was decreased the changes suggested that the stress of 10 mg l 1 cu2 could cause the richness decrease and the diversity increase in bacterial community similarly in a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf the chao1 ace shannon and simpson levels exhibited 1022 1039 7 21 and 0 97 respectively suggesting that bacterial richness decreased while its diversity increased as the injection of 30 mg l 1 dcf the chao1 ace shannon and simpson values in a3 exhibited 887 887 7 09 and 0 97 respectively among a1 a2 and a3 the increase in the values of chao1 and ace in a3 was the most significant nevertheless the shannon and simpson changes in a3 exhibited the least the changes indicated bacterial community at the mixed cu2 dcf stress had lower richness and diversity compared with the alone cu2 or dcf stress which might be bound up with the synergistic inhibitions of mixed cu2 dcf on bacteria the values of chao1 ace shannon and simpson in a4 were 940 940 6 36 and 0 94 respectively and they in a5 were 696 710 6 18 and 0 95 respectively compared to a3 activated sludge from a4 had higher bacterial richness and lower bacterial diversity while bacterial diversity and richness in a5 were both lower the changes showed that the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase had different impacts on bacterial richness and diversity and it need to be studied in the further the nitrifiers and denitrifiers under different cu2 and or dcf concentrations were examined at the level of genus fig 5 the genera dechloromonas 36 pseudomonas 37 dokdonella 38 delftia 39 escherichia shigella 7 mesorhizobium 40 pseudoxanthomonas 41 rhodobacter 28 zoogloea 38 stenotrophomonas 42 and thermomonas 43 were denitrifying bacteria and the sum of their relative abundances in seeding sludge a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 68 22 60 71 61 54 46 05 38 26 and 32 30 respectively compared with seeding sludge the total denitrifying bacteria relative abundances in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were lower suggesting that cu2 and or dcf could inhibit the growth of denitrifiers the genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira were ammonia oxidizing bacteria 44 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria 28 and they belonged to nitrifying bacteria the sum of nitrifying bacteria relative abundances in seeding sludge a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 1 33 4 04 5 49 0 81 0 53 and 0 38 respectively the relative abundance ratio of denitrifiers and nitrifiers in seeding sludge a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 51 12 15 01 11 20 56 96 72 50 and 85 00 respectively compared with seeding sludge the relative abundance ratio between denitrifying bacteria and nitrifying bacteria in a1 and a2 decreased suggesting that the nitrifiers population decreased level was lower than denitrifiers at the alone cu2 and dcf stress in a3 a4 and a5 the relative abundance ratio of denitrifiers and nitrifiers was higher than that in seeding sludge and it increased as the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase the changes suggested that denitrifying bacteria had greater tolerances to mixed cu2 dcf than nitrifying bacteria as the component of synthetic wastewaters in the study was simpler than real wastewaters the combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on the nitrogen removal bacterial activity and community from a real scale biological wastewater treatment reactor need to be examined in the further 4 conclusions the nh4 n and cod elimination rates decreased as the injection of cu2 and or dcf in the influent combined cu2 and dcf had synergetic inhibition impacts on the changes of amo nar nir and nor activities the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase had more impacts on nar and amo than nir and nor the ros and ldh contents at the mixed cu2 and dcf stress were higher than those at the alone cu2 or dcf stress and they increased as the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase in eps pn and ps were sensitive to the stress of dcf while pn was more easily affected by cu2 and mixed cu2 dcf than ps compared with seeding sludge the relative abundance ratio between denitrifying bacteria and nitrifying bacteria decreased at an alone stress of cu2 or dcf while the ratio increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf

diclofenac dcf and divalent copper cu2 on the nitrogen removal enzyme activity and bacterial community from a sequencing batch reactor were examined dcf and or cu2 in the influent rendered the decrease of ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand elimination rates the combined inhibition impacts of cu2 and dcf on ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrite reductase nir and nitrate reductase nar contents exhibited synergetic and the amo and nor activities reduced levels were lower than nar and nir as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increment the decreased degrees of amo activities were higher than nor at different mixed cu2 and dcf concentrations the contents of reactive oxygen species and lactate dehydrogenase at the mixed cu2 and dcf stress were higher than those at the alone cu2 and dcf stress and they increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase in extracellular polymeric substances eps the content of protein pn was more easily affected by cu2 and mixed cu2 dcf than polysaccharide ps while pn and ps were both sensitive to the stress of dcf compared to seeding sludge the denitrifying bacteria and nitrifying bacteria relative abundance ratio was decreased at the stress of alone cu2 and dcf while the ratio was increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords diclofenac divalent copper combined impacts nitrogen removal enzyme activity 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a kind of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs that could cure ache and inflammation and it has been commonly used in human and animal medicine 1 the annual global dcf consumption is about 1400 tons 2 the unordered use of dcf results in the frequent detection of dcf in municipal wastewater treatment systems 3 4 and its presence could inhibit the removal of pollutants such as organic matters and nitrogen et al in a wastewater treatment system due to its toxicity to organisms metabolisms even at low concentration 5 divalent copper ion cu2 is one of the usual heavy metals contaminants in municipal wastewater treatment systems 6 and it has negative impacts on the wastewater treatment system performance 7 many studies have reported that single dcf or heavy metals could significantly change the contaminants removal bacterial activity and community in a biological wastewater treatment system tables a 1 and a 2 however dcf could bind heavy metal ions through its deprotonic functional groups to form the complexes of heavy metals and dcf and the complexes toxicity to cells differentiates from that of single heavy metals and dcf 8 9 alisir et al 10 found the combination of dcf and silver enhanced the antibacterial properties of dcf against intestinal bacteria such as entrococcus faecalis and escherichia coli refat et al 11 observed the dcf inhibition on intestinal bacteria bacillus subtilis as the addition of mercury dimiza et al 12 found cu2 could increase the dcf bacterial toxicity due to the dna break by the dcf and cu2 complexation the above results suggest the joint influence of cu2 and dcf on the performance of wastewater treatment system might be different from the impact of alone dcf and cu2 and the investigation on the combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on the biological wastewater treatment system performance is essential wang et al 13 reported the combined impacts of zinc and dcf on the organic matters removal in a sequencing batch reactor sbr and found that mixed zinc and dcf had synergistic effects on the chemical oxygen demand cod removal although some researchers have paid close attention to the joint toxicity of dcf and heavy metals on the biological wastewater treatment system performance and relevant information remains very little meanwhile they mostly focus on the organic matters removal in a sbr under the joint stress of dcf and heavy metals and few researches investigate on the joint impacts of dcf and heavy metals on the nitrogen removal bacterial community and enzyme activity in a sbr this study mainly aims to explore the joint impact of cu2 and dcf a on the nitrogen and organic matters removal b on nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes activities c on the contents of reactive oxygen species ros and lactate dehydrogenase ldh d on the protein pn and polysaccharide ps contents from loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps e on bacterial community in a sbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and wastewater in the study five plexiglass sbrs a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were set up and their volume exchange rate and working volume height and internal diameter and were 50 7 7 l 50 cm and 14 cm respectively the five sbrs were operated four cycles per day under the same operating conditions and one cycle was 6 h including 0 05 h influent 3 6 h aerobic period 1 8 h anoxic period 0 5 h precipitation and 0 05 h drainage the dissolved oxygen concentrations in aerobic and anoxic periods were more than 2 0 mg l 1 and less than 0 5 mg l 1 respectively in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 the seeding sludge was taken from a sbr that was ran without the stress of cu2 and dcf for a month in our laboratory and the initial mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss in the five sbrs were about 2500 mg l 1 the synthetic wastewaters fed into a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 contained 500 mg l 1 cod 40 mg l 1 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n 10 mg l 1 phosphorus po4 3 p and different concentrations of cu2 and dcf and the cu2 and dcf concentrations in the influent from a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were varied in accordance with the plan in table a 3 2 2 measuring methods the nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n cod mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were checked in accordance with chinese n e p a 14 the determinations of ammonia monooxygenase amo nitrite oxidoreductase nor nitrite reductase nir nitrate reductase nar were carried out in accordance with deng et al 15 the bacterial community was tested by personalbio company shanghai china through the high throughput sequencing 16 tb eps and lb eps were acquired in accordance with wang et al 17 the pn and ps levels were estimated according as lowry method 18 and as anthrone sulfuric acid method 19 respectively the ros and ldh contents were estimated according as deng et al 15 2 3 statistical analysis data were evaluated through the one way analysis of variance with tukey test using origin software version 2015 and p 0 05 was considered as a statistical significance the data were shown as means standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on the sbr performance the joint impacts of cu2 and dcf on the cod and nitrogen eliminations in sbrs are exhibited in fig 1 in a1 a2 and a3 the mean rates of cod removal were 88 88 66 98 and 62 05 respectively and the mean elimination rates of nh4 n were 76 80 96 92 and 59 34 respectively the cod and nh4 n elimination rates in a1 and a2 were higher than those in a3 indicating the impacts of combined cu2 dcf on the cod and nh4 n elimination were synergetic the mean cod and nh4 n elimination rates in a4 exhibited 58 89 and 51 30 respectively and those in a5 exhibited 32 67 and 46 73 respectively among a3 a4 and a5 the highest mean elimination rates of cod and nh4 n were from a3 while their lowest values were from a4 the changes indicated the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase enhanced their inhibitions on the sbr performance the mean cod removal rate in a3 and a4 were higher than that of nh4 n while the opposite results could be observed in a5 that the mean nh4 n removal rate exhibited higher than cod dcf was refractory organic 13 and the dcf concentration in a5 was higher than that in a3 and a4 this might explain why the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase was not beneficial for the cod removal compared to nh4 n in a5 the mean concentrations of no3 n in the effluent from a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 6 67 7 17 5 55 4 02 and 3 69 mg l 1 respectively the mean effluent no3 n level in a3 was lower than that in a1 and a2 indicating the impacts of joint cu2 and dcf on the no3 n removal were synergetic among a3 a4 and a5 the mean effluent no3 n levels decreased as the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase which were bound up with the nh4 n removal rate decrease in the effluent from a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 no2 n was significantly not accumulated 3 2 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on enzyme activities fig 2 exhibits the nitrification and denitrification enzymes activities variations under the cu2 and or dcf stress in seeding sludge excluding cu2 and dcf the amo nor nar and nir activities exhibited 0 45 0 92 0 58 and 7 28 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively in a1 the amo nor nar and nir activities exhibited 0 29 0 76 0 46 and 4 22 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively and they decreased by 35 56 17 39 20 69 and 42 03 respectively compared with seeding sludge the enzymatic activities decrease was related to the cu2 toxicity to nitrifiers and denitrifiers 20 ouyang et al 21 discovered that cu2 inhibited the amoa transcription functional gene from ammonia oxidizing bacteria more significantly than nxrb functional marker gene from nitrite oxidizing bacteria which could explain why the decreased degree of amo was higher than nor in a1 the inhibitory effect of cu2 on nir was more significant than on nar suggesting that nitrate reducing bacteria had a greater tolerance to cu2 than nitrite reducing bacteria li et al 22 found similar variations that the nar decreased degree activity was lower than nir at a cu2 stress the amo nor nar and nir activities from a2 exhibited 0 41 0 84 0 51 and 7 07 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively and they declined by 8 89 8 70 12 07 and 2 88 respectively compared with seeding sludge the amo nor nar and nir values decline in a2 suggested dcf was toxic to nitrifiers and denitrifiers amo had a higher reduced level than nor in a2 indicating ammonia oxidizing bacteria was more vulnerable to dcf than nitrite oxidizing bacteria previous researcher illustrated similar results that the decreased level of ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance was higher than nitrite oxidizing bacteria at a stress of non steroidal anti inflammatory drug 23 the decreased degree of nar activity was higher than that of nir suggesting that nitrate reducing bacteria was more sensitive to dcf than nitrite reducing bacteria the results were similar to the discovery of yu et al 24 in which ampicillin exerted higher inhibition actions on nitrate reducing bacteria than nitrite reducing bacteria the amo nor nar and nir levels from a3 exhibited 0 27 0 60 0 34 and 3 20 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively in comparison to seeding sludge the amo nor nar and nir values from a3 declined by 40 00 34 78 41 38 and 56 04 respectively and their decreased degrees in a3 were higher than those in a1 and a2 which revealed that mixed cu2 and dcf had synergistic impacts on amo nor nar and nir the changes could be explained by that dcf could combine with cu2 ions via the amino hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups presented on it and the bioavailability and the enzyme activity inhibition efficiency of cu2 dcf complexes were higher than free cu2 ions and dcf 25 26 the amo activity reduced level was higher than nor which demonstrated that ammonia oxidizing bacteria was more easily inhibited by mixed cu2 dcf compared with nitrite oxidizing bacteria similar the nir activity reduced degree was higher than nar suggesting that the inhibitory action of mixed cu2 and dcf on nitrite reducing bacteria was stronger than nitrate reducing bacteria although no literature focused on the combined impacts of dcf and metal ions on nitrification and denitrification enzymes activities the joint impacts of other pharmaceuticals and metal ions on nitrifiers and denitrifiers had been reported similar results in many studies they found that the tetracycline and cu2 or divalent zinc mixture had higher inhibitions on ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite reducing bacteria compared to nitrite oxidizing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria respectively 27 28 however li et al 29 reported contrary results that the inhibition of cu2 and oxytetracycline on nitrite oxidizing bacteria and nitrate reducing bacteria was more obvious than ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite reducing bacteria respectively previous results were not always coincident suggesting that the changes of pharmaceuticals and metals mixture composition could affect their joint toxicity on bacteria the values of amo nor nar and nir from a4 exhibited 0 19 0 58 0 22 and 3 00 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively and they from a5 were 0 16 0 42 0 21 and 2 47 μg n mg 1 pn min 1 respectively the amo nor nar and nir values from a4 and a5 exhibited lower than those in a3 which was related to the increase of mixed cu2 dcf toxicity as the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase the amo nor nar and nir decreased levels in a4 exhibited 57 10 37 19 61 57 and 58 79 compared with seeding sludge respectively and they in a5 were 63 73 54 39 64 17 and 66 14 respectively among a3 a4 and a5 the nar and nir reduced levels always exhibited more obvious than amo and nor which suggested denitrifying bacteria were more easily inhibited by mixed cu2 dcf than nitrifying bacteria the changes were similar to the results of wang et al 27 that denitrifiers were more susceptible to the mixture of cu2 and tetracycline compared to nitrifiers the decreased degrees of amo activities in a3 a4 and a5 were always higher than nor suggesting that compared to ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria had greater tolerances to mixed cu2 dcf and was not affected by the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase the different results were found in the changes of nar and nir activities from a3 a4 and a5 in a3 the nar decreased degree was significantly lower than nir while in a4 and a5 the difference of reduced levels between nar and nir evidently shrank the results suggested that the tolerance of nitrate reducing bacteria and nitrite reducing bacteria to mixed cu2 dcf could be affected by the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase the nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria responses to the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase were different which need to be studied in the further 3 3 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on ros and ldh the combined impacts of cu2 and dcf on the ros and ldh contents are exhibited in fig 3 ros was produced as a harmful by product in cell metabolism 13 and its excessive accumulation could affect cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis by damaging dna and inhibiting certain essential enzymatic activities 30 compared with seeding sludge the relative ros contents in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 135 6 88 72 159 15 165 22 and 173 65 respectively the ros content in a1 with 10 mg l 1 cu2 was more than that in seeding sludge which was bound up with the fact that cu2 as an active redox metal could stimulate bacteria produce excess ros 31 opposite changes were found in a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf the ros content in a2 was decreased by 11 28 compared with seeding sludge żur et al 32 found that the double bond structure of dcf was beneficial to its reaction with ros which was one of the reasons for the ros level decrease under a 30 mg l 1 dcf stress in a2 the ros content from a3 exhibited more than from a1 and from a2 the changes indicated that the mixed cu2 dcf toxicity to bacteria was stronger than alone cu2 and dcf among a3 a4 and a5 the ros content in a3 was the lowest while the highest value was found in a5 the results suggested the increase of mixed cu2 and dcf toxicity to bacteria as the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase was related to the changes of ros content the ldh content was an indicator to evaluate cell membrane integrity that affected microbial functions 15 compared with seeding sludge the relative ldh content in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 112 06 101 50 121 11 134 17 and 144 72 respectively the increase of ldh release indicated that the cell integrity was destroyed 33 the ldh release in a3 exhibited more than that in a1 and a2 indicating the mixed cu2 dcf damage on cell membrane integrity was more serious than single cu2 and dcf among a3 a4 and a5 the ldh release increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase indicating the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase had more serious damages on cell membrane integrity the ros and ldh contents in a3 were higher than those in a1 and a2 which might explained why mixed cu2 and dcf had synergistic actions on nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities 3 4 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on pn and ps levels from eps the joint impacts of cu2 and dcf on the pn and ps levels from lb eps and tb eps are exhibited in fig 4 in seeding sludge without cu2 and dcf the pn and ps contents from lb eps exhibited 15 86 and 38 19 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 47 09 and 106 22 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps levels from lb eps in a1 were 42 02 and 53 05 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from a2 were 18 85 and 44 18 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps contents from tb eps in a1 were 88 03 and 123 07 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf were 53 71 and 115 96 mg g 1 vss respectively eps was a chemical compound produced by macromolecular cell lysis and microbial secretion and it could protect cells from the damage of toxic substrates 34 the pn and ps levels increase from lb eps and tb eps as the cu2 or dcf addition was related to the bacterial response to the stress of cu2 or dcf 13 27 the pn and ps levels from lb eps in a3 exhibited 47 12 and 65 61 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 105 09 and 166 67 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps contents of lb eps and tb eps from a3 were higher than those from a1 and a2 this could be explained by that the inhibitory action of mixed cu2 and dcf on bacterial activities was synergistic the pn ps ratios of lb eps and tb eps from seeding sludge were 0 42 and 0 44 respectively the pn ps ratios of lb eps and tb eps from a1 were 0 79 and 0 72 respectively and they in a3 exhibited 0 72 and 0 63 respectively eps contained heat shock like proteins and metal ions reductase that altered metals forms and valence states and the changes could weaken the metals toxicity to bacteria 35 this could explain why the pn ps ratio in a1 and a3 significantly increased compared to seeding sludge more significant increase of pn ps ratio from lb eps was found in comparison to tb eps indicating pn from lb eps had more primary roles in protecting cells from the damage of cu2 and mixed cu2 dcf than that from tb eps the pn ps ratios in lb eps and tb eps from a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf were 0 43 and 0 46 respectively and they were not significantly different from seeding sludge the results showed that pn and ps were both susceptive to the dcf stress the pn and ps contents of lb eps from a4 exhibited 53 67 and 69 53 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 111 05 and 174 59 mg g 1 vss respectively the pn and ps contents of lb eps from a5 exhibited 63 56 and 77 96 mg g 1 vss respectively and they from tb eps exhibited 130 44 and 178 27 mg g 1 vss respectively in a4 the pn ps ratios of lb eps and tb eps exhibited 0 77 and 0 64 respectively and they in a5 were 0 82 and 0 73 respectively among a3 a4 and a5 the pn and ps contents and the pn ps ratios from lb eps and tb eps rose as the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase and the pn ps ratios increase from lb eps was more evident than from tb eps the changes indicated that the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase did not change the role of eps in the bacterial response to the mixed cu2 dcf stress 3 5 combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on bacterial community the joint impacts of cu2 and dcf on bacterial diversity shannon and simpson and richness chao1 and ace are exhibited in table 1 good s coverage of different samples all exhibited higher than 0 993 suggesting the sequence libraries were able to cover bacterial diversity in seeding sludge without cu2 and dcf the chao1 ace shannon and simpson values exhibited 1023 1086 6 86 and 0 98 respectively in a1 with 10 mg l 1 cu2 the chao1 ace shannon and simpson levels exhibited 1000 1000 7 48 and 0 98 respectively compared to seeding sludge the simpson index in a1 did not change and the shannon index was increased while the values of chao1 and ace in a1 was decreased the changes suggested that the stress of 10 mg l 1 cu2 could cause the richness decrease and the diversity increase in bacterial community similarly in a2 with 30 mg l 1 dcf the chao1 ace shannon and simpson levels exhibited 1022 1039 7 21 and 0 97 respectively suggesting that bacterial richness decreased while its diversity increased as the injection of 30 mg l 1 dcf the chao1 ace shannon and simpson values in a3 exhibited 887 887 7 09 and 0 97 respectively among a1 a2 and a3 the increase in the values of chao1 and ace in a3 was the most significant nevertheless the shannon and simpson changes in a3 exhibited the least the changes indicated bacterial community at the mixed cu2 dcf stress had lower richness and diversity compared with the alone cu2 or dcf stress which might be bound up with the synergistic inhibitions of mixed cu2 dcf on bacteria the values of chao1 ace shannon and simpson in a4 were 940 940 6 36 and 0 94 respectively and they in a5 were 696 710 6 18 and 0 95 respectively compared to a3 activated sludge from a4 had higher bacterial richness and lower bacterial diversity while bacterial diversity and richness in a5 were both lower the changes showed that the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase had different impacts on bacterial richness and diversity and it need to be studied in the further the nitrifiers and denitrifiers under different cu2 and or dcf concentrations were examined at the level of genus fig 5 the genera dechloromonas 36 pseudomonas 37 dokdonella 38 delftia 39 escherichia shigella 7 mesorhizobium 40 pseudoxanthomonas 41 rhodobacter 28 zoogloea 38 stenotrophomonas 42 and thermomonas 43 were denitrifying bacteria and the sum of their relative abundances in seeding sludge a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 68 22 60 71 61 54 46 05 38 26 and 32 30 respectively compared with seeding sludge the total denitrifying bacteria relative abundances in a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were lower suggesting that cu2 and or dcf could inhibit the growth of denitrifiers the genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira were ammonia oxidizing bacteria 44 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria 28 and they belonged to nitrifying bacteria the sum of nitrifying bacteria relative abundances in seeding sludge a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 1 33 4 04 5 49 0 81 0 53 and 0 38 respectively the relative abundance ratio of denitrifiers and nitrifiers in seeding sludge a1 a2 a3 a4 and a5 were 51 12 15 01 11 20 56 96 72 50 and 85 00 respectively compared with seeding sludge the relative abundance ratio between denitrifying bacteria and nitrifying bacteria in a1 and a2 decreased suggesting that the nitrifiers population decreased level was lower than denitrifiers at the alone cu2 and dcf stress in a3 a4 and a5 the relative abundance ratio of denitrifiers and nitrifiers was higher than that in seeding sludge and it increased as the mixed cu2 dcf concentration increase the changes suggested that denitrifying bacteria had greater tolerances to mixed cu2 dcf than nitrifying bacteria as the component of synthetic wastewaters in the study was simpler than real wastewaters the combined impacts of dcf and cu2 on the nitrogen removal bacterial activity and community from a real scale biological wastewater treatment reactor need to be examined in the further 4 conclusions the nh4 n and cod elimination rates decreased as the injection of cu2 and or dcf in the influent combined cu2 and dcf had synergetic inhibition impacts on the changes of amo nar nir and nor activities the mixed cu2 and dcf concentration increase had more impacts on nar and amo than nir and nor the ros and ldh contents at the mixed cu2 and dcf stress were higher than those at the alone cu2 or dcf stress and they increased as the cu2 and dcf mixtures concentration increase in eps pn and ps were sensitive to the stress of dcf while pn was more easily affected by cu2 and mixed cu2 dcf than ps compared with seeding sludge the relative abundance ratio between denitrifying bacteria and nitrifying bacteria decreased at an alone stress of cu2 or dcf while the ratio increased as the mixed cu2 and dcf

13324,pharmaceutical and personal care products are released in watercourses due to the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatment and photocatalytic oxidation has been pointed out as an alternative thus this study aimed at gaining an insight on the mechanism of reaction using different radiation sources solar and visible and catalysts ag tio2 and pd tio2 for the abatement of a mixture of pharmaceutical contaminants of emerging concern cec sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and lorazepam lrz moreover aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments to improve their environmental friendliness an ecotoxicological evaluation was carried out by assessing the responses of several indicator organisms fish cladocerans plants microalgae and bacteria the hydroxyl radical had a major role on photocatalytic oxidation 90 of cbz degradation was achieved after 60 min using sunlight and ag tio2 whereas this removal was reduced to 15 with hydroxyl radical scavengers concerning the ecotoxicological evaluation the untreated mixture was mildly toxic to these organisms approximately 30 depression in the assessed endpoints except for microalgae where a pronounced toxicity 85 of growth inhibition treated solutions achieving lower concentrations of the parent compounds were generally found to be more toxic than the untreated mixture for example after solar photocatalytic oxidation using ag tio2 the toxicity of the mixture to the microalgae and daphnia magna increased or remained unaffected this suggests the formation of toxic by products during the treatments highlighting that effective treatments do not always translate into improved environmental friendliness these results raise concern on the environmental safety of the water treatment technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords visible light photocatalysis hydroxyl radical sunlight induced photocatalysis emerging contaminants ecotoxicological toxicity 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the greatest issues of this century this is due to the continuous and growing consumption of this resource by industry and agriculture towards human welfare allied to negative impacts in water quality and availability due to climate change water resources have been continuously receiving the income of pollutants in part due to the inefficiency of wastewater treatment which renders water reclamation an important strategy 1 in fact conventional wastewater treatment seems to be unsuitable for dealing with current contamination challenges and allowing water reclamation 2 and hence the need to find alternative solutions that enhance its efficacy especially against contaminants of emerging concern cecs 3 4 a group of cecs commonly found in wastewaters are pharmaceuticals including antibiotics and mental illness medicines 5 the overuse of antibiotics promotes bacteria resistance which has a positive feedback reflecting on increased and more intensive antibiotic use 6 7 also prominently mental health has been deteriorating worldwide which is linked with stress driven burnout recently recognized as an effective disorder by the world health organization this mental illness condition promotes the increased consumption of antidepressants anticonvulsants and antiepileptic drugs 8 the present study is focused in representatives of these pharmaceuticals namely on the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx which has been widely used and continuously appearing in water sources 9 10 on the anticonvulsant carbamazepine cbz and the benzodiazepine lorazepam lrz which have been increasingly detected in natural water sources and wastewater treatment plants 9 12 due to their recalcitrant characteristics cecs are very difficult to remove from water 13 and advanced oxidation processes aop s have been argued to be suitable non conventional treatment strategies since the hydroxyl radical generation can be helpful in the degradation of these refractory compounds 3 besides this a new generation of adsorbents with mesoporous and magnetic properties has been developed for the pharmaceutical contaminant s removal 14 16 nowadays among the most used aop technologies is photocatalysis aided by titanium dioxide tio2 as catalyst which preserves its photoactivity under different radiation sources tio2 is of low cost preparation easy handling and chemical stability all features contributing to its selection as a photocatalyst in aops 17 the main drawback of this catalyst is the high band gap 3 2 ev which turns pure tio2 active through uva radiation λ 387 nm the photogeneration of electron and holes pairs which enhances the radical oxidative species ros production just occurs under uva radiation 17 the reduction of this bandgap can be done through the doping with noble metals ag au pd pt and non metals n b s allowing the use of visible light and sunlight as radiation sources 18 21 the noble metals can reduce the band gap due to the surface plasmon resonance allowing visible light absorbance which reduces the radiation costs in the photocatalysis procedure 20 21 a scheme representing doped tio2 photoactivation is presented in the fig 1 for instance smx degradation through pd and pt tio2 was successfully achieved under sunlight radiation 22 however the radiation source has an important role in cecs degradation through ag and pd tio2 as reported by martins et al 18 while radical species such as the hydroxyl radical are efficient drivers of cecs degradation they promote the partial oxidation of compounds instead of their mineralization and these by products can promote the toxicity of the treated matrix 23 24 hence the tuning of mechanisms of reaction towards the most efficient alternatives can benefit from additional knowledge on the eco toxicity of the resulting by products e g as different radiation sources with or without radical scavengers are applied rather than rely solely on the monitoring of decreasing concentrations of the targeted chemicals in fact different radiation sources can enhance or not cecs abatement 18 but the by products resulting from aops methodologies can be more toxic than the original compounds 23 while converse results have also been reported e g 25 26 in this context the aim of the present study is two fold first we aimed at gaining an insight on the mechanism of reaction using different radiation sources for photocatalytic oxidation of a synthetic mixture of three cecs smx cbz and lrz using radical scavengers in fact in this work we performed the photocatalytic oxidation of such mixture with two different noble metals ag and pd doped onto tio2 using visible and sunlight radiation the intent was to analyze the role of reactive oxidative species such as hydroxyl and superoxide radical under visible and solar light once the composition of the treated mixture can hardly be predicted its quantitative analysis would hardly be feasible however the testing of treated mixtures for comparison with the initial mixture of contaminants as to their ecotoxicity allows an integrated view on the environmental efficiency of the treatment qualitatively distinguishing the tested mixtures to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such holistic approach is used to analyze photocatalytic oxidation this rationale triggered the second aim of the present study i e to assess whether the by products of different aop treatments can promote ecotoxic effects rendering the treated mixtures suspected of environmental hazard since treated wastewater is typically discharged in waterways standard aquatic organisms and corresponding standard tests were selected for the ecotoxicity assessment of the initial and treated mixtures namely focusing on the luminescence inhibition of the bacteria aliivibrio fischeri the immobilization of the cladoceran daphnia magna the growth inhibition of the green microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata the growth inhibition of the macrophyte lemna minor and the toxicity to zebrafish embryos lofrano et al 27 analyzed the toxicity using different non target species after photocatalytic degradation of just one antibiotic on the same way the degradation of two azo dyes through the photocatalytic process was evaluated in terms of toxicity over different non target species 28 to the best of our knowledge this is one the few works dealing with photocatalytic degradation of contaminants mixture while giving a deep evaluation of toxicity evolution using non target species of several trophic levels 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and catalysts smx cbz and lrz were purchased from sigma aldrich 99 purity the solution used in the experiments consists in the mixture of smx cbz and lrz at a concentration of 1 mg l each dissolved in ultrapure water isopropanol used as hydroxyl radical scavenger was obtained from sigma aldrich the catalysts 1 wt of ag tio2 and pd tio2 used in these experiments were prepared by photodeposition method 29 titanium isopropoxide was used as tio2 precursor silver nitrate and palladium chloride as precursors of ag and pd respectively the ag and pd precursors were sonicated with tio2 nanoparticles irradiated by uv vis light and afterwards the particles were dried the main characterization of the catalysts can be found elsewhere 29 this characterization comprises xrd sem eds xps and tga analysis 29 2 2 photocatalytic oxidation procedure several factors were considered in the experiments namely the radiation source visible light or sunlight the effect of the catalyst agtio2 or pdtio2 under different radiation sources in the presence or absence of a hydroxyl scavenger isopropanol and oxygen for an additional insight into the mechanisms behind differential treatment efficacy the effects of these factors were considered concerning the cecs degradation the catalyst load was 70 mg l for all experiments the experimental conditions and sample coding used hereinafter are summarized in table 1 the visible light experiments were carried out using a vivosun high pressure sodium lamp 600 w the photon flux of this radiation during the experiments was about 70 w m2 10 w m2 the sunlight experiments were performed in november 2018 from 11 00 to 13 00 in the morning where the radiation was of lower intensity compared to summer conditions 30 the photon flux for sunlight tests ranged from 110 to 430 w m2 both these experiments were performed in a stirred reactor 0 5 l equipped with a compound parabolic collector cpc the dispersion of the catalyst in the solution was ensured by placing a porous stone allowing air bubbling as well as magnetic stirring at 300 rpm 18 this bubbling could be done with air or pure nitrogen stream on the mechanistic study the mixture of contaminants was bubbled with a pure nitrogen stream during 4 h and then during the photocatalytic degradation under visible light the reactor was fed with the same stream to evaluate the hydroxyl radical contribution on the cecs degradation 5 mm of isopropanol was used 31 the introduction of isopropanol occurs at the beginning of the experiment the catalyst load used in all experiments was 70 mg l the catalyst was added to the solutions 10 min before the onset of irradiation allowing the evaluation of the adsorption of cecs onto the catalyst surface the solutions were exposed to the experimental conditions during 60 min during this period samples were collected after 0 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min of treatment for chemical analysis allowing to assess the degradation of each cec throughout the 60 min experimental period the samples collect for analysis was pass through an acetate cellulose syringe filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm chromafil xtra ca 45 25 to recover the catalyst particles all the experiments were made in duplicate 2 3 analytical quantifications the quantification of cecs used in this work along the reactions time was made through high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad the eluent for hplc was made by the volumetric ratio 60 40 of 1 4 g l of nah2po4 in ultrapure water and acetonitrile respectively the injection volume was 100 μl and the flowrate of the mobile phase was 1 ml min the wavelength selected for cecs quantification was 255 nm since is one of the absorption edge of mixture 18 the retention time of smx cbz and lrz were 5 2 min 7 3 min and 8 5 min respectively 2 4 toxicity assessment the ecotoxicity of the initial mixture t0 was compared to that assessed in 8 mixtures treated with different treatment protocols table 1 using a test battery comprising standard organisms typically used in regulatory environmental hazard assessment that represent different functional levels in aquatic ecosystems the microtox toxicity test kit was used to assess a fischeri luminescence inhibition promoted by each treatment see 32 the experimental samples were tested slightly diluted 81 9 maximum concentration following bacteria reconstitution and osmotic adjustment using the proprietary osmotic adjusting solution the light emission of the bacteria following 30 min of exposure was read and compared to that of a blank control proprietary diluent replacing test samples the growth inhibition of the green microalgae r subcapitata and the macrophyte l minor following exposure to the samples was assessed according to standard guidelines 33 34 as described in detail in gomes et al 23 briefly the tests were carried out using laboratory cultures of the organisms in multi well plates under controlled incubation conditions of temperature 23 1 c and continuous light the samples were spiked with nutrients according to the recipe of corresponding culture media woods hole mbl and steinberg respectively to avoid the interference of nutrient scarcity in test results thus each sample was tested at a 98 2 or 93 5 strength respectively for microalgae and macrophytes biomass yield was used as an endpoint in both tests based on the increase in r subcapitata cell density through the 96 h test period or on the dry weight increase of l minor through the 7 day test period difficulties in frond number counting were found due to overlaying of the fronds which suggests a defense strategy through reducing contact surfaces with the samples thus this endpoint was disregarded in the analysis the results are expressed as percent yield inhibition relative to an internal control in which the organisms were exposed to blank media the immobilization of d magna following exposure to test samples was assessed according to the standard acute toxicity test 201 by oecd 35 as detailed in gomes et al 23 briefly neonates ageing less than 24 h born in laboratory cultures were tested against the samples and a blank medium astm hard water control at 20 2 c under a 16hl 8hd photoperiod regime nutrient spiking to comply with the astm recipe was also made thus each sample was tested at a 92 strength percent immobilization inhibition was calculated by comparing the number of immobilized organisms found in samples with that found in the internal control after 48 h of exposure the fish embryo toxicity test fet following the oecd guideline 236 36 was used to assess the toxicity of the samples for zebrafish embryos danio rerio tests were carried out with newly fertilized eggs obtained from a standard zebrafish facility at the university of aveiro therein adult fish are cultured in carbon filtered water at 26 1 c conductivity of 750 50 μs cm ph 7 5 0 5

experimental samples were adjusted to those of the fish culture water conductivity was adjusted using sea salt instant ocean synthetic sea salt spectrum brands usa and ph was adjusted using sodium bicarbonate analytical grade an internal control was also carried out consisting of fish culture water water from the recirculating system tests were carried out at 26 1 c and under a 16 hl 8 hd

remaining endpoints are presented in supplementary table s1 2 4 1 assessing cecs interaction in the toxicity of the samples before and after treatment assuming that the toxic effects noticed in the bioassays can reflect interactions between the cecs within the mixtures constituting each sample the toxic units tu summation tus method 39 was applied to better characterize the test outcomes the tus method is a generally accepted solution to address mixtures toxicity 39 that relies on the concentration addition concept which assumes that the components of a mixture have a similar mode of toxic action thus they act as dilutions of each other to produce the toxic effects thus the tus value describes the sum of tus i e for a given effect level x the sum of the ratios between concentrations of each mixture component c i and its corresponding equi effective concentration when dosed singly ecx i as clarified in eq 1 by direct interpretation as tus 1 or tus 1 the mixture should provoke an overall effect smaller or larger than x respectively 1 tus i 1 n tu i i 1 n c i ecx i by using the average of the ec50 values collected in the literature for each cec table 2 tus was calculated considering the concentrations of the cecs found in each sample see section 2 3 for the c i term this exercise was only made for r subcapitata and for d magna since no lrz toxicity records were found regarding a fischeri and l minor and only lethality records were found for the fish our test focused hatching and development of d rerio instead 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanistic aspects of photocatalytic oxidation the effect of different radiation sources through photocatalytic oxidation using 1 ag and 1 pd tio2 was previously analyzed by martins et al 18 their main results indicate that sunlight radiation presents the best result in terms of smx cbz and lrz degradation closely followed by uva radiation visible light presented the worst degradation performance since it creates fewer photogenerated electron and holes pairs 18 furthermore concerning sunlight it was shown that weather conditions and season of the year can affect the cecs removal 30 based on these evidences mechanistic studies under sunlight were developed herein considering experiments run during the autumn moreover as uva and sunlight results were very similar in these previous studies we are focusing here the mechanistic under visible versus sunlight radiation representing extremes regarding degradation efficacy table 3 shows the actual concentrations of each pharmaceutical found at the end of each treatment 3 1 1 effect of the hydroxyl radical under sunlight radiation the best performance of sunlight compared to other radiation sources highlighted in previous studies is likely related with the hydroxyl radical production considering photocatalysis processes 18 22 31 thus we evaluated the hydroxyl radical contribution for smx cbz and lrz degradation by comparing processes in the presence or absence of isopropanol as a hydroxyl radical scavenger for similar conditions of sunlight irradiation fig 2 smx adsorbed greatly to both catalysts at the initial 10 min of contact in dark fig 2 despite of the low surface area of both catalysts 29 40 this is concordant with a previous study which reported a high adsorption of smx to the pd tio2 catalyst 18 for ag tio2 the adsorption after 75 min of contact with the solution was about 30 5 and 15 for smx cbz and lrz respectively except for smx the other contaminants poorly adsorbed onto the catalyst surface sunlight radiation combined with 1 ag tio2 almost completely degraded all contaminants fig 2 the lower degradation achieved by 1 pd tio2 is related to the smaller photon flux as well as the lower uv fraction on the radiation composition comparing to ag corroborating the results of a previous study 30 the increase of cecs concentration after 5 min of reaction can be related with some desorption from the catalyst surface and or through the hplc peaks overlap of the parent compounds and by products moreover for the remaining reaction time was possible to verify the important role of the hydroxyl radical on the degradation of different cecs fig 2 conversely in the case of smx treated with 1 pd tio2 the effect of the radical scavenger is negligible which means that the removal of this compound is mostly related to adsorption onto the catalyst surface the photogeneration of holes and electron pairs with semiconductors such as tio2 is responsible for the hydroxyl radical production since the holes can oxidize water 17 despite the scavenging of the hydroxyl radical by isopropanol appreciable degradation can still be found for cbz and lrz which could be related with the formation of other reactive species such as hydroperoxyl and superoxide radical partial adsorption or even with solar photolysis moreover the highest impact of the absence of hydroxyl radical was monitored through cbz degradation in fact cbz has a tricycle structure that can be more difficult to break by hydroxyl radicals 18 on the other hand martins et al 18 found that the solar photolysis of these contaminants with a photon flux of 428 w m2 caused a 50 abatement on the concentration of each contaminant these results are in accordance with those herein regarding the presence of the hydroxyl radical except for cbz which can be related with the low photon flux achieved during the last 30 min of reaction about 110 20 w m2 for the other cecs smx and lrz the higher abatement for this small photon flux can be related with the high adsorption capacity as will be further discussed section 3 1 3 however analysis of the first 30 min of experiment allows to confirm the major role of the hydroxyl radical on the cecs abatement depending on the contaminant photolysis and adsorption on the catalyst surface can have additionally important roles for cecs abatement 3 1 2 effect of oxygen under visible light radiation the oxygen presence in photocatalysis can influence the degradation of cecs due to the possibility of superoxide radical formation 17 the photogenerated electrons can reduce oxygen which acts as electron acceptor 17 41 moreover the presence of oxygen given its capacity of trapping the electrons can reduce the recombination phenomenon 31 here we expected that the recombination phenomenon would have a small impact on cecs degradation since the noble metals at the surface of tio2 can work also as electron traps 21 in order to assess whether superoxide can enhance the cecs degradation the photocatalytic oxidation of these contaminants was carried out under air or a nitrogen atmosphere absence of oxygen using visible light as radiation source using air stream oxygen partial pressure of 21 is considered to ensure the production of the superoxide radical following a study by martínez et al 41 who reported similar cbz degradation through uv vis light using p25 as catalyst for different oxygen partial pressures 21 50 and 100 fig 3 addresses the effect of oxygen presence in the cecs abatement the performance of cecs degradation was not affected by the presence of oxygen since similar results were obtained for treatments with nitrogen or air stream considering each catalyst fig 3 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the superoxide radical has no relevant impact on the degradation performance this disagrees with a previous study reporting that the superoxide radical was the main species responsible for methyl paraben degradation 1 mg l using p25 and simulated solar radiation 31 the likely explanation for this disagreement is that the presence of ag and pd at the catalyst surface hindered superoxide radical production indeed these noble metals have the capacity to trap the electrons and therefore decrease the available electrons for reducing oxygen 21 42 3 1 3 effect of hydroxyl radical under visible light since the degradation of cecs can be related with hydroxyl radical or other reactive species it is important to study the effect of the presence of hydroxyl radical scavenger on photocatalytic oxidation under visible light such a study was performed only for 1 ag tio2 since the adsorption of smx to 1 pd tio2 is very high fig 2 and section 3 1 1 rendering a lower scope for the observation of the effect of the scavenger the photocatalytic oxidation of cecs obtained in the presence of isopropanol and under dark conditions were identical as well as it was generally more limited than the photocatalytic oxidation obtained for 1 ag tio2 alone fig 4 this reinforces that the hydroxyl radical plays a crucial role in cecs degradation also under visible light radiation using 1 ag tio2 using n tio2 for simulated solar radiation petala et al 19 verified that the hydroxyl radical is the most significant pathway also grabowska et al 43 verified high hydroxyl radical production at the wavelength of 450 nm for 1 ag tio2 after 60 min of light irradiation this suggests that the hydroxyl radical may be more effective than other reactive species in cecs degradation 3 2 environmental hazardous potential of photocatalytic oxidation the available literature for the toxicity of each cec individually is summarized in table 2 there is an extreme scarcity of data concerning the ecotoxicity of lrz and the benchmarks found exclusively for green algae daphnids and fish were estimated not experimentally determined table 2 44 on this basis lrz seems to be slightly less hazardous than smx but more hazardous by approximately one order of magnitude than cbz for green microalgae the records for daphnids are more variable thus it is difficult to distinguish an order of toxicity and the three cecs seem to be similarly toxic to fish table 2 a brief examination of the toxicity values for smx shows that the producers l minor and r subcapitata are generally more sensitive to smx than the remaining species concerning cbz all species were basically similarly sensitive this high sensitivity of microalgae and macrophytes to the studied cecs also confirmed in our assays as depicted in fig 5 was somewhat unexpected as none of the tested cecs are designed to affect metabolic pathways that are primarily found in producers but rather in animals both smx and cbz affect microalgae through several mechanisms including lipid peroxidation antioxidant enzyme activity pigments content and composition 45 it is known in addition that smx promotes severe changes in the structure and composition of lipids and proteins altering their function in r subcapitata 46 and was also reported to increase energy consumption in microalgae leading to a decrease in cellular energy allocation 45 which might contribute to explain the more pronounced effects of this cec compared to cbz still both smx and cbz also affect animal species including d magna through similar mechanisms mostly impairing the oxidative metabolism and important macromolecules such as proteins 47 49 thus the differential toxicity of these cecs to producers and animals is yet to be clarified despite the variability of the records found in the literature it is clear that ec50 values were way above the initial concentration of each chemical in the mixture 1 mg l thus remarkable effects of the initial mixture t0 would not be a priori expected for example smx and cbz are similarly toxic to the bacteria a fischeri table 2 with ec50 values above 20 mg l and consistently luminescence inhibition following exposure to t0 holding much lower concentrations of the cecs was very mild approximately 16 fig 5 cai and hu 50 support this observation as they found that 1 mg l smx does not promote any luminescence inhibition through 24 h of exposure still two exceptions were found regarding the magnitude of the toxicity namely the ec50 records for smx with p subcapitata 51 and l minor 52 were lower than 1 mg l but averaging among the records available renders the overall ec50 values above 1 mg l at t0 which is our starting mixture of known composition 1 mg l of each cec the inhibition in yield was above 50 compared to a blank control for the green microalgae r subcapitata taking into account the relative toxic strength of this mixture assuming that the toxicity follows concentration addition which is logical as per an assumed similar mode of action in non target organisms such as producers growth inhibition below 50 was rather expected if no interaction among cecs occurs tus 1 table 3 indeed previous studies showed generally synergistic interactions in mixtures containing some of the tested pharmaceuticals for aquatic species 53 55 in addition to the interactive effects suggested by the tus approach for t0 these are also suggested for the samples treated despite we found tus below 1 for all treatments the growth of r subcapitata was inhibited by more than 50 after exposure to several treated samples table 3 fig 5 this may suggest that interaction between cecs at very low concentrations occurs however the response of d magna is not consistent with this line of reasoning as this is the treatment resulting in cec concentrations closer to t0 but t0 did not elicit immobilization in d magna therefore other aspects should concur to explain the ecotoxicity patterns found e g the formation of toxic by products during treatment although optimizing cecs photocatalytic degradation is worthwhile as per the toxic potential of these compounds thus the need to efficiently treat contaminated water it is critical to ensure that optimized conditions do not translate into substituted toxic effects in aquatic species that may be exposed to discharged treated water in this way we selectively evaluated the ecotoxicity of the treated mixtures as different technologies were applied for the cecs abatement this strategy allows a view on whether different photocatalytic procedures lead to different by products and importantly if the process can be optimized towards better environmental safety beyond successful cec abatement 3 2 1 ecotoxicological effects of treating contaminated samples with sunlight visible light and sunlight were considered in the present study as energy source to activate the photocatalytic action visible light per se is assumed to be ineffective in the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds since its wavelength is quite high compared to the absorption edge of each compound 18 56 57 thus the toxicity of samples treated only with visible radiation would expectedly be the same as the toxicity of the initial sample this reasoning the absence of testing of such a condition in general the photolysis under solar radiation slightly reduced or maintained the level of toxicity of the untreated sample see t0 vs sunlight in fig 5 but the magnitude of the changes in toxicity depending on the species is not consistent while the concentrations of each cec decreased approximately by half after sunlight treatment table 3 the decrease in toxicity was comparatively mild for the sensitive microalgae and for macrophytes the explanation for this pattern can be two fold on the one hand unmonitored byproduct formation may occur throughout sunlight treatment alone 58 59 that can be more toxic than the cecs remaining in the tested sample on the other hand the interaction between cecs proven for r subcapitata following the tus approach see table 3 and the discussion above producing a synergic mixture can compensate for the reduction in the actual exposure concentration to each cec resulting in mildly lower toxicity of the sunlight treatment compared to t0 besides the inconsistencies noticed above regarding interactions among cecs the literature has been validating the possibility of an enhanced toxicity following treatment driven by the reaction by products for example donner et al 60 reported that cbz solutions treated by uv photolysis presented higher ecotoxicity than the parent compound over v fischeri p subcapitata and d magna in fact one of the most concerning identified by products of cbz photolysis is acriline since it has a lower ec50 for fish and daphnids comparing to cbz still acriline recorded an ec50 higher than cbz for microalgae 25 the differences between radiation sources and catalysts in promoting toxic effects are also consistent with the relevant role of by products of enhanced toxicity compared to parent compounds as explored below 3 2 2 ecotoxicological effect of the catalytic processes under different radiation sources under visible light radiation both catalysts presented a similar behavior promoting the degradation of 20 of cbz and 55 of lrz smx degradation was more pronounced namely of 70 with 1 ag tio2 and 95 with 1 pd tio2 table 3 sunlight irradiation was more effective in cecs removal regardless of the catalyst smx degradation was about 95 for both catalysts with sunlight radiation while cbz and lrz were removed by 90 95 with 1 ag tio2 and by 50 and 80 with 1 pd tio2 after 60 min of solar irradiation table 3 the role of the radiation source in promoting better cec degradation was reinforced by the testing of both catalysts under dark conditions especially for cbz and lrz poor removal section 3 1 3 however these degradation patterns are not consistent with the ecotoxicological profiling fig 5 the responses of the species generally denote a higher biological impairment by samples treated with sunlight which was more effective in promoting cecs removal than visible light although the catalyst added may slightly modulate this general trend in summary the sunlight radiation coupled with a catalyst presented the best performance in terms of cecs removal moreover the catalyst ag tio2 compared to pd tio2 improves the degradation due to the higher solar photon flux 30 on this basis it is reasonable to assume that regarding photocatalytic oxidation through sunlight radiation the by products formation was enhanced for ag tio2 when toxicity can be recognized i e for the microalgae and the macrophytes to a lower extent growth inhibition was indeed more pronounced for samples treated with ag tio2 than for those treated with pd tio2 fig 5 the photocatalytic oxidation of pd tio2 was run at lower photon flux than sunlight photolysis and consistently it produced samples with lower ecotoxicity this suggests that different by products formed or that they formed to a lower extent than following solar photolysis and ag tio2 solar photocatalytic oxidation similarly when using visible light the toxicity was lower as the degradation was lower comparing with the high degradation abatement of ag tio2 solar photocatalytic oxidation in fact the low degradation of pattern compounds through different mechanisms of action can result in different by products formation in fact the photocatalytic oxidation can produce more toxic by products than the pattern compounds 61 62 during the hplc runs was possible to observe the by products peaks formation that were not identified at the end of reactions some of those peaks remain and others disappear depending on the tested condition 3 2 3 ecotoxicological effect of the superoxide radical regarding the experiments with air and nitrogen stream their performance in cecs removal was similar fig 3 table 3 suggesting that the superoxide radical has no sharp influence in cecs abatement however the ecotoxicological profiling revealed differences between the toxic potential of samples treated with air or the nitrogen stream see agtio2 vis and pdtio2 vis vs counterparts added the suffix n in fig 5 generally the samples treated under a nitrogen stream were more toxic when ag tio2 was used as a catalyst and less toxic when pd tio2 was rather used the differences being more prominent for microalgae fig 5 concerning the samples where ag tio2 was used as a catalyst smx concentration at the end of the experiment was indeed higher under the nitrogen stream than air table 3 and given that microalgae are very sensitive to this cec e g 51 63 table 2 it is reasonable to hypothesize that the lower smx abatement has a role in the differential toxicity pattern in the case of the samples where pd tio2 was used as a catalyst no differences were noticed regarding cec concentration following treatment under air or nitrogen streams the lower toxicity of the samples treated with this catalyst under a nitrogen stream suggests that the superoxide formed through treatment under an air stream may have a role in enhancing toxicity gomes et al 64 verified that the hydroxyl radical scavenger constrains the by products resulting from the catalytic ozonation of a mixture of parabens thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that a parallel may happen with the superoxide radical and its presence may have promoted the formation of different by products or their formation in a larger extent hence the differential ecotoxicological sensitivity to samples treated under air or nitrogen streams still the results for zebrafish egg hatching are not consistent with the overall reasoning above as the toxicity patterns are opposed to the general trend which reinforces the need for further studies that can elucidate the complex scenarios constraining the ecotoxicity outcomes of photocatalytic oxidation differential species sensitivity should be appraised by studying the responses of a wide range of species but it seems currently that producers should be particularly focused as well since they seem to be more sensitive to these chemicals than species from other functional levels 4 conclusions the photocatalytic oxidation of the cecs mixture through the sunlight radiation proven to be effective for the removal of the parent contaminants the hydroxyl radical had an important role for this efficacy visible light radiation was also used and the superoxide radical impact was assessed through the nitrogen presence the impact was minimal whereas the hydroxyl radical seems to have major relevance visible radiation was shown to promote a lower degradation of parent compounds however high efficacy on cecs abatement does not necessarily mean optimal efficiency in fact the highest performance for cecs removal showed a parallel increase in the toxicity over different species comparing to the initial mixture thus higher environmental hazardous potential despite degradation of parent compounds can be almost complete the by products forming during the treatment reactions might represent increased toxicity although the extension of treatment periods can be more immediately suggested as a measure to promote the conversion of formed by products into other compounds of lower ecotoxic potential further systematic studies are much needed to better understand the environmental hazardous potential of effective photocatalytic oxidation processes so that reclaimed water treated under these protocols can indeed be safely used the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 endpoints obtained in the fet test with zebrafish after 96 h of exposure to the selected water samples values represent relative to the total number of replicates 20 per water sample table s1 supplementary data to this article can be found online at

13324,pharmaceutical and personal care products are released in watercourses due to the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatment and photocatalytic oxidation has been pointed out as an alternative thus this study aimed at gaining an insight on the mechanism of reaction using different radiation sources solar and visible and catalysts ag tio2 and pd tio2 for the abatement of a mixture of pharmaceutical contaminants of emerging concern cec sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and lorazepam lrz moreover aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments to improve their environmental friendliness an ecotoxicological evaluation was carried out by assessing the responses of several indicator organisms fish cladocerans plants microalgae and bacteria the hydroxyl radical had a major role on photocatalytic oxidation 90 of cbz degradation was achieved after 60 min using sunlight and ag tio2 whereas this removal was reduced to 15 with hydroxyl radical scavengers concerning the ecotoxicological evaluation the untreated mixture was mildly toxic to these organisms approximately 30 depression in the assessed endpoints except for microalgae where a pronounced toxicity 85 of growth inhibition treated solutions achieving lower concentrations of the parent compounds were generally found to be more toxic than the untreated mixture for example after solar photocatalytic oxidation using ag tio2 the toxicity of the mixture to the microalgae and daphnia magna increased or remained unaffected this suggests the formation of toxic by products during the treatments highlighting that effective treatments do not always translate into improved environmental friendliness these results raise concern on the environmental safety of the water treatment technologies graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords visible light photocatalysis hydroxyl radical sunlight induced photocatalysis emerging contaminants ecotoxicological toxicity 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the greatest issues of this century this is due to the continuous and growing consumption of this resource by industry and agriculture towards human welfare allied to negative impacts in water quality and availability due to climate change water resources have been continuously receiving the income of pollutants in part due to the inefficiency of wastewater treatment which renders water reclamation an important strategy 1 in fact conventional wastewater treatment seems to be unsuitable for dealing with current contamination challenges and allowing water reclamation 2 and hence the need to find alternative solutions that enhance its efficacy especially against contaminants of emerging concern cecs 3 4 a group of cecs commonly found in wastewaters are pharmaceuticals including antibiotics and mental illness medicines 5 the overuse of antibiotics promotes bacteria resistance which has a positive feedback reflecting on increased and more intensive antibiotic use 6 7 also prominently mental health has been deteriorating worldwide which is linked with stress driven burnout recently recognized as an effective disorder by the world health organization this mental illness condition promotes the increased consumption of antidepressants anticonvulsants and antiepileptic drugs 8 the present study is focused in representatives of these pharmaceuticals namely on the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole smx which has been widely used and continuously appearing in water sources 9 10 on the anticonvulsant carbamazepine cbz and the benzodiazepine lorazepam lrz which have been increasingly detected in natural water sources and wastewater treatment plants 9 12 due to their recalcitrant characteristics cecs are very difficult to remove from water 13 and advanced oxidation processes aop s have been argued to be suitable non conventional treatment strategies since the hydroxyl radical generation can be helpful in the degradation of these refractory compounds 3 besides this a new generation of adsorbents with mesoporous and magnetic properties has been developed for the pharmaceutical contaminant s removal 14 16 nowadays among the most used aop technologies is photocatalysis aided by titanium dioxide tio2 as catalyst which preserves its photoactivity under different radiation sources tio2 is of low cost preparation easy handling and chemical stability all features contributing to its selection as a photocatalyst in aops 17 the main drawback of this catalyst is the high band gap 3 2 ev which turns pure tio2 active through uva radiation λ 387 nm the photogeneration of electron and holes pairs which enhances the radical oxidative species ros production just occurs under uva radiation 17 the reduction of this bandgap can be done through the doping with noble metals ag au pd pt and non metals n b s allowing the use of visible light and sunlight as radiation sources 18 21 the noble metals can reduce the band gap due to the surface plasmon resonance allowing visible light absorbance which reduces the radiation costs in the photocatalysis procedure 20 21 a scheme representing doped tio2 photoactivation is presented in the fig 1 for instance smx degradation through pd and pt tio2 was successfully achieved under sunlight radiation 22 however the radiation source has an important role in cecs degradation through ag and pd tio2 as reported by martins et al 18 while radical species such as the hydroxyl radical are efficient drivers of cecs degradation they promote the partial oxidation of compounds instead of their mineralization and these by products can promote the toxicity of the treated matrix 23 24 hence the tuning of mechanisms of reaction towards the most efficient alternatives can benefit from additional knowledge on the eco toxicity of the resulting by products e g as different radiation sources with or without radical scavengers are applied rather than rely solely on the monitoring of decreasing concentrations of the targeted chemicals in fact different radiation sources can enhance or not cecs abatement 18 but the by products resulting from aops methodologies can be more toxic than the original compounds 23 while converse results have also been reported e g 25 26 in this context the aim of the present study is two fold first we aimed at gaining an insight on the mechanism of reaction using different radiation sources for photocatalytic oxidation of a synthetic mixture of three cecs smx cbz and lrz using radical scavengers in fact in this work we performed the photocatalytic oxidation of such mixture with two different noble metals ag and pd doped onto tio2 using visible and sunlight radiation the intent was to analyze the role of reactive oxidative species such as hydroxyl and superoxide radical under visible and solar light once the composition of the treated mixture can hardly be predicted its quantitative analysis would hardly be feasible however the testing of treated mixtures for comparison with the initial mixture of contaminants as to their ecotoxicity allows an integrated view on the environmental efficiency of the treatment qualitatively distinguishing the tested mixtures to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such holistic approach is used to analyze photocatalytic oxidation this rationale triggered the second aim of the present study i e to assess whether the by products of different aop treatments can promote ecotoxic effects rendering the treated mixtures suspected of environmental hazard since treated wastewater is typically discharged in waterways standard aquatic organisms and corresponding standard tests were selected for the ecotoxicity assessment of the initial and treated mixtures namely focusing on the luminescence inhibition of the bacteria aliivibrio fischeri the immobilization of the cladoceran daphnia magna the growth inhibition of the green microalgae raphidocelis subcapitata the growth inhibition of the macrophyte lemna minor and the toxicity to zebrafish embryos lofrano et al 27 analyzed the toxicity using different non target species after photocatalytic degradation of just one antibiotic on the same way the degradation of two azo dyes through the photocatalytic process was evaluated in terms of toxicity over different non target species 28 to the best of our knowledge this is one the few works dealing with photocatalytic degradation of contaminants mixture while giving a deep evaluation of toxicity evolution using non target species of several trophic levels 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and catalysts smx cbz and lrz were purchased from sigma aldrich 99 purity the solution used in the experiments consists in the mixture of smx cbz and lrz at a concentration of 1 mg l each dissolved in ultrapure water isopropanol used as hydroxyl radical scavenger was obtained from sigma aldrich the catalysts 1 wt of ag tio2 and pd tio2 used in these experiments were prepared by photodeposition method 29 titanium isopropoxide was used as tio2 precursor silver nitrate and palladium chloride as precursors of ag and pd respectively the ag and pd precursors were sonicated with tio2 nanoparticles irradiated by uv vis light and afterwards the particles were dried the main characterization of the catalysts can be found elsewhere 29 this characterization comprises xrd sem eds xps and tga analysis 29 2 2 photocatalytic oxidation procedure several factors were considered in the experiments namely the radiation source visible light or sunlight the effect of the catalyst agtio2 or pdtio2 under different radiation sources in the presence or absence of a hydroxyl scavenger isopropanol and oxygen for an additional insight into the mechanisms behind differential treatment efficacy the effects of these factors were considered concerning the cecs degradation the catalyst load was 70 mg l for all experiments the experimental conditions and sample coding used hereinafter are summarized in table 1 the visible light experiments were carried out using a vivosun high pressure sodium lamp 600 w the photon flux of this radiation during the experiments was about 70 w m2 10 w m2 the sunlight experiments were performed in november 2018 from 11 00 to 13 00 in the morning where the radiation was of lower intensity compared to summer conditions 30 the photon flux for sunlight tests ranged from 110 to 430 w m2 both these experiments were performed in a stirred reactor 0 5 l equipped with a compound parabolic collector cpc the dispersion of the catalyst in the solution was ensured by placing a porous stone allowing air bubbling as well as magnetic stirring at 300 rpm 18 this bubbling could be done with air or pure nitrogen stream on the mechanistic study the mixture of contaminants was bubbled with a pure nitrogen stream during 4 h and then during the photocatalytic degradation under visible light the reactor was fed with the same stream to evaluate the hydroxyl radical contribution on the cecs degradation 5 mm of isopropanol was used 31 the introduction of isopropanol occurs at the beginning of the experiment the catalyst load used in all experiments was 70 mg l the catalyst was added to the solutions 10 min before the onset of irradiation allowing the evaluation of the adsorption of cecs onto the catalyst surface the solutions were exposed to the experimental conditions during 60 min during this period samples were collected after 0 5 10 15 30 45 and 60 min of treatment for chemical analysis allowing to assess the degradation of each cec throughout the 60 min experimental period the samples collect for analysis was pass through an acetate cellulose syringe filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm chromafil xtra ca 45 25 to recover the catalyst particles all the experiments were made in duplicate 2 3 analytical quantifications the quantification of cecs used in this work along the reactions time was made through high performance liquid chromatography hplc dad the eluent for hplc was made by the volumetric ratio 60 40 of 1 4 g l of nah2po4 in ultrapure water and acetonitrile respectively the injection volume was 100 μl and the flowrate of the mobile phase was 1 ml min the wavelength selected for cecs quantification was 255 nm since is one of the absorption edge of mixture 18 the retention time of smx cbz and lrz were 5 2 min 7 3 min and 8 5 min respectively 2 4 toxicity assessment the ecotoxicity of the initial mixture t0 was compared to that assessed in 8 mixtures treated with different treatment protocols table 1 using a test battery comprising standard organisms typically used in regulatory environmental hazard assessment that represent different functional levels in aquatic ecosystems the microtox toxicity test kit was used to assess a fischeri luminescence inhibition promoted by each treatment see 32 the experimental samples were tested slightly diluted 81 9 maximum concentration following bacteria reconstitution and osmotic adjustment using the proprietary osmotic adjusting solution the light emission of the bacteria following 30 min of exposure was read and compared to that of a blank control proprietary diluent replacing test samples the growth inhibition of the green microalgae r subcapitata and the macrophyte l minor following exposure to the samples was assessed according to standard guidelines 33 34 as described in detail in gomes et al 23 briefly the tests were carried out using laboratory cultures of the organisms in multi well plates under controlled incubation conditions of temperature 23 1 c and continuous light the samples were spiked with nutrients according to the recipe of corresponding culture media woods hole mbl and steinberg respectively to avoid the interference of nutrient scarcity in test results thus each sample was tested at a 98 2 or 93 5 strength respectively for microalgae and macrophytes biomass yield was used as an endpoint in both tests based on the increase in r subcapitata cell density through the 96 h test period or on the dry weight increase of l minor through the 7 day test period difficulties in frond number counting were found due to overlaying of the fronds which suggests a defense strategy through reducing contact surfaces with the samples thus this endpoint was disregarded in the analysis the results are expressed as percent yield inhibition relative to an internal control in which the organisms were exposed to blank media the immobilization of d magna following exposure to test samples was assessed according to the standard acute toxicity test 201 by oecd 35 as detailed in gomes et al 23 briefly neonates ageing less than 24 h born in laboratory cultures were tested against the samples and a blank medium astm hard water control at 20 2 c under a 16hl 8hd photoperiod regime nutrient spiking to comply with the astm recipe was also made thus each sample was tested at a 92 strength percent immobilization inhibition was calculated by comparing the number of immobilized organisms found in samples with that found in the internal control after 48 h of exposure the fish embryo toxicity test fet following the oecd guideline 236 36 was used to assess the toxicity of the samples for zebrafish embryos danio rerio tests were carried out with newly fertilized eggs obtained from a standard zebrafish facility at the university of aveiro therein adult fish are cultured in carbon filtered water at 26 1 c conductivity of 750 50 μs cm ph 7 5 0 5 dissolved oxygen at 95 saturation photoperiod cycle of 14 hl 10 hd and are fed with commercial artificial diet zm 400 granular twice a day eggs were exposed to the experimental samples and a blank medium control 37 38 in 24 well plates with 20 replicates per treatment nutrient spiking to comply with iso 37 was also made thus each sample was tested at a 99 strength the conductivity and ph of the experimental samples were adjusted to those of the fish culture water conductivity was adjusted using sea salt instant ocean synthetic sea salt spectrum brands usa and ph was adjusted using sodium bicarbonate analytical grade an internal control was also carried out consisting of fish culture water water from the recirculating system tests were carried out at 26 1 c and under a 16 hl 8 hd

remaining endpoints are presented in supplementary table s1 2 4 1 assessing cecs interaction in the toxicity of the samples before and after treatment assuming that the toxic effects noticed in the bioassays can reflect interactions between the cecs within the mixtures constituting each sample the toxic units tu summation tus method 39 was applied to better characterize the test outcomes the tus method is a generally accepted solution to address mixtures toxicity 39 that relies on the concentration addition concept which assumes that the components of a mixture have a similar mode of toxic action thus they act as dilutions of each other to produce the toxic effects thus the tus value describes the sum of tus i e for a given effect level x the sum of the ratios between concentrations of each mixture component c i and its corresponding equi effective concentration when dosed singly ecx i as clarified in eq 1 by direct interpretation as tus 1 or tus 1 the mixture should provoke an overall effect smaller or larger than x respectively 1 tus i 1 n tu i i 1 n c i ecx i by using the average of the ec50 values collected in the literature for each cec table 2 tus was calculated considering the concentrations of the cecs found in each sample see section 2 3 for the c i term this exercise was only made for r subcapitata and for d magna since no lrz toxicity records were found regarding a fischeri and l minor and only lethality records were found for the fish our test focused hatching and development of d rerio instead 3 results and discussion 3 1 mechanistic aspects of photocatalytic oxidation the effect of different radiation sources through photocatalytic oxidation using 1 ag and 1 pd tio2 was previously analyzed by martins et al 18 their main results indicate that sunlight radiation presents the best result in terms of smx cbz and lrz degradation closely followed by uva radiation visible light presented the worst degradation performance since it creates fewer photogenerated electron and holes pairs 18 furthermore concerning sunlight it was shown that weather conditions and season of the year can affect the cecs removal 30 based on these evidences mechanistic studies under sunlight were developed herein considering experiments run during the autumn moreover as uva and sunlight results were very similar in these previous studies we are focusing here the mechanistic under visible versus sunlight radiation representing extremes regarding degradation efficacy table 3 shows the actual concentrations of each pharmaceutical found at the end of each treatment 3 1 1 effect of the hydroxyl radical under sunlight radiation the best performance of sunlight compared to other radiation sources highlighted in previous studies is likely related with the hydroxyl radical production considering photocatalysis processes 18 22 31 thus we evaluated the hydroxyl radical contribution for smx cbz and lrz degradation by comparing processes in the presence or absence of isopropanol as a hydroxyl radical scavenger for similar conditions of sunlight irradiation fig 2 smx adsorbed greatly to both catalysts at the initial 10 min of contact in dark fig 2 despite of the low surface area of both catalysts 29 40 this is concordant with a previous study which reported a high adsorption of smx to the pd tio2 catalyst 18 for ag tio2 the adsorption after 75 min of contact with the solution was about 30 5 and 15 for smx cbz and lrz respectively except for smx the other contaminants poorly adsorbed onto the catalyst surface sunlight radiation combined with 1 ag tio2 almost completely degraded all contaminants fig 2 the lower degradation achieved by 1 pd tio2 is related to the smaller photon flux as well as the lower uv fraction on the radiation composition comparing to ag corroborating the results of a previous study 30 the increase of cecs concentration after 5 min of reaction can be related with some desorption from the catalyst surface and or through the hplc peaks overlap of the parent compounds and by products moreover for the remaining reaction time was possible to verify the important role of the hydroxyl radical on the degradation of different cecs fig 2 conversely in the case of smx treated with 1 pd tio2 the effect of the radical scavenger is negligible which means that the removal of this compound is mostly related to adsorption onto the catalyst surface the photogeneration of holes and electron pairs with semiconductors such as tio2 is responsible for the hydroxyl radical production since the holes can oxidize water 17 despite the scavenging of the hydroxyl radical by isopropanol appreciable degradation can still be found for cbz and lrz which could be related with the formation of other reactive species such as hydroperoxyl and superoxide radical partial adsorption or even with solar photolysis moreover the highest impact of the absence of hydroxyl radical was monitored through cbz degradation in fact cbz has a tricycle structure that can be more difficult to break by hydroxyl radicals 18 on the other hand martins et al 18 found that the solar photolysis of these contaminants with a photon flux of 428 w m2 caused a 50 abatement on the concentration of each contaminant these results are in accordance with those herein regarding the presence of the hydroxyl radical except for cbz which can be related with the low photon flux achieved during the last 30 min of reaction about 110 20 w m2 for the other cecs smx and lrz the higher abatement for this small photon flux can be related with the high adsorption capacity as will be further discussed section 3 1 3 however analysis of the first 30 min of experiment allows to confirm the major role of the hydroxyl radical on the cecs abatement depending on the contaminant photolysis and adsorption on the catalyst surface can have additionally important roles for cecs abatement 3 1 2 effect of oxygen under visible light radiation the oxygen presence in photocatalysis can influence the degradation of cecs due to the possibility of superoxide radical formation 17 the photogenerated electrons can reduce oxygen which acts as electron acceptor 17 41 moreover the presence of oxygen given its capacity of trapping the electrons can reduce the recombination phenomenon 31 here we expected that the recombination phenomenon would have a small impact on cecs degradation since the noble metals at the surface of tio2 can work also as electron traps 21 in order to assess whether superoxide can enhance the cecs degradation the photocatalytic oxidation of these contaminants was carried out under air or a nitrogen atmosphere absence of oxygen using visible light as radiation source using air stream oxygen partial pressure of 21 is considered to ensure the production of the superoxide radical following a study by martínez et al 41 who reported similar cbz degradation through uv vis light using p25 as catalyst for different oxygen partial pressures 21 50 and 100 fig 3 addresses the effect of oxygen presence in the cecs abatement the performance of cecs degradation was not affected by the presence of oxygen since similar results were obtained for treatments with nitrogen or air stream considering each catalyst fig 3 therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the superoxide radical has no relevant impact on the degradation performance this disagrees with a previous study reporting that the superoxide radical was the main species responsible for methyl paraben degradation 1 mg l using p25 and simulated solar radiation 31 the likely explanation for this disagreement is that the presence of ag and pd at the catalyst surface hindered superoxide radical production indeed these noble metals have the capacity to trap the electrons and therefore decrease the available electrons for reducing oxygen 21 42 3 1 3 effect of hydroxyl radical under visible light since the degradation of cecs can be related with hydroxyl radical or other reactive species it is important to study the effect of the presence of hydroxyl radical scavenger on photocatalytic oxidation under visible light such a study was performed only for 1 ag tio2 since the adsorption of smx to 1 pd tio2 is very high fig 2 and section 3 1 1 rendering a lower scope for the observation of the effect of the scavenger the photocatalytic oxidation of cecs obtained in the presence of isopropanol and under dark conditions were identical as well as it was generally more limited than the photocatalytic oxidation obtained for 1 ag tio2 alone fig 4 this reinforces that the hydroxyl radical plays a crucial role in cecs degradation also under visible light radiation using 1 ag tio2 using n tio2 for simulated solar radiation petala et al 19 verified that the hydroxyl radical is the most significant pathway also grabowska et al 43 verified high hydroxyl radical production at the wavelength of 450 nm for 1 ag tio2 after 60 min of light irradiation this suggests that the hydroxyl radical may be more effective than other reactive species in cecs degradation 3 2 environmental hazardous potential of photocatalytic oxidation the available literature for the toxicity of each cec individually is summarized in table 2 there is an extreme scarcity of data concerning the ecotoxicity of lrz and the benchmarks found exclusively for green algae daphnids and fish were estimated not experimentally determined table 2 44 on this basis lrz seems to be slightly less hazardous than smx but more hazardous by approximately one order of magnitude than cbz for green microalgae the records for daphnids are more variable thus it is difficult to distinguish an order of toxicity and the three cecs seem to be similarly toxic to fish table 2 a brief examination of the toxicity values for smx shows that the producers l minor and r subcapitata are generally more sensitive to smx than the remaining species concerning cbz all species were basically similarly sensitive this high sensitivity of microalgae and macrophytes to the studied cecs also confirmed in our assays as depicted in fig 5 was somewhat unexpected as none of the tested cecs are designed to affect metabolic pathways that are primarily found in producers but rather in animals both smx and cbz affect microalgae through several mechanisms including lipid peroxidation antioxidant enzyme activity pigments content and composition 45 it is known in addition that smx promotes severe changes in the structure and composition of lipids and proteins altering their function in r subcapitata 46 and was also reported to increase energy consumption in microalgae leading to a decrease in cellular energy allocation 45 which might contribute to explain the more pronounced effects of this cec compared to cbz still both smx and cbz also affect animal species including d magna through similar mechanisms mostly impairing the oxidative metabolism and important macromolecules such as proteins 47 49 thus the differential toxicity of these cecs to producers and animals is yet to be clarified despite the variability of the records found in the literature it is clear that ec50 values were way above the initial concentration of each chemical in the mixture 1 mg l thus remarkable effects of the initial mixture t0 would not be a priori expected for example smx and cbz are similarly toxic to the bacteria a fischeri table 2 with ec50 values above 20 mg l and consistently luminescence inhibition following exposure to t0 holding much lower concentrations of the cecs was very mild approximately 16 fig 5 cai and hu 50 support this observation as they found that 1 mg l smx does not promote any luminescence inhibition through 24 h of exposure still two exceptions were found regarding the magnitude of the toxicity namely the ec50 records for smx with p subcapitata 51 and l minor 52 were lower than 1 mg l but averaging among the records available renders the overall ec50 values above 1 mg l at t0 which is our starting mixture of known composition 1 mg l of each cec the inhibition in yield was above 50 compared to a blank control for the green microalgae r subcapitata taking into account the relative toxic strength of this mixture assuming that the toxicity follows concentration addition which is logical as per an assumed similar mode of action in non target organisms such as producers growth inhibition below 50 was rather expected if no interaction among cecs occurs tus 1 table 3 indeed previous studies showed generally synergistic interactions in mixtures containing some of the tested pharmaceuticals for aquatic species 53 55 in addition to the interactive effects suggested by the tus approach for t0 these are also suggested for the samples treated despite we found tus below 1 for all treatments the growth of r subcapitata was inhibited by more than 50 after exposure to several treated samples table 3 fig 5 this may suggest that interaction between cecs at very low concentrations occurs however the response of d magna is not consistent with this line of reasoning as this is the treatment resulting in cec concentrations closer to t0 but t0 did not elicit immobilization in d magna therefore other aspects should concur to explain the ecotoxicity patterns found e g the formation of toxic by products during treatment although optimizing cecs photocatalytic degradation is worthwhile as per the toxic potential of these compounds thus the need to efficiently treat contaminated water it is critical to ensure that optimized conditions do not translate into substituted toxic effects in aquatic species that may be exposed to discharged treated water in this way we selectively evaluated the ecotoxicity of the treated mixtures as different technologies were applied for the cecs abatement this strategy allows a view on whether different photocatalytic procedures lead to different by products and importantly if the process can be optimized towards better environmental safety beyond successful cec abatement 3 2 1 ecotoxicological effects of treating contaminated samples with sunlight visible light and sunlight were considered in the present study as energy source to activate the photocatalytic action visible light per se is assumed to be ineffective in the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds since its wavelength is quite high compared to the absorption edge of each compound 18 56 57 thus the toxicity of samples treated only with visible radiation would expectedly be the same as the toxicity of the initial sample this reasoning the absence of testing of such a condition in general the photolysis under solar radiation slightly reduced or maintained the level of toxicity of the untreated sample see t0 vs sunlight in fig 5 but the magnitude of the changes in toxicity depending on the species is not consistent while the concentrations of each cec decreased approximately by half after sunlight treatment table 3 the decrease in toxicity was comparatively mild for the sensitive microalgae and for macrophytes the explanation for this pattern can be two fold on the one hand unmonitored byproduct formation may occur throughout sunlight treatment alone 58 59 that can be more toxic than the cecs remaining in the tested sample on the other hand the interaction between cecs proven for r subcapitata following the tus approach see table 3 and the discussion above producing a synergic mixture can compensate for the reduction in the actual exposure concentration to each cec resulting in mildly lower toxicity of the sunlight treatment compared to t0 besides the inconsistencies noticed above regarding interactions among cecs the literature has been validating the possibility of an enhanced toxicity following treatment driven by the reaction by products for example donner et al 60 reported that cbz solutions treated by uv photolysis presented higher ecotoxicity than the parent compound over v fischeri p subcapitata and d magna in fact one of the most concerning identified by products of cbz photolysis is acriline since it has a lower ec50 for fish and daphnids comparing to cbz still acriline recorded an ec50 higher than cbz for microalgae 25 the differences between radiation sources and catalysts in promoting toxic effects are also consistent with the relevant role of by products of enhanced toxicity compared to parent compounds as explored below 3 2 2 ecotoxicological effect of the catalytic processes under different radiation sources under visible light radiation both catalysts presented a similar behavior promoting the degradation of 20 of cbz and 55 of lrz smx degradation was more pronounced namely of 70 with 1 ag tio2 and 95 with 1 pd tio2 table 3 sunlight irradiation was more effective in cecs removal regardless of the catalyst smx degradation was about 95 for both catalysts with sunlight radiation while cbz and lrz were removed by 90 95 with 1 ag tio2 and by 50 and 80 with 1 pd tio2 after 60 min of solar irradiation table 3 the role of the radiation source in promoting better cec degradation was reinforced by the testing of both catalysts under dark conditions especially for cbz and lrz poor removal section 3 1 3 however these degradation patterns are not consistent with the ecotoxicological profiling fig 5 the responses of the species generally denote a higher biological impairment by samples treated with sunlight which was more effective in promoting cecs removal than visible light although the catalyst added may slightly modulate this general trend in summary the sunlight radiation coupled with a catalyst presented the best performance in terms of cecs removal moreover the catalyst ag tio2 compared to pd tio2 improves the degradation due to the higher solar photon flux 30 on this basis it is reasonable to assume that regarding photocatalytic oxidation through sunlight radiation the by products formation was enhanced for ag tio2 when toxicity can be recognized i e for the microalgae and the macrophytes to a lower extent growth inhibition was indeed more pronounced for samples treated with ag tio2 than for those treated with pd tio2 fig 5 the photocatalytic oxidation of pd tio2 was run at lower photon flux than sunlight photolysis and consistently it produced samples with lower ecotoxicity this suggests that different by products formed or that they formed to a lower extent than following solar photolysis and ag tio2 solar photocatalytic oxidation similarly when using visible light the toxicity was lower as the degradation was lower comparing with the high degradation abatement of ag tio2 solar photocatalytic oxidation in fact the low degradation of pattern compounds through different mechanisms of action can result in different by products formation in fact the photocatalytic oxidation can produce more toxic by products than the pattern compounds 61 62 during the hplc runs was possible to observe the by products peaks formation that were not identified at the end of reactions some of those peaks remain and others disappear depending on the tested condition 3 2 3 ecotoxicological effect of the superoxide radical regarding the experiments with air and nitrogen stream their performance in cecs removal was similar fig 3 table 3 suggesting that the superoxide radical has no sharp influence in cecs abatement however the ecotoxicological profiling revealed differences between the toxic potential of samples treated with air or the nitrogen stream see agtio2 vis and pdtio2 vis vs counterparts added the suffix n in fig 5 generally the samples treated under a nitrogen stream were more toxic when ag tio2 was used as a catalyst and less toxic when pd tio2 was rather used the differences being more prominent for microalgae fig 5 concerning the samples where ag tio2 was used as a catalyst smx concentration at the end of the experiment was indeed higher under the nitrogen stream than air table 3 and given that microalgae are very sensitive to this cec e g 51 63 table 2 it is reasonable to hypothesize that the lower smx abatement has a role in the differential toxicity pattern in the case of the samples where pd tio2 was used as a catalyst no differences were noticed regarding cec concentration following treatment under air or nitrogen streams the lower toxicity of the samples treated with this catalyst under a nitrogen stream suggests that the superoxide formed through treatment under an air stream may have a role in enhancing toxicity gomes et al 64 verified that the hydroxyl radical scavenger constrains the by products resulting from the catalytic ozonation of a mixture of parabens thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that a parallel may happen with the superoxide radical and its presence may have promoted the formation of different by products or their formation in a larger extent hence the differential ecotoxicological sensitivity to samples treated under air or nitrogen streams still the results for zebrafish egg hatching are not consistent with the overall reasoning above as the toxicity patterns are opposed to the general trend which reinforces the need for further studies that can elucidate the complex scenarios constraining the ecotoxicity outcomes of photocatalytic oxidation differential species sensitivity should be appraised by studying the responses of a wide range of species but it seems currently that producers should be particularly focused as well since they seem to be more sensitive to these chemicals than species from other functional levels 4 conclusions the photocatalytic oxidation of the cecs mixture through the sunlight radiation proven to be effective for the removal of the parent contaminants the hydroxyl radical had an important role for this efficacy visible light radiation was also used and the superoxide radical impact was assessed through the nitrogen presence the impact was minimal whereas the hydroxyl radical seems to have major relevance visible radiation was shown to promote a lower degradation of parent compounds however high efficacy on cecs abatement does not necessarily mean optimal efficiency in fact the highest performance for cecs removal showed a parallel increase in the toxicity over different species comparing to the initial mixture thus higher environmental hazardous potential despite degradation of parent compounds can be almost complete the by products forming during the treatment reactions might represent increased toxicity although the extension of treatment periods can be more immediately suggested as a measure to promote the conversion of formed by products into other compounds of lower ecotoxic potential further systematic studies are much needed to better understand the environmental hazardous potential of effective photocatalytic oxidation processes so that reclaimed water treated under these protocols can indeed be safely used the following is the supplementary data related to this article table s1 endpoints obtained in the fet test with zebrafish after 96 h of exposure to the selected water samples values represent relative to the total number of replicates 20 per water sample table s1 supplementary data to this article can be found online at
