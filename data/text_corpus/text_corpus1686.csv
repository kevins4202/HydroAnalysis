8430,study region the management of transboundary river basins is challenging given frequent divergences in political cultural developmental and conservation priorities of countries that make up the basin in the lower mekong river basin where multiple countries are beneficiaries of its water resources ensuring good quality of the river waters is crucial for sustainable development and for protecting the integrity of its ecosystems study focus the focus of this paper is on identifying an appropriate decision support tool for assisting the management of in stream nutrients and sediment concentrations taking into account the abilities to i satisfactory simulate hydrological processes and pollutant loadings in a time continuous manner ii simulate the effects of various land use change scenarios iii handle issues of data scarcity and compatibility stemming from different development policies and priorities of each administrative jurisdiction iv have a record of previous applications in a large transboundary river basin and v have a track record of use by government agencies to support decision making these criteria guide in depth analysis of 250 peer reviewed journal papers new hydrological insights for the region four models meet the pre determined criteria with ewater source providing a comparative advantage of prior use in a transboundary catchment larger than the lower mekong river basin keywords land use watershed models transboundary water resources management watershed management 1 introduction the management of non point source pollution arising from land use practices has been a long standing and significant concern for water resource managers while many options exist to deal with non point source pollution king 2018 lu and xie 2018 wang et al 2018 there are conflicting ideas of how watersheds and water resources should be managed lonergan 2018 neef et al 2018 consequently water resource managers face difficult decisions on how to balance their options so that mitigation measures implemented to address non point source pollution do not affect the catchment s livelihood and economic development in developing countries where the focus is placed on improving living standards and ensuring sustainable food supplies environmental issues are often overlooked sachs 2012 however failure to pay attention to environmental issues can lead to unsustainable development and lower economic performance schaltegger and synnestvedt 2002 without proper integrated planning and management development at a watershed scale can lead to environmental problems including loss of habitat water contamination diminishing freshwater supplies and ecosystem degradation bauer et al 2015 liao et al 2018 oeurng et al 2016 ribolzi et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 therefore it is important that watersheds are properly managed if the goal of sustaining high water quality is to be achieved this can mean implementing plans and strategies to maintain vegetation coverage to promote rainfall infiltration minimizing soil loss through deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practice such as slash and burn agriculture controlling erosion and sedimentation and minimising cuts and fill activities on hilly slopes blevins et al 2018 her et al 2017 yan et al 2015 prior research has evidenced correlations between land use and water quality chea et al 2016 guédron et al 2014 mouri et al 2011 oeurng et al 2016 yu et al 2016 studies have shown that forest agriculture and urban land covers can influence sediment and nutrient levels in rivers and streams allan et al 1997 arheimer and lidén 2000 buck et al 2004 salvia castellví et al 2005 schilling 2002 work of howarth et al 2002 demonstrated that stream nitrate concentration tends to correlate with the proportion of agricultural land use in a catchment and urbanization has been known to influence stream sediment chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen levels chang 2008 nelson and booth 2002 in addition biological oxygen demand has been found to be high in urban areas with high population density and wastewater runoff mouri et al 2011 one way to improve or sustain water quality is through appropriate land use management practices a land use management technique often suggested by researchers and water resource managers is an integrated water resources management approach cohen and davidson 2011 liu et al 2008 mitchell 2005 sokolov 2011 tas 2013 which provides a solid basis for assessing identifying and managing water resource related problems through integrated and holistic frameworks garcia 2008 mitchell 2005 integrating all aspects of a watershed land use hydrological process climate condition existing forest and vegetation cover and capacity of the receiving waterways can help water resource managers improve their policies and implement appropriate management practices goharian and burian 2018 1 1 overview of integrated watershed models with growing concerns about non point sources of pollution many researchers and government agencies have invested time and effort in the development of watershed models that can simulate relationships between land use and the quality and or quantity of water in a watershed in the united states of america for example various government agencies have a long history of developing models to assist in the management of water resources the us environmental research laboratory developed the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model usepa 2015 and the usda agricultural research service who developed the annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps model young et al 1989 in australia the federal government funded the development of source an integrated hydrological modelling platform carr and podger 2012 likewise the development of mike she was financially supported by the commission of european communities abbott et al 1986 since the development of the stanford watershed model crawford and linsley 1966 many researchers have created and used watershed models to simulate the interaction between land use and water quality seeking to gain a better understanding of their interactions and their effects on one another he et al 2008 mannik et al 2012 maranda and anctil 2015 saleh and gallego 2007 over the past few decades watershed models have been widely used to simulate runoff behaviour in an urbanizing watershed brun and band 2000 simulate water quality parameters mannik et al 2012 shafique et al 2002 assess the relationship between land use and water quality including total suspended solids and nutrients at the watershed level misigo and suzuki 2018 wang and yin 1997 simulate hydrological process he et al 2008 kite 2001 and promote environmental democracy in water resource management parisi et al 2003 wheeler et al 2018 the goal of many watershed models is to assist water resource managers in identifying crucial sources of non point source pollution so that informed decisions and adequate management can be made to minimize runoff impacts singh and frevert 2006 these models have become important tools for integrated water resource management iwrm defined as a process that considers the balancing of ecological economic and social welfare when developing and managing water and its resources xie 2006 with the advancement of computing technology models capabilities for data processing and an interdisciplinary approach to watershed management have increased in turn this has enabled the integration of physical socioeconomic and political aspects found in a watershed to be included in the assessment of the potential implications of water resources development and management as illustrated in fig 1 mirchi et al 2009 table 1si supplementary information si presents some of the most common watershed models used for the simulation of non point source pollution along with their developers regions of application and examples of application current watershed models can simulate hydrologic processes within a watershed as well as the effects of different uses and management of land on a river ecosystem devia et al 2015 romero zaliz and reinoso gordo 2018 1 2 challenges of transboundary water resources modelling despite advances in watershed model development challenges remain in their applications especially in transboundary river catchments prior research notably singh and woolhiser 2002 and singh and frevert 2006 critically reviewed and thoroughly described selected models see table 1si devia et al 2015 complemented and extended these prior reviews and further assessed models performance against observed data see table 1si their study demonstrates that simulation results are not necessarily correlated with model complexity in addition researchers have also undertaken reviews of watershed models focusing on different criteria including low flow conditions pushpalatha et al 2012 catchments dominated by drought condition trambauer et al 2013 in stream water quality chinyama et al 2014 cox 2003 integrated environmental assessment and management kelly et al 2013 however review and analysis has so far been insufficient for assessing the suitability of watershed models to simulate the water condition ie quality and quantity of transboundary river catchments large in area i e greater than 100 000 square kilometres dealing with challenges of diversity in topography and land cover also divergent data governance arrangements and policies for data collection and collation with data irregularly monitored and or monitored using different methods and techniques causes data to be incompatible the latter are the main characteristics of the lower mekong basin a transboundary river basin comprised of four countries cambodia lao pdr thailand and viet nam and an area of about 571 000 square kilometres mekong river commission 2011 due to its large area the basin has diverse topography with elevations ranging from zero metre above sea level at the mekong delta to about 2800 m above sea level in the mountainous region of lao pdr mrc 2011 the countries that make up the lower mekong basin have different development policies and priorities which have resulted in different types of monitoring data being recorded department of foreign affairs and trade 2016 while the establishment of the mekong river commission an inter governmental agency has increased data compatibility and data harmonization efforts among the lower mekong river countries capacities within government agencies tasked for collecting data are still varied and therefore data uncertainty and or incompleteness remains an issue as such watershed models selected for transboundary watersheds such as the lower mekong river basin must be able to cope with these characteristics 2 review aim and method this review aims to compile freely available watershed models and examine their suitability for transboundary watershed application a river catchment covering two or more jurisdictions a comprehensive literature search is conducted to this end using three primary sources of scholarly information google scholar the thomson reuters web of science database and science direct focusing on water science and water resources management related academic journals a number of unique characteristics associated with transboundary river basins are identified and subsequently used to identify compare and contrast the models suitability against the set criteria recommendations follow on the models capability to simulate nutrients and sediment loads and to support decision making in transboundary river basins such the lower mekong river basin the next section introduces the methodology designed for data collection and analysis 2 1 criteria for selection of relevant literature the united nations environment programme defines transboundary river basins as river systems that cross national boundaries of countries linking them not only geographically but also politically economically and environmentally unep dhi and unep 2016 as such the management of these river systems is challenging due to the different priorities in economic development and environmental conservation of each involved country further countries making up the transboundary river basins generally possess different levels of human and infrastructure capacity for water resources management as in the case of the lower mekong river basin department of foreign affairs and trade 2016 using expert opinion and local knowledge on the lower mekong basin data gaps a set of relevant criteria were established to categorise and examine models searched in the literature these include i be a freely available model with the ability to satisfactory simulate hydrologic process and pollutant loadings in a time continuous manner ii have the ability to simulate the effects of various land use change scenarios iii have the capability to handle issues of data scarcity e g complex models with onerous data requirements for example may be prohibitively high resource and computational requirements and compatibility stemming from different development policies and priorities of concerned administrative jurisdictions iv have a record of previous applications in a large transboundary river basin and v have track record of being used by government agencies to support their decision making using these criteria a decision diagram fig 2 was developed illustrating the selection process to identify the most suitable watershed model for transboundary river basin for the management of nutrients and total suspended the rationales for their developments are outlined in table 1 2 2 literature database and keywords three databases were used to identify relevant literature science direct google scholar and web of science to identify the most suitable watershed model that satisfies the set criteria section 2 1 the approach for a systematic review was adapted from moher et al 2009 and specific keywords were used to search the databases including watershed models hydrologic models land use and water quality water quality models transboundary river basin management mekong river basin and integrated watershed management fig 3 illustrates the search process undertaken to identify relevant literature for this study the key words yielded over 1 5 million results combined which were initially narrowed down to a period of publication from 2000 to 2018 duplicated records were removed and abstracts of the remaining records were initially reviewed a total of 250 peer review journals were screened most peer review papers were published in environmental modelling and software water science and technology agricultural water management journal of hydrology and journal of environmental management their proportions are shown in fig 4 3 results as stated in section 1 1 there has been a proliferation of watershed models since the development of stanford watershed model while this review begun including a broad set of watershed models some were eliminated during the initial reviewing process due to a combination of their data requirement and user licenses fig 2 these include the mike she and water evaluation and planning weap models which prior scientific reviews found to have demanding data requirements be unsuitable for large river basins with data gap issues and to be not freely available for public use jaber and shukla 2012 sandu and virsta 2015 devia et al 2015 consequently a total of 14 watershed models were initially identified table 2 a two stage selection process followed firstly models were assessed against the first two defined criteria section 2 1 fig 2 to ensure that they were i freely available time continuous models that can be used to simulate hydrologic processes and pollution loadings ii applied on catchments with a mix of land uses the initial assessment columns i and ii in table 2 shows that while all models are freely available and have the capability to simulate hydrologic processes and nutrients and sediment transport loadings not all can be applied in a time continuous manner agricultural non point source pollution agnps for instance is an event driven model that cannot be used to assess the transformation of nutrients and their process within the stream adu and kumarasamy 2018 furthermore not all models appear capable of simulating the effects of multiple land use land cover on total suspended solids and nutrients for example chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management system creams knisel 1980 has been mainly used to assess the effects of agricultural management and practice while storm water management model rossman 2004 is mostly suitable for storm water runoff and wastewater management in urban watershed of the identified models only four met all the initial assessment requirements these models are hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf soil water assessment tool swat annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps and source table 2 green coloured rows consequently only four these models were reviewed in detail and further assessed against the remaining criteria the results of the assessment follow in the next section 3 1 model 1 annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps the annualized agricultural non point source pollution model annagnps is a continuous watershed model that can be used to simulate non point source loading of sediment nutrients and pesticides in large watershed systems bingner et al 2009 it is a continued version of the agricultural non point source pollution model a distributed parameter single event computer based model developed by the usda agricultural research service young et al 1989 and enhanced in the mid 1990s to improve automation of data input for simulation of long term transport of sediment nutrients and pesticides in large watersheds bingner et al 2009 as an integrated and holistic model it allows for the generation of flow weather and pollutant loadings he 2003 annagnps subdivides a watershed into small grids to allow the effects of various management practices on water quality be simulated and assessed bhuyan et al 2003 daily runoff is determined by the scs curve number techniques usda 1972 while both the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1996 and the hydro geomorphic universal soil loss equation husle theurer and clarke 1991 are applied to determine sediment yield from sheet and rill erosion the transport of chemicals including nutrients can be estimated for both soluble and sediment adsorbed phases and is simulated based on the chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model young and shepherd 1995 data requirements for annagnps are extensive prior research by pease et al 2010 who applied the model to estimate sediment and nutrient loads from pipestem creek watershed in north dakota usa lists the inputs as including topography soil weather observed stream flow water quality land use and management data annagnps has been applied extensively worldwide to support watershed management applications have covered analysis of water quality and quantity in catchment areas of varying size though none have been carried out in transboundary river catchments for example baginska et al 2003 applied the model in a small sub catchment of the hawkesbury nepean basin australia to predict the exportation of nitrogen and phosphorus they found that while the daily simulated nutrients data deviated from the measured data model derived trends aligned with the recorded trends similarly pease et al 2010 used annagnps to estimate pollutant loads from an agriculture dominated watershed with an area of about 1700 square kilometres and found the correlation between the observed and simulated pollutant data to be poor underestimation was attributed to the size of study area and the high variability in land use and management practices additional applications of annagnps include simulation of runoff and sediment loads with satisfactory results reported for runoff simulation at event monthly and annual scales following calibration and validation chahor et al 2014 li et al 2015 licciardello et al 2007 sarangi et al 2007 however when simulating sediment loadings the model underestimated outputs suttles et al 2003 3 2 model 2 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is a continuous watershed model capable of simulating non point source runoff and pollutant loadings developed by the us environmental research laboratory it is an updated version of the 1960s stanford watershed model usepa 2015 with three main application modules and five utilities modules the model allows simulating water quality and quantity for impervious land pervious land and stream reaches the simulation of water quality and quantity over pervious land accounts for different flow types as well as chemicals transported by them simulations of water quality and quantity over impervious land segments are focused mainly on surface runoff crossette et al 2015 hspf is a time continuous model that requires extensive data input crossette et al 2015 the set up includes spatial definition of the catchment to be modelled using terrain elevation watershed boundaries a river network and land cover information thus enabling delineation of watershed and the establishment of the stream network and sub catchments runoff simulation is driven by meteorological data including precipitation temperature dewpoint solar radiation wind speed and evaporation al abed and al sharif 2008 noted that for the simulation of sediments and pollutant loadings an input of a complete meteorological dataset is required observed water quality and flow data are also needed for calibration purposes numerous applications of hspf to simulate the impacts of land use on hydrological processes and water quality of watersheds have been reported al abed and al sharif 2008 lee et al 2010 liu and tong 2011 petersen et al 2011 rolle et al 2012 lee et al 2010 state the model was effective in describing the behaviour of pollutants and could be used in various types of land cover particularly when using monitoring data acquired at hourly scale similarly rolle et al 2012 found hspf to be an effective tool for identifying the source of pollution and concluded that the model s performance was acceptable with a coefficient of determination equal to 0 64 when comparing observed and predicted pollutant concentrations in simulating nutrient runoff ribarova et al 2008 and bergman et al 2002 found good agreement between the outputs of hspf and recorded values concluding that the model can be valuable in forecasting nutrient concentrations during storm events likewise using the percent difference between observed and simulated values the model was found to perform adequately for evaluating watershed processes and best management practices in the han river basin in south korea with a catchment area of about 20 000 square kilometres jung et al 2008 3 3 model 3 the soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a semi distributed time continuous and process based model used to simulate the potential impact of land use change and management on water quality and quantity arnold et al 2012 the model was first developed and applied in the early 1990s being later on integrated with a geographic information system gis to allow input of digital topographic land use and soil data under swat surface runoff is determined by a modified scs curve number cn method hjelmfelt allen 1991 which estimates rainfall excess from a rainfall event the model also allows for the simulation of evaporation and runoff losses from drainage channels as the model is based on the hydrologic cycle and centred on the water balance equation each component of water balance can be determined at sub catchment level abbaspour et al 2015 the initial set up allows the modelled watershed to be divided into smaller sub catchments and hydrologic response units hrus the latter consist of units of homogeneous land use and management topographic and soil attributes arnold et al 2012 watershed hydrology can be simulated in land phase and in stream phase with the former allowing the determination of runoff loadings of water sediment and chemicals from each sub catchment while the latter allows the determination of the movement of these variables through the stream network of the watershed for the simulation of water quality swat integrates of the groundwater loading effects of agricultural management system model gleams and creams knisel 1980 and therefore can be used to simulate not only the river hydrologic process but also pollutant transport arnold et al 2012 a single plant growth model enables simulating the removal of water and nutrients as function of landcover type while the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams and berndt 1997 predicts sediment yielded from landcover or landuse the swat database is context dependant ie needs to be modified when used in different study areas and being a continuous and semi distributed watershed model it requires extensive data input for successful simulation adu and kumarasamy 2018 data requirements include rainfall air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation for calibration and validation purpose observed flow and water quality data are also required swat is one of the most popular watershed models implemented to assess the impact of land use change and management on water quality and quantity across a number of continents including america asia africa and europe betrie et al 2011 jayakrishnan et al 2005 lévesque et al 2008 ndomba et al 2008 xu et al 2009 reported performance on simulations vary its application on a small agricultural watershed 49 square kilometres in canada yielded satisfactory performances on a daily level but the model overestimated flow during the summer season when the flow is low lévesque et al 2008 when used to estimate runoff and for understanding the effects of agricultural practices on pollution loadings over a data poor catchment area in california saleh et al 2009 found the model underperformed for continuous flow simulation applied on the 7280 square kilometres kikuletwat river basin of tanzania where little data is available ndomba et al 2008 found the model to be moderately satisfactory with a nash sutchliffe coefficient of efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 of about 55 for calibration this value improved when more data was used when applied to estimate environmental benefits of water pollution abatement in the agriculture dominated transboundary minho river basin portugal and spain of about 17 000 square kilometres roebeling et al 2014 found swat s performance satisfactory to good with a ns value of 0 58 noteworthy is the use of swat in the lower mekong river basin for establishing a hydrologic baseline more to the point rossi 2009 used swat to evaluate the hydrology of the lower mekong river basin concluding the model performed satisfactorily for simulating river hydrology ie ns values ranging from 0 8 to 1 0 on a monthly and daily time steps the study however focused only on water quantity and not pollutant loadings likewise shrestha et al 2013 confirmed the swat s accuracy for simulating streamflow of one of the mekong river tributaries the nam ou river but pointed out it was unable to capture peak flows and produced low accuracy sediment yield simulations coefficient of determination and ns values of less than 0 6 out of maximum value of 1 3 4 model 4 ewater source source is a modelling platform developed in australia as an integrated eco hydrological modelling tool that includes algorithms for the simulation of catchment water quality and quantity and the impacts of resource management and development carr and podger 2012 under source a watershed to be modelled can be configured spatially or schematically over a set time frame depending on the modelling requirements the source platform provides a range of tools for rainfall runoff modelling including tools for tools for catchment delineation six rainfall runoff models a calibration tool regionalization methods for ungauged catchments and different land use types carr and podger 2012 the model includes export and routing methods for water quality simulation including models such as sednet prosser et al 2001 which can be used to construct sediment and nutrient budgets for a river network source can be used to simulate water resource processes of a catchment in support of enhanced governance and planning of a river basin and it can accommodate a wide range of climatic geographic policy and governance settings ewater 2012 the model has been used successfully within australia for simulating how land use change could affect sediment and nutrient concentration in the hawkesbury nepean river basin 22 000 square kilometres mannik et al 2012 assessing the effectiveness of agricultural management practice in the great barrier reef catchment for improving water quality 423 000 square kilometres shaw et al 2013 waters et al 2013 examining changes in sediment chemistry over space and time krull et al 2008 simulating nutrients and tss in a catchment area nattai river comprised of eight different types including agriculture urban and vegetated areas chong 2010 supporting the management of water resources of the oven river basin 6295 square kilometres in northern victoria barlow et al 2011 and examining impacts of land use change on hydrological processes browne et al 2008 in researching effects of water abstraction and dam release the flexible nature of the source model allowed barlow et al 2011 using it in conjunction with other models including the parameter estimated tool pest thus increasing prediction accuracy of streamflow likewise waters et al 2013 used source for ex ante assessment of land use change scenarios on sediment nutrient and herbicide loads entering the great barrier reef the modelling undertaken provided evidence to argue that levels of water pollutants could be reduced through improved land management practices applications outside australia include investigating management of nutrients in a catchment area of 77 square kilometres in the dongshan peninsula suzhou china waters et al 2012 the outputs of this study enabled identifying major sources of nutrient exported to the lake and three potential nutrient management options including the improvement of i point source management ii diffuse source management and iii the construction of wetlands a cited advantage of the source model chong 2010 is its in built capacity for delineating sub catchment boundaries when a digital elevation model is supplied enabling to disaggregate very large study areas into smaller sub catchments as needed like other hydrological simulation models source requires meteorological catchment land use land cover streamflow and in stream water quality data for simulation calibration and validation prior research barlow et al 2011 waters et al 2013 welsh et al 2013 reports very good performance as indicated by high ns up to 97 and coefficient of determination up to 0 99 in australian catchments ranging from 1748 square kilometres to 7985 square kilometres in addition to the strong performance for hydrologic processes simulation the model has also shown similarity between simulated and observed water quality constituents chong 2010 4 discussion a total of 14 watershed models were initially identified using the criteria set out in section 2 1 the first two criteria were used as screening criteria to ensure that the models further examined in detail have the capability to simulate nutrients and sediment loading from catchment with mix land use land cover several models failed to meet the first criterion column i in table 2 for example not all models reviewed are freely available and hence those failing to meet that criterion were eliminated from further analysis of those freely available that can be used to simulate hydrologic processes and pollution loading only five are time continuous and can be used to synthesize hydrologic processes and pollutant loadings over a long period of time with the complexity of managing transboundary river basins where consequences of long term development plans are uncertain time continuous models are needed to assist water resource managers in solving complex water resources and environmental conflicts such as water demand and total maximum daily pollutant loads that may affect one or more countries chu and steinman 2009 noted that while event based models are useful for understanding the fundamental of hydrologic processes time continuous models allow these processes to be synthesized and the cumulative effects of land development simulated therefore event based models were eliminated from further consideration and were not assessed against the subsequent criteria the five remaining models table 2 symbol were then examined against the second criterion column ii in table 1 to ensure that they can and have been previously used in catchments with mixed land use land cover the inclusion of mixed land use land cover is important in extensive transboundary river basins which given this characteristic tend to include different types of land uses likewise changes in any one land use land cover type particularly involving rapid conversion of large tracks of land can cause a great impact on the environment including hydrologic processes and water constituents loadings karakus et al 2015 following the results of the initial screening only four models met the first two criteria as models that can be used to simulate nutrients and tss from catchments with mixed land cover in a time continuous basis furthermore while the interaction between land use change and stream integrity has been well documented connolly et al 2015 lawniczak et al 2016 monaghan et al 2007 tu 2013 yu et al 2013 different land use types tend to generate different pollutants see section 1 in this regard only annagnps swat hspf and ewater source have been applied to simulate hydrologic processes and nutrients and sediment loadings in various river basins and evidenced prior use in catchments with mix land use land cover these four models can also anticipate ie ex ante assessment the effects of various development and land use change scenarios on water quality and quantity see section 3 4 for examples while all models have been reported as successful in their prior applications sections 3 1 3 4 the degree of their success depends greatly on data availability prior reviews of annagnps swat hspf and source have revealed that these models demand a great number of input data adu and kumarasamy 2018 chong 2010 crossette et al 2015 luo et al 2015 this can be problematic in large transboundary river basins where long term monitoring data may not be available may contain gaps and or may have insufficient frequency as discussed in section 1 2 in many instances the level of performance of watershed models has been related to the availability and quality of the input data see section 3 1 for annagnps and section 3 2 for the hspf model given that these are sophisticated models that required a large amount of data input they may not be suitable for a large transboundary river basin where data scarcity and incompatibility are major issues see section 1 2 while most models reviewed perform satisfactorily when simulating the effects of land use change on water quality and quantity only a few have been applied in a large transboundary river basin such the lower mekong river more to the point only swat and source have been applied in transboundary river catchments of relevance is that swat was used in the lower mekong river though pollutant loading simulation was excluded from this study see section 3 3 unlike source that has been applied in transboundary river catchments to simulate hydrologic processes and nutrient and sediment transport as summarised in section 3 4 being successfully applied in the australian murray darling river basin dutta et al 2012 a transboundary river basin that expands across five states and covers an area of more than one million square kilometres almost twice the size of the lower mekong basin source is a model that could cope with demands associated to watershed dimension both swat and source have been used by government agencies to support decision making on water resources management francesconi et al 2016 provided a comprehensive list of studies using swat to support decision making including assessing the effects of conservation practices identifying ecosystem services thresholds and evaluating best management practices noteworthy is that swat applications have been largely on non transboundary catchments see section 3 3 source has been adopted as a watershed modelling platform to support decision making in australia for water resource management welsh et al 2013 section 3 4 summarises satisfactory performances reported in applications related to simulation of flow water quality loading and resource management by different actors including in a large transboundary river basin ellis and searle 2013 mannik et al 2012 shaw et al 2013 other comparative advantages of source that make it a valuable integrated water management tool for large transboundary basins like the lower mekong river are flexibility of design allowing it to be customized and updated when new information and policy become available set of hydrological water balance and water quality tools in built capacity for disaggregating very large study areas into smaller sub catchments as needed 5 conclusions this paper examined freely available watershed models against a set of criteria designed to establish their suitability for simulating the effects of land use change on hydrological processes and pollutant loadings in transboundary basins characterised by diverse topography topography data scarcity and compatibility issues and complex development policies and priorities in all 14 models were examined with four models annagnps swat hspf and source being reviewed in detail given their fulfillment of all pre defined criteria including proven capability to simulate hydrologic processes and or pollutant loadings the review shows that model performance depends on a number of factors including the size of the watershed and availability of required data input previous applications of annagnps were found to be mainly in small river basins with agriculture as predominate land use hence it was concluded that there is insufficient evidence of the model s ability to deal with the complexity associated to modelling transboundary river basins of large catchment areas the lower mekong river basin encompassing four countries requires a model that works as a generic tool suitable for different jurisdictions this review shows that all models require extensive data input which could be difficult to obtain in a transboundary river basin where data scarcity and incompatibility are major issues however source has evidenced satisfactory outcomes in large transboundary river basin even with limited data input the source model appears to provide a flexible modelling environment that allows the simulation of hydrological processes and pollutant loadings from large transboundary river basins as proven in its application for the murry darling river basin furthermore source has proven track record as a decision support tool and has been used successfully for water planning and management purposes including the assessment of water quality and quantity due to land use change water demand and sharing and changes in water regulatory given the complexity associated to the management of the lower mekong river basin where four different countries have diverse development strategies and conservation priorities this review shows that the source model has a comparative advantage over the other models based on the defined criteria pertaining to the simulation of the potential effects of land use change on water quality and quantity of a transboundary river basin

hydrological insights for the region four models meet the pre determined criteria with ewater source providing a comparative advantage of prior use in a transboundary catchment larger than the lower mekong river basin keywords land use watershed models transboundary water resources management watershed management 1 introduction the management of non point source pollution arising from land use practices has been a long standing and significant concern for water resource managers while many options exist to deal with non point source pollution king 2018 lu and xie 2018 wang et al 2018 there are conflicting ideas of how watersheds and water resources should be managed lonergan 2018 neef et al 2018 consequently water resource managers face difficult decisions on how to balance their options so that mitigation measures implemented to address non point source pollution do not affect the catchment s livelihood and economic development in developing countries where the focus is placed on improving living standards and ensuring sustainable food supplies environmental issues are often overlooked sachs 2012 however failure to pay attention to environmental issues can lead to unsustainable development and lower economic performance schaltegger and synnestvedt 2002 without proper integrated planning and management development at a watershed scale can lead to environmental problems including loss of habitat water contamination diminishing freshwater supplies and ecosystem degradation bauer et al 2015 liao et al 2018 oeurng et al 2016 ribolzi et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 therefore it is important that watersheds are properly managed if the goal of sustaining high water quality is to be achieved this can mean implementing plans and strategies to maintain vegetation coverage to promote rainfall infiltration minimizing soil loss through deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practice such as slash and burn agriculture controlling erosion and sedimentation and minimising cuts and fill activities on hilly slopes blevins et al 2018 her et al 2017 yan et al 2015 prior research has evidenced correlations between land use and water quality chea et al 2016 guédron et al 2014 mouri et al 2011 oeurng et al 2016 yu et al 2016 studies have shown that forest agriculture and urban land covers can influence sediment and nutrient levels in rivers and streams allan et al 1997 arheimer and lidén 2000 buck et al 2004 salvia castellví et al 2005 schilling 2002 work of howarth et al 2002 demonstrated that stream nitrate concentration tends to correlate with the proportion of agricultural land use in a catchment and urbanization has been known to influence stream sediment chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen levels chang 2008 nelson and booth 2002 in addition biological oxygen demand has been found to be high in urban areas with high population density and wastewater runoff mouri et al 2011 one way to improve or sustain water quality is through appropriate land use management practices a land use management technique often suggested by researchers and water resource managers is an integrated water resources management approach cohen and davidson 2011 liu et al 2008 mitchell 2005 sokolov 2011 tas 2013 which provides a solid basis for assessing identifying and managing water resource related problems through integrated and holistic frameworks garcia 2008 mitchell 2005 integrating all aspects of a watershed land use hydrological process climate condition existing forest and vegetation cover and capacity of the receiving waterways can help water resource managers improve their policies and implement appropriate management practices goharian and burian 2018 1 1 overview of integrated watershed models with growing concerns about non point sources of pollution many researchers and government agencies have invested time and effort in the development of watershed models that can simulate relationships between land use and the quality and or quantity of water in a watershed in the united states of america for example various government agencies have a long history of developing models to assist in the management of water resources the us environmental research laboratory developed the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf model usepa 2015 and the usda agricultural research service who developed the annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps model young et al 1989 in australia the federal government funded the development of source an integrated hydrological modelling platform carr and podger 2012 likewise the development of mike she was financially supported by the commission of european communities abbott et al 1986 since the development of the stanford watershed model crawford and linsley 1966 many researchers have created and used watershed models to simulate the interaction between land use and water quality seeking to gain a better understanding of their interactions and their effects on one another he et al 2008 mannik et al 2012 maranda and anctil 2015 saleh and gallego 2007 over the past few decades watershed models have been widely used to simulate runoff behaviour in an urbanizing watershed brun and band 2000 simulate water quality parameters mannik et al 2012 shafique et al 2002 assess the relationship between land use and water quality including total suspended solids and nutrients at the watershed level misigo and suzuki 2018 wang and yin 1997 simulate hydrological process he et al 2008 kite 2001 and promote environmental democracy in water resource management parisi et al 2003 wheeler et al 2018 the goal of many watershed models is to assist water resource managers in identifying crucial sources of non point source pollution so that informed decisions and adequate management can be made to minimize runoff impacts singh and frevert 2006 these models have become important tools for integrated water resource management iwrm defined as a process that considers the balancing of ecological economic and social welfare when developing and managing water and its resources xie 2006 with the advancement of computing technology models capabilities for data processing and an interdisciplinary approach to watershed management have increased in turn this has enabled the integration of physical socioeconomic and political aspects found in a watershed to be included in the assessment of the potential implications of water resources development and management as illustrated in fig 1 mirchi et al 2009 table 1si supplementary information si presents some of the most common watershed models used for the simulation of non point source pollution along with their developers regions of application and examples of application current watershed models can simulate hydrologic processes within a watershed as well as the effects of different uses and management of land on a river ecosystem devia et al 2015 romero zaliz and reinoso gordo 2018 1 2 challenges of transboundary water resources modelling despite advances in watershed model development challenges remain in their applications especially in transboundary river catchments prior research notably singh and woolhiser 2002 and singh and frevert 2006 critically reviewed and thoroughly described selected models see table 1si devia et al 2015 complemented and extended these prior reviews and further assessed models performance against observed data see table 1si their study demonstrates that simulation results are not necessarily correlated with model complexity in addition researchers have also undertaken reviews of watershed models focusing on different criteria including low flow conditions pushpalatha et al 2012 catchments dominated by drought condition trambauer et al 2013 in stream water quality chinyama et al 2014 cox 2003 integrated environmental assessment and management kelly et al 2013 however review and analysis has so far been insufficient for assessing the suitability of watershed models to simulate the water condition ie quality and quantity of transboundary river catchments large in area i e greater than 100 000 square kilometres dealing with challenges of diversity in topography and land cover also divergent data governance arrangements and policies for data collection and collation with data irregularly monitored and or monitored using different methods and techniques causes data to be incompatible the latter are the main characteristics of the lower mekong basin a transboundary river basin comprised of four countries cambodia lao pdr thailand and viet nam and an area of about 571 000 square kilometres mekong river commission 2011 due to its large area the basin has diverse topography with elevations ranging from zero metre above sea level at the mekong delta to about 2800 m above sea level in the mountainous region of lao pdr mrc 2011 the countries that make up the lower mekong basin have different development policies and priorities which have resulted in different types of monitoring data being recorded department of foreign affairs and trade 2016 while the establishment of the mekong river commission an inter governmental agency has increased data compatibility and data harmonization efforts among the lower mekong river countries capacities within government agencies tasked for collecting data are still varied and therefore data uncertainty and or incompleteness remains an issue as such watershed models selected for transboundary watersheds such as the lower mekong river basin must be able to cope with these characteristics 2 review aim and method this review aims to compile freely available watershed models and examine their suitability for transboundary watershed application a river catchment covering two or more jurisdictions a comprehensive literature search is conducted to this end using three primary sources of scholarly information google scholar the thomson reuters web of science database and science direct focusing on water science and water resources management related academic journals a number of unique characteristics associated with transboundary river basins are identified and subsequently used to identify compare and contrast the models suitability against the set criteria recommendations follow on the models capability to simulate nutrients and sediment loads and to support decision making in transboundary river basins such the lower mekong river basin the next section introduces the methodology designed for data collection and analysis 2 1 criteria for selection of relevant literature the united nations environment programme defines transboundary river basins as river systems that cross national boundaries of countries linking them not only geographically but also politically economically and environmentally unep dhi and unep 2016 as such the management of these river systems is challenging due to the different priorities in economic development and environmental conservation of each involved country further countries making up the transboundary river basins generally possess different levels of human and infrastructure capacity for water resources management as in the case of the lower mekong river basin department of foreign affairs and trade 2016 using expert opinion and local knowledge on the lower mekong basin data gaps a set of relevant criteria were established to categorise and examine models searched in the literature these include i be a freely available model with the ability to satisfactory simulate hydrologic process and pollutant loadings in a time continuous manner ii have the ability to simulate the effects of various land use change scenarios iii have the capability to handle issues of data scarcity e g complex models with onerous data requirements for example may be prohibitively high resource and computational requirements and compatibility stemming from different development policies and priorities of concerned administrative jurisdictions iv have a record of previous applications in a large transboundary river basin and v have track record of being used by government agencies to support their decision making using these criteria a decision diagram fig 2 was developed illustrating the selection process to identify the most suitable watershed model for transboundary river basin for the management of nutrients and total suspended the rationales for their developments are outlined in table 1 2 2 literature database and keywords three databases were used to identify relevant literature science direct google scholar and web of science to identify the most suitable watershed model that satisfies the set criteria section 2 1 the approach for a systematic review was adapted from moher et al 2009 and specific keywords were used to search the databases including watershed models hydrologic models land use and water quality water quality models transboundary river basin management mekong river basin and integrated watershed management fig 3 illustrates the search process undertaken to identify relevant literature for this study the key words yielded over 1 5 million results combined which were initially narrowed down to a period of publication from 2000 to 2018 duplicated records were removed and abstracts of the remaining records were initially reviewed a total of 250 peer review journals were screened most peer review papers were published in environmental modelling and software water science and technology agricultural water management journal of hydrology and journal of environmental management their proportions are shown in fig 4 3 results as stated in section 1 1 there has been a proliferation of watershed models since the development of stanford watershed model while this review begun including a broad set of watershed models some were eliminated during the initial reviewing process due to a combination of their data requirement and user licenses fig 2 these include the mike she and water evaluation and planning weap models which prior scientific reviews found to have demanding data requirements be unsuitable for large river basins with data gap issues and to be not freely available for public use jaber and shukla 2012 sandu and virsta 2015 devia et al 2015 consequently a total of 14 watershed models were initially identified table 2 a two stage selection process followed firstly models were assessed against the first two defined criteria section 2 1 fig 2 to ensure that they were i freely available time continuous models that can be used to simulate hydrologic processes and pollution loadings ii applied on catchments with a mix of land uses the initial assessment columns i and ii in table 2 shows that while all models are freely available and have the capability to simulate hydrologic processes and nutrients and sediment transport loadings not all can be applied in a time continuous manner agricultural non point source pollution agnps for instance is an event driven model that cannot be used to assess the transformation of nutrients and their process within the stream adu and kumarasamy 2018 furthermore not all models appear capable of simulating the effects of multiple land use land cover on total suspended solids and nutrients for example chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management system creams knisel 1980 has been mainly used to assess the effects of agricultural management and practice while storm water management model rossman 2004 is mostly suitable for storm water runoff and wastewater management in urban watershed of the identified models only four met all the initial assessment requirements these models are hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf soil water assessment tool swat annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps and source table 2 green coloured rows consequently only four these models were reviewed in detail and further assessed against the remaining criteria the results of the assessment follow in the next section 3 1 model 1 annualized agricultural non point source pollution annagnps the annualized agricultural non point source pollution model annagnps is a continuous watershed model that can be used to simulate non point source loading of sediment nutrients and pesticides in large watershed systems bingner et al 2009 it is a continued version of the agricultural non point source pollution model a distributed parameter single event computer based model developed by the usda agricultural research service young et al 1989 and enhanced in the mid 1990s to improve automation of data input for simulation of long term transport of sediment nutrients and pesticides in large watersheds bingner et al 2009 as an integrated and holistic model it allows for the generation of flow weather and pollutant loadings he 2003 annagnps subdivides a watershed into small grids to allow the effects of various management practices on water quality be simulated and assessed bhuyan et al 2003 daily runoff is determined by the scs curve number techniques usda 1972 while both the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1996 and the hydro geomorphic universal soil loss equation husle theurer and clarke 1991 are applied to determine sediment yield from sheet and rill erosion the transport of chemicals including nutrients can be estimated for both soluble and sediment adsorbed phases and is simulated based on the chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model young and shepherd 1995 data requirements for annagnps are extensive prior research by pease et al 2010 who applied the model to estimate sediment and nutrient loads from pipestem creek watershed in north dakota usa lists the inputs as including topography soil weather observed stream flow water quality land use and management data annagnps has been applied extensively worldwide to support watershed management applications have covered analysis of water quality and quantity in catchment areas of varying size though none have been carried out in transboundary river catchments for example baginska et al 2003 applied the model in a small sub catchment of the hawkesbury nepean basin australia to predict the exportation of nitrogen and phosphorus they found that while the daily simulated nutrients data deviated from the measured data model derived trends aligned with the recorded trends similarly pease et al 2010 used annagnps to estimate pollutant loads from an agriculture dominated watershed with an area of about 1700 square kilometres and found the correlation between the observed and simulated pollutant data to be poor underestimation was attributed to the size of study area and the high variability in land use and management practices additional applications of annagnps include simulation of runoff and sediment loads with satisfactory results reported for runoff simulation at event monthly and annual scales following calibration and validation chahor et al 2014 li et al 2015 licciardello et al 2007 sarangi et al 2007 however when simulating sediment loadings the model underestimated outputs suttles et al 2003 3 2 model 2 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is a continuous watershed model capable of simulating non point source runoff and pollutant loadings developed by the us environmental research laboratory it is an updated version of the 1960s stanford watershed model usepa 2015 with three main application modules and five utilities modules the model allows simulating water quality and quantity for impervious land pervious land and stream reaches the simulation of water quality and quantity over pervious land accounts for different flow types as well as chemicals transported by them simulations of water quality and quantity over impervious land segments are focused mainly on surface runoff crossette et al 2015 hspf is a time continuous model that requires extensive data input crossette et al 2015 the set up includes spatial definition of the catchment to be modelled using terrain elevation watershed boundaries a river network and land cover information thus enabling delineation of watershed and the establishment of the stream network and sub catchments runoff simulation is driven by meteorological data including precipitation temperature dewpoint solar radiation wind speed and evaporation al abed and al sharif 2008 noted that for the simulation of sediments and pollutant loadings an input of a complete meteorological dataset is required observed water quality and flow data are also needed for calibration purposes numerous applications of hspf to simulate the impacts of land use on hydrological processes and water quality of watersheds have been reported al abed and al sharif 2008 lee et al 2010 liu and tong 2011 petersen et al 2011 rolle et al 2012 lee et al 2010 state the model was effective in describing the behaviour of pollutants and could be used in various types of land cover particularly when using monitoring data acquired at hourly scale similarly rolle et al 2012 found hspf to be an effective tool for identifying the source of pollution and concluded that the model s performance was acceptable with a coefficient of determination equal to 0 64 when comparing observed and predicted pollutant concentrations in simulating nutrient runoff ribarova et al 2008 and bergman et al 2002 found good agreement between the outputs of hspf and recorded values concluding that the model can be valuable in forecasting nutrient concentrations during storm events likewise using the percent difference between observed and simulated values the model was found to perform adequately for evaluating watershed processes and best management practices in the han river basin in south korea with a catchment area of about 20 000 square kilometres jung et al 2008 3 3 model 3 the soil and water assessment tool swat swat is a semi distributed time continuous and process based model used to simulate the potential impact of land use change and management on water quality and quantity arnold et al 2012 the model was first developed and applied in the early 1990s being later on integrated with a geographic information system gis to allow input of digital topographic land use and soil data under swat surface runoff is determined by a modified scs curve number cn method hjelmfelt allen 1991 which estimates rainfall excess from a rainfall event the model also allows for the simulation of evaporation and runoff losses from drainage channels as the model is based on the hydrologic cycle and centred on the water balance equation each component of water balance can be determined at sub catchment level abbaspour et al 2015 the initial set up allows the modelled watershed to be divided into smaller sub catchments and hydrologic response units hrus the latter consist of units of homogeneous land use and management topographic and soil attributes arnold et al 2012 watershed hydrology can be simulated in land phase and in stream phase with the former allowing the determination of runoff loadings of water sediment and chemicals from each sub catchment while the latter allows the determination of the movement of these variables through the stream network of the watershed for the simulation of water quality swat integrates of the groundwater loading effects of agricultural management system model gleams and creams knisel 1980 and therefore can be used to simulate not only the river hydrologic process but also pollutant transport arnold et al 2012 a single plant growth model enables simulating the removal of water and nutrients as function of landcover type while the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams and berndt 1997 predicts sediment yielded from landcover or landuse the swat database is context dependant ie needs to be modified when used in different study areas and being a continuous and semi distributed watershed model it requires extensive data input for successful simulation adu and kumarasamy 2018 data requirements include rainfall air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation for calibration and validation purpose observed flow and water quality data are also required swat is one of the most popular watershed models implemented to assess the impact of land use change and management on water quality and quantity across a number of continents including america asia africa and europe betrie et al 2011 jayakrishnan et al 2005 lévesque et al 2008 ndomba et al 2008 xu et al 2009 reported performance on simulations vary its application on a small agricultural watershed 49 square kilometres in canada yielded satisfactory performances on a daily level but the model overestimated flow during the summer season when the flow is low lévesque et al 2008 when used to estimate runoff and for understanding the effects of agricultural practices on pollution loadings over a data poor catchment area in california saleh et al 2009 found the model underperformed for continuous flow simulation applied on the 7280 square kilometres kikuletwat river basin of tanzania where little data is available ndomba et al 2008 found the model to be moderately satisfactory with a nash sutchliffe coefficient of efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 of about 55 for calibration this value improved when more data was used when applied to estimate environmental benefits of water pollution abatement in the agriculture dominated transboundary minho river basin portugal and spain of about 17 000 square kilometres roebeling et al 2014 found swat s performance satisfactory to good with a ns value of 0 58 noteworthy is the use of swat in the lower mekong river basin for establishing a hydrologic baseline more to the point rossi 2009 used swat to evaluate the hydrology of the lower mekong river basin concluding the model performed satisfactorily for simulating river hydrology ie ns values ranging from 0 8 to 1 0 on a monthly and daily time steps the study however focused only on water quantity and not pollutant loadings likewise shrestha et al 2013 confirmed the swat s accuracy for simulating streamflow of one of the mekong river tributaries the nam ou river but pointed out it was unable to capture peak flows and produced low accuracy sediment yield simulations coefficient of determination and ns values of less than 0 6 out of maximum value of 1 3 4 model 4 ewater source source is a modelling platform developed in australia as an integrated eco hydrological modelling tool that includes algorithms for the simulation of catchment water quality and quantity and the impacts of resource management and development carr and podger 2012 under source a watershed to be modelled can be configured spatially or schematically over a set time frame depending on the modelling requirements the source platform provides a range of tools for rainfall runoff modelling including tools for tools for catchment delineation six rainfall runoff models a calibration tool regionalization methods for ungauged catchments and different land use types carr and podger 2012 the model includes export and routing methods for water quality simulation including models such as sednet prosser et al 2001 which can be used to construct sediment and nutrient budgets for a river network source can be used to simulate water resource processes of a catchment in support of enhanced governance and planning of a river basin and it can accommodate a wide range of climatic geographic policy and governance settings ewater 2012 the model has been used successfully within australia for simulating how land use change could affect sediment and nutrient concentration in the hawkesbury nepean river basin 22 000 square kilometres mannik et al 2012 assessing the effectiveness of agricultural management practice in the great barrier reef catchment for improving water quality 423 000 square kilometres shaw et al 2013 waters et al 2013 examining changes in sediment chemistry over space and time krull et al 2008 simulating nutrients and tss in a catchment area nattai river comprised of eight different types including agriculture urban and vegetated areas chong 2010 supporting the management of water resources of the oven river basin 6295 square kilometres in northern victoria barlow et al 2011 and examining impacts of land use change on hydrological processes browne et al 2008 in researching effects of water abstraction and dam release the flexible nature of the source model allowed barlow et al 2011 using it in conjunction with other models including the parameter estimated tool pest thus increasing prediction accuracy of streamflow likewise waters et al 2013 used source for ex ante assessment of land use change scenarios on sediment nutrient and herbicide loads entering the great barrier reef the modelling undertaken provided evidence to argue that levels of water pollutants could be reduced through improved land management practices applications outside australia include investigating management of nutrients in a catchment area of 77 square kilometres in the dongshan peninsula suzhou china waters et al 2012 the outputs of this study enabled identifying major sources of nutrient exported to the lake and three potential nutrient management options including the improvement of i point source management ii diffuse source management and iii the construction of wetlands a cited advantage of the source model chong 2010 is its in built capacity for delineating sub catchment boundaries when a digital elevation model is supplied enabling to disaggregate very large study areas into smaller sub catchments as needed like other hydrological simulation models source requires meteorological catchment land use land cover streamflow and in stream water quality data for simulation calibration and validation prior research barlow et al 2011 waters et al 2013 welsh et al 2013 reports very good performance as indicated by high ns up to 97 and coefficient of determination up to 0 99 in australian catchments ranging from 1748 square kilometres to 7985 square kilometres in addition to the strong performance for hydrologic processes simulation the model has also shown similarity between simulated and observed water quality constituents chong 2010 4 discussion a total of 14 watershed models were initially identified using the criteria set out in section 2 1 the first two criteria were used as screening criteria to ensure that the models further examined in detail have the capability to simulate nutrients and sediment loading from catchment with mix land use land cover several models failed to meet the first criterion column i in table 2 for example not all models reviewed are freely available and hence those failing to meet that criterion were eliminated from further analysis of those freely available that can be used to simulate hydrologic processes and pollution loading only five are time continuous and can be used to synthesize hydrologic processes and pollutant loadings over a long period of time with the complexity of managing transboundary river basins where consequences of long term development plans are uncertain time continuous models are needed to assist water resource managers in solving complex water resources and environmental conflicts such as water demand and total maximum daily pollutant loads that may affect one or more countries chu and steinman 2009 noted that while event based models are useful for understanding the fundamental of hydrologic processes time continuous models allow these processes to be synthesized and the cumulative effects of land development simulated therefore event based models were eliminated from further consideration and were not assessed against the subsequent criteria the five remaining models table 2 symbol were then examined against the second criterion column ii in table 1 to ensure that they can and have been previously used in catchments with mixed land use land cover the inclusion of mixed land use land cover is important in extensive transboundary river basins which given this characteristic tend to include different types of land uses likewise changes in any one land use land cover type particularly involving rapid conversion of large tracks of land can cause a great impact on the environment including hydrologic processes and water constituents loadings karakus et al 2015 following the results of the initial screening only four models met the first two criteria as models that can be used to simulate nutrients and tss from catchments with mixed land cover in a time continuous basis furthermore while the interaction between land use change and stream integrity has been well documented connolly et al 2015 lawniczak et al 2016 monaghan et al 2007 tu 2013 yu et al 2013 different land use types tend to generate different pollutants see section 1 in this regard only annagnps swat hspf and ewater source have been applied to simulate hydrologic processes and nutrients and sediment loadings in various river basins and evidenced prior use in catchments with mix land use land cover these four models can also anticipate ie ex ante assessment the effects of various development and land use change scenarios on water quality and quantity see section 3 4 for examples while all models have been reported as successful in their prior applications sections 3 1 3 4 the degree of their success depends greatly on data availability prior reviews of annagnps swat hspf and source have revealed that these models demand a great number of input data adu and kumarasamy 2018 chong 2010 crossette et al 2015 luo et al 2015 this can be problematic in large transboundary river basins where long term monitoring data may not be available may contain gaps and or may have insufficient frequency as discussed in section 1 2 in many instances the level of performance of watershed models has been related to the availability and quality of the input data see section 3 1 for annagnps and section 3 2 for the hspf model given that these are sophisticated models that required a large amount of data input they may not be suitable for a large transboundary river basin where data scarcity and incompatibility are major issues see section 1 2 while most models reviewed perform satisfactorily when simulating the effects of land use change on water quality and quantity only a few have been applied in a large transboundary river basin such the lower mekong river more to the point only swat and source have been applied in transboundary river catchments of relevance is that swat was used in the lower mekong river though pollutant loading simulation was excluded from this study see section 3 3 unlike source that has been applied in transboundary river catchments to simulate hydrologic processes and nutrient and sediment transport as summarised in section 3 4 being successfully applied in the australian murray darling river basin dutta et al 2012 a transboundary river basin that expands across five states and covers an area of more than one million square kilometres almost twice the size of the lower mekong basin source is a model that could cope with demands associated to watershed dimension both swat and source have been used by government agencies to support decision making on water resources management francesconi et al 2016 provided a comprehensive list of studies using swat to support decision making including assessing the effects of conservation practices identifying ecosystem services thresholds and evaluating best management practices noteworthy is that swat applications have been largely on non transboundary catchments see section 3 3 source has been adopted as a watershed modelling platform to support decision making in australia for water resource management welsh et al 2013 section 3 4 summarises satisfactory performances reported in applications related to simulation of flow water quality loading and resource management by different actors including in a large transboundary river basin ellis and searle 2013 mannik et al 2012 shaw et al 2013 other comparative advantages of source that make it a valuable integrated water management tool for large transboundary basins like the lower mekong river are flexibility of design allowing it to be customized and updated when new information and policy become available set of hydrological water balance and water quality tools in built capacity for disaggregating very large study areas into smaller sub catchments as needed 5 conclusions this paper examined freely available watershed models against a set of criteria designed to establish their suitability for simulating the effects of land use change on hydrological processes and pollutant loadings in transboundary basins characterised by diverse topography topography data scarcity and compatibility issues and complex development policies and priorities in all 14 models were examined with four models annagnps swat hspf and source being reviewed in detail given their fulfillment of all pre defined criteria including proven capability to simulate hydrologic processes and or pollutant loadings the review shows that model performance depends on a number of factors including the size of the watershed and availability of required data input previous applications of annagnps were found to be mainly in small river basins with agriculture as predominate land use hence it was concluded that there is insufficient evidence of the model s ability to deal with the complexity associated to modelling transboundary river basins of large catchment areas the lower mekong river basin encompassing four countries requires a model that works as a generic tool suitable for different jurisdictions this review shows that all models require extensive data input which could be difficult to obtain in a transboundary river basin where data scarcity and incompatibility are major issues however source has evidenced satisfactory outcomes in large transboundary river basin even with limited data input the source model appears to provide a flexible modelling environment that allows the simulation of hydrological processes and pollutant loadings from large transboundary river basins as proven in its application for the murry darling river basin furthermore source has proven track record as a decision support tool and has been used successfully for water planning and management purposes including the assessment of water quality and quantity due to land use change water demand and sharing and changes in water regulatory given the complexity associated to the management of the lower mekong river basin where four different countries have diverse development strategies and conservation priorities this review shows that the source model has a comparative advantage over the other models based on the defined criteria pertaining to the simulation of the potential effects of land use change on water quality and quantity of a transboundary river basin

groundwater potential mapping in guna tana landscape will have a significant effect in the region as well as the country since the landscape is the major part to contribute to lake tana and upper blue nile river mapping the underground water will enhance sustainable management of groundwater resources in the country in the present study the mcda method employed to develop groundwater potential zones which could be useful for decision makers policy makers and water resources planners for effective and sustainable use of groundwater resource the main objectives of this study are a to develop thematic layers for groundwater potential zone development b to identify and delineate suitable groundwater potential zones through the integration of different thematic layers c to prepare spatial variability of groundwater zones and d to demonstrate the capabilities of remote sensing and gis in groundwater mapping 2 methodology soil 30 30 m resolution and digital elevation model 30 30 m resolution were collected from the ministry of water irrigation and electricity of ethiopia land cover image 30 х 30 m resolution downloaded from usgs earth explorer website for januar 2018 the land cover map was prepared by classifying the satellite image and verifying with ground truth points the geology and lineament map at a scale of 1 250 000 were collected from the geological survey of ethiopia slope drainage and elevation maps were derived from the digital elevation model while drainage density and lineament density maps were derived from drainage and lineament maps respectively all the required thematic maps were developed from the collected datasets using arcgis 10 3 1 software 2 1 description of the study area guna tana landscape is situated in the north west part of ethiopia between 11 35 to 12 19 n latitude and 37 27 to 38 14 e longitudes fig 1 this landscape comprised of two watersheds namely gumara and ribb the landscape at the outlet to lake tana covers an area of 3545 km2 which has been delineated from the digital elevation model dem this area covers about 30 5 of lake tana basin contributing a large amount of inflow into lake tana the topography of the study area ranges from 1752 m a m s l at lake tana to 4090 m a m s l at mount guna gumara and rib rivers are originated from small springs located near guna moutain at an elevation of 4090 m a m s l and drains to the eastern part of lake tana the higher elevation ranges are located at the eastern corner guna mount area while the remaining area is relatively uniform in guna tana landscape groundwater is used mainly for domestic purposes sometimes it is used to supplement the deficit irrigation in downstream parts of the landscape the need for supplementary irrigation in lower parts of the landscape and domestic use in upper parts of the landscape is very high in lower parts of the landscape especially in fogera flood plain there is a conflict of interest for supplementing the required amount of water needed for their croplands upper parts of the study area also had a problem of water for the domestic purpose debre tabor town water users gets water once only in a week even though there are a lot of wells which were extracted to supplement the domestic water requirement still the scarcity water is very severing which needs great attention 2 2 thematic map preparation 2 2 1 geology the geological or lithological features of the study area are shown in fig 2 a the study area consists of ten different types of lithological features viz debre tabor basalts and trachyte quaternary lacustrine sediment middle basalt flows upper basalts and trachyte and guna tuff table 1 2 2 2 slope guna tana landscape is characterized by undulating terrain varying from plains to steep slope hills the slope theme of the study area was developed from the digital elevation model 30 х 30 m resolution the slope percentage of guna tana landscape varies from 0 to 67 7 based on the slope percentage the study area has been reclassified into five slope classes the major parts of the landscape were found in slope class 1 0 5 which covers 43 12 of the study area suitable weights were assigned to each slope class depending on their groundwater potential fig 2b and table 2 2 2 3 soils chromic luvisols eutric leptosols haplic luvisols and eutric fluvisol are the major soils found in the study area fig 3 a and table 3 with loam sandy loam and clay texture these soils are characterized by poor to moderate infiltration property 2 2 4 land use land cover the land cover map was prepared from the satellite image of january 2018 downloaded from usgs earth explorer and classified using erdas imagine remote sensing tool the study area consists of six types of land cover viz cultivated grassland shrubland forest bare land and water the major parts of the landscape were dominated by cultivated agriculture followed by grassland covering about 64 67 and 14 17 of the study area respectively fig 3b and table 4 2 2 5 lineament density the lineament density of guna tana landscape was prepared from the lineament feature collected from geological survey of ethiopia with a resolution scale of 1 250 000 this study used lineament density ld for groundwater targeting in the study area lineaments represent the total length of lineaments in a unit area as expressed in eq 1 yeh et al 2016 1 l d i 1 i n l i a where i 1 i n l i represents the total length of lineaments l and a represents a unit area l2 in this study the lineament density was categorized into three classes fig 4 b lineament with densities ranging from 0 0 1 km km2 were dominating the study area with their areal extent of 3138 km2 88 44 table 5 of the landscape lineament density is directly proportional to groundwater potential areas having a lineament density between 0 2 and 0 25 km km2 were considered as excellent groundwater prospect zone covering about 3 49 of the landscape 2 2 6 drainage density the drainage density km km2 expresses the closeness of spacing of stream channels thus providing a quantitative measurement of the average length of stream channels of the whole basin strahler 1964 singh et al 2014 the drainage density has an inverse relation with the permeability of aquifers and plays a vital role in the runoff distribution and level of infiltration the drainage density of guna tana landscape was prepared from the digital elevation model 30 m х 30 m resolution in arcgis 10 3 1 platform about 46 6 and 32 2 of the area were found in very low 0 0 25 km km2 and low 0 25 0 5 km km2 drainage density classes respectively fig 4a 2 2 7 geomorphology geomorphology of an area is an important factor used for assessing the groundwater potential and prospect because it controls the subsurface movement of groundwater in guna tana landscape there are about 11 types of landforms fig 5 the major parts of the landscape are covered with plain and high gradient hill which are manifested by hills uplands and undulating surfaces 2 3 weight assignment multi criteria decision analysis was employed to determine the respective weights of the determinant thematic maps table 6 the groundwater conditioning factors were weighted based on expert knowledge and literature review of several researchers yeh et al 2016 nampak et al 2014 naghibi et al 2017 rajaveni et al 2017 ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 rahmati et al 2015 weighted sum overlay tool was utilized to overlay the thematic maps the pairwise comparison between each thematic layer obtained based on the methods employed by several researchers machiwal et al 2011 sahoo et al 2015 chowdhury et al 2010 2009 and presented in table 7 the normalized weights of the individual themes and their different layers were calculated using the ahp method the pairs of criteria ci in the row and cj in the column were considered based on 1 which criterion was important ci or cj and 2 how much the said criterion is more important relative to the lesser important criterion the normalized weights were determined by dividing each ci row values by the column total table 7 in this study the consistency ratio cr is found 0 029 this ratio reflects a reasonable level of consistency in the pair wise comparison phase therefore it can be seen that ahp models applied in this study showed reasonably good accuracy in spatial predicting of groundwater probability eutric vertisols clay textured soils were considered excellent groundwater prospect since the drainage characteristic is poor soils with poor drainage property had high soil water holding capacity on the other hand soils with well drainage characteristic are poor in groundwater storage therefore high relative influence values were given to eutric vertisols table 8 and table 10 the characteristics of each of the lithologic group were taken from workineh et al 2010 lacustrine sediment type of lithology was given high influence value with regard to groundwater potential due its loose and friable nature which leads high infiltration ability of the precipitation that reaches to this lithologic group while other lithologic groups with columnar massive and compact nature considered as poor groundwater prospect which has been given very low influencing value table 9 and table 10 according to the characteristics of the theme feature and its relation to groundwater contribution weights have been assigned the geometric mean and normalized weights table 10 were developed based on the assigned weight to each feature and pairwise comparison between the feature classes areas having high lineament density was characterized as high groundwater recharge areas yeh et al 2016 nampak et al 2014 naghibi et al 2017 rajaveni et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2012 areas with high drainage density were assigned very low weight ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 rahmati et al 2015 yildiz 2004 rajaveni et al 2017 low slope to flat areas was given the highest priority for groundwater recharge and storage since it had more concentration time to remain on the ground surface and percolate into the subsurface while steep slopes favor the rainfall to flow as a runoff rather than percolating to the subsurface hence categorized as very poor groundwater potential area rajaveni et al 2017 the overall methodology employed in this study is presented in fig 6 2 4 groundwater potential map development the groundwater potential map was developed by overlaying the determinant groundwater contributing thematic layers the groundwater prospect zones were evaluated based on the groundwater potential index gwpi computed from the integration of all groundwater influencing thematic layers the weighted overlay analysis tool was used to compute groundwater potential index values using the equation proposed by malczewski 1999 2 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature of the thematic layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of features of a given theme the gwpi values were used to classify whether an area is excellent very good moderate poor or very poor with respect to groundwater potential jha et al 2010 chowdhury et al 2010 sahoo et al 2015 2 5 validation of groundwater maps the results of groundwater potential maps were validated using the existing hand dug and bore wells pumping test data the existing pumping wells map in the study area were prepared and overlaid with the groundwater prospect map developed in arc gis environment the receiver operating characteristic curve roc and area under the curve auc were used as a performance indicator for the validation of groundwater potential map developed using thematic maps naghibi et al 2016 the pumping well discharge and depth to the groundwater below the ground surface maps of the existing pumping wells were also overlaid with the developed groundwater prospect maps 3 results and discussions 3 1 groundwater prospect zones the groundwater prospect map of the study area showed that the downstream parts had high potential excellent prospect zone due to the flat slope which leads to a higher rate of infiltration the groundwater potential index map of guna tana landscape has been prepared using multi criteria decision fig 7 a based on gwpi values groundwater prospect zones classified into five groups table 11 using the jenks natural break classification method of arcgis environment the groundwater prospect map indicated that downstream areas of the landscape have higher groundwater potential than upstream areas this was due to flat terrain with a very high tendency to infiltrate more water and lacustrine sediment nature of lithology the northern parts of the landscape showed with very poor groundwater exposure the results of this study showed that about 23 8 and 13 4 of the area had an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively table 11 and fig 7a the results obtained using overlay analysis were compared with the static water table depth to the groundwater below the ground surface and pumping well discharge maps developed from the existing pumping wells according to bevan et al 2005 the water table level is defined as the surface at which pore pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure water table level indicates hydraulic gradients of any point hence it can be useful to identify the area with high groundwater potential the depth to the groundwater below the ground surface fig 7c and pumping well discharge maps fig 7b prepared from pumping wells by using kriging method of interpolation revealed that downstream and southern parts of the landscape lie under very good and excellent groundwater condition this indicated that groundwater could be one of the sustainable water management tools in the area which can be used for different water resources development activities 3 2 groundwater map validation for quantitative validation receiver operating characteristic roc curve analysis was used by comparing the existing groundwater well locations fig 7b in the validation of datasets with the groundwater potential map developed by mcda moghaddam et al 2015 regmi et al 2013 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 for validating the predicted groundwater prospect map 300 existing wells were collected and used for roc curve preparation fig 8 has shown the roc curve of the groundwater potential map obtained using mcda technique in roc curve the true positive rate sensitivity is plotted in function of the false positive rate for different cut off points of a parameter each point on the roc curve represents a sensitivity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold the area under the roc curve auc is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups the relationship between auc and prediction accuracy can be summarized as yesilnacar and topal 2005 naghibi et al 2015 poor 0 5 0 6 average 0 6 0 7 good 0 7 0 8 very good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 the validation of results revealed that ahp has a fairly good prediction of 0 705 therefore the results of groundwater potential maps obtained using the ahp method has been considered as a good prediction 4 conclusions groundwater is a vital resource for sustainable growth of the country with sustainable management of water resources remote sensing and gis have integrated for evaluating groundwater potential zones of the study area using the different thematic maps prepared like geology soil land use lineament density and drainage density the weight of thematic layers was assigned based on their characteristic for groundwater contribution and were overlaid and integrated for groundwater potential zone development this study is very important for sustainable use of groundwater resources for developmental activities and thereby used for increasing groundwater recharge by adopting proper management the groundwater prospect map indicated that downstream areas of the landscape have higher groundwater potential than upstream areas which was due to flat terrain which is suitable for infiltration of more water in addition to its lacustrine sediment nature of lithology the landscape has been evaluated as having an area of 833 49 km2 and 469 12 km2 with an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively the results indicated that excellent groundwater potential zones are located in downstream parts of the study area mainly in fogera flood plain in these areas the slope is very flat very small slope percentage very porous lithology which is lacustrine sediment which leads to high infiltration rate and also the soil is clay that can hold a high amount of water the groundwater prospect maps were validated with the existing wells and the auc were found 0 705 which indicates good prediction capability of the ahp method therefore groundwater development activities can be performed in such high groundwater prospect zones of the landscape for increasing the productivity of supplementary irrigation and domestic use this study is much useful for water resources planners by indicating the potential areas for development and this methodology can be applied in other parts of the country further studies can be done on the groundwater hydro chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigation and also on the groundwater recharge amount and its relation to precipitation amount conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest between

groundwater potential map developed by mcda moghaddam et al 2015 regmi et al 2013 pourtaghi and pourghasemi 2014 for validating the predicted groundwater prospect map 300 existing wells were collected and used for roc curve preparation fig 8 has shown the roc curve of the groundwater potential map obtained using mcda technique in roc curve the true positive rate sensitivity is plotted in function of the false positive rate for different cut off points of a parameter each point on the roc curve represents a sensitivity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold the area under the roc curve auc is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups the relationship between auc and prediction accuracy can be summarized as yesilnacar and topal 2005 naghibi et al 2015 poor 0 5 0 6 average 0 6 0 7 good 0 7 0 8 very good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 the validation of results revealed that ahp has a fairly good prediction of 0 705 therefore the results of groundwater potential maps obtained using the ahp method has been considered as a good prediction 4 conclusions groundwater is a vital resource for sustainable growth of the country with sustainable management of water resources remote sensing and gis have integrated for evaluating groundwater potential zones of the study area using the different thematic maps prepared like geology soil land use lineament density and drainage density the weight of thematic layers was assigned based on their characteristic for groundwater contribution and were overlaid and integrated for groundwater potential zone development this study is very important for sustainable use of groundwater resources for developmental activities and thereby used for increasing groundwater recharge by adopting proper management the groundwater prospect map indicated that downstream areas of the landscape have higher groundwater potential than upstream areas which was due to flat terrain which is suitable for infiltration of more water in addition to its lacustrine sediment nature of lithology the landscape has been evaluated as having an area of 833 49 km2 and 469 12 km2 with an excellent and very good groundwater potential respectively the results indicated that excellent groundwater potential zones are located in downstream parts of the study area mainly in fogera flood plain in these areas the slope is very flat very small slope percentage very porous lithology which is lacustrine sediment which leads to high infiltration rate and also the soil is clay that can hold a high amount of water the groundwater prospect maps were validated with the existing wells and the auc were found 0 705 which indicates good prediction capability of the ahp method therefore groundwater development activities can be performed in such high groundwater prospect zones of the landscape for increasing the productivity of supplementary irrigation and domestic use this study is much useful for water resources planners by indicating the potential areas for development and this methodology can be applied in other parts of the country further studies can be done on the groundwater hydro chemistry and its suitability for domestic and irrigation and also on the groundwater recharge amount and its relation to precipitation amount conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest between

8432,study region lom depression bulgaria study focus a multi tracer investigation was applied to identify the recharge conditions and isotope hydrological character of four aquifers in the lom depression northwest bulgaria using environmental isotopes δ18o δ2h δ13c 3h 14c and noble gases the radiocarbon age model of ingerson and pearson was used to estimate the mean residence time of groundwater samples from four aquifers dacian pontian meotian sarmatian our study focuses on the study of recharge conditions and provides an additional information to hydrodynamic understanding of the four aquifers new hydrological insights for the region the mean residence time of groundwater samples represent the last twelve thousand years in addition to a recently recharged groundwater sample some samples represent the early holocene and samples closely correspond to the late pleistocene or the transition time between the early holocene late pleistocene the lower noble gas recharge temperature values may indicate that the recharge occurred during the late glacial holocene climatic transition these data can also be used to verify the existence of paleowater from the pontian and sarmatian aquifers on a trend of the mean residence time of older water heading north away from the study area besides the paleoclimatological investigation it was determined that the pontian aquifer has no hydraulic connection with the danube river the sandy layers and lenses forming the dacian aquifer are apparently hydraulically isolated and therefore have high degree of heterogeneity keywords environmental isotopes noble gases groundwater residence time lom depression bulgaria 1 introduction in the past several decades there has been increasing concern for global water resources as influenced by climate change this concern has motivated studies that examine the effects of climate change on the water cycle and their specific impacts on aquifers at regional and local scales aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 groundwater is critical to water supply irrigation and industry further assessment of its sustainability in response to future changes requires the better knowledge about hydrological features and processes as well as climate driven changes in specific aquifers environmental isotope hydrology is a powerful tool in discovering the origin of water and the characterization of aquifer conditions using environmental tracers isotopes noble gases etc groundwater recharge conditions such as mean residence time mrt and climatic influences at the time of recharge can be determined fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 sarkar et al 2017 joshi et al 2018 mrt values are usually estimated by the radiocarbon content of the water stute and deak 1989 stute and schlosser 1993 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 klump et al 2007 varsányi et al 2011 a direct quantitative method using the temperature dependence of noble gas solubility in water allows the reconstruction of past mean annual temperatures in this study a multi tracer investigation was carried out for a multilayered aquifer system in the lom depression in bulgaria which combines hydrochemical data environmental isotopes δ18o δ2h δ13c 3h 14c and noble gases in order to reconstruct the recharge conditions and identify the isotopic character of this system although such isotopic hydrological studies exist for bulgaria the data coverage is poor and general knowledge is still scarce rank et al 1985 pulido bosch et al 1999 magro et al 2010 machkova et al 2014 as well as unpublished data the aim of this first sampling campaign was to examine the aquifers of the lom depression from a paleoclimatological point of view and to use this information for late pleistocene and holocene paleoclimate reconstruction our study focuses on the study of recharge conditions and aiming to provide an additional information to hydrodynamic understanding of the four aquifers 2 study area the study area is located in northwest bulgaria within the danubian plain and covers about 2500 km2 fig 1 from a geological point of view this is the lom depression the most outstanding tectonic feature in northwest bulgaria and from a hydrogeological point of view this is the lom artesian basin part of the north bulgarian artesian basin the climate of the study area is a fully humid warm temperate zone with hot summers according to the köppen geiger climate classification cfa the recharge area belongs to the fully humid warm temperate zone with warm summers cfb peel et al 2007 according to observations the mean annual rainfall varies from 546 to 677 mm the average air temperature on the danubian plain is 11 4 c the study area is bounded on the north by the danube river and its tributaries the lom river and the tsibritsa river flow from the south within the study area the relief of the interfluvial areas is flat with altitudes up to about 150 200 m above sea level in general the relief is inclined slightly to the north and northeast towards the danube river with the lowest altitudes at about 30 m the main drainage artery of the region is the danube river 2 1 geology from a geological point of view the lom depression is located in the western part of the moesian plate and is mainly filled by neogene sediments archar formation the meotian lower pontian sediments brusartsi formation and quaternary deposits kojumdgieva popov 1988 the archar formation n1p mainly consists of well sorted sand the meotian lower pontian sediments that occur in the central part of the lom depression are mainly built of clay the brusartsi formation n2 mostly consists of clay with sandy lenses all neogene layers dip toward the northeast quaternary sediments are widespread in the region and were deposited under a variety of sedimentary environments including alluvial fluvial and aeolian loess origins 2 2 hydrogeological characterization hydrogeological conditions in the study area are mostly determined by geological factors the main hydrogeological structure here is the lom artesian basin yovchev ryzhova 1962 coinciding with the tectonic unit of the lom depression this basin is an upper part of the north bulgarian artesian region the largest hydrogeological structure in bulgaria with well expressed hydrodynamic hydrochemical and hydrogeothermal zonality both in vertical and in horizontal directions antonov danchev 1980 there is a multilayered aquifer system in these formations in which five hydrogeological units can be distinguished table 1 fig 1 the uppermost quaternary aquifer is associated with alluvial sediments in the danube lowlands and river valleys early pleistocene fluvial and fan deposits and loess deposits the most permeable quaternary sediments are alluvial deposits gravels and sands with intercalations of clays with discordant layering relations in comparing to the older formations both aquiferous and low permeable the object of the study is groundwater formed in neozoic strata they sink from the western southern and eastern periphery to the central northern part of the study area based on lithostratigraphic features of the sediments the most important hydrogeological units hgu can be distinguished table 1 the dacian romanian complex dra dacian aquifer which is fully contained within the brusartsi formation table 1 is located at the upper part of neozoic sediments from a hydrogeological point of view it is rather heterogeneous the formation mainly consists of clay interspersed with sandy lenses with thickness from 0 5 to 20 m most of the lenses are completely isolated and some of them are interconnected the sandy lenses at the top of the brusartsi formation receive recharge from fluvial early pleistocene deposits boulders gravel and coarse grained sands the local groundwater discharge occurs through springs on the slopes of the danube river and its tributaries some artesian wells have been established providing a continuous discharge to the surface regionally the dacian romanian complex is an aquiclude with coal layers at the bottom the hydraulic conductivity of individual sand lenses is in the range of 0 64 to 2 1 m d benderev et al 2010 stoyanov 2019 the upper pontian aquifer upa pontian aquifer covers an area of 1700 km2 and it is the most essential aquifer in the study area it is important for water supply to settlements by a large number of wells and therefore it is quite well investigated benderev et al 2010 stoyanov 2019 the aquifer is related to sediments of the archar formation table 1 with total thickness of about 80 100 m it is built of different grained sands locally with intercalations of clayey sands the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is relatively high but varies in the fraction of sand related to the paleogeographic environment during sedimentation in the western parts of the study area near the town of lom the upper pontian deposits are rather coarse with transmissivity from a few hundred to over 2000 m2 d benderev et al 2010 to the east finer grained sands are deposited leading to a reduction of transmissivity values from 40 to155 m2 d at the eastern edge the transmissivity is about 20 m2 d locally a highly permeable zone is identified near the village of valchedram with transmissivity around 750 m2 d outcropping zones of the aquiferous archar formation as well as the areas where it is covered only by the loess deposits are located on the peripheral parts of the lom depression fig 2 it is in these peripheral parts that the main recharge of the upper pontian aquifer occurs due to flat relief and widespread loess cover the surface outflow is relatively slow and the rainwater infiltrates into the loess complex as groundwater recharge into the aquifers which generates baseflow of the rivers or outflow through springs the aquiferous sandy layers dip to the central parts of the depression where they are covered by sediments of the brusartsi formation most clayey deposits in the lower part of the last formation play the role of a regional aquiclude separating the two hydrogeological units dra and upa the general direction of the groundwater flow is to the north the aquifer is confined in its inner part with a hydraulic pressure head of between 40 and 80 m the hydrodynamic features of upa presented in fig 2 are derived both from observations and groundwater modeling results benderev et al 2010 stoyanov 2019 the drainage of upa occurs into alluvial deposits of the danube river at the western and eastern edges of the aquifer one part of the groundwater probably flows north towards romania where the sandy fraction in the dacian romanian sediments prevails enciu 2009 the upper pontian aquifer overlays the meotian lower pontian aquiclude mlpa the latter is mainly made up of the clayey sediments of the smirnenski and florentin formations table 1 with intercalations of aquiferous sandstones and dolomitic limestones in the first and the second formations respectively outside the areas covered by the archar formation these clayey formations are covered by loess deposits and outcrop only in river valleys data on the spatial position of the mlpa is mainly based on boreholes for oil and gas exploration there are only a few drillings with available hydrogeological information and these are mainly in areas where the aquifer is relatively shallow the aquiferous sandy and carbonate layers within mlpa are confined with difficult water exchange except for of its outcropping zones the meotian lower pontian sediments are underlain by those of sarmatian age fig 1 that refer to various lithostratigraphic units with complex spatial relationships due to facies changes cheshitev and filipov 1989a b these units have been studied in more details outside the study area within the scope of the lom depression there is information only on their lithological composition based on deep boreholes the most permeable is limestone of the furen formation table 1 forming the sarmatian aquifer sa in outcropping zones it is karstified with transmissivity up to 220 m2 d sarmatian sediments of the krivodol and delein formations consist of clays with enhanced carbonate content form the sarmatian aquiclude table 1 as a whole in the study area the sarmatian aquifer is confined with delayed water exchange in the present study attention is mainly focused on the northern zones where the sarmatian sediments dip downwards filipov 1995 haydutov 1995 with transition from unconfined to confined conditions 3 methods groundwater sampling was conducted in october 2016 four water samples were taken from the dacian aquifer and seven from the pontian aquifer as well as two from the sarmatian aquifer and one groundwater sample from the meotian aquifer see table 1 the sampling points are shown on the map and the cross section fig 1 for artesian wells and pumping station the groundwater samples were collected directly at the well heads after the boreholes wells had been primed three types of wells were identified and sampled artesian wells water supply wells and observation wells table 2 the artesian wells flow continuously the samples from the water supply wells were taken during exploitation periods and the two observation wells were primed to remove more than three volumes of the water before sampling the groundwater temperature ph electrical conductivity alkalinity as well as redox potential were measured in situ in the field the hco3 cl no3 no2 f po4 3 so4 2 ca2 k na mg2 and nh4 analyses were conducted at the icer laboratory debrecen hungary the anions were measured by ion chromatography and trace elements by mp aes microwave plasma atom emission spectrometer additionally nh4 was determined by spectrophotometry the cod chemical oxygen demand of the water samples was determined by titration while the toc total organic carbon by high temperature catalytic oxidation with infrared detection stable isotopic analyses of water and dissolved inorganic carbon dic from the water samples were carried out with an automated gasbench ii sample preparation device attached to a thermo finnigan deltaplus xp mass spectrometer vodila et al 2011 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the groundwater as well as carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonate samples were analyzed and then expressed as δ2h δ18o and δ13c values relative to v pdb for δ13c and v smow for δ2h and δ18o following the equation δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the 2h h 18o 16o or 13c 12c ratio in the sample or in the international standard the precision of the measurements is better than 0 15 for δ18o and 2 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ13c the 14c content in the dissolved inorganic carbon dic from the groundwater samples were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry environmicadas ams no preservatives were used but samples were stored in dark and cold conditions dic content of the groundwater sample was degassed as co2 with addition of phosphoric acid 85 in vacuum sealed gas reaction vessels at 75 c for 2 h molnár et al 2013a the carbon dioxide samples were cleaned in a cryogenic gas extraction line and converted into graphite for ams analyses the 14c results were corrected for decay of the standard and for isotope fractionation using on line 13c measurements on the ams molnár et al 2013b noble gas and tritium measurements were performed by a vg5400 noble gas mass spectrometer fisons instruments the groundwater samples for dissolved noble gases were stored in copper tubes sealed by stainless steel pinch off clamps the mass spectrometer has an automated extraction and purification system for degassing noble gases from water samples and after the sample passes through this system the mass spectrometer measures the noble gas concentrations as well as 3he 4he isotope ratios papp et al 2012 the tritium concentrations were measured using the 3he ingrowth method with a detection limit of 0 012 tritium units tu or better and the accuracy is 2 4 for tu between 1 and 20 palcsu et al 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemistry chemical parameters of the 14 samples are summarized in table 2 shallow and deep wells were sampled there are water samples from the dacian aquifer with depths between 60 120 m and from the pontian aquifer from depths between 75 225 m and one sample from the meotian aquifer at a depth of 819 m the temperature of the groundwater from the dacian aquifer was between 14 5 and 16 4 c and the water samples from the pontian aquifer was in the range 13 0 16 5 c the aquifers are generally characterized by neutral ph values 6 27 7 84 in terms of dissolved anions hco3 dominates in the waters followed by so4 2 and then cl in case of dissolved cations the dominant ion is ca2 followed by mg2 the ca hco3 water type is dominant in all aquifers except for the rua well which is of ca na hco3 type and for dolni tsibar which has ca na hco3 cl chemistry it can be seen that moving away from the recharge zone the dissolved solids become slightly higher along the prevailing flow lines fig 1 table 2 a study of possible water rock interaction processes which control the groundwater chemistry is necessary to understand the basic geochemical characteristics and processes of an aquifer possible carbonate dissolution processes can be determined based on the ca mg molar ratio in this case the ca mg ratio of the samples is in the range from 1 6 to 3 6 table 2 where the ratio between 1 and 2 is attributed to calcite dissolution and a ratio higher than 2 is typical for the contribution of calcite rich minerals katz et al 1997 probable ion exchange processes can be characterized by an equivalent ratio of ca mg versus so4 hco3 of groundwater samples which values are between 1 0 and 1 3 table 2 and this indicates that ion exchange can occur in the area and suggests dissolution of carbonate and gypsum fisher and mullican 1997 this molar ratio is appropriate for estimating the contribution of gypsum calcite and dolomite to the water composition although the so4 ca molar ratio of groundwater samples ranges between 0 and 0 3 table 2 may confirm the lack of gypsum dissolution for a better illustration of the chemical character of the groundwater ions are plotted in a piper diagram fig 3 4 2 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of samples the stable isotopic values of groundwater samples from all the studied aquifers vary between 9 82 and 14 24 for δ18o and between 68 7 and 103 1 for δ2h fig 4 the samples from the dacian aquifer display less variability between 10 44 and 12 44 for δ18o and 72 4 to 89 6 for δ2h the gmwl global meteoric water line shows the average relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in precipitation which is expressed as a worldwide average δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 although there is no measured stable isotope composition of precipitation in the area the recent precipitation at ramnicu valcea romania gnip station of iaea located 150 km northeast of the research area can be considered representative for the danubian plain monthly δ18o values in regional precipitation are 2 5 to 15 0 and 23 6 to 111 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the prevailing winds for the study area are from west and northwest and seasonally from south generally west east or south north transport of air masses over bulgaria prevails zonal circulation has a larger influence on precipitation in bulgaria compared to meridional circulation nojarov 2017 some prominent local geographical features including the black sea in the east and carpathian mountains and balkan mountains to the north and west contribute to the evolution of air masses knight et al 2004 according to the stable isotope data for ramnicu valcea precipitation the lmwl local meteoric water line can be calculated and gives a regional average δ2h 7 03 δ18o 1 44 and the hydrogen and oxygen isotope distributions are correlated for meteoric waters thus these data reflect a meteoric origin for groundwater samples 4 3 water mean residence time to better understand water transport in a multilayered aquifer system the residence time of groundwater can be a useful tool tritium radiocarbon noble gases and stable isotopes can be used both for age dating as tracers in groundwater systems these environmental isotopic tracers can be used to estimate residence time and to determine environmental conditions upon recharge 4 3 1 tritium as tritium is a radioactive isotope with a short half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 it can be used to identify modern recharge natural tritium is produced in the atmosphere due to nuclear reactions between galactic cosmic rays and atmospheric gases the tritium concentration in precipitation is representative of the atmosphere and is about 10 tu in central europe the average value in debrecen hungary is 11 3 tu palcsu et al 2018 and 11 66 tu in râmnicu vâlcea romania varlam et al 2013 our tritium results are shown in table 3 most of the groundwater samples showed very low tritium concentrations lower than 0 02 for rua valchedram komoshtitsa pumped cherni vrah dolno linevo hospital s mahala komoshtitsa deep dolni tsibar groundwater from the vasilovtsi well had the highest tritium content of 6 8 tu indicating modern recharge followed by fishfarm with a value of 1 23 tu and bukovets with a value of 0 99 tu there are two wells with a value in the range of 0 1 0 15 tu smirnenski agroinvest the measureable tritium in smirnenski well along with the lowest radiocarbon content 15 94 pmc attracts attention and suggests mixing with recent water this mixing process could have occurred due to a malfunction of the well or from a well with multiple screen depths or from leakage assuming this sample represents aquifer water we infer that the sarmatian aquifer is affected by mixing between recent and old groundwater a similar observation was made by joshi et al 2018 with regards to the isotopic signature of the groundwater from aquifers of nw india this is a reasonable interpretation as the recharge zone is located nearby since groundwater from the vasilovtsi well has the highest tritium concentration it is worth calculating the 3h 3he age of groundwater although dissolved 3he in groundwater may have several origins the 3h 3he age of vasilovtsi can be calculated and more precise groundwater residence time can be estimated the tritiogenic 3he concentration is calculated by subtracting from the measured helium content that amount due to atmospheric solubility excess air and radiogenic production schlosser et al 1989 based on these calculations the tritiogenic 3he is 60 1 tu and the 3h 3he age is calculated to be 40 6 0 7 years according to the calculations and tritium recovery curve of precipitation in vienna fig 5 the initial tritium concentration at the time of recharge was 66 9 2 9 tu and the decay from the time of the mid 1960s and mid 1970s bomb peak this peak provides a reference point for determining groundwater residence time the samples were taken in 2016 and a 3h 3he age of 40 years implies the recharge events could have occurred around 1976 fig 5 4 3 2 modelled radiocarbon ages in groundwater the dic dissolved inorganic carbon results from co2 aq hco3 co3 2 which are dissolved in the recharge water and these contain atmospheric 14c this is a useful tool for dating groundwater and is measured in dissolved inorganic organic carbon for estimation of groundwater residence time we use the radiocarbon model of ingerson and pearson 1964 this method produces similar ages to a variety of other methods ingerson and pearson 1964 fontes and garnier 1979 mook 1980 salem et al 1980 plummer and glynn 2013 to calculate the apparent age of the groundwater in years the following equation can be used t 8267 ln a0 at to estimate the residence time of groundwater the initial 14c content a0 of dic in groundwater at the recharge zone must be evaluated here the vasilovtsi well can be used as representative for initial 14c content based on the 3h 3he age and the measured 14c content which is 98 6 pmc this is somewhat higher based on the groundwater recharge that can have occurred during the last 50 years and is therefore likely to contain a component of bomb derived 14c the results of the ingerson and pearson model 1964 are given in table 3 in this model a dilution factor q is used to estimate a0 according to the equation q δ13cdic δ13ccarb δ13csoil δ13ccarb here δ13cdic is the measured δ13c in groundwater and δ13ccarb is the δ13c value of the dissolved carbonate which is usually 0 the δ13csoil term is the δ13c value of the co2 in the soil which depends on the plants growing there in temperate zone c3 c3 plants are about 25 table 3 an enrichment factor was used to calculate q because the soil can be enriched in 13c based on equilibrium exchange processes between soil co2 and dic at increasing ph the dilution factor q can be calculated based on the equation q δ13cdic δ13ccarb δ13csoil ɛ13cdic co2 soil δ13ccarb where the ɛ13cdic co2 soil depends on ph following the δ13c mixing model of pearson 1965 and pearson and hanshaw 1970 see δ13c correction table 3 the error in the corrected ages was derived by propagating the errors of the independent elements in the dilution factor equation including errors for measured radiocarbon content and δ 13c values of dic ph and alkalinity are the measurement errors the corrected ages are reported with one sigma error the 14c content of the groundwater samples range from 15 9 pmc to 98 6 pmc table 3 fig 1 these data suggest that three aquifers of four might contain waters recharged during the early holocene late pleistocene pontian dacian sarmatian there are two wells in the pontian aquifer dolni tsibar 20 83 0 12 pmc agroinvest 23 85 0 13 pmc with low radiocarbon content the wells near the area of agroinvest are characterized by higher radiocarbon content moving away from the well in any direction the radiocarbon content is increasing in the dacian aquifer there is only one well the valchedram which might show late pleistocene recharge given the level of 23 7 pmc in the sarmatian aquifer the oldest water was obtained from all samples with 15 94 pmc for the smirnenski well this is of interest because the distance between bukovets and smirnenki is less than 5 km although the screen depth of smirnenski well is 100 m deeper so this difference may be related to another flow path the age of the groundwater is the mean water residence time in the aquifer of each individual groundwater sample this was calculated from the average of ages derived from the various radiocarbon models the uncertainty associated with residence times is obtained as the standard deviation of ages from the different models and then this average age is consistently used in the following interpretations the 3h 3he age determination showed the most recently recharged sample was vasilovtsi from the pontian aquifer fig 5 a number of samples appear to be recharged during the late holocene komoshtitsa deep s mahala chernivrah fishfarm bukovets with ages between 3000 and 4000 calibrated years before present yr bp fig 6 in addition there are samples with ages between 5000 6800 yr bp hospital dolno linevo from the pontian aquifer furthermore there are groundwater samples with residence time between 8000 9300 yr which represents the early holocene rua komoshtitsa pumped agroinvest fig 6 samples with ages between 10 000 12 000 yr bp valchedram dolnitsibar smirnenski closely correspond to the late pleistocene or the early holocene late pleistocene transition 4 3 3 terrigenous helium accumulation terrestrial 4he 4heterr can be used to classify groundwaters with longer mean residence times solomon 2000 it is used especially when characterizing the old fractions in groundwater that have experienced mixing modelled water mean residence times plotted versus 4heterr content identify groundwater samples with relatively long residence times that contain excess 4heterr fig 6 likely incurred during the early holocene late pleistocene climatic transition we observe a tendency of increased terrigenic helium contents in older groundwater from the pontian aquifer and in the sminenski sample fig 6 4 3 4 hydrogeological aspects the correct interpretation of the results requires the exact location of the boreholes sampled some of the boreholes correspond to the deeper confined zone of the aquifer and others to the outcrops of the aquiferous formations considering the groundwater properties of the aquifers and corresponding boreholes the following hydrogeological settings can be defined 4 3 4 1 sarmatian one of the boreholes bukovets is located within the outcrops of the aquifer and the second one smirnenski is below the local erosion base fig 1 the covered confined part of the aquifer is generally characterized by very slow water exchange this is mainly observed at the village of smirenenski the groundwater residence time for the borehole in the village of smirnenski shows weak water exchange and the highest groundwater age possibly due to the influence of deeper water 4 3 4 2 meotian relatively younger groundwater compared to other waters indicates a probable connection between the smirnenski formation sandy layers with the outcropping sands of the pontian aquifer fig 1 4 3 4 3 dacian a specific feature of this aquifer complex are sandy lenses and layers that vary in thickness location in depth and hydraulic conductivity values depending of the sandy content the wide range of groundwater age in two neighboring boreholes close to the village of komoshtitsa 300 yr bp and 8600 yr bp indicates poor hydraulic connection between different lenses and layers as well as different recharge and discharge conditions this significant difference also suggests the absence of a hydraulic connection in this area between the waters of dacian and underlying pontian aquifers 4 3 4 4 pontian the numerous samples of the pontian aquifer 7 samples demonstrate groundwater ages that range from about 300 to 11 700 yr bp one exception is the water sample from the borehole in the village of vasilovtsi where water can be considered to be modern in this area the pontian aquifer is relatively shallow and could have a direct connection with the river passing near the village at lower elevation the highest values from about 8000 to 11 700 yr bp are common in the central part of the aquifer with a reduced age near the town of lom to 5000 yr bp this phenomenon could be explained by significantly higher hydraulic conductivity values in this area a second possibility could be intensive groundwater exploitation near to the town of lom the various samples taken from the pontian aquifer were analyzed for possible interrelations between parameters determined from individual groundwater samples the most indicative parameter is thought to be the groundwater age increasing groundwater age is associated with increasing concentrations of na k cl concentrations and increasing electrical conductivity of water moreover an increase nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 contents is registered along with increasing of cod chemical oxygen demand in these water samples conversely the redox potential and nitrate no3 show evident decrease with the increasing groundwater age 4 4 noble gas temperature and paleoclimate reconstruction the concentrations of noble gases are suitable indicators to estimate the groundwater recharge temperature the noble gas concentrations of ne ar kr and xe are derived from the atmosphere and after their dissolution into the water their concentrations do not change along the flow path since they take part neither in chemical nor biological processes the interpretation of noble gas concentrations in groundwater requires inverse modelling which can determine reliable noble gas solubility or recharge temperature ngt this requires a correction for excess air and a model proposed to determine its formation the closed system equilibration model of gas partitioning was used in this study aeschbach hertig et al 1999 noble gas results are shown in table 4 and the uncertainty of the noble gas temperature determination is about 0 6 c we already noted that the average air temperature in the danubian plain is 11 4 c water temperature near in the recharge area vasilovtsi is 13 c as measured in the field which may reflect ground temperature the noble gas temperatures measured vary between 8 1 c and 13 4 c table 4 ngts of the dacian aquifer vary between 9 95 c and 11 17 c although the ngts from the pontian aquifer shows higher variability 8 1 c to 13 4 c somewhat lower ngt values in the smirnenski dolni tsibar and valchedram wells presumably indicate recharge during the glacial holocene transition fig 7 a likely admixture of recent groundwater to glacial water is conceivable due to the low radiocarbon content with measureable tritium in a water sample from the smirnenski well and a minimal tritium content in the dolni tsibar well the waters from the sarmatian and pontian aquifers are presumed to have recharged during late glacial times or to have incorporated glacial water that result in ngt somewhat lower than groundwater from the mid and late holocene fig 7 these groundwater samples are characterized by ngts of about 8 3 c whereas the late holocene waters have ngts around 12 c which is similar to the mean annual air temperature of 11 4 c so the largest temperature change observed is about 3 7 c these recharge temperature differences might represent the transition time between these two periods this transition period can be also observed in the stable isotope data where the groundwater with larger residence times has more negative δ2h and δ18o values suggesting the groundwater recharge occurred during the late glacial holocene climatic transition period table 3 fig 8 paleoclimate reconstruction studies in europe based on dissolved noble gases in groundwater have shown higher temperature differences between the holocene and glacial periods for example 5 7 c in the bohemian cretaceous basin corcho alvarado et al 2013 and at least 5 c in the glatt valley switzerland beyerle et al 1998 in the pannonian basin the warming after the last glacial maximum lgm reached a temperature of 9 1 c varsányi et al 2011 and this temperature in the ledo paniselian aquifer is 9 5 c blaser et al 2010 comparing these ngt values in europe the temperature differences obtained here appear to be too low comparable observations were made for a jurassic limestone aquifer in poland where the ngt was 2 3 5 c lower than recent recharge groundwater osenbrück et al 1993 assuming some mixing with recent waters these noble gas temperatures could reflect either mixing or a transition phase between the two climatic periods the lower ngt difference between the colder and warmer recharge waters can be explained as that the mean residence times do not reflect groundwater recharged at the lgm i e the groundwater at the oldest part of the aquifer does not reflect glacial temperatures 5 conclusion this study presents a hydrogeological and palaeoclimatic interpretation for the lom depression northwest bulgaria a multi tracer approach is presented to reconstruct the recharge temperature and identify isotopic hydrological character of the aquifers using the environmental isotopes δ18o δ2h δ13c 3h 14c and noble gases the stable isotope results show that the recharge sources of the groundwater studied are local meteoric water for a groundwater sample from the vasilovtsi well the 3h 3he groundwater age of 40 6 0 7 years was confirmed tritium content in deep groundwater with low radiocarbon content was determined for three wells the presence of tritium can be attributed to mixing process between old and recent waters due either to overexploitation or leakage in the well the ingerson and pearson radiocarbon model was used to estimate mean residence times taking into account chemical and isotope hydrological parameters to achieve precise groundwater ages from the 14c content of dissolved inorganic carbon modelled groundwater residence times fall within the last twelve thousand years with samples from the early holocene with ages between 8000 9300 yr bp rua komoshtitsa pumped agroinvest and older waters that date to between 10 000 12 000 yr bp valchedram dolni tsibar smirnenski from the late pleistocene or the transition time between the holocene and pleistocene the noble gas results provide quantitative information on the temperature of recharge and qualitative information on the time of recharge they make it conceivable to estimate the climatic conditions under which the recharge took place and to confirm the time of recharge values of 3 4 c lower ngt for smirnenski dolni tsibar and valchedram presumably indicate that the recharge occurred during the glacial holocene transition an admixture of recent holocene groundwater to glacial water is likely due to the low radiocarbon content in presence of some tritium in water sample from smirnenski well and a low tritium content for the dolni tsibar well the results of this study significantly change our previous knowledge about the hydrodynamics of the lom basin in particular we have shown that the pontian aquifer has no hydraulic connection to the danube river the sandy layers and lenses forming the dacian aquifer are apparently hydraulically isolated and therefore have high degree of heterogeneity

8432,study region lom depression bulgaria study focus a multi tracer investigation was applied to identify the recharge conditions and isotope hydrological character of four aquifers in the lom depression northwest bulgaria using environmental isotopes δ18o δ2h δ13c 3h 14c and noble gases the radiocarbon age model of ingerson and pearson was used to estimate the mean residence time of groundwater samples from four aquifers dacian pontian meotian sarmatian our study focuses on the study of recharge conditions and provides an additional information to hydrodynamic understanding of the four aquifers new hydrological insights for the region the mean residence time of groundwater samples represent the last twelve thousand years in addition to a recently recharged groundwater sample some samples represent the early holocene and samples closely correspond to the late pleistocene or the transition time between the early holocene late pleistocene the lower noble gas recharge temperature values may indicate that the recharge occurred during the late glacial holocene climatic transition these data can also be used to verify the existence of paleowater from the pontian and sarmatian aquifers on a trend of the mean residence time of older water heading north away from the study area besides the paleoclimatological investigation it was determined that the pontian aquifer has no hydraulic connection with the danube river the sandy layers and lenses forming the dacian aquifer are apparently hydraulically isolated and therefore have high degree of heterogeneity keywords environmental isotopes noble gases groundwater residence time lom depression bulgaria 1 introduction in the past several decades there has been increasing concern for global water resources as influenced by climate change this concern has motivated studies that examine the effects of climate change on the water cycle and their specific impacts on aquifers at regional and local scales aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 groundwater is critical to water supply irrigation and industry further assessment of its sustainability in response to future changes requires the better knowledge about hydrological features and processes as well as climate driven changes in specific aquifers environmental isotope hydrology is a powerful tool in discovering the origin of water and the characterization of aquifer conditions using environmental tracers isotopes noble gases etc groundwater recharge conditions such as mean residence time mrt and climatic influences at the time of recharge can be determined fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 sarkar et al 2017 joshi et al 2018 mrt values are usually estimated by the radiocarbon content of the water stute and deak 1989 stute and schlosser 1993 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 klump et al 2007 varsányi et al 2011 a direct quantitative method using the temperature dependence of noble gas solubility in water allows the reconstruction of past mean annual temperatures in this study a multi tracer investigation was carried out for a multilayered aquifer system in the lom depression in bulgaria which combines hydrochemical data environmental isotopes δ18o δ2h δ13c 3h 14c and noble gases in order to reconstruct the recharge conditions and identify the isotopic character of this system although such isotopic hydrological studies exist for bulgaria the data coverage is poor and general knowledge is still scarce rank et al 1985 pulido bosch et al 1999 magro et al 2010 machkova et al 2014 as well as unpublished data the aim of this first sampling campaign was to examine the aquifers of the lom depression from a paleoclimatological point of view and to use this information for late pleistocene and holocene paleoclimate reconstruction our study focuses on the study of recharge conditions and aiming to provide an additional information to hydrodynamic understanding of the four aquifers 2 study area the study area is located in northwest bulgaria within the danubian plain and covers about 2500 km2 fig 1 from a geological point of view this is the lom depression the most outstanding tectonic feature in northwest bulgaria and from a hydrogeological point of view this is the lom artesian basin part of the north bulgarian artesian basin the climate of the study area is a fully humid warm temperate zone with hot summers according to the köppen geiger climate classification cfa the recharge area belongs to the fully humid warm temperate zone with warm summers cfb peel et al 2007 according to observations the mean annual rainfall varies from 546 to 677 mm the average air temperature on the danubian plain is 11 4 c the study area is bounded on the north by the danube river and its tributaries the lom river and the tsibritsa river flow from the south within the study area the relief of the interfluvial areas is flat with altitudes up to about 150 200 m above sea level in general the relief is inclined slightly to the north and northeast towards the danube river with the lowest altitudes at about 30 m the main drainage artery of the region is the danube river 2 1 geology from a geological point of view the lom depression is located in the western part of the moesian plate and is mainly filled by neogene sediments archar formation the meotian lower pontian sediments brusartsi formation and quaternary deposits kojumdgieva popov 1988 the archar formation n1p mainly consists of well sorted sand the meotian lower pontian sediments that occur in the central part of the lom depression are mainly built of clay the brusartsi formation n2 mostly consists of clay with sandy lenses all neogene layers dip toward the northeast quaternary sediments are widespread in the region and were deposited under a variety of sedimentary environments including alluvial fluvial and aeolian loess origins 2 2 hydrogeological characterization hydrogeological conditions in the study area are mostly determined by geological factors the main hydrogeological structure here is the lom artesian basin yovchev ryzhova 1962 coinciding with the tectonic unit of the lom depression this basin is an upper part of the north bulgarian artesian region the largest hydrogeological structure in bulgaria with well expressed hydrodynamic hydrochemical and hydrogeothermal zonality both in vertical and in horizontal directions antonov danchev 1980 there is a multilayered aquifer system in these formations in which five hydrogeological units can be distinguished table 1 fig 1 the uppermost quaternary aquifer is associated with alluvial sediments in the danube lowlands and river valleys early pleistocene fluvial and fan deposits and loess deposits the most permeable quaternary sediments are alluvial deposits gravels and sands with intercalations of clays with discordant layering relations in comparing to the older formations both aquiferous and low permeable the object of the study is groundwater formed in neozoic strata they sink from the western southern and eastern periphery to the central northern part of the study area based on lithostratigraphic features of the sediments the most important hydrogeological units hgu can be distinguished table 1 the dacian romanian complex dra dacian aquifer which is fully contained within the brusartsi formation table 1 is located at the upper part of neozoic sediments from a hydrogeological point of view it is rather heterogeneous the formation mainly consists of clay interspersed with sandy lenses with thickness from 0 5 to 20 m most of the lenses are completely isolated and some of them are interconnected the sandy lenses at the top of the brusartsi formation receive recharge from fluvial early pleistocene deposits boulders gravel and coarse grained sands the local groundwater discharge occurs through springs on the slopes of the danube river and its tributaries some artesian wells have been established providing a continuous discharge to the surface regionally the dacian romanian complex is an aquiclude with coal layers at the bottom the hydraulic conductivity of individual sand lenses is in the range of 0 64 to 2 1 m d benderev et al 2010 stoyanov 2019 the upper pontian aquifer upa pontian aquifer covers an area of 1700 km2 and it is the most essential aquifer in the study area it is important for water supply to settlements by a large number of wells and therefore it is quite well investigated benderev et al 2010 stoyanov 2019 the aquifer is related to sediments of the archar formation table 1 with total thickness of about 80 100 m it is built of different grained sands locally with intercalations of clayey sands the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is relatively high but varies in the fraction of sand related to the paleogeographic environment during sedimentation in the western parts of the study area near the town of lom the upper pontian deposits are rather coarse with transmissivity from a few hundred to over 2000 m2 d benderev et al 2010 to the east finer grained sands are deposited leading to a reduction of transmissivity values from 40 to155 m2 d at the eastern edge the transmissivity is about 20 m2 d locally a highly permeable zone is identified near the village of valchedram with transmissivity around 750 m2 d outcropping zones of the aquiferous archar formation as well as the areas where it is covered only by the loess deposits are located on the peripheral parts of the lom depression fig 2 it is in these peripheral parts that the main recharge of the upper pontian aquifer occurs due to flat relief and widespread loess cover the surface outflow is relatively slow and the rainwater infiltrates into the loess complex as groundwater recharge into the aquifers which generates baseflow of the rivers or outflow through springs the aquiferous sandy layers dip to the central parts of the depression where they are covered by sediments of the brusartsi formation most clayey deposits in the lower part of the last formation play the role of a regional aquiclude separating the two hydrogeological units dra and upa the general direction of the groundwater flow is to the north the aquifer is confined in its inner part with a hydraulic pressure head of between 40 and 80 m the hydrodynamic features of upa presented in fig 2 are derived both from observations and groundwater modeling results benderev et al 2010 stoyanov 2019 the drainage of upa occurs into alluvial deposits of the danube river at the western and eastern edges of the aquifer one part of the groundwater probably flows north towards romania where the sandy fraction in the dacian romanian sediments prevails enciu 2009 the upper pontian aquifer overlays the meotian lower pontian aquiclude mlpa the latter is mainly made up of the clayey sediments of the smirnenski and florentin formations table 1 with intercalations of aquiferous sandstones and dolomitic limestones in the first and the second formations respectively outside the areas covered by the archar formation these clayey formations are covered by loess deposits and outcrop only in river valleys data on the spatial position of the mlpa is mainly based on boreholes for oil and gas exploration there are only a few drillings with available hydrogeological information and these are mainly in areas where the aquifer is relatively shallow the aquiferous sandy and carbonate layers within mlpa are confined with difficult water exchange except for of its outcropping zones the meotian lower pontian sediments are underlain by those of sarmatian age fig 1 that refer to various lithostratigraphic units with complex spatial relationships due to facies changes cheshitev and filipov 1989a b these units have been studied in more details outside the study area within the scope of the lom depression there is information only on their lithological composition based on deep boreholes the most permeable is limestone of the furen formation table 1 forming the sarmatian aquifer sa in outcropping zones it is karstified with transmissivity up to 220 m2 d sarmatian sediments of the krivodol and delein formations consist of clays with enhanced carbonate content form the sarmatian aquiclude table 1 as a whole in the study area the sarmatian aquifer is confined with delayed water exchange in the present study attention is mainly focused on the northern zones where the sarmatian sediments dip downwards filipov 1995 haydutov 1995 with transition from unconfined to confined conditions 3 methods groundwater sampling was conducted in october 2016 four water samples were taken from the dacian aquifer and seven from the pontian aquifer as well as two from the sarmatian aquifer and one groundwater sample from the meotian aquifer see table 1 the sampling points are shown on the map and the cross section fig 1 for artesian wells and pumping station the groundwater samples were collected directly at the well heads after the boreholes wells had been primed three types of wells were identified and sampled artesian wells water supply wells and observation wells table 2 the artesian wells flow continuously the samples from the water supply wells were taken during exploitation periods and the two observation wells were primed to remove more than three volumes of the water before sampling the groundwater temperature ph electrical conductivity alkalinity as well as redox potential were measured in situ in the field the hco3 cl no3 no2 f po4 3 so4 2 ca2 k na mg2 and nh4 analyses were conducted at the icer laboratory debrecen hungary the anions were measured by ion chromatography and trace elements by mp aes microwave plasma atom emission spectrometer additionally nh4 was determined by spectrophotometry the cod chemical oxygen demand of the water samples was determined by titration while the toc total organic carbon by high temperature catalytic oxidation with infrared detection stable isotopic analyses of water and dissolved inorganic carbon dic from the water samples were carried out with an automated gasbench ii sample preparation device attached to a thermo finnigan deltaplus xp mass spectrometer vodila et al 2011 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the groundwater as well as carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonate samples were analyzed and then expressed as δ2h δ18o and δ13c values relative to v pdb for δ13c and v smow for δ2h and δ18o following the equation δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r is the 2h h 18o 16o or 13c 12c ratio in the sample or in the international standard the precision of the measurements is better than 0 15 for δ18o and 2 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ13c the 14c content in the dissolved inorganic carbon dic from the groundwater samples were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry environmicadas ams no preservatives were used but samples were stored in dark and cold conditions dic content of the groundwater sample was degassed as co2 with addition of phosphoric acid 85 in vacuum sealed gas reaction vessels at 75 c for 2 h molnár et al 2013a the carbon dioxide samples were cleaned in a cryogenic gas extraction line and converted into graphite for ams analyses the 14c results were corrected for decay of the standard and for isotope fractionation using on line 13c measurements on the ams molnár et al 2013b noble gas and tritium measurements were performed by a vg5400 noble gas mass spectrometer fisons instruments the groundwater samples for dissolved noble gases were stored in copper tubes sealed by stainless steel pinch off clamps the mass spectrometer has an automated extraction and purification system for degassing noble gases from water samples and after the sample passes through this system the mass spectrometer measures the noble gas concentrations as well as 3he 4he isotope ratios papp et al 2012 the tritium concentrations were measured using the 3he ingrowth method with a detection limit of 0 012 tritium units tu or better and the accuracy is 2 4 for tu between 1 and 20 palcsu et al 2010 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemistry chemical parameters of the 14 samples are summarized in table 2 shallow and deep wells were sampled there are water samples from the dacian aquifer with depths between 60 120 m and from the pontian aquifer from depths between 75 225 m and one sample from the meotian aquifer at a depth of 819 m the temperature of the groundwater from the dacian aquifer was between 14 5 and 16 4 c and the water samples from the pontian aquifer was in the range 13 0 16 5 c the aquifers are generally characterized by neutral ph values 6 27 7 84 in terms of dissolved anions hco3 dominates in the waters followed by so4 2 and then cl in case of dissolved cations the dominant ion is ca2 followed by mg2 the ca hco3 water type is dominant in all aquifers except for the rua well which is of ca na hco3 type and for dolni tsibar which has ca na hco3 cl chemistry it can be seen that moving away from the recharge zone the dissolved solids become slightly higher along the prevailing flow lines fig 1 table 2 a study of possible water rock interaction processes which control the groundwater chemistry is necessary to understand the basic geochemical characteristics and processes of an aquifer possible carbonate dissolution processes can be determined based on the ca mg molar ratio in this case the ca mg ratio of the samples is in the range from 1 6 to 3 6 table 2 where the ratio between 1 and 2 is attributed to calcite dissolution and a ratio higher than 2 is typical for the contribution of calcite rich minerals katz et al 1997 probable ion exchange processes can be characterized by an equivalent ratio of ca mg versus so4 hco3 of groundwater samples which values are between 1 0 and 1 3 table 2 and this indicates that ion exchange can occur in the area and suggests dissolution of carbonate and gypsum fisher and mullican 1997 this molar ratio is appropriate for estimating the contribution of gypsum calcite and dolomite to the water composition although the so4 ca molar ratio of groundwater samples ranges between 0 and 0 3 table 2 may confirm the lack of gypsum dissolution for a better illustration of the chemical character of the groundwater ions are plotted in a piper diagram fig 3 4 2 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of samples the stable isotopic values of groundwater samples from all the studied aquifers vary between 9 82 and 14 24 for δ18o and between 68 7 and 103 1 for δ2h fig 4 the samples from the dacian aquifer display less variability between 10 44 and 12 44 for δ18o and 72 4 to 89 6 for δ2h the gmwl global meteoric water line shows the average relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in precipitation which is expressed as a worldwide average δ2h 8 δ18o 10 craig 1961 although there is no measured stable isotope composition of precipitation in the area the recent precipitation at ramnicu valcea romania gnip station of iaea located 150 km northeast of the research area can be considered representative for the danubian plain monthly δ18o values in regional precipitation are 2 5 to 15 0 and 23 6 to 111 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the prevailing winds for the study area are from west and northwest and seasonally from south generally west east or south north transport of air masses over bulgaria prevails zonal circulation has a larger influence on precipitation in bulgaria compared to meridional circulation nojarov 2017 some prominent local geographical features including the black sea in the east and carpathian mountains and balkan mountains to the north and west contribute to the evolution of air masses knight et al 2004 according to the stable isotope data for ramnicu valcea precipitation the lmwl local meteoric water line can be calculated and gives a regional average δ2h 7 03 δ18o 1 44 and the hydrogen and oxygen isotope distributions are correlated for meteoric waters thus these data reflect a meteoric origin for groundwater samples 4 3 water mean residence time to better understand water transport in a multilayered aquifer system the residence time of groundwater can be a useful tool tritium radiocarbon noble gases and stable isotopes can be used both for age dating as tracers in groundwater systems these environmental isotopic tracers can be used to estimate residence time and to determine environmental conditions upon recharge 4 3 1 tritium as tritium is a radioactive isotope with a short half life of 12 32 years lucas and unterweger 2000 it can be used to identify modern recharge natural tritium is produced in the atmosphere due to nuclear reactions between galactic cosmic rays and atmospheric gases the tritium concentration in precipitation is representative of the atmosphere and is about 10 tu in central europe the average value in debrecen hungary is 11 3 tu palcsu et al 2018 and 11 66 tu in râmnicu vâlcea romania varlam et al 2013 our tritium results are shown in table 3 most of the groundwater samples showed very low tritium concentrations lower than 0 02 for rua valchedram komoshtitsa pumped cherni vrah dolno linevo hospital s mahala komoshtitsa deep dolni tsibar groundwater from the vasilovtsi well had the highest tritium content of 6 8 tu indicating modern recharge followed by fishfarm with a value of 1 23 tu and bukovets with a value of 0 99 tu there are two wells with a value in the range of 0 1 0 15 tu smirnenski agroinvest the measureable tritium in smirnenski well along with the lowest radiocarbon content 15 94 pmc attracts attention and suggests mixing with recent water this mixing process could have occurred due to a malfunction of the well or from a well with multiple screen depths or from leakage assuming this sample represents aquifer water we infer that the sarmatian aquifer is affected by mixing between recent and old groundwater a similar observation was made by joshi et al 2018 with regards to the isotopic signature of the groundwater from aquifers of nw india this is a reasonable interpretation as the recharge zone is located nearby since groundwater from the vasilovtsi well has the highest tritium concentration it is worth calculating the 3h 3he age of groundwater although dissolved 3he in groundwater may have several origins the 3h 3he age of vasilovtsi can be calculated and more precise groundwater residence time can be estimated the tritiogenic 3he concentration is calculated by subtracting from the measured helium content that amount due to atmospheric solubility excess air and radiogenic production schlosser et al 1989 based on these calculations the tritiogenic 3he is 60 1 tu and the 3h 3he age is calculated to be 40 6 0 7 years according to the calculations and tritium recovery curve of precipitation in vienna fig 5 the initial tritium concentration at the time of recharge was 66 9 2 9 tu and the decay from the time of the mid 1960s and mid 1970s bomb peak this peak provides a reference point for determining groundwater residence time the samples were taken in 2016 and a 3h 3he age of 40 years implies the recharge events could have occurred around 1976 fig 5 4 3 2 modelled radiocarbon ages in groundwater the dic dissolved inorganic carbon results from co2 aq hco3 co3 2 which are dissolved in the recharge water and these contain atmospheric 14c this is a useful tool for dating groundwater and is measured in dissolved inorganic organic carbon for estimation of groundwater residence time we use the radiocarbon model of ingerson and pearson 1964 this method produces similar ages to a variety of other methods ingerson and pearson 1964 fontes and garnier 1979 mook 1980 salem et al 1980 plummer and glynn 2013 to calculate the apparent age of the groundwater in years the following equation can be used t 8267 ln a0 at to estimate the residence time of groundwater the initial 14c content a0 of dic in groundwater at the recharge zone must be evaluated here the vasilovtsi well can be used as representative for initial 14c content based on the 3h 3he age and the measured 14c content which is 98 6 pmc this is somewhat higher based on the groundwater recharge that can have occurred during the last 50 years and is therefore likely to contain a component of bomb derived 14c the results of the ingerson and pearson model 1964 are given in table 3 in this model a dilution factor q is used to estimate a0 according to the equation q δ13cdic δ13ccarb δ13csoil δ13ccarb here δ13cdic is the measured δ13c in groundwater and δ13ccarb is the δ13c value of the dissolved carbonate which is usually 0 the δ13csoil term is the δ13c value of the co2 in the soil which depends on the plants growing there in temperate zone c3 c3 plants are about 25 table 3 an enrichment factor was used to calculate q because the soil can be enriched in 13c based on equilibrium exchange processes between soil co2 and dic at increasing ph the dilution factor q can be calculated based on the equation q δ13cdic δ13ccarb δ13csoil ɛ13cdic co2 soil δ13ccarb where the ɛ13cdic co2 soil depends on ph following the δ13c mixing model of pearson 1965 and pearson and hanshaw 1970 see δ13c correction table 3 the error in the corrected ages was derived by propagating the errors of the independent elements in the dilution factor equation including errors for measured radiocarbon content and δ 13c values of dic ph and alkalinity are the measurement errors the corrected ages are reported with one sigma error the 14c content of the groundwater samples range from 15 9 pmc to 98 6 pmc table 3 fig 1 these data suggest that three aquifers of four might contain waters recharged during the early holocene late pleistocene pontian dacian sarmatian there are two wells in the pontian aquifer dolni tsibar 20 83 0 12 pmc agroinvest 23 85 0 13 pmc with low radiocarbon content the wells near the area of agroinvest are characterized by higher radiocarbon content moving away from the well in any direction the radiocarbon content is increasing in the dacian aquifer there is only one well the valchedram which might show late pleistocene recharge given the level of 23 7 pmc in the sarmatian aquifer the oldest water was obtained from all samples with 15 94 pmc for the smirnenski well this is of interest because the distance between bukovets and smirnenki is less than 5 km although the screen depth of smirnenski well is 100 m deeper so this difference may be related to another flow path the age of the groundwater is the mean water residence time in the aquifer of each individual groundwater sample this was calculated from the average of ages derived from the various radiocarbon models the uncertainty associated with residence times is obtained as the standard deviation of ages from the different models and then this average age is consistently used in the following interpretations the 3h 3he age determination showed the most recently recharged sample was vasilovtsi from the pontian aquifer fig 5 a number of samples appear to be recharged during the late holocene komoshtitsa deep s mahala chernivrah fishfarm bukovets with ages between 3000 and 4000 calibrated years before present yr bp fig 6 in addition there are samples with ages between 5000 6800 yr bp hospital dolno linevo from the pontian aquifer furthermore there are groundwater samples with residence time between 8000 9300 yr which represents the early holocene rua komoshtitsa pumped agroinvest fig 6 samples with ages between 10 000 12 000 yr bp valchedram dolnitsibar smirnenski closely correspond to the late pleistocene or the early holocene late pleistocene transition 4 3 3 terrigenous helium accumulation terrestrial 4he 4heterr can be used to classify groundwaters with longer mean residence times solomon 2000 it is used especially when characterizing the old fractions in groundwater that have experienced mixing modelled water mean residence times plotted versus 4heterr content identify groundwater samples with relatively long residence times that contain excess 4heterr fig 6 likely incurred during the early holocene late pleistocene climatic transition we observe a tendency of increased terrigenic helium contents in older groundwater from the pontian aquifer and in the sminenski sample fig 6 4 3 4 hydrogeological aspects the correct interpretation of the results requires the exact location of the boreholes sampled some of the boreholes correspond to the deeper confined zone of the aquifer and others to the outcrops of the aquiferous formations considering the groundwater properties of the aquifers and corresponding boreholes the following hydrogeological settings can be defined 4 3 4 1 sarmatian one of the boreholes bukovets is located within the outcrops of the aquifer and the second one smirnenski is below the local erosion base fig 1 the covered confined part of the aquifer is generally characterized by very slow water exchange this is mainly observed at the village of smirenenski the groundwater residence time for the borehole in the village of smirnenski shows weak water exchange and the highest groundwater age possibly due to the influence of deeper water 4 3 4 2 meotian relatively younger groundwater compared to other waters indicates a probable connection between the smirnenski formation sandy layers with the outcropping sands of the pontian aquifer fig 1 4 3 4 3 dacian a specific feature of this aquifer complex are sandy lenses and layers that vary in thickness location in depth and hydraulic conductivity values depending of the sandy content the wide range of groundwater age in two neighboring boreholes close to the village of komoshtitsa 300 yr bp and 8600 yr bp indicates poor hydraulic connection between different lenses and layers as well as different recharge and discharge conditions this significant difference also suggests the absence of a hydraulic connection in this area between the waters of dacian and underlying pontian aquifers 4 3 4 4 pontian the numerous samples of the pontian aquifer 7 samples demonstrate groundwater ages that range from about 300 to 11 700 yr bp one exception is the water sample from the borehole in the village of vasilovtsi where water can be considered to be modern in this area the pontian aquifer is relatively shallow and could have a direct connection with the river passing near the village at lower elevation the highest values from about 8000 to 11 700 yr bp are common in the central part of the aquifer with a reduced age near the town of lom to 5000 yr bp this phenomenon could be explained by significantly higher hydraulic conductivity values in this area a second possibility could be intensive groundwater exploitation near to the town of lom the various samples taken from the pontian aquifer were analyzed for possible interrelations between parameters determined from individual groundwater samples the most indicative parameter is thought to be the groundwater age increasing groundwater age is associated with increasing concentrations of na k cl concentrations and increasing electrical conductivity of water moreover an increase nitrite no2 and ammonium nh4 contents is registered along with increasing of cod chemical oxygen demand in these water samples conversely the redox potential and nitrate no3 show evident decrease with the increasing groundwater age 4 4 noble gas temperature and paleoclimate reconstruction the concentrations of noble gases are suitable indicators to estimate the groundwater recharge temperature the noble gas concentrations of ne ar kr and xe are derived from the atmosphere and after their dissolution into the water their concentrations do not change along the flow path since they take part neither in chemical nor biological processes the interpretation of noble gas concentrations in groundwater requires inverse modelling which can determine reliable noble gas solubility or recharge temperature ngt this requires a correction for excess air and a model proposed to determine its formation the closed system equilibration model of gas partitioning was used in this study aeschbach hertig et al 1999 noble gas results are shown in table 4 and the uncertainty of the noble gas temperature determination is about 0 6 c we already noted that the average air temperature in the danubian plain is 11 4 c water temperature near in the recharge area vasilovtsi is 13 c as measured in the field which may reflect ground temperature the noble gas temperatures measured vary between 8 1 c and 13 4 c table 4 ngts of the dacian aquifer vary between 9 95 c and 11 17 c although the ngts from the pontian aquifer shows higher variability 8 1 c to 13 4 c somewhat lower ngt values in the smirnenski dolni tsibar and valchedram wells presumably indicate recharge during the glacial holocene transition fig 7 a likely admixture of recent groundwater to glacial water is conceivable due to the low radiocarbon content with measureable tritium in a water sample from the smirnenski well and a minimal tritium content in the dolni tsibar well the waters from the sarmatian and pontian aquifers are presumed to have recharged during late glacial times or to have incorporated glacial water that result in ngt somewhat lower than groundwater from the mid and late holocene fig 7 these groundwater samples are characterized by ngts of about 8 3 c whereas the late holocene waters have ngts around 12 c which is similar to the mean annual air temperature of 11 4 c so the largest temperature change observed is about 3 7 c these recharge temperature differences might represent the transition time between these two periods this transition period can be also observed in the stable isotope data where the groundwater with larger residence times has more negative δ2h and δ18o values suggesting the groundwater recharge occurred during the late glacial holocene climatic transition period table 3 fig 8 paleoclimate reconstruction studies in europe based on dissolved noble gases in groundwater have shown higher temperature differences between the holocene and glacial periods for example 5 7 c in the bohemian cretaceous basin corcho alvarado et al 2013 and at least 5 c in the glatt valley switzerland beyerle et al 1998 in the pannonian basin the warming after the last glacial maximum lgm reached a temperature of 9 1 c varsányi et al 2011 and this temperature in the ledo paniselian aquifer is 9 5 c blaser et al 2010 comparing these ngt values in europe the temperature differences obtained here appear to be too low comparable observations were made for a jurassic limestone aquifer in poland where the ngt was 2 3 5 c lower than recent recharge groundwater osenbrück et al 1993 assuming some mixing with recent waters these noble gas temperatures could reflect either mixing or a transition phase between the two climatic periods the lower ngt difference between the colder and warmer recharge waters can be explained as that the mean residence times do not reflect groundwater recharged at the lgm i e the groundwater at the oldest part of the aquifer does not reflect glacial temperatures 5 conclusion this study presents a hydrogeological and palaeoclimatic interpretation for the lom depression northwest bulgaria a multi tracer approach is presented to reconstruct the recharge temperature and identify isotopic hydrological character of the aquifers using the environmental isotopes δ18o δ2h δ13c 3h 14c and noble gases the stable isotope results show that the recharge sources of the groundwater studied are local meteoric water for a groundwater sample from the vasilovtsi well the 3h 3he groundwater age of 40 6 0 7 years was confirmed tritium content in deep groundwater with low radiocarbon content was determined for three wells the presence of tritium can be attributed to mixing process between old and recent waters due either to overexploitation or leakage in the well the ingerson and pearson radiocarbon model was used to estimate mean residence times taking into account chemical and isotope hydrological parameters to achieve precise groundwater ages from the 14c content of dissolved inorganic carbon modelled groundwater residence times fall within the last twelve thousand years with samples from the early holocene with ages between 8000 9300 yr bp rua komoshtitsa pumped agroinvest and older waters that date to between 10 000 12 000 yr bp valchedram dolni tsibar smirnenski from the late pleistocene or the transition time between the holocene and pleistocene the noble gas results provide quantitative information on the temperature of recharge and qualitative information on the time of recharge they make it conceivable to estimate the climatic conditions under which the recharge took place and to confirm the time of recharge values of 3 4 c lower ngt for smirnenski dolni tsibar and valchedram presumably indicate that the recharge occurred during the glacial holocene transition an admixture of recent holocene groundwater to glacial water is likely due to the low radiocarbon content in presence of some tritium in water sample from smirnenski well and a low tritium content for the dolni tsibar well the results of this study significantly change our previous knowledge about the hydrodynamics of the lom basin in particular we have shown that the pontian aquifer has no hydraulic connection to the danube river the sandy layers and lenses forming the dacian aquifer are apparently hydraulically isolated and therefore have high degree of heterogeneity

8433,study region teesta river of eastern himalayas india study focus this article addresses the mechanisms of weathering in the teesta river for the first time based on the original data of major ions water samples were collected along the teesta river in sikkim himalaya india the evaluation of the major ion and trace elements against the standard guideline values and the average chemical composition of world rivers were discussed new hydrological insights the predominance of ca mg and hco3 in all waters reflects the influence of carbonate weathering on the teesta river however an increase in the na ca ratio was linked to the increase of si downstream indicating that silicate weathering was predominant in the lowlands of teesta drainage the rate of silicate weathering is dependent on an overall balance of key factors including gradient contact time temperature and vegetation the higher concentration of cations was balanced by the so4 originating from the action of h2so4 and h2co3 on carbonates and silicates rock weathering carbonate silicate weathering is the key mechanism that controls the major ion chemistry of the teesta river followed by evaporite dissolution keywords carbonate weathering silicate weathering eastern himalayas teesta river chemistry major ions sikkim himalaya 1 introduction the status of natural water throughout the world has been gradually changing due to climate change and an increase in human activity raymond et al 2008 according to research initiated by the world health organization who around 1 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water who 2011 the receding of himalayan glaciers due to global climate change has a noticeable impact on the chemistry and the contamination level of toxic metals of the rivers in the himalayas huang et al 2009 qu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 since the water from rivers is the main source of freshwater for human and animals monitoring of river water availability and water quality are very important for society and ecosystems behmel et al 2016 the teesta river an important tributary of the brahmaputra river is a source of fresh water for the aquatic ecosystem that is home to the activities of millions of people along its route khuman et al 2018 it is located in the state of sikkim in the eastern indian himalaya and is characterised by a large difference in vertical topography over a short horizontal distance bhutan and nepal lie east and west of sikkim respectively the teesta river originates from the teesta khangse or pauhunri glaciers northwest of the state at 7 127 m above sea level meetei et al 2007 wiejaczka et al 2014 however at some of the headwater locations in the northern part water also originates from the tibetan plateau as shown in fig 1 in comparison with other sub basins of the eastern himalayas the teesta catchment of sikkim has various landscapes in terms of its morphology and landforms singh et al 2017 krishna 2005 meetei et al 2007 it was proposed that the average chemical denudation rate of the brahmaputra basin is twice as high as that of the ganges and five times higher than the global average galy et al 1999 sarin et al 1989 currently studies on the sikkim himalayas mostly focus on the formation of tectonics land use and soil properties kellett et al 2015 jain et al 2000 prokop and płoskonka 2014 rai et al 1994 singh et al 2017 singh and goyal 2016 an asynchronous trend of monsoon variation in the eastern himalayas has been recognised within the last few centuries bhattacharyya et al 2007 ghosh et al 2018 li et al 2017 flood and drought due to an excess and shortage of precipitation within the same year are more common in the 21st century goswami et al 2018 furthermore there are areas that are more prone to flooding due to wet days and precipitation in the eastern himalayas goswami et al 2018 singh and goyal 2016 the teesta river represents the overall fluvial system in the sikkim himalayas however there was a lack of scientific research on water chemistry in comparison to the other rivers of indian himalaya das et al 2018 devi et al 2016 gogoi et al 2016 philip et al 2018 data regarding the chemistry of major ions in the teesta river and its comparison with other himalayan rivers is not available due to lack of studies therefore the primary objective of the current study is to determine the spatial variations of major ions and trace elements of the teesta river in sikkim to the best of our knowledge to date the geochemistry of major ions in the teesta river has not been studied the current study provides a baseline for further research work dealing with the fluvial system in the eastern himalayas it aims to support water resource management the implementation of water conservation policies and actions in the eastern himalayas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and geology of the study area our study area of sikkim in the eastern himalaya lies within the coordinates 27 04 46 to 28 07 48 n and 88 00 58 to 88 55 25 e covering an area of 7096 km2 the drainage system of the teesta river covers the entire state from the north by adjoining with many small tributaries fed by glaciers and precipitation water samples were collected from 19 sampling sites site1 site 19 along the teesta river in sikkim india fig 1 the rangit river a major tributary of the teesta river was sampled at five locations site13 to site 17 as shown in fig 1 the teesta river flows from sikkim to west bengal on the indian subcontinent and then on to bangladesh serving as a major source for irrigation and hydropower generation sikkim is sub divided into types of geotectonic domains distinguished from each other by key tectonic elements karan 1989 sinha roy 1982 the main exposed rock units in the study area are shown in fig 2 in the northern part of sikkim tethyan sedimentary sequence tss with cambro ordovician to tertiary sediments is exposed fig 2 the tethyan rocks are composed mainly of from old to new mica schist sandstone metamorphosed and unmetamorphosed fossil rich limestone calcareous arkose and siltstone pyrite rich black shale interbedded at all scales tipper et al 2006 limestone and a massive carbonate sequence wolff boenisch et al 2009 the main central thrust mct divides the greater himalayan sequence ghs from the lesser himalayan sequence lhs fig 2 the ghs mainly consists of two units of silicate gneiss and calc silicate metamorphic rocks which include high grade gneisses quartzites calc silicate rocks calcite rich feldspar intercalations of biotite schists bickle et al 2001 tipper et al 2006 the lhs is dominated by precambrian rocks composed of quartzite gneiss schists phyllite granite and some limestone and marble wolff boenisch et al 2009 swades kumar basu 2013 south of the lhs is the sub himalayan sequence which comprises deposits of the siwaliks mio pliocene fig 2 the inverted metamorphism is best observed in sikkim himalaya carosi et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 2 2 climate according to meetei et al 2007 the climate regime of sikkim himalaya can be classified into five types depending upon elevation they are i subtropical zone up to 1000 m ii warm temperate zone between 1000 and 2000 m iii cold temperate zone between 2000 and 2500 m iv cold zone between 2500 and 4000 m and v frigid zone above 4000 m the main sources of the teesta river water are from glacial meltwater and precipitation sc mukhopadhyay 1982 the teesta basin is mainly glaciated terrain in the northern part sc mukhopadhyay 1982 sikkim himalaya is rich in flora and fauna and has more than 315 glacial lakes it has been largely influenced by the bay of bengal branch of the indian summer monsoon and there is significant heterogeneity in the precipitation lapse rate azhoni and goyal 2018 singh and goyal 2016 2 3 sampling and analyses sampling from the teesta river was performed in march 2018 sampling sites were selected based on the elevation and the proximity to the source the sampling plan focused on the entire mainstream of teesta river in sikkim himalaya the elevation of the sampling sites ranged from 3697 m to 203 m representative samples were collected from the headwaters of the river lachen and lachung up to the confluence with the rangit river the mid stream of the teesta river was inaccessible due to steep terrain the ph was measured in situ using a wagtech multimeter cp 1000 prior to measurement the meters were calibrated by standard solutions samples were collected at a depth of approximately 30 cm from the surface of water against the flow all samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm polypropylene syringe filter and acidified with ultrapure nitric acid for metal analysis in a 30 ml ldpe bottle prewashed with 10 nitric acid and ultra pure water unacidified samples were collected in 30 ml pre washed ldpe bottles for cation and anion analysis unfiltered samples were collected in a 250 ml polycarbonate bottle for alkalinity measurement all samples were stored at 4 c until laboratory analysis the samples were quantified using icp oes agilent 5100 australia for major elements and silicon the accuracy of the method was assessed by the reference solution of the mono component element certified reference material crm sigma aldrich blank and replicate sample analysis was performed the rsd for all the analyses of elements was 10 which showed the high precision of the methods an alkalinity measurement was carried out by titration with 0 02 n h2so4 the anion analyses were measured using the ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 accredited method based on standard iso 10304 1 2007 at the finnish environment institute oulu all blank samples were below the detection limit of the instruments the total dissolved solids tds were calculated by the sum of all the major ions ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 hco3 cl and si 3 result and discussion 3 1 general observations the results of in situ measurements ph and turbidity are shown in table 1 the teesta river of sikkim himalaya was slightly alkaline with a narrow range of ph from 7 16 to 8 49 the average turbidity of the river is 6 76 except at sampling sites 11 and 12 at site 11 and 12 the turbidity values were almost three times higher than the average value and the concentration of nitrate was 6 13 μmol l and 4 68 μmol l respectively the higher concentration of no3 and turbidity at sites 11 and 12 than the remaining sites indicates the contribution of a local pollutant from the nearby state s largest town at sampling sites 11 and 12 it was observed that the mean tds value is 66 20 mg l the concentration of cations and anions are plotted in fig 3 data in supplementary table s1 the total cation tz and anion tz are comparable for all the samples having significant correlation at 0 01 one tailed with a pearson coefficient value of 0 88 good data quality is implied by a good correlation between the sum of major cations and anions r2 0 74 and charge balance z z z z within 15 the samples with a tz value of less than tz may be due to the presence of organic ligands singh et al 2005 but this is not discussed in this research 3 2 classification into upstream and downstream waters based on geologic terrains and altitudes as shown in fig 2 sampling sites 1 8 on the teesta river lie on geologic terrain dominated by ghs while sites 9 19 lie in the zone of lhs classification of the teesta river in sikkim into upstream and downstream waters can facilitate the discussion of the geochemical evolution of water chemistry from headwaters to downstream it was found that sites 1 8 are located at high altitudes elevation ranges from 1686 m at site 8 to 3697 m at site 1 while sites 9 19 are situated at lower altitudes from 1294 m at site 9 to 216 m at site 19 fig 4 based on these observations sampling sites 1 8 are considered upstream waters while sites 9 19 represent downstream waters the general trends of major ions concentration from headwaters to downstream does not show any particular pattern fig 3 but a slight increase in na from sites 9 19 is observed fig 3a 3 3 mechanisms controlling the water chemistry of the teesta river the three dominant mechanisms controlling global water chemistry are rock weathering precipitation and the evaporation crystallization process gibbs 1970 according to gibb s plot as shown in fig 5 the points are mainly towards carbonate and silicate end members that show the main mechanism controlling the water chemistry of the teesta river ternary plotting can help to understand the major ion chemistry of the present assessment fig 6 for cation on average ca2 covers the highest total cationic equivalent charge of 63 followed by na and k with 22 5 mg2 covering 14 5 for anion hco3 is the dominating ion contributing almost 55 3 of total anionic equivalent charge followed by so4 2 and cl with 25 7 so4 is the main contributor to this value si covering 19 the trend of the highest composition of ca2 and hco3 in the teesta river indicates their derivation from carbonate weathering similar findings were observed at the yamuna river and the brahmaputra river dalai et al 2002b qu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the main bedrock of eastern himalaya is silicate rock and only about 1 carbonate rock the himalayan region has a high frequency of physical weathering and chemical erosion colin et al 1999 dalai et al 2002a singh et al 2005 the points in ternary plots seem to align from the ca2 apex towards the na side accompanied by drifting from the so4 2 side toward the hco3 and si domain a general tendency of evolution from carbonate weathering to silicate weathering as water flows from upstream to downstream was observed and is shown by arrows in fig 6 however hco3 mainly originates from carbonate weathering which demonstrates the great dominance of carbonates rocks as controls of water chemistry blum et al 1998 the considerable so4 2 in upstream waters was likely derived from tss rocks as products of pyrite oxidation as the pyrite rich black shale was interbedded in tss rocks the na normalised molar ratio plot of ca2 na versus hco3 na shows the spatiotemporal variability in hydrogeochemistry with three end members carbonate silicate evaporites co2 driven weathering of these end members can help in the understanding of the weathering processes in the watersheds with silicate carbonate terrain fig 7 the downstream points of the teesta river are mainly scattered towards silicate carbonate end members whereas the upstream points are closer to the line connecting carbonates and evaporites fig 7 therefore the model revealed that carbonate and silicate weathering has more influence downstream of the teesta river and upstream is more affected by carbonate weathering and evaporites however all samples slightly deviate from the three end members mixing lines fig 7b this deviation indicates that along with h2co3 h2so4 derived from pyrite oxidation and or the oxidation of sulphur from organic rich soils seems to contribute to the weathering process h2so4 from pyrite oxidation as a major weathering agent was also concluded by meyer et al 2017 during the study of the chemical weathering of the high standing island watershed in taiwan that has pyrite widespread throughout the study area as well as by li et al 2011 during the study of jialing river chemistry in southwest china 3 4 distinguishing between upstream waters and downstream waters based on k concentrations the ca2 na ratios in the himalayan stream waters showed great variability for example the average ca2 na ratio calculated by krishnaswami and singh 1998 was 0 7 whereas jacobson et al 2002a estimated it to be 0 18 for the raikhot watershed within the himalayan region in the present study the average ratio of ca2 na varied from 2 46 upstream to 1 65 downstream table 2 the wide range of ca2 na ratios in the himalaya region is attributed to the variation of the lithology of higher and lesser himalaya the relative contribution of ca2 and na by rocks is not well quantified as stated by krisnaswami and sunil singh 2005 likewise the teesta river is draining from ghs to lhs and these rock units can contribute na and ca2 to the himalayan watershed accordingly as it is assumed that k originated exclusively from silicate weathering in the himalayan streams hodson et al 2002 wolff boenisch et al 2009 a cluster analysis based on k concentrations in all waters is used as a tool to identify the magnitude of silicate weathering in the teesta river watershed in sikkim fig 8 this cluster analysis was able to classify the sampling sites into two main groups with group 1 from sampling sites 1 8 and group 2 from sites 9 19 based on k concentrations likewise the vegetation coverage of sikkim himalaya varies widely within the basin with the upper region of north sikkim mostly covered by snow and glaciers and the lower region towards the south covered by forest and hard rocks ghosh et al 2018 meetei et al 2007 as shown in table 2 the higher values of k na na ca2 k ca2 si and hco3 in downstream waters compared to upstream waters revealed that silicate weathering increases towards lowlands downstream thus k can be used as a useful tracer for silicate weathering especially when the ca na ratio varies greatly as in the cases of varying lithology in the himalayan catchments 3 5 contribution of carbonate and silicate weathering to the major ions of the teesta river 3 5 1 carbonate weathering the geology of the studied watershed showed the distribution of massive carbonates in tss rock units and the intercalations of carbonates with silicates in ghs and lhs blum et al 1998 stated that although the carbonates represent very small amounts in ghs 1 they contribute 82 of the hco3 to the rivers draining ghs rocks similar findings by jacobson et al 2002a and jacobson et al 2002b revealed that more than 90 of hco3 and ca2 is derived from carbonate weathering in the glaciated himalayas although carbonates are represented by only 1 wt in fresh glacial till liu et al 2011 the binary plots of major ions in μeq l were used fig 9 to identify the main sources and processes controlling the major ion chemistry in the teesta river first in the case of upstream waters sites 1 9 the scatter plot of mg2 ca2 versus hco3 in μeq l of the upstream waters lies around the equiline with r2 equalling 0 92 which indicates a dominant source of these ions in the headwaters of the teesta river from the weathering of carbonate rocks fig 9a the teesta river upstream receives waters from tss which are dominated by limestone swades kumar basu 2013 moreover these results agreed well with the results of blum et al 1998 that ghs is characterised by the presence of small amounts of marble calc silicate and calcareous sedimentary rocks however small amounts of carbonate have a major influence on the river chemistry of the himalayan watershed in upstream waters some points are scattered slightly above the carbonate weathering line which shows little excess of ca2 over hco3 the ca2 should be balanced by other anions such as so4 2 sourced from evaporites or sulphide oxidation the so4 2 contribution form oxidation of the pyrite shows that so4 2 concentration surpasses that of ca2 concentration for the most upstream sample the studies of headwaters in the naryani basin in nepal himalaya by galy et al 1999 observed that oxidation of sulphides is the primary source of sulphate in rivers with geotectonic and lithologies similar to the teesta river the significant weak correlation coefficient r2 0 22 between hco3 and so4 2 at upstream sites shows the influence of sulphuric acid as well as evaporite dissolution the probable contribution of evaporite dissolution and sulphuric acid to the excess of ca2 in the upper reaches of the teesta river without sulphur isotopes data is difficult to estimate nonetheless a negative slope value slope 79 31 r2 0 09 of na k and so42 so4 2 hco3 and weak correlation r2 0 10 slope 696 98 between mg2 ca2 and so4 so4 hco3 are observed therefore it is safe to consider that waters in the upper reaches of the teesta river mainly accumulate from the contribution of carbonate weathering followed by sulphide oxidation and evaporite dissolution mg2 ca2 both upstream and downstream shows a positive correlation with hco3 the regression line having a slope value of 1 50 r2 0 92 upstream which decreases in the downstream with a slope value of 0 70 r2 0 43 indicating the contribution of silicate weathering in addition to carbonate weathering at downstream sites thus it can be concluded that the waters in the lower reaches collect contributions from both silicate and carbonate weathering thereby decreasing the correlation coefficient in downstream samples as shown in fig 9b these findings are in good agreement with other previous studies conducted on other river basins in himalaya which argued that the contribution of lhs carbonates to river fluxes in himalaya is small france lanord and derry 1999 krishnaswami 1999 in downstream waters the initial few points appear below the equiline fig 9b which means an excess of hco3 over ca2 this excess of hco3 over ca2 in downstream waters probably derives from silicate weathering and this observation validates the earlier finding in table 2 that silicate weathering perhaps increases from upstream to downstream in the teesta river the stoichiometry between total ca2 mg2 and total hco3 showed that some sites have higher values of ca2 mg2 than hco3 which requires additional anions such as so4 2 for ionic balance it can be suggested that sulphuric acid might play a part in carbonate weathering in the teesta river krisnaswami and sunil singh 2005 demonstrated that sulphide oxidation is the leading supplier of so4 2 in the himalayan river basins in india so sulphide oxidation appears to be the main source of so4 2 throughout the teesta river catchment in sikkim the absence of evaporites gypsum or anhydrite in the himalayan river catchments was noted in galy et al 1999 dalai et al 2002a hodson et al 2002 and wolff boenish et al 2009 these observations are similar to findings given by galy et al 1999 that sulphide oxidation acts as the most likely source of so4 2 in the northern himalayan basins the significant positive correlation r2 0 67 between ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 linked with a slope close to the equiline indicates the significant action of h2so4 on carbonate weathering li and ji 2016 meyer et al 2017 fig 9c excess hco3 so4 2 over ca2 mg2 indicates non carbonate sources i e interaction of h2so4 and h2co3 on silicates and this excess should be balanced by na and k that were found in higher amounts than cl 3 5 2 silicates weathering silicate rocks represent the main bedrock in the teesta river catchment area kinetically the weathering of carbonate rocks is more rapid than silicate rocks in aquatic systems sarin and krishnaswami 1984 in this study silicate weathering probably contributes to na and k in the river water according to krisnaswami and sunil singh 2005 the dissolution of na from silicates nasil can be calculated as follows nasil nar clr where nar and clr are the concentrations of na and cl in the river water it was found that the average ratio of na cl in all waters is 6 8 this indicates that the major source of na in the teesta river is from silicate weathering the scatter plots of upstream and downstream water shown in fig 10 a and b are above the equiline and closer to the na k domain indicating the derivations of these ions from silicate ions the positive correlation of na and cl at all sites indicates that the contribution could likely be from rainwater hot springs and salt dissolution the annual rainfall differs across the state depending upon the zones from 400 mm in temperate to subalpine zones to 1250 mm or less in the lower elevation of south sikkim and 500 mm in the dry plateaus of north sikkim seidler 2018 http en climate data org region 779 the south sikkim district receives the maximum average annual rainfall mostly arriving during the monsoon season of june september according to galy et al 1999 the chemical composition of rain water in himalaya is 7 4 μm and rainwater contribution to the riverine dissolved load from the average rainwater concentration multiplied by 1 33 25 evapotranspiration in the himalaya is estimated the rain and snow contribution of the cl could differ greatly from different streams and estimates of the contribution of the riverine chemical budget have not been extensively discussed it is however safe to conclude that the increase in cl concentration from upstream to downstream is likely partly the result of rainwater likewise a study conducted on the chemical composition of spring water in south sikkim by vishwakarma et al 2019 estimated that cl is the second highest anion in spring water with an order of anionic dominance of hco3 cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 f so cl increases downstream could also be a result of hot springs and the dissolution of trace amounts of nacl salt from soils in the teesta river watershed 3 6 effect of gradient vegetation cover and temperature on the rate of water rock interaction 3 6 1 potential effect of gradient and vegetation cover the elevation difference between sampling sites 1 8 upstream was 2011 m over a distance of about 34 km while the elevation difference between sampling site 9 19 downstream was 1059 m over about 70 km see fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the gradient of flow of the teesta river changes from a steep slope upstream to a gentle slope downstream kinetically the rate of weathering of carbonate rocks is higher than silicate rocks the upper region of north sikkim is mostly covered by snow and glaciers while vegetation cover is mostly seen in the lowlands ghosh et al 2018 meetei et al 2007 vegetation cover enhances the rate of silicate weathering as it enables water retention and percolation into the soil thus increasing the contact time allowed for reaction between the silicate minerals and pore water gabet et al 2006 tipper et al 2006 it can thus be concluded that the rate of silicate weathering is dependent on an overall balance of key factors including gradient contact time temperature and vegetation 3 6 2 effect of temperature due to the altitude differences the local climate of sikkim can play an important role in the weathering process in the teesta river catchment area in sikkim based on elevation differences between highlands and lowlands the climate changes from subtropical at low altitudes downstream to cold temperate or cold at high altitudes wolff boenish et al 2009 concluded that the effect of the global climate on the himalayan basins was causing the transportation of silicate particles from upper regions which weathered in the lower regions mineral dissolution is kinetically dependent on temperature wolff boenish et al 2009 as stated by dalai et al 2002b there is a strong relationship between the rate of silicate weathering and temperature in the tributaries of the yamuna river in the lesser himalaya sequence lhs this proves that conditions for silicate weathering were more favourable in the lowlands warmer than highlands in sikkim 3 7 comparison of major ions with the brahmaputra yarlung tsangpo and the global average mg l a comparison of the mean value of the major ion compositions in the teesta river with other rivers and the global average are shown in table 3 the mean concentration of mg2 and cl in the teesta river is lower than the global average value whereas the concentrations of ca2 and na are comparable to the global average it is observed that the major ionic composition of the teesta river in sikkim himalaya is less than the yarlung tsangpo on the tibetan plateau but comparable to the brahmaputra in india singh et al 2005 the substantial difference in the chemical ion constituents in the yarlung tsangpo on the tibet plateau and sikkim in indian himalaya could be attributable to various factors such as soil type elevation rate of precipitation mining and industrial activities the high rate of precipitation in sikkim himalaya has caused a dilution effect on the ions concentration in the teesta river so a lower level of overall ionic composition is observed than in yarlung tsangpo huang et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 the south asian summer monsoon has an effect on eastern himalaya gibling et al 2005 the tds of the teesta river significantly increases with a decrease in elevation as the vegetation coverage increases the ionic concentration values of the teesta river were within the range of the global average as shown in table 3 however the concentration of cl is almost four times lower than the global average sikkim himalaya is situated near the southern part of the tibetan plateau it is less affected by anthropogenic activities and would receive a less cyclic salt contribution which could be a reason for the low levels of cl taking that into account it is considered that the contribution of cl by the cyclic salt decreases as the distance from the sea increases stallard and edmond 1981 3 8 comparison of major ions and trace elements for the elemental composition in the teesta river 14 elements were measured that are considered elements of health concern by the bureau of indian standards and who bis 2012 who 2011 the metals b ba cr mn mo ni zn and li were quantified with varying concentrations at different sampling sites cd pb cu al as and u were all below detection limits the average concentrations of the measured elements and the standard guideline values of who and bis are shown in table 4 it was found that all the measured trace elements lie within the standard guidelines of who and bis except for boron likewise the concentration of all the elements is just trace amounts which indicates that the teesta river does not have significant anthropogenic influence studies suggested that boron is an essential trace element for marine life and is abundantly available in oceans carrano et al 2009 mottram et al 2014 the main central thrust zone of sikkim himalaya is also characterised by large concentrations of tourmaline that could be attributable to the relatively high concentration of boron in the river moreover all the parameters including in situ measurements major ions and trace elements of the river were found to be within the standard guideline values apart from turbidity 4 conclusion this study provides valuable information on the water chemistry and mechanisms of weathering in the teesta river of sikkim himalaya it also contributes to the study of weathering of himalayan regions that has always received varied explanations due to large variations in lithology and geotectonic domain it also provides original data on the major ions and the trace elements of the teesta river the river chemistry is mainly dominated by natural phenomena with upstream mainly influenced by carbonate weathering and downstream mainly governed by silicate weathering ca2 mg2 and hco3 were mainly provided from carbonate weathering while na and k originated from silicate weathering throughout the entire watershed h2co3 and h2so4 make significant contributions to the weathering process the increase of na ca2 linked with an increase in si from upstream to downstream validates the contribution of silicate rocks in the weathering process of the teesta river in the sikkim lowlands gradient vegetation cover and temperature have played supporting roles in silicate weathering downstream likewise the contribution of hot spring and rainwater to the riverine chemical composition of downstream sites was observed the cluster analysis ca based on k concentration could successfully differentiate between upstream and downstream waters the concentration of major ions and elements are in the range of the concentration of the global average in rivers the overall state of the teesta river is pristine with minimal contribution from human activities and the river is suitable for irrigation purposes the main limitation of this assessment is based on one sampling campaign but it contributes to narrowing the gap in research into the teesta river of the indian himalayas that has rarely been discussed the dynamic landscape and vegetation coverage of sikkim has an enormous impact on river chemistry this study can support future studies on the geochemistry of sikkim which could also contribute to water resource management and the preservation of natural resources appendix a supplementary data supplementary

8433,study region teesta river of eastern himalayas india study focus this article addresses the mechanisms of weathering in the teesta river for the first time based on the original data of major ions water samples were collected along the teesta river in sikkim himalaya india the evaluation of the major ion and trace elements against the standard guideline values and the average chemical composition of world rivers were discussed new hydrological insights the predominance of ca mg and hco3 in all waters reflects the influence of carbonate weathering on the teesta river however an increase in the na ca ratio was linked to the increase of si downstream indicating that silicate weathering was predominant in the lowlands of teesta drainage the rate of silicate weathering is dependent on an overall balance of key factors including gradient contact time temperature and vegetation the higher concentration of cations was balanced by the so4 originating from the action of h2so4 and h2co3 on carbonates and silicates rock weathering carbonate silicate weathering is the key mechanism that controls the major ion chemistry of the teesta river followed by evaporite dissolution keywords carbonate weathering silicate weathering eastern himalayas teesta river chemistry major ions sikkim himalaya 1 introduction the status of natural water throughout the world has been gradually changing due to climate change and an increase in human activity raymond et al 2008 according to research initiated by the world health organization who around 1 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water who 2011 the receding of himalayan glaciers due to global climate change has a noticeable impact on the chemistry and the contamination level of toxic metals of the rivers in the himalayas huang et al 2009 qu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 since the water from rivers is the main source of freshwater for human and animals monitoring of river water availability and water quality are very important for society and ecosystems behmel et al 2016 the teesta river an important tributary of the brahmaputra river is a source of fresh water for the aquatic ecosystem that is home to the activities of millions of people along its route khuman et al 2018 it is located in the state of sikkim in the eastern indian himalaya and is characterised by a large difference in vertical topography over a short horizontal distance bhutan and nepal lie east and west of sikkim respectively the teesta river originates from the teesta khangse or pauhunri glaciers northwest of the state at 7 127 m above sea level meetei et al 2007 wiejaczka et al 2014 however at some of the headwater locations in the northern part water also originates from the tibetan plateau as shown in fig 1 in comparison with other sub basins of the eastern himalayas the teesta catchment of sikkim has various landscapes in terms of its morphology and landforms singh et al 2017 krishna 2005 meetei et al 2007 it was proposed that the average chemical denudation rate of the brahmaputra basin is twice as high as that of the ganges and five times higher than the global average galy et al 1999 sarin et al 1989 currently studies on the sikkim himalayas mostly focus on the formation of tectonics land use and soil properties kellett et al 2015 jain et al 2000 prokop and płoskonka 2014 rai et al 1994 singh et al 2017 singh and goyal 2016 an asynchronous trend of monsoon variation in the eastern himalayas has been recognised within the last few centuries bhattacharyya et al 2007 ghosh et al 2018 li et al 2017 flood and drought due to an excess and shortage of precipitation within the same year are more common in the 21st century goswami et al 2018 furthermore there are areas that are more prone to flooding due to wet days and precipitation in the eastern himalayas goswami et al 2018 singh and goyal 2016 the teesta river represents the overall fluvial system in the sikkim himalayas however there was a lack of scientific research on water chemistry in comparison to the other rivers of indian himalaya das et al 2018 devi et al 2016 gogoi et al 2016 philip et al 2018 data regarding the chemistry of major ions in the teesta river and its comparison with other himalayan rivers is not available due to lack of studies therefore the primary objective of the current study is to determine the spatial variations of major ions and trace elements of the teesta river in sikkim to the best of our knowledge to date the geochemistry of major ions in the teesta river has not been studied the current study provides a baseline for further research work dealing with the fluvial system in the eastern himalayas it aims to support water resource management the implementation of water conservation policies and actions in the eastern himalayas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and geology of the study area our study area of sikkim in the eastern himalaya lies within the coordinates 27 04 46 to 28 07 48 n and 88 00 58 to 88 55 25 e covering an area of 7096 km2 the drainage system of the teesta river covers the entire state from the north by adjoining with many small tributaries fed by glaciers and precipitation water samples were collected from 19 sampling sites site1 site 19 along the teesta river in sikkim india fig 1 the rangit river a major tributary of the teesta river was sampled at five locations site13 to site 17 as shown in fig 1 the teesta river flows from sikkim to west bengal on the indian subcontinent and then on to bangladesh serving as a major source for irrigation and hydropower generation sikkim is sub divided into types of geotectonic domains distinguished from each other by key tectonic elements karan 1989 sinha roy 1982 the main exposed rock units in the study area are shown in fig 2 in the northern part of sikkim tethyan sedimentary sequence tss with cambro ordovician to tertiary sediments is exposed fig 2 the tethyan rocks are composed mainly of from old to new mica schist sandstone metamorphosed and unmetamorphosed fossil rich limestone calcareous arkose and siltstone pyrite rich black shale interbedded at all scales tipper et al 2006 limestone and a massive carbonate sequence wolff boenisch et al 2009 the main central thrust mct divides the greater himalayan sequence ghs from the lesser himalayan sequence lhs fig 2 the ghs mainly consists of two units of silicate gneiss and calc silicate metamorphic rocks which include high grade gneisses quartzites calc silicate rocks calcite rich feldspar intercalations of biotite schists bickle et al 2001 tipper et al 2006 the lhs is dominated by precambrian rocks composed of quartzite gneiss schists phyllite granite and some limestone and marble wolff boenisch et al 2009 swades kumar basu 2013 south of the lhs is the sub himalayan sequence which comprises deposits of the siwaliks mio pliocene fig 2 the inverted metamorphism is best observed in sikkim himalaya carosi et al 2018 chakraborty et al 2016 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 2 2 climate according to meetei et al 2007 the climate regime of sikkim himalaya can be classified into five types depending upon elevation they are i subtropical zone up to 1000 m ii warm temperate zone between 1000 and 2000 m iii cold temperate zone between 2000 and 2500 m iv cold zone between 2500 and 4000 m and v frigid zone above 4000 m the main sources of the teesta river water are from glacial meltwater and precipitation sc mukhopadhyay 1982 the teesta basin is mainly glaciated terrain in the northern part sc mukhopadhyay 1982 sikkim himalaya is rich in flora and fauna and has more than 315 glacial lakes it has been largely influenced by the bay of bengal branch of the indian summer monsoon and there is significant heterogeneity in the precipitation lapse rate azhoni and goyal 2018 singh and goyal 2016 2 3 sampling and analyses sampling from the teesta river was performed in march 2018 sampling sites were selected based on the elevation and the proximity to the source the sampling plan focused on the entire mainstream of teesta river in sikkim himalaya the elevation of the sampling sites ranged from 3697 m to 203 m representative samples were collected from the headwaters of the river lachen and lachung up to the confluence with the rangit river the mid stream of the teesta river was inaccessible due to steep terrain the ph was measured in situ using a wagtech multimeter cp 1000 prior to measurement the meters were calibrated by standard solutions samples were collected at a depth of approximately 30 cm from the surface of water against the flow all samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm polypropylene syringe filter and acidified with ultrapure nitric acid for metal analysis in a 30 ml ldpe bottle prewashed with 10 nitric acid and ultra pure water unacidified samples were collected in 30 ml pre washed ldpe bottles for cation and anion analysis unfiltered samples were collected in a 250 ml polycarbonate bottle for alkalinity measurement all samples were stored at 4 c until laboratory analysis the samples were quantified using icp oes agilent 5100 australia for major elements and silicon the accuracy of the method was assessed by the reference solution of the mono component element certified reference material crm sigma aldrich blank and replicate sample analysis was performed the rsd for all the analyses of elements was 10 which showed the high precision of the methods an alkalinity measurement was carried out by titration with 0 02 n h2so4 the anion analyses were measured using the ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 accredited method based on standard iso 10304 1 2007 at the finnish environment institute oulu all blank samples were below the detection limit of the instruments the total dissolved solids tds were calculated by the sum of all the major ions ca2 mg2 k na so4 2 hco3 cl and si 3 result and discussion 3 1 general observations the results of in situ measurements ph and turbidity are shown in table 1 the teesta river of sikkim himalaya was slightly alkaline with a narrow range of ph from 7 16 to 8 49 the average turbidity of the river is 6 76 except at sampling sites 11 and 12 at site 11 and 12 the turbidity values were almost three times higher than the average value and the concentration of nitrate was 6 13 μmol l and 4 68 μmol l respectively the higher concentration of no3 and turbidity at sites 11 and 12 than the remaining sites indicates the contribution of a local pollutant from the nearby state s largest town at sampling sites 11 and 12 it was observed that the mean tds value is 66 20 mg l the concentration of cations and anions are plotted in fig 3 data in supplementary table s1 the total cation tz and anion tz are comparable for all the samples having significant correlation at 0 01 one tailed with a pearson coefficient value of 0 88 good data quality is implied by a good correlation between the sum of major cations and anions r2 0 74 and charge balance z z z z within 15 the samples with a tz value of less than tz may be due to the presence of organic ligands singh et al 2005 but this is not discussed in this research 3 2 classification into upstream and downstream waters based on geologic terrains and altitudes as shown in fig 2 sampling sites 1 8 on the teesta river lie on geologic terrain dominated by ghs while sites 9 19 lie in the zone of lhs classification of the teesta river in sikkim into upstream and downstream waters can facilitate the discussion of the geochemical evolution of water chemistry from headwaters to downstream it was found that sites 1 8 are located at high altitudes elevation ranges from 1686 m at site 8 to 3697 m at site 1 while sites 9 19 are situated at lower altitudes from 1294 m at site 9 to 216 m at site 19 fig 4 based on these observations sampling sites 1 8 are considered upstream waters while sites 9 19 represent downstream waters the general trends of major ions concentration from headwaters to downstream does not show any particular pattern fig 3 but a slight increase in na from sites 9 19 is observed fig 3a 3 3 mechanisms controlling the water chemistry of the teesta river the three dominant mechanisms controlling global water chemistry are rock weathering precipitation and the evaporation crystallization process gibbs 1970 according to gibb s plot as shown in fig 5 the points are mainly towards carbonate and silicate end members that show the main mechanism controlling the water chemistry of the teesta river ternary plotting can help to understand the major ion chemistry of the present assessment fig 6 for cation on average ca2 covers the highest total cationic equivalent charge of 63 followed by na and k with 22 5 mg2 covering 14 5 for anion hco3 is the dominating ion contributing almost 55 3 of total anionic equivalent charge followed by so4 2 and cl with 25 7 so4 is the main contributor to this value si covering 19 the trend of the highest composition of ca2 and hco3 in the teesta river indicates their derivation from carbonate weathering similar findings were observed at the yamuna river and the brahmaputra river dalai et al 2002b qu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the main bedrock of eastern himalaya is silicate rock and only about 1 carbonate rock the himalayan region has a high frequency of physical weathering and chemical erosion colin et al 1999 dalai et al 2002a singh et al 2005 the points in ternary plots seem to align from the ca2 apex towards the na side accompanied by drifting from the so4 2 side toward the hco3 and si domain a general tendency of evolution from carbonate weathering to silicate weathering as water flows from upstream to downstream was observed and is shown by arrows in fig 6 however hco3 mainly originates from carbonate weathering which demonstrates the great dominance of carbonates rocks as controls of water chemistry blum et al 1998 the considerable so4 2 in upstream waters was likely derived from tss rocks as products of pyrite oxidation as the pyrite rich black shale was interbedded in tss rocks the na normalised molar ratio plot of ca2 na versus hco3 na shows the spatiotemporal variability in hydrogeochemistry with three end members carbonate silicate evaporites co2 driven weathering of these end members can help in the understanding of the weathering processes in the watersheds with silicate carbonate terrain fig 7 the downstream points of the teesta river are mainly scattered towards silicate carbonate end members whereas the upstream points are closer to the line connecting carbonates and evaporites fig 7 therefore the model revealed that carbonate and silicate weathering has more influence downstream of the teesta river and upstream is more affected by carbonate weathering and evaporites however all samples slightly deviate from the three end members mixing lines fig 7b this deviation indicates that along with h2co3 h2so4 derived from pyrite oxidation and or the oxidation of sulphur from organic rich soils seems to contribute to the weathering process h2so4 from pyrite oxidation as a major weathering agent was also concluded by meyer et al 2017 during the study of the chemical weathering of the high standing island watershed in taiwan that has pyrite widespread throughout the study area as well as by li et al 2011 during the study of jialing river chemistry in southwest china 3 4 distinguishing between upstream waters and downstream waters based on k concentrations the ca2 na ratios in the himalayan stream waters showed great variability for example the average ca2 na ratio calculated by krishnaswami and singh 1998 was 0 7 whereas jacobson et al 2002a estimated it to be 0 18 for the raikhot watershed within the himalayan region in the present study the average ratio of ca2 na varied from 2 46 upstream to 1 65 downstream table 2 the wide range of ca2 na ratios in the himalaya region is attributed to the variation of the lithology of higher and lesser himalaya the relative contribution of ca2 and na by rocks is not well quantified as stated by krisnaswami and sunil singh 2005 likewise the teesta river is draining from ghs to lhs and these rock units can contribute na and ca2 to the himalayan watershed accordingly as it is assumed that k originated exclusively from silicate weathering in the himalayan streams hodson et al 2002 wolff boenisch et al 2009 a cluster analysis based on k concentrations in all waters is used as a tool to identify the magnitude of silicate weathering in the teesta river watershed in sikkim fig 8 this cluster analysis was able to classify the sampling sites into two main groups with group 1 from sampling sites 1 8 and group 2 from sites 9 19 based on k concentrations likewise the vegetation coverage of sikkim himalaya varies widely within the basin with the upper region of north sikkim mostly covered by snow and glaciers and the lower region towards the south covered by forest and hard rocks ghosh et al 2018 meetei et al 2007 as shown in table 2 the higher values of k na na ca2 k ca2 si and hco3 in downstream waters compared to upstream waters revealed that silicate weathering increases towards lowlands downstream thus k can be used as a useful tracer for silicate weathering especially when the ca na ratio varies greatly as in the cases of varying lithology in the himalayan catchments 3 5 contribution of carbonate and silicate weathering to the major ions of the teesta river 3 5 1 carbonate weathering the geology of the studied watershed showed the distribution of massive carbonates in tss rock units and the intercalations of carbonates with silicates in ghs and lhs blum et al 1998 stated that although the carbonates represent very small amounts in ghs 1 they contribute 82 of the hco3 to the rivers draining ghs rocks similar findings by jacobson et al 2002a and jacobson et al 2002b revealed that more than 90 of hco3 and ca2 is derived from carbonate weathering in the glaciated himalayas although carbonates are represented by only 1 wt in fresh glacial till liu et al 2011 the binary plots of major ions in μeq l were used fig 9 to identify the main sources and processes controlling the major ion chemistry in the teesta river first in the case of upstream waters sites 1 9 the scatter plot of mg2 ca2 versus hco3 in μeq l of the upstream waters lies around the equiline with r2 equalling 0 92 which indicates a dominant source of these ions in the headwaters of the teesta river from the weathering of carbonate rocks fig 9a the teesta river upstream receives waters from tss which are dominated by limestone swades kumar basu 2013 moreover these results agreed well with the results of blum et al 1998 that ghs is characterised by the presence of small amounts of marble calc silicate and calcareous sedimentary rocks however small amounts of carbonate have a major influence on the river chemistry of the himalayan watershed in upstream waters some points are scattered slightly above the carbonate weathering line which shows little excess of ca2 over hco3 the ca2 should be balanced by other anions such as so4 2 sourced from evaporites or sulphide oxidation the so4 2 contribution form oxidation of the pyrite shows that so4 2 concentration surpasses that of ca2 concentration for the most upstream sample the studies of headwaters in the naryani basin in nepal himalaya by galy et al 1999 observed that oxidation of sulphides is the primary source of sulphate in rivers with geotectonic and lithologies similar to the teesta river the significant weak correlation coefficient r2 0 22 between hco3 and so4 2 at upstream sites shows the influence of sulphuric acid as well as evaporite dissolution the probable contribution of evaporite dissolution and sulphuric acid to the excess of ca2 in the upper reaches of the teesta river without sulphur isotopes data is difficult to estimate nonetheless a negative slope value slope 79 31 r2 0 09 of na k and so42 so4 2 hco3 and weak correlation r2 0 10 slope 696 98 between mg2 ca2 and so4 so4 hco3 are observed therefore it is safe to consider that waters in the upper reaches of the teesta river mainly accumulate from the contribution of carbonate weathering followed by sulphide oxidation and evaporite dissolution mg2 ca2 both upstream and downstream shows a positive correlation with hco3 the regression line having a slope value of 1 50 r2 0 92 upstream which decreases in the downstream with a slope value of 0 70 r2 0 43 indicating the contribution of silicate weathering in addition to carbonate weathering at downstream sites thus it can be concluded that the waters in the lower reaches collect contributions from both silicate and carbonate weathering thereby decreasing the correlation coefficient in downstream samples as shown in fig 9b these findings are in good agreement with other previous studies conducted on other river basins in himalaya which argued that the contribution of lhs carbonates to river fluxes in himalaya is small france lanord and derry 1999 krishnaswami 1999 in downstream waters the initial few points appear below the equiline fig 9b which means an excess of hco3 over ca2 this excess of hco3 over ca2 in downstream waters probably derives from silicate weathering and this observation validates the earlier finding in table 2 that silicate weathering perhaps increases from upstream to downstream in the teesta river the stoichiometry between total ca2 mg2 and total hco3 showed that some sites have higher values of ca2 mg2 than hco3 which requires additional anions such as so4 2 for ionic balance it can be suggested that sulphuric acid might play a part in carbonate weathering in the teesta river krisnaswami and sunil singh 2005 demonstrated that sulphide oxidation is the leading supplier of so4 2 in the himalayan river basins in india so sulphide oxidation appears to be the main source of so4 2 throughout the teesta river catchment in sikkim the absence of evaporites gypsum or anhydrite in the himalayan river catchments was noted in galy et al 1999 dalai et al 2002a hodson et al 2002 and wolff boenish et al 2009 these observations are similar to findings given by galy et al 1999 that sulphide oxidation acts as the most likely source of so4 2 in the northern himalayan basins the significant positive correlation r2 0 67 between ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 linked with a slope close to the equiline indicates the significant action of h2so4 on carbonate weathering li and ji 2016 meyer et al 2017 fig 9c excess hco3 so4 2 over ca2 mg2 indicates non carbonate sources i e interaction of h2so4 and h2co3 on silicates and this excess should be balanced by na and k that were found in higher amounts than cl 3 5 2 silicates weathering silicate rocks represent the main bedrock in the teesta river catchment area kinetically the weathering of carbonate rocks is more rapid than silicate rocks in aquatic systems sarin and krishnaswami 1984 in this study silicate weathering probably contributes to na and k in the river water according to krisnaswami and sunil singh 2005 the dissolution of na from silicates nasil can be calculated as follows nasil nar clr where nar and clr are the concentrations of na and cl in the river water it was found that the average ratio of na cl in all waters is 6 8 this indicates that the major source of na in the teesta river is from silicate weathering the scatter plots of upstream and downstream water shown in fig 10 a and b are above the equiline and closer to the na k domain indicating the derivations of these ions from silicate ions the positive correlation of na and cl at all sites indicates that the contribution could likely be from rainwater hot springs and salt dissolution the annual rainfall differs across the state depending upon the zones from 400 mm in temperate to subalpine zones to 1250 mm or less in the lower elevation of south sikkim and 500 mm in the dry plateaus of north sikkim seidler 2018 http en climate data org region 779 the south sikkim district receives the maximum average annual rainfall mostly arriving during the monsoon season of june september according to galy et al 1999 the chemical composition of rain water in himalaya is 7 4 μm and rainwater contribution to the riverine dissolved load from the average rainwater concentration multiplied by 1 33 25 evapotranspiration in the himalaya is estimated the rain and snow contribution of the cl could differ greatly from different streams and estimates of the contribution of the riverine chemical budget have not been extensively discussed it is however safe to conclude that the increase in cl concentration from upstream to downstream is likely partly the result of rainwater likewise a study conducted on the chemical composition of spring water in south sikkim by vishwakarma et al 2019 estimated that cl is the second highest anion in spring water with an order of anionic dominance of hco3 cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 f so cl increases downstream could also be a result of hot springs and the dissolution of trace amounts of nacl salt from soils in the teesta river watershed 3 6 effect of gradient vegetation cover and temperature on the rate of water rock interaction 3 6 1 potential effect of gradient and vegetation cover the elevation difference between sampling sites 1 8 upstream was 2011 m over a distance of about 34 km while the elevation difference between sampling site 9 19 downstream was 1059 m over about 70 km see fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the gradient of flow of the teesta river changes from a steep slope upstream to a gentle slope downstream kinetically the rate of weathering of carbonate rocks is higher than silicate rocks the upper region of north sikkim is mostly covered by snow and glaciers while vegetation cover is mostly seen in the lowlands ghosh et al 2018 meetei et al 2007 vegetation cover enhances the rate of silicate weathering as it enables water retention and percolation into the soil thus increasing the contact time allowed for reaction between the silicate minerals and pore water gabet et al 2006 tipper et al 2006 it can thus be concluded that the rate of silicate weathering is dependent on an overall balance of key factors including gradient contact time temperature and vegetation 3 6 2 effect of temperature due to the altitude differences the local climate of sikkim can play an important role in the weathering process in the teesta river catchment area in sikkim based on elevation differences between highlands and lowlands the climate changes from subtropical at low altitudes downstream to cold temperate or cold at high altitudes wolff boenish et al 2009 concluded that the effect of the global climate on the himalayan basins was causing the transportation of silicate particles from upper regions which weathered in the lower regions mineral dissolution is kinetically dependent on temperature wolff boenish et al 2009 as stated by dalai et al 2002b there is a strong relationship between the rate of silicate weathering and temperature in the tributaries of the yamuna river in the lesser himalaya sequence lhs this proves that conditions for silicate weathering were more favourable in the lowlands warmer than highlands in sikkim 3 7 comparison of major ions with the brahmaputra yarlung tsangpo and the global average mg l a comparison of the mean value of the major ion compositions in the teesta river with other rivers and the global average are shown in table 3 the mean concentration of mg2 and cl in the teesta river is lower than the global average value whereas the concentrations of ca2 and na are comparable to the global average it is observed that the major ionic composition of the teesta river in sikkim himalaya is less than the yarlung tsangpo on the tibetan plateau but comparable to the brahmaputra in india singh et al 2005 the substantial difference in the chemical ion constituents in the yarlung tsangpo on the tibet plateau and sikkim in indian himalaya could be attributable to various factors such as soil type elevation rate of precipitation mining and industrial activities the high rate of precipitation in sikkim himalaya has caused a dilution effect on the ions concentration in the teesta river so a lower level of overall ionic composition is observed than in yarlung tsangpo huang et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 the south asian summer monsoon has an effect on eastern himalaya gibling et al 2005 the tds of the teesta river significantly increases with a decrease in elevation as the vegetation coverage increases the ionic concentration values of the teesta river were within the range of the global average as shown in table 3 however the concentration of cl is almost four times lower than the global average sikkim himalaya is situated near the southern part of the tibetan plateau it is less affected by anthropogenic activities and would receive a less cyclic salt contribution which could be a reason for the low levels of cl taking that into account it is considered that the contribution of cl by the cyclic salt decreases as the distance from the sea increases stallard and edmond 1981 3 8 comparison of major ions and trace elements for the elemental composition in the teesta river 14 elements were measured that are considered elements of health concern by the bureau of indian standards and who bis 2012 who 2011 the metals b ba cr mn mo ni zn and li were quantified with varying concentrations at different sampling sites cd pb cu al as and u were all below detection limits the average concentrations of the measured elements and the standard guideline values of who and bis are shown in table 4 it was found that all the measured trace elements lie within the standard guidelines of who and bis except for boron likewise the concentration of all the elements is just trace amounts which indicates that the teesta river does not have significant anthropogenic influence studies suggested that boron is an essential trace element for marine life and is abundantly available in oceans carrano et al 2009 mottram et al 2014 the main central thrust zone of sikkim himalaya is also characterised by large concentrations of tourmaline that could be attributable to the relatively high concentration of boron in the river moreover all the parameters including in situ measurements major ions and trace elements of the river were found to be within the standard guideline values apart from turbidity 4 conclusion this study provides valuable information on the water chemistry and mechanisms of weathering in the teesta river of sikkim himalaya it also contributes to the study of weathering of himalayan regions that has always received varied explanations due to large variations in lithology and geotectonic domain it also provides original data on the major ions and the trace elements of the teesta river the river chemistry is mainly dominated by natural phenomena with upstream mainly influenced by carbonate weathering and downstream mainly governed by silicate weathering ca2 mg2 and hco3 were mainly provided from carbonate weathering while na and k originated from silicate weathering throughout the entire watershed h2co3 and h2so4 make significant contributions to the weathering process the increase of na ca2 linked with an increase in si from upstream to downstream validates the contribution of silicate rocks in the weathering process of the teesta river in the sikkim lowlands gradient vegetation cover and temperature have played supporting roles in silicate weathering downstream likewise the contribution of hot spring and rainwater to the riverine chemical composition of downstream sites was observed the cluster analysis ca based on k concentration could successfully differentiate between upstream and downstream waters the concentration of major ions and elements are in the range of the concentration of the global average in rivers the overall state of the teesta river is pristine with minimal contribution from human activities and the river is suitable for irrigation purposes the main limitation of this assessment is based on one sampling campaign but it contributes to narrowing the gap in research into the teesta river of the indian himalayas that has rarely been discussed the dynamic landscape and vegetation coverage of sikkim has an enormous impact on river chemistry this study can support future studies on the geochemistry of sikkim which could also contribute to water resource management and the preservation of natural resources appendix a supplementary data supplementary

objective of this study was to apportion sub basin spatial source relative contributions to target channel bed sediment samples using a composite fingerprinting procedure including a bayesian un mixing model in total thirty four geochemical tracers eleven elemental ratios and different weathering indices were measured or estimated for 43 tributary sediment samples collected to characterise three sub basin spatial sediment sources and eleven target bed sediment samples collected at the outlet of the main basin statistical analysis was used to select three different composite signatures new hydrological insights for the region using a composite signature based on kw h and dfa the respective relative contributions with uncertainty ranges from tributary sub basins 1 2 and 3 were estimated as 54 3 47 8 62 0 11 4 4 2 18 7 and 34 3 27 6 39 9 compared to 72 0 61 6 82 7 13 6 9 0 18 5 and 14 2 3 1 25 4 using a combination of kw h and data mining and 50 8 42 8 59 9 28 7 20 2 37 3

malhotra et al 2018 although fine grained sediment is a naturally occurring material in river systems providing a fundamental input for the development of river landscapes and their aquatic ecosystems frostick et al 1984 lisle 1989 excessive fine grained sediment delivery to and accumulation within river systems is one of the most pervasive causes of watercourse degradation worldwide gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 in fact since the 1980 s there has been growing concern in many countries over the off site issues associated with accelerated soil erosion evans et al 2017 including muddy floods and the related damage to properties boardman et al 1996 increased operational and maintenance costs for potable water purification cashman et al 2018 owens et al 2016 deformation of channel

redistribution of nutrients and pollutants blake et al 2018 carter et al 2003 collins and walling 2007 westrich and förstner 2007 and the harmful effects on aquatic biology jones et al 2014 2012 kemp et al 2011 wilkes et al 2019 alongside these off site impacts a wide range of on site problems also result from accelerated soil erosion and sediment mobilization including amongst others reductions in soil fertility and water holding capacity and reduced crop productivity nosrati 2017 tiecher et al 2018 against the above context accelerated soil erosion is rated as a serious threat to sustainable land and water resource management in many parts of the world and in turn this has driven a growing awareness of the need to understand the contributions of different sediment sources and erosion processes to sediment related problems on and off site froger et al 2018 laceby et al 2017 improved understanding of sediment sources can be utilized as an important basis for the conceptualization and confirmation of the drivers e g modern intensive farming of accelerated soil erosion and sediment transport gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 walling et al 1993 wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 and to help target management laceby et al 2017 walling 2005 to this end uptake and refinement of sediment source tracing or fingerprinting techniques has expanded dramatically as an alternative approach to traditional methods of identifying key sediment sources blake et al 2018 carter et al 2003 collins et al 1998 2017b collins and walling 2007 walling et al 1993 1999 and erosion processes in many environmental settings collins et al 2010 2017a froger et al 2018 haddadchi et al 2013 koiter et al 2013 sediment source fingerprinting involves discriminating potential sediment sources on the basis of differences in source material properties or tracers and determining the relative contributions of these sources to sampled target sediment a wide range of tracer properties has been tested for the identification of sediment sources bainbridge et al 2016 chen et al 2017 collins and walling 2002 collins et al 2017b estrany et al 2010 grimshaw and lewin 1980 haddadchi et al 2013 hatfield and maher 2009 mckinley et al 2013 nosrati et al 2018b palazón and navas 2017 walling et al 1999 geochemical tracers are however the most widely used in published studies to date d haen et al 2012 froger et al 2018 haddadchi et al 2014 2013 hughes et al 2009 koiter et al 2013 nosrati et al 2018b olley and caitcheon 2000 because of their frequent ability to discriminate strongly among different sources and to apportion sources of fine grained sediment with reasonable levels of uncertainty malhotra et al 2018 the use of one single tracer to apportion sources is inappropriate given the inherent risk of spurious source sediment matches carter et al 2003 collins et al 1998 malhotra et al 2018 mukundan et al 2012 walling et al 1999 zhou et al 2016 in response so called composite fingerprinting approaches have been developed based on combining several tracer properties into fingerprints the use of such composite signatures provides a more reliable and consistent means for determining sediment sources walling et al 1999 reduces the likelihood of false source sediment links and often provides the scope for discriminating more sources collins et al 1998 2017b in this study a composite fingerprinting approach using statistical validation of different composite signatures and a multivariate bayesian un mixing model was applied for determining the relative contribution of each of three sub basins of the kamish river in iran to downstream target bed sediment samples collected on the main stem land managers and policy makers frequently seek information on the contributions of sediment from individual source types classified for example on the basis of generic land use categories such as arable or grass but also including additional sources such as channel banks since this type of source classification scheme provides a clear means of selecting relevant mitigation measures capable of reducing sediment mobilization associated with tillage methods livestock management or fluvial scour of channel margins in larger catchments however where land use patterns can be complicated and the contributions from individual source types more spatially variable provision of such information exclusive of some form of underpinning spatial information on the general sources of sediment problems is not necessarily supportive of decision making which is commonly based on limited resources for on the ground follow up and intervention planning here previous work applying sediment fingerprinting procedures has adopted an alternative approach to the classification of potential sources based on tributary sub catchments e g caitcheon 1993 collins et al 1997 hardy et al 2010 nosrati et al 2018a stone et al 2014 vale et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2013 in essence this confluence based approach permits investigation of the sediment contributions from different spatial zones within a large catchment and thereby a tier 1 screening of sediment sources for guiding the targeting of any future investigations into individual source types the work reported herein thereby summarizes the first pass screening of sediment sources in the study catchment and was designed to provide data on the contributions from spatial zones represented by tributary sub catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kamish river catchment 308 km2 is located near the town of kermanshah province in western iran between 47 24 e to 47 42 e longitude and 34 9 n to 34 20 n latitude fig 1 the study area is one of the branches of the gamasyab river which in turn is located in the drainage basin of the seymareh river the topography of the kamish river catchment is mountainous with elevations ranging from 1300 to 2600 m with a mean of 1900 m above sea level the average slope gradient is 11 and the main river slope is 1 8 land cover comprises rangelands 133 km2 43 cultivated land including dry land farming cropped fields and horticulture 163 km2 52 9 rock outcrops 6 km2 1 9 and residential areas 6 km2 1 9 long term 30 years mean annual precipitation recorded at the kamish station next to the study area is ca 370 mm in the upper parts of the region precipitation is mostly snow mean annual discharge based on the 30 years 1985 2015 of record from the hydraulic station at the outlet of the drainage basin is estimated at 1 21 m3 s 1 with most discharge occurring in march and april monthly means of 11 m3 s 1 and 5 81 m3 s 1 respectively on the basis of 10 field surveys and associated observations over a 12 month period it was established that the three sub basins fig 1 comprising sub basin 1 168 3 km2 sub basin 2 63 7 km2 and sub basin 3 43 km2 in the study area dominate tributary sediment inputs to the main river land use in the three sub basins is summarized in table s1 in supplementary information from a stratigraphical point of view fig 1 ancient geological formations belonging to the precambrian period and more recent formations belonging to the quaternary period are observed in the study area see table s2 in supplementary information based on field observations erosion is very evident across the study area after any rainfall event a large volume of soil undergoes erosion and subsequent transport and is deposited on the main stem channel bed at the basin outlet the average daily suspended sediment export has been estimated at 3814 tons iran water resources management company runoff and erosion has important off site impacts in this drainage basin with for example muddy floods affecting crop fields and gardens fig 2 as a result considerable areas of the gardens and agricultural land surrounding the river have been affected by sediment mobilization and delivery leading to social and economic problems in the locality measures for controlling runoff such as terracing strip cropping and improved vegetation cover are still lacking the kamish river catchment has at its center harsin city and it is also home to a large number of villages mostly located alongside the banks of the kamish river most villagers in this area are heavily dependent on agriculture gardening and animal husbandry as their main sources of income hence soil protection in this area is critical for the sustainability of the villages and the wellbeing of villagers at the present time the kamish dam 4 5 km to the south of harsin city and about 1 5 km to the north of baba zeyd village with a storage capacity of 16 6 million m3 and an average annual input flow of 20 5 million m3 is being constructed current high levels of erosion and sediment production in the region have the potential to impact on the water storage capacity behind the dam accordingly appraisal of the spatial origins of sediment are very important for controlling and managing this risk to new critical infrastructure for supporting livelihoods and well being 2 2 field sampling although most sediment fingerprinting studies have relied on sets of suspended sediment samples from various flood events or different times across flood hydrographs haddadchi et al 2014 hughes et al 2009 fine grained sediment deposited on the river bed has also been successfully used as an alternative type of target sediment in various environmental situations dirszowsky 2004 evrard et al 2011 2013 haddadchi et al 2014 2013 hughes et al 2009 lamba et al 2015 nosrati et al 2018a olley and caitcheon 2000 smith and blake 2014 this type of target fine grained sediment which has been referred to in some previous studies as drape sediment nosrati et al 2018a can be assumed to provide a surrogate for suspended sediment associated geochemistry horowitz et al 2012 and to be more temporally representative than snapshot instantaneous suspended sediment samples zhou et al 2016 whilst negating the need for water sample collection during actual storm periods miller et al 2015 on this basis samples of sediment deposited on the river bed were collected at the outlet of the main drainage basin and from the outlets of the three sub basins fig 1 here the samples collected from the main basin are used as the target sediment for apportioning the relative contributions from the upstream sub basins nosrati et al 2018a each bed sediment sample was a combination of 5 sub samples each of which was taken at an interval of 200 m along the selected reach all samples were collected using a non metallic shovel to prevent sample contamination franz et al 2013 and using a portable stilling well to avoid the winnowing of fines during sample extraction through the water overlying the channel bed the inclusion of sub samples was aimed at taking some account of the local scale spatial variation in bed sediment tracer properties in total 10 composite samples were retrieved from the main basin outlet and a further 43 composite samples from the three sub basin outlet sampling locations the mass of each composite bed sediment sample was 1 kg due to possible problems associated with the erosion and collapse of channel banks proximal to the bed sediment sampling points and the risk of bias in the bed sediment associated geochemistry zhou et al 2016 the downstream reaches on either the sub basins or on the main stem were pinpointed to channel sections where local bank erosion was not evident 2 3 laboratory measurements of tracers and estimation of weathering indices all sediment samples retrieved from the river bed were slowly air dried and then manually disaggregated using a mortar and pestle the samples were dry sieved using a 63 μm sieve prior to laboratory analysis in order to compare a similar particle size fraction of all samples palazón and navas 2017 pulley et al 2015 tiecher et al 2018 selection of this size fraction is commonly applied to help reduce the potential bias related to the effects of grain size collins et al 1997 d haen et al 2012 dirszowsky 2004 fu et al 2008 manjoro et al 2017 nosrati et al 2011 2014 peart and walling 1986 tiecher et al 2018 walling et al 1999 which could directly distort comparison of the sub basin source and target sediment samples nosrati et al 2018a sieving and weighing of the resulting fractions of the sediment samples collected from both the tributaries and the downstream main outlet confirmed it was appropriate to use the 63 μm fraction in order to measure the concentration of geochemical tracers including ag ar as ba be ca cd ce co cr cu fe k la li mg mn mo na ni p pb s sb sc sr th ti u v y ya zn and zr using an agilent varian 735 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes 0 25 g of each sediment sample 63 μm was digested with hydrofluoric acid hf and aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 at 220 c for 4 h in a hot box the concentrations were expressed in milligrams per kilogram the results showed that the analytical error for each element was 5 in addition to the 34 elements several elemental ratios al ti cu pb fe mn fe p k na pb ni al k na ca mg the chemical index of alteration cia the weathering index of parker wip the chemical index of weathering ciw the plagioclase index of alteration pia and a recycling ratio the ratio between the cia and the wip was also computed for potential use in the composite signatures table 1 presents a summary of the laboratory results elemental ratios and weathering indices the weathering indices were computed based on the molecular proportion of associated elements here the concentration of elements in ppm was converted to elemental oxides based on each element compound ratio guo et al 2018 motha et al 2003 olley and caitcheon 2000 the chemical index of alteration cia originally proposed by nesbitt and young 1982 and applied by numerous studies e g guo et al 2018 shao et al 2012 is potentially useful as a tracer since it provides a basis for identifying chemical changes caused by weathering of alumino silicate minerals haddadchi et al 2013 motha et al 2003 owens et al 2016 it is defined as a l 2 o 3 a l 2 o 3 c a o n a 2 o k 2 o 100 guo et al 2018 olley and caitcheon 2000 shao et al 2012 a cia value of approximately 45 55 shows a lack of weathering whereas a value of 100 indicates intense weathering with the complete removal of alkali and alkaline earth elements from the parent material motha et al 2003 shao et al 2012 in general higher cia values suggest more weathering of silicates however it is difficult to make a simple linear relationship between weathering and cia values shao et al 2012 the wip was proposed by parker 1970 to evaluate the weathering intensity of silicate rocks based on the ratios of alkali and alkaline earth elements price and velbel 2003 and it can be defined as 2 n a 2 o 0 35 m g o 0 9 2 k 2 o 0 25 c a o 0 7 100 guo et al 2018 shao et al 2012 according to the definition of wip and contrary to cia values smaller wip values are indicative of stronger chemical weathering guo et al 2017 this index is most suitable for weathering profiles on heterogeneous parent rocks but potentially less suitable for highly weathering coatings because its formulation is based on only highly mobile alkali and alkaline elements hamdan and bumham 1996 price and velbel 2003 in the case of the mobility of aluminum during chemical washing some studies have shown that wip may be more suitable for characterizing weathering intensity than cia although both indicators are well correlated however to date wip has been rarely used to measure the weathering intensity in different stream sediment samples from around the world whereas cia has been widely documented for drainage basins shao et al 2012 cia wip plots can be used to discriminate the modification of sediment compositions due to weathering induced by recycling over longer timescales thus with an increase in sediment recycling the value of wip is linearly reduced but cia is largely independent of this guo et al 2017 the effects of chemical recycling on river sediment chemistry should be carefully considered in order to provide stronger constraints on the interpretation of sediment associated geochemical profiles guo et al 2018 the chemical index of weathering ciw developed by harnois 1988 is defined as a l 2 o 3 a l 2 o 3 c a o n a 2 o 100 this index is equivalent to the cia except that the potassium was eliminated from the cia equation like the cia the ciw is also essentially a measure of the extent of conversion of feldspars to clays because the ciw does not account for the aluminum associated with k feldspar it may yield very high values for k feldspar rich rocks whether they are chemically weathered or not fedo et al 1995 proposed the plagioclase index of alteration pia as an alternative to the ciw because plagioclase is abundant in silicate rocks and dissolves relatively rapidly the pia may be used when plagioclase weathering needs to be taken into consideration price and velbel 2003 2 4 tracer conservation tests sediment tracers should exhibit conservative behavior during sediment detachment and transport through a catchment haddadchi et al 2015 lamba et al 2015 accordingly the first step in addressing this requirement is removal of non conservative tracers from further analysis non conservative tracers were identified and eliminated using three methods haddadchi et al 2015 nosrati et al 2018b initially the standard bracket or range test was performed to ensure that the tracer concentrations of the individual main stem target sediment samples which were collected from the outlet of the main basin were within the concentration range of the sub basin source groups mukundan et al 2010 navratil et al 2012 nosrati et al 2018b tiecher et al 2018 at the next stage the mean concentration of each tracer in each main stem target sediment sample was compared with the corresponding mean concentration range in the sub basin samples haddadchi et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2013 again the tracers that were not in the mean concentration range of the sub basin spatial source bed sediment samples were removed from further analysis these range tests do not confirm the complete absence of changes to tracer properties but instead provide an initial screening for the removal of tracers that show significant alteration between upstream sampled sources and downstream sites for the collection of target sediment samples lastly biplots of tracer pairings selected in the final composite signatures were used to assess the degree to which the relationships between tracers judged to be generally conservative by the first two tests were consistent between upstream and downstream bed sediment sampling sites 2 5 discrimination of the tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources applying statistical tests is one widely used means of identifying sets of tracers that can discriminate robustly between potential sediment sources haddadchi et al 2014 nosrati et al 2011 three statistical methods were used to provide composite fingerprints for discriminating the three sub basin spatial sources 1 a combination of kw h and discriminant function analysis dfa 2 a combination of kw h and data mining analysis and 3 a combination of kw h and principal components classification analysis pcca kw h or one way anova is a nonparametric test that compares more than two groups and tests the null hypothesis that different groups in comparison comprise a similar distribution or distributions with equal means collins and walling 2002 2007 smith and blake 2014 therefore the kwh test helps eliminate any tracer that does not show significant differences in the concentrations between at least two sediment sources pulley et al 2015 discriminant function analysis dfa was performed based on minimizing the wilks lambda of those tracer properties that passed the kw h test dfa has been widely used to determine the final composite fingerprints that have the highest discrimination between sediment sources but with a minimum number of variables collins et al 1998 evrard et al 2011 lamba et al 2015 smith and blake 2014 wilks lambda is a multivariate statistical test that measures the significance of the discriminatory power of the model wilks lambda values are between 0 1 values close to 0 indicate high discriminatory power while values close to 1 indicate poor discrimination hughes et al 2009 to determine whether discriminant functions are statistically significant various tests including eigenvalue canonical correlation and mahalanobis distance were used nosrati 2017 nosrati et al 2018b tracers exhibiting statistically significant differences between the potential sub basin spatial sediment sources using kwh were also entered into classification tree analysis classification tree analysis is one of the main techniques used in data mining lemon et al 2003 classification trees are used to predict membership of cases in the classes of a categorical dependent variable from their measurements on one or more predictor variables i e tracers and as such this method has much in common with dfa classification tree analysis determines a set of logical if then conditions instead of the linear equations estimated in dfa for classifying cases classification trees readily lend themselves to being displayed graphically helping to make them easier to interpret there are two key tools to interpret the results of classification tree analysis the final trees and the predictor importance the final graphical sequence of boosted trees can be a useful way to examine the significance of the final classification model the predictor importance is computed as the relative scaled average value of the predictor statistic over all trees the bar plot of the predictor importance provides insight on the variables that make the major contributions to the prediction of group membership the fourth and final set of tracer properties was identified by applying a pcca test to those tracers that passed the kwh test a comprehensive review of the principal component method is presented by nosrati et al 2018a all statistical analyses were performed using statistica v 8 0 statsoft 2008 2 6 source apportionment using a sediment un mixing model the modified mixsir bayesian un mixing model nosrati et al 2014 2018b quantifies the relative contributions of sediment from different sources by calculating probability distributions for the proportional contribution fi of each source i to the downstream target sediment samples in three stages 1 prior probability distributions for model parameters 2 construction of a likelihood function for the statistical model and 3 derivation of the posterior probability distributions for the parameters using the bayes rule to adjust the prior distributions based on the observed data the bayes rule states that the posterior probability distribution for all fi is proportional to the prior probability distributions multiplied by the likelihood and then dividing by their sum viz 1 p f q d a t a l d a t a f q p f q l d a t a f q p f q where l data fq is the likelihood of the data given fq p fq representing the prior probability being true based on prior information and fq is the proportional source contributions of q proposed vectors the relative contributions of sediment are factored into the model by defining mean and variance parameters for each sediment source i and the final sets of tracers composite fingerprints j the proposed tracer distributions for the target sediment mixtures collected from the study catchment outlet are determined by solving for the proposed means μ ˆ j and standard deviations σ ˆ j of the sediment mixtures based on the randomly drawn fi values comprising a vector fq 2 μ ˆ j i 1 n f i m j s o u r c e i 3 σ ˆ j i 1 n f i 2 s j s o u r c e i 2 where m j s o u r c e i in eq 3 is the mean and s j s o u r c e i 2 in eq 4 is the variance of the jth sediment tracer and the ith sediment source based on the μ ˆ j and σ ˆ j of each property comprising each final composite fingerprint the likelihood of the data given the proposed sediment mixture is calculated as 4 l x μ ˆ j σ ˆ j k 1 n j 1 n 1 σ ˆ j 2 π exp x k j μ ˆ j 2 2 σ ˆ j 2 where x k j represents the j th tracer property of the k th sediment sample the model predictions of source proportions were evaluated using 10 sets of virtual sediment mixtures for each composite signature using a range of source proportions 1 equal proportions from each sub basin 33 3 33 3 33 3 2 100 sub basin 1 0 sub basins 2 3 3 0 sub

were constructed using the measured tracer data for the tributary sub basin spatial source samples the tracer concentrations in the virtual mixtures satisfied the bracket test for tracer conservation the accuracy of the modelling in solving the virtual sediment mixtures was assessed using the averaged root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the predicted and known source proportions using each final composite signature 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmation of conservative tracers and different composite fingerprints for discriminating the spatial sediment sources

that all remaining tracers except y and fe p were conservative table 1 on the basis of these two tests the 29 remaining tracers were retained and tested using the kw h test table 1 also shows the results of applying the kw h test which indicated that all tracers exhibited a statistically significant difference between the tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources using the bed sediment

into the stepwise dfa table 2 the largest eigenvalue of the first function 61 1 corresponds to the eigenvector in the direction of the maximum spread of the groups means the wilk s lambda value of the first function 0 001 indicated that 83 of the total variance among the sub basin spatial source bed sediment samples was explained by these tracers the canonical correlation value was 0 99 and indicated a strong correlation between the discriminant scores and the individual source groups table 3 the squared mahalanobis distance showed that the spatial sediment sources were well separated by the shortlisted tracers table 3 the backward stepwise dfa yielded classification matrices assigning 100 of the cases i e spatial source bed sediment samples to the correct groups table 3 stepwise

the results of different tests within dfa indicated that the discriminatory power of all of these tracers was perfect table 2 partial wilks lambda is the wilks lambda for the unique contribution of

the first and second discriminant functions calculated using backward dfa confirmed that the sediment samples collected from the outlets of the different sub basin spatial sediment sources were well separated during the data mining stage of the tracer analysis the properties passing kw h were entered into general classification and regression tree models gc rt fig 4 a displays the final tree selected on the basis of the sub basin properties tracers considering v fold cross validation cv cost 03 analysis the final tree classified the sub basin spatial sediment sources into three terminal nodes i e the sampled sub basins using the sediment samples collected to characterise these potential sources the histograms of cases in each class at the nodes showed that 100 of the cases were classified correctly fig 4a the bar plot of predictor importance based on tributary sub basin spatial source as the dependent variable and the tracer properties as the predictors is presented in fig 4b for each tracer predictor importance shows the relative average value of the sums of squares prediction over all trees and nodes where the maximum value sums to 1 hence these values reflect the strength of the relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable of interest over the successive boosting steps in this case the tracers ba co cr mg ni and pb ni importance value 1 0 stand out as the most important predictors within this particular composite signature fig 4b these results provide evidence that general classification and regression tree models can be used as a tool for identifying important dimensions in a set of tracers included within a composite signature and to identify those sediment sources with similar or dissimilar characteristics tracers passing the kwh

selected six tracers be fe wip li p and cr as an alternative composite fingerprint on the basis of the pcca model table 4 the plot of factor coordinates of variables for the first two pcs associated

tracers selected in the final composite signatures the biplots of some tracer pairings for source and sediment samples were compared the results confirmed that there was no major tracer transformations during sediment mobilization and delivery in the study area fig 6 3 2 sediment source contributions fig 7 presents the un mixing model outputs using the composite fingerprint selected by kw h and dfa table 5 the relative contributions with corresponding uncertainty ranges from the sub basin spatial sources 1 2 and 3 were estimated as 54 3 47 8 62 0 11 4 4 2 18 7 and 34 3 27 6 39 9 respectively using the alternative composite signature selected by a combination of kw h and data mining table 5 the corresponding respective contributions and associated uncertainty ranges were estimated as 72 0 61 6 82 7 13 6 9 0 18 5 and 14 2 3 1 25 4 finally on the basis of the composite signature selected using a combination of kw h and pcca table 5 the relative contributions from the sub basin spatial sources 1 2 and 3 were estimated as 50 8 42 8 59 9 28 7 20 2 37 3 and 20 3 12 7 27 2 respectively the root mean square difference table 5 between the estimated sediment contributions from the sub basin spatial sources using the three different composite signatures ranged from 22 3 sub basin 3 to 47 4 sub basin 2 the predicted spatial source contributions were therefore highly sensitive to the composite fingerprint used in the bayesian un mixing model comparisons of the predicted and known relative contributions from the tributary sub basin spatial sources 1 2 and 3 using the three different composite signatures and the virtual sediment mixtures showed that the rmse ranged between 0 6 and 35 8 and mae between 0 2 and 11 9 table 6 the overall average rmse and mae for the modelled source predictions using the virtual mixtures were 10 6 and 9 6 respectively the rmse results showed that 15 of 30 possible predicted values were 10 whilst in the case of mae 29 of the 30 values were 10 these error levels were judged to be acceptable in the context of those reported elsewhere in the international literature e g haddadchi et al 2013 nosrati and collins 2019 palazón et al 2015 the weathering indices included in the initial potential tracer datasets reflect the intensity of chemical weathering processes and the degree of elemental mobility resulting from depletion of sediment samples in mobile as compared with immobile components nadlonek and bojakowska 2018 price and velbel 2003 only wip was selected in one of the final composite signatures for discriminating the three tributary sub basin spatial sources tables 5 and 6 although the results of the kw h in table 1 show that the indices were individually able to discriminate between the three sub basin spatial sources the wip values in table 1 suggest that the degree of chemical weathering reflected in the bed sediment samples collected to characterise sub basins 2 and 3 is marginally greater than that for the equivalent samples collected from sub basin 1 the estimates of wip shown in table 1 are considerably higher than those reported by some recent studies in the international literature e g nadlonek and bojakowska 2018 thereby suggesting comparatively lower chemical weathering intensity in the study area the low values for cia in table 1 are also suggestive of a lack of intensive weathering and chemical alteration in the study area and reflect the local arid climate nadlonek and bojakowska 2018 weathering index values reflect the complex interplay between climate lithology tectonism topography vegetation cover and human activities gibbs 1970 meybeck 1987 oliva et al 2003 shao et al 2012 on this basis they potentially offer a physically grounded basis for inclusion in tracer datasets for identifying statistically robust composite signatures for source discrimination here however scale is likely to be an important factor driving the magnitude of differences between weathering index values for soil or sediment samples collected to characterise different river basin sources the source apportionment results based on the three composite signatures consistently suggested that tributary sub basin 1 is the dominant source of the target sediment samples collected further downstream from the bed of the main stem this sub basin is the largest 168 3 km2 of the spatial zones apportioned in this study and comprises larger areas of both dry land farming 72 km2 and rangelands 64 km2 compared to the other two spatial sources locally dry land farming is characterized by cultivation using conventional tillage practices on steep slopes which renders bare tilled soils susceptible to rain splash detachment and subsequent mobilization in surface runoff recent expansion of such farming in sub basin 1 on the quaternary deposits has exacerbated erosion problems in this zone of the study area at present water scarcity problems and limited availability of new land for conversion to agriculture mean that land use change from rangeland to arable cropping under dry land farming is common especially in sub basin 1 conventional dry land farming practices are widespread including intensive tillage with ploughing and heavy harrowing plus the routine removal of crop residues by burning to reduce biomass volume and to facilitate mechanical operations which are the primary factor leading to increased soil erosion and sediment production on the steep slopes jin et al 2007 it should be noted however that flood water irrigation in riparian areas in the lower and middle portions of sub basin 1 which is assisted by siltation encouraging more overbank inundation is used to support crop production on low lying riparian plots the source apportionment results presented herein should however be interpreted as a tier 1 assessment of the sources of downstream sediment issues in this regard they provide a basis for targeting follow up work for confirming the relative losses from dry land and rangeland farming practices especially in sub basin 1 to help engage local farmers and select and target appropriate mitigation measures for soil tillage or grazing management here further work could also usefully assess the relative age of sampled sediment e g using the ratios of fallout radionuclides with shorter and longer half lives to elucidate the likely temporal duration of sediment storage and remobilization in the study catchment and to help link the sediment source tracing results to oral cropping histories developed with local farmers 4 conclusions a spatial sediment source fingerprinting exercise has been used to provide a tier 1 screening of sediment provenance in a mountainous agricultural catchment in western iran three composite signatures were selected using different statistical tests all of which suggested that sub basin 1 draining the upper portions of the study area dominates source contributions to the target sediment samples collected on the riverbed at the catchment outlet the consistency of the signatures in all identifying sub basin 1 as the dominant spatial sediment source lends weight to the results since it is established that different composite signatures have the potential to generate contrasting sediment source estimates using mixing models collins et al 2017b the inclusion of weathering indices in initial tracer sets from which composite signatures are selected warrants further evaluation regardless of their inclusion or otherwise in final composite signatures weathering indices potentially offer useful information for helping pre selection of tracers e g mineralogical elemental and for interpreting tracer conservation test results in the context of climate lithology and hydro geomorphological processes in river basins with regards tracer conservation longitudinal sediment sampling in large drainage basins would permit the weathering indices to be used to explore any potential evolution of tracer transformation risks across scales weathering indices offer potential for ensuring composite signatures have a physical rather than a purely statistical basis in the context of study area lithology and the requirement to discriminate individual spatial sources across landscapes follow up investigations are required to confirm the relative contributions of the dry land and rangeland farming and of channel banks in the study area to downstream sediment loads nonetheless the evidence generated by this study will be used to help engage land owners in the need for

objective of this study was to apportion sub basin spatial source relative contributions to target channel bed sediment samples using a composite fingerprinting procedure including a bayesian un mixing model in total thirty four geochemical tracers eleven elemental ratios and different weathering indices were measured or estimated for 43 tributary sediment samples collected to characterise three sub basin spatial sediment sources and eleven target bed sediment samples collected at the outlet of the main basin statistical analysis was used to select three different composite signatures new hydrological insights for the region using a composite signature based on kw h and dfa the respective relative contributions with uncertainty ranges from tributary sub basins 1 2 and 3 were estimated as 54 3 47 8 62 0 11 4 4 2 18 7 and 34 3 27 6 39 9 compared to 72 0 61 6 82 7 13 6 9 0 18 5 and 14 2 3 1 25 4 using a combination of kw h and data mining and 50 8 42 8 59 9 28 7 20 2 37 3

et al 2011 wilkes et al 2019 alongside these off site impacts a wide range of on site problems also result from accelerated soil erosion and sediment mobilization including amongst others reductions in soil fertility and water holding capacity and reduced crop productivity nosrati 2017 tiecher et al 2018 against the above context accelerated soil erosion is rated as a serious threat to sustainable land and water resource management in many parts of the world and in turn this has driven a growing awareness of the need to understand the contributions of different sediment sources and erosion processes to sediment related problems on and off site froger et al 2018 laceby et al 2017 improved understanding of sediment sources can be utilized as an important basis for the conceptualization and confirmation of the drivers e g modern intensive farming of accelerated soil erosion and sediment transport gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 walling et al 1993 wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 and to help target management laceby et al 2017 walling 2005 to this end uptake and refinement of sediment source tracing or fingerprinting techniques has expanded dramatically as an alternative approach to traditional methods of identifying key sediment sources blake et al 2018 carter et al 2003 collins et al 1998 2017b collins and walling 2007 walling et al 1993 1999 and erosion processes in many environmental settings collins et al 2010 2017a froger et al 2018 haddadchi et al 2013 koiter et al 2013 sediment source fingerprinting involves discriminating potential sediment sources on the basis of differences in source material properties or tracers and determining the relative contributions of these sources to sampled target sediment a wide range of tracer properties has been tested for the identification of sediment sources bainbridge et al 2016 chen et al 2017 collins and walling 2002 collins et al 2017b estrany et al 2010 grimshaw and lewin 1980 haddadchi et al 2013 hatfield and maher 2009 mckinley et al 2013 nosrati et al 2018b palazón and navas 2017 walling et al 1999 geochemical tracers are however the most widely used in published studies to date d haen

different sources and to apportion sources of fine grained sediment with reasonable levels of uncertainty malhotra et al 2018 the use of one single tracer to apportion sources is inappropriate given the inherent risk of spurious source sediment matches carter et al 2003 collins et al 1998 malhotra et al 2018 mukundan et al 2012 walling et al 1999 zhou et al 2016 in response so called composite fingerprinting approaches have been developed based on combining several tracer properties into fingerprints the use of such composite signatures provides a more reliable and consistent means for determining sediment sources walling et al 1999 reduces the likelihood of false source sediment links and often provides the scope for discriminating more sources collins et al 1998 2017b in this study a composite fingerprinting approach using statistical validation of different composite signatures and a multivariate bayesian un mixing model was applied for determining the relative contribution of each of three sub basins of the kamish river in iran to downstream target bed sediment samples collected on the main stem land managers and policy makers frequently seek information on the contributions of sediment from individual source types classified for example on the basis of generic land use categories such as arable or grass but also including additional sources such as channel banks since this type of source classification scheme provides a clear means of selecting relevant mitigation measures capable of reducing sediment mobilization associated with tillage methods livestock management or fluvial scour of channel margins in larger catchments however where land use patterns can be complicated and the contributions from individual source types more spatially variable provision of such information exclusive of some form of underpinning spatial information on the general sources of sediment problems is not necessarily supportive of decision making which is commonly based on limited resources for on the ground follow up and intervention planning here previous work applying sediment fingerprinting procedures has adopted an alternative approach to the classification of potential sources based on tributary sub catchments e g caitcheon 1993 collins et al 1997 hardy et al 2010 nosrati et al 2018a stone et al 2014 vale et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2013 in essence this confluence based approach permits investigation of the sediment contributions from different spatial zones within a large catchment and thereby a tier 1 screening of sediment sources for guiding the targeting of any future investigations into individual source types the work reported herein thereby summarizes the first pass screening of sediment sources in the study catchment and was designed to provide data on the contributions from spatial zones represented by tributary sub catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kamish river catchment 308 km2 is located near the town of kermanshah province in western iran between 47 24 e to 47 42 e longitude and 34 9 n to 34 20 n latitude fig 1 the study area is one of the branches of the gamasyab river which in turn is located in the drainage basin of the seymareh river the topography of the kamish river catchment is mountainous with elevations ranging from 1300 to 2600 m with a mean of 1900 m above sea level the average slope gradient is 11 and the main river slope is 1 8 land cover comprises rangelands 133 km2 43 cultivated land including dry land farming cropped fields and horticulture 163 km2 52 9 rock outcrops 6 km2 1 9 and residential areas 6 km2 1 9 long term 30 years mean annual precipitation recorded at the kamish station next to the study area is ca 370 mm in the upper parts of the region precipitation is mostly snow mean annual discharge based on the 30 years 1985 2015 of record from the hydraulic station at the outlet of the drainage basin is estimated at 1 21 m3 s 1 with most discharge occurring in march and april monthly means of 11 m3 s 1 and 5 81 m3 s 1 respectively on the basis of 10 field surveys and associated observations over a 12 month period it was established that the three sub basins fig 1 comprising sub basin 1 168 3 km2 sub basin 2 63 7 km2 and sub basin 3 43 km2 in the study area dominate tributary sediment inputs to the main river land use in the three sub basins is summarized in table s1 in supplementary information from a stratigraphical point of view fig 1 ancient geological formations belonging to the precambrian period and more recent formations belonging to the quaternary period are observed in the study area see table s2 in supplementary information based on field observations erosion is very evident across the study area after any rainfall event a large volume of soil undergoes erosion and subsequent transport and is deposited on the main stem channel bed at the basin outlet the average daily suspended sediment export has been estimated at 3814 tons iran water resources management company runoff and erosion has important off site impacts in this drainage basin with for example muddy floods affecting crop fields and gardens fig 2 as a result considerable areas of the gardens and agricultural land surrounding the river have been affected by sediment mobilization and delivery leading to social and economic problems in the locality measures for controlling runoff such as terracing strip cropping and improved vegetation cover are still lacking the kamish river catchment has at its center harsin city and it is also home to a large number of villages mostly located alongside the banks of the kamish river most villagers in this area are heavily dependent on agriculture gardening and animal husbandry as their main sources of income hence soil protection in this area is critical for the sustainability of the villages and the wellbeing of villagers at the present time the kamish dam 4 5 km to the south of harsin city and about 1 5 km to the north of baba zeyd village with a storage capacity of 16 6 million m3 and an average annual input flow of 20 5 million m3 is being constructed current high levels of erosion and sediment production in the region have the potential to impact on the water storage capacity behind the dam accordingly appraisal of the spatial origins of sediment are very important for controlling and managing this risk to new critical infrastructure for supporting livelihoods and well being 2 2 field sampling although most sediment fingerprinting studies have relied on sets of suspended sediment samples from various flood events or different times across flood hydrographs haddadchi et al 2014 hughes et al 2009 fine grained sediment deposited on the river bed has also been successfully used as an alternative type of target sediment in various environmental situations dirszowsky 2004 evrard et al 2011 2013 haddadchi et al 2014 2013 hughes et al 2009 lamba et al 2015 nosrati et al 2018a olley and caitcheon 2000 smith and blake 2014 this type of target fine grained sediment which has been referred to in some previous studies as drape sediment nosrati et al 2018a can be assumed to provide a surrogate for suspended sediment associated geochemistry horowitz et al 2012 and to be more temporally representative than snapshot instantaneous suspended sediment samples zhou et al 2016 whilst negating the need for water sample collection during actual storm periods miller et al 2015 on this basis samples of sediment deposited on the river bed were collected at the outlet of the main drainage basin and from the outlets of the three sub basins fig 1 here the samples collected from the main basin are used as the target sediment for apportioning the relative contributions from the upstream sub basins nosrati et al 2018a each bed sediment sample was a combination of 5 sub samples each of which was taken at an interval of 200 m along the selected reach all samples were collected using a non metallic shovel to prevent sample contamination franz et al 2013 and using a portable stilling well to avoid the winnowing of fines during sample extraction through the water overlying the channel bed the inclusion of sub samples was aimed at taking some account of the local scale spatial variation in bed sediment tracer properties in total 10 composite samples were retrieved from the main basin outlet and a further 43 composite samples from the three sub basin outlet sampling locations the mass of each composite bed sediment sample was 1 kg due to possible problems associated with the erosion and collapse of channel banks proximal to the bed sediment sampling points and the risk of bias in the bed sediment associated geochemistry zhou et al 2016 the downstream reaches on either the sub basins or on the main stem were pinpointed to channel sections where local bank erosion was not evident 2 3 laboratory measurements of tracers and estimation of weathering indices all sediment samples retrieved from the river bed were slowly air dried and then manually disaggregated using a mortar and pestle the samples were dry sieved using a 63 μm sieve prior to laboratory analysis in order to compare a similar particle size fraction of all samples palazón and navas 2017 pulley et al 2015 tiecher et al 2018 selection of this size fraction is commonly applied to help reduce the potential bias related to the effects of grain size collins et al 1997 d haen et al 2012 dirszowsky 2004 fu et al 2008 manjoro et al 2017 nosrati et al 2011 2014 peart and walling 1986 tiecher et al 2018 walling et al 1999 which could directly distort comparison of the sub basin source and target sediment samples nosrati et al 2018a sieving and weighing of the resulting fractions of the sediment samples collected from both the tributaries and the downstream main outlet confirmed it was appropriate to use the 63 μm fraction in order to measure the concentration of geochemical tracers including ag ar as ba be ca cd ce co cr cu fe k la li mg mn mo na ni p pb s sb sc sr th ti u v y ya zn and zr using an agilent varian 735 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes 0 25 g of each sediment sample 63 μm was digested with hydrofluoric acid hf and aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 at 220 c for 4 h in a hot box the concentrations were expressed in

chemical index of alteration cia the weathering index of parker wip the chemical index of weathering ciw the plagioclase index of alteration pia and a recycling ratio the ratio between the cia and the wip was also computed for potential use in the composite signatures table 1 presents a summary of the laboratory results elemental ratios and weathering indices the weathering indices were computed based on the molecular proportion of associated elements here the concentration of elements in ppm was converted to elemental oxides based on each element compound ratio guo et al 2018 motha et al 2003 olley and caitcheon 2000 the chemical index of alteration cia originally proposed by nesbitt and young 1982 and applied by numerous studies e g guo et al 2018 shao et al 2012 is potentially useful as a tracer since it provides a basis for identifying chemical changes caused by weathering of alumino silicate minerals haddadchi et al 2013 motha et al 2003 owens et al 2016 it is defined as a l 2 o 3 a l 2 o 3 c a o n a 2 o k 2 o 100 guo et al 2018 olley and caitcheon 2000 shao et al 2012 a cia value of approximately 45 55 shows a lack of weathering whereas a value of 100 indicates intense weathering with the complete removal of alkali and alkaline earth elements from the parent material motha et al 2003 shao et al 2012 in general higher cia values suggest more weathering of silicates however it is difficult to make a simple linear relationship between weathering and cia values shao et al 2012 the wip was proposed by parker 1970 to evaluate the weathering intensity of silicate rocks based on the ratios of alkali and alkaline earth elements price and velbel 2003 and it can be defined as 2 n a 2 o 0 35 m g o 0 9 2 k 2 o 0 25 c a o 0 7 100 guo et al 2018 shao et al 2012 according to the definition of wip and contrary to cia values smaller wip values are indicative of stronger chemical weathering guo et al 2017 this index is most suitable for weathering profiles on heterogeneous parent rocks but potentially less suitable for highly weathering coatings because its formulation is based on only highly mobile alkali and alkaline elements hamdan and bumham 1996 price and velbel 2003 in the case of the mobility of aluminum during chemical washing some studies have shown that wip may be more suitable for characterizing weathering intensity than cia although both indicators are well correlated however to date wip has been rarely used to measure the weathering intensity in different stream sediment samples from around the world whereas cia has been widely documented for drainage basins shao et al 2012 cia wip plots can be used to discriminate the modification of sediment compositions due to weathering induced by recycling over longer timescales thus with an increase in sediment recycling the value of wip is linearly reduced but cia is largely independent of this guo et al 2017 the effects of chemical recycling on river sediment chemistry should be carefully considered in order to provide stronger constraints on the interpretation of sediment associated geochemical profiles guo et al 2018 the chemical index of weathering ciw developed by harnois 1988 is defined as a l 2 o 3 a l 2 o 3 c a o n a 2 o 100 this index is equivalent to the cia except that the potassium was eliminated from the cia equation like the cia the ciw is also essentially a measure of the extent of conversion of feldspars to clays because the ciw does not account for the aluminum associated with k feldspar it may yield very high values for k feldspar rich rocks whether they are chemically weathered or not fedo et al 1995 proposed the plagioclase index of alteration pia as an alternative to the ciw because plagioclase is abundant in silicate rocks and dissolves relatively rapidly the pia may be used when plagioclase weathering needs to be taken into consideration price and velbel 2003 2 4 tracer conservation tests sediment tracers should exhibit conservative behavior during sediment detachment and transport through a catchment haddadchi et al 2015 lamba et al 2015 accordingly the first step in addressing this requirement is removal of non conservative tracers from further analysis non conservative tracers were identified and eliminated using three methods haddadchi et al 2015 nosrati et al 2018b initially the standard bracket or range test was performed to ensure that the tracer concentrations of the individual main stem target sediment samples which were collected from the outlet of the main basin were within the concentration range of the sub basin source groups mukundan et al 2010 navratil et al 2012 nosrati et al 2018b tiecher et al 2018 at the next stage the mean concentration of each tracer in each main stem target sediment sample was compared with the corresponding mean concentration range in the sub basin samples haddadchi et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2013 again the tracers that were not in the mean concentration range of the sub basin spatial source bed sediment samples were removed from further analysis these range tests do not confirm the complete absence of changes to tracer properties but instead provide an initial screening for the removal of tracers that show significant alteration between upstream sampled sources and downstream sites for the collection of target sediment samples lastly biplots of tracer pairings selected in the final composite signatures were used to assess the degree to which the relationships between tracers judged to be generally conservative by the first two tests were consistent between upstream and downstream bed sediment sampling sites 2 5 discrimination of the tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources applying statistical tests is one widely used means of identifying sets of tracers that can discriminate robustly between potential sediment sources haddadchi et al 2014 nosrati et al 2011 three statistical methods were used to provide composite fingerprints for discriminating the three sub basin spatial sources 1 a combination of kw h and discriminant function analysis dfa 2 a combination of kw h and data mining analysis and 3 a combination of kw h and principal components classification analysis pcca kw h or one way anova is a nonparametric test that compares more than two groups and tests the null hypothesis that different groups in comparison comprise a similar distribution or distributions with equal means collins and walling 2002 2007 smith and blake 2014 therefore the kwh test helps eliminate any tracer that does not show significant differences in the concentrations between at least two sediment sources pulley et al 2015 discriminant function analysis dfa was performed based on minimizing the wilks lambda of those tracer properties that passed the kw h test dfa has been widely used to determine the final composite fingerprints that have the highest discrimination between sediment sources but with a minimum number of variables collins et al 1998 evrard et al 2011 lamba et al 2015 smith and blake 2014 wilks lambda is a multivariate statistical test that measures the significance of the discriminatory power of the model wilks lambda values are between 0 1 values close to 0 indicate high discriminatory power while values close to 1 indicate poor discrimination hughes et al 2009 to determine whether discriminant functions are statistically significant various tests including eigenvalue canonical correlation and mahalanobis distance were used nosrati 2017 nosrati et al 2018b tracers exhibiting statistically significant differences between the potential sub basin spatial sediment sources using kwh were also entered into classification tree analysis classification tree analysis is one of the main techniques used in data mining lemon et al 2003 classification trees are used to predict membership of cases in the classes of a categorical dependent variable from their measurements on one or more predictor variables i e tracers and as such this method has much in common with dfa classification tree analysis determines a set of logical if then conditions instead of the linear equations estimated in dfa for classifying cases classification trees readily lend themselves to being displayed graphically helping to make them easier to interpret there are two key tools to interpret the results of classification tree analysis the final trees and the predictor importance the final graphical sequence of boosted trees can be a useful way to examine the significance of the final classification model the predictor importance is computed as the relative scaled average value of the predictor statistic over all trees the bar plot of the predictor importance provides insight on the variables that make the major contributions to the prediction of group membership the fourth and final set of tracer properties was identified by applying a pcca test to those tracers

source apportionment using a sediment un mixing model the modified mixsir bayesian un mixing model nosrati et al 2014 2018b quantifies the relative contributions of sediment from different sources by

were constructed using the measured tracer data for the tributary sub basin spatial source samples the tracer concentrations in the virtual mixtures satisfied the bracket test for tracer conservation the accuracy of the modelling in solving the virtual sediment mixtures was assessed using the averaged root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the predicted and known source proportions using each final composite signature 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmation of conservative tracers and different composite fingerprints for discriminating the spatial sediment sources table 1 compares the tracer concentrations in the sub basin outlet spatial sediment sources and downstream target sediment samples the results of the standard bracket test showed that ag ce cu la mn pb sb sc u v yb zn zr cu pb and fe mn were non conservative in addition to the standard test the results of comparing the sediment means with the corresponding sub basin spatial source means showed that all remaining tracers except y and fe p were conservative table 1 on the basis of these two tests the 29 remaining tracers were retained and tested using the kw h test table 1 also shows the results of applying the kw h test which indicated that all tracers exhibited a statistically significant difference between the tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources using the bed sediment samples collected from the field the 29 tracers al as ba be ca cd co cr fe k li mg mo na ni p s sr th ti al ti k na pb ni k na ca mg al cia wip recycling ciw and pia passing the kwh test were entered into the stepwise dfa table 2 the largest eigenvalue of the first function 61 1 corresponds to the eigenvector in the direction of the maximum spread of the groups means the wilk s lambda value of the first function 0 001 indicated that 83 of the total variance among the sub basin spatial source bed sediment samples was explained by these tracers the canonical correlation value was 0 99 and indicated a strong correlation between the discriminant scores and the individual source groups table 3 the squared mahalanobis distance showed that the spatial sediment sources were well separated by the shortlisted tracers table 3 the backward stepwise dfa yielded classification matrices assigning 100 of the cases i e spatial source bed sediment samples to the correct groups table 3 stepwise selection using wilks lambda indicated that a composite signature comprising seven tracers li al ba p al ti na and fe provided significant discriminatory power on the basis of the dfa model table 2 the results of different tests within dfa indicated that the discriminatory power of all of these tracers was perfect table 2 partial wilks lambda is the wilks lambda for the unique contribution of

the first and second discriminant functions calculated using backward dfa confirmed that the sediment samples collected from the outlets of the different sub basin spatial sediment sources were well separated during the data mining stage of the tracer analysis the properties passing kw h were entered into general classification and regression tree models gc rt fig 4 a displays the final tree selected on the basis of the sub basin properties tracers considering v fold cross validation cv cost 03 analysis the final tree classified the sub basin spatial sediment sources into three terminal nodes i e the sampled sub basins using the sediment samples collected to characterise these potential sources the histograms of cases in each class at the nodes showed that 100 of the cases were classified correctly fig 4a the bar plot of predictor importance based on tributary sub basin spatial source as the dependent variable and the tracer properties as the predictors is presented in fig 4b for each tracer predictor importance shows the relative average value of the sums of squares prediction over all trees and nodes where the maximum value sums to 1 hence these values reflect the strength of the relationship between the predictors and the dependent variable of interest over the successive boosting steps in this case the tracers ba co cr mg ni and pb ni importance value 1 0 stand out as the most important predictors within this particular composite signature fig 4b these results provide evidence that general classification and regression tree models can be used as a tool for identifying important dimensions in a set of tracers included within a composite signature and to identify those sediment sources with similar or dissimilar characteristics tracers passing the kwh test al as ba be ca cd co cr fe k li mg mo na ni p s sr th ti al ti k na pb ni k na ca mg al cia wip recycling ciw and pia were also tested using pcca here all the tracers in question were further explored as an alternative means of reducing the number of tracers and problems of multicollinearity the results of pcca showed that the first five principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 accounted for 90 of the variability among the tracer values for the three spatial source groups table 4 the pc corresponding to the largest eigenvalue 16 0 accounted for approximately 55 of the total variance the second pc corresponding to the second eigenvalue 5 9 accounted for approximately 20 of the total variance the third pc corresponding to the third eigenvalue 1 9 accounted for approximately 6 of the total variance the fourth pc corresponding to the fourth eigenvalue 1 1 accounted for approximately 4 of the total variance the pc corresponding to the smallest selected eigenvalue 1 0 accounted for approximately 3 6 of the total variance table 4 the highly weighted tracers under pc1 with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 93 value for be loading the loading of selected tracers should be larger than 0 84 were al k mg ni pb ni al ti k na k na ca mg al cia and ciw only be was retained for the final composite signature because these eleven tracers were strongly inter correlated under pc2 the highly weighted tracers with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 77 value for wip loading the loading of selected tracers should be greater than 0 70 were sr and ti only wip and ti were retained for the final composite signature because wip was strongly correlated with sr r 0 92 under pc3 the highly weighted tracer 0 66 value for li with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer loading the loading of selected tracers should exceed 0 60 was li under pc4 the highly weighted tracers with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer 0 47 value for p loading the loading of selected tracers should exceed 0 42 were p and cr both were retained for the final composite signature because they were not strongly correlated under pc5 the highly weighted tracer 0 63 value for s with absolute values within 10 of the highest tracer loading the loading of selected tracers should exceed 0 57 was s pcs scores were calculated using the resulting component score coefficient matrix and tested for significant differences between the sediment sources using one way anova f test and tukey hsd post hoc tests p 0 05 table 4 the results showed that the pc scores for the first four pcs varied significantly with sediment sources so the tracer associated to the pc5 s was excluded from the composite signature these results thereby selected six tracers be fe wip li p and cr as an alternative composite fingerprint on the basis of the pcca model table 4 the plot of factor coordinates of variables for the first two pcs associated with the six tracers selected by pcca is presented in fig 5 a this composite fingerprint clearly provided strong discrimination between the three potential sub basin sediment sources fig 5b for the tracers selected in the final composite signatures the biplots of some tracer pairings for source and sediment samples were compared the results confirmed that there was no major tracer transformations during sediment mobilization and delivery in the study area fig 6 3 2 sediment source contributions fig 7 presents the un mixing model outputs using the composite fingerprint selected by kw h and dfa table 5 the relative contributions with corresponding uncertainty ranges from the sub basin spatial sources 1 2 and 3 were estimated as 54 3 47 8 62 0 11 4 4 2 18 7 and 34 3 27 6 39 9 respectively using the alternative composite signature selected by a combination of kw h and data mining table 5 the corresponding respective contributions and associated uncertainty ranges were estimated as 72 0 61 6 82 7 13 6 9 0 18 5 and 14 2 3 1 25 4 finally on the basis of the composite signature selected using a combination of kw h and pcca table 5 the relative contributions from the sub basin spatial sources 1 2 and 3 were estimated as 50 8 42 8 59 9 28 7 20 2 37 3 and 20 3 12 7 27 2 respectively the root mean square difference table 5 between the estimated sediment contributions from the sub basin spatial sources using the three different composite signatures ranged from 22 3 sub basin 3 to 47 4 sub basin 2 the predicted spatial source contributions were therefore highly sensitive to the composite fingerprint used in the bayesian un mixing model comparisons of the predicted and known relative contributions from the tributary sub basin spatial sources 1 2 and 3 using the three different composite signatures and the virtual sediment mixtures showed that the rmse ranged between 0 6 and 35 8 and mae between 0 2 and 11 9 table 6 the overall average rmse and mae for the modelled source predictions using the virtual mixtures were 10 6 and 9 6 respectively the rmse results showed that 15 of 30 possible predicted values were 10 whilst in the case of mae 29 of the 30 values were 10 these error levels were judged to be acceptable in the context of those reported elsewhere in the international literature e g haddadchi et al 2013 nosrati and collins 2019 palazón et al 2015 the weathering indices included in the initial potential tracer datasets reflect the intensity of chemical weathering processes and the degree of elemental mobility resulting from depletion of sediment samples in mobile as compared with immobile components nadlonek and bojakowska 2018 price and velbel 2003 only wip was selected in one of the final composite signatures for discriminating the three tributary sub basin spatial sources tables 5 and 6 although the results of the kw h in table 1 show that the indices were individually able to discriminate between the three sub basin spatial sources the wip values in table 1 suggest that the degree of chemical weathering reflected in the bed sediment samples collected to characterise sub basins 2 and 3 is marginally greater than that for the equivalent samples collected from sub basin 1 the estimates of wip shown in table 1 are considerably higher than those reported by some recent studies in the international literature e g nadlonek and bojakowska 2018 thereby suggesting comparatively lower chemical weathering intensity in the study area the low values for cia in table 1 are also suggestive of a lack of intensive weathering and chemical alteration in the study area and reflect the local arid climate nadlonek and bojakowska 2018 weathering index values reflect the complex interplay between climate lithology tectonism topography vegetation cover and human activities gibbs 1970 meybeck 1987 oliva et al 2003 shao et al 2012 on this basis they potentially offer a physically grounded basis for inclusion in tracer datasets for identifying statistically robust composite signatures for source discrimination here however scale is likely to be an important factor driving the magnitude of differences between weathering index values for soil or sediment samples collected to characterise different river basin sources the source apportionment results based on the three composite signatures consistently suggested that tributary sub basin 1 is the dominant source of the target sediment samples collected further downstream from the bed of the main stem this sub basin is the largest 168 3 km2 of the spatial zones apportioned in this study and comprises larger areas of both dry land farming 72 km2 and rangelands 64 km2 compared to the other two spatial sources locally dry land farming is characterized by cultivation using conventional tillage practices on steep slopes which renders bare tilled soils susceptible to rain splash detachment and subsequent mobilization in surface runoff recent expansion of such farming in sub basin 1 on the quaternary deposits has exacerbated erosion problems in this zone of the study area at present water scarcity problems and limited availability of new land for conversion to agriculture mean that land use change from rangeland to arable cropping under dry land farming is common especially in sub basin 1 conventional dry land farming practices are widespread including intensive tillage with ploughing and heavy harrowing plus the routine removal of crop residues by burning to reduce biomass volume and to facilitate mechanical operations which are the primary factor leading to increased soil erosion and sediment production on the steep slopes jin et al 2007 it should be noted however that flood water irrigation in riparian areas in the lower and middle portions of sub basin 1 which is assisted by siltation encouraging more overbank inundation is used to support crop production on low lying riparian plots the source apportionment results presented herein should however be interpreted as a tier 1 assessment of the sources of downstream sediment issues in this regard they provide a basis for targeting follow up work for confirming the relative losses from dry land and rangeland farming practices especially in sub basin 1 to help engage local farmers and select and target appropriate mitigation measures for soil tillage or grazing management here further work could also usefully assess the relative age of sampled sediment e g using the ratios of fallout radionuclides with shorter and longer half lives to elucidate the likely temporal duration of sediment storage and remobilization in the study catchment and to help link the sediment source tracing results to oral cropping histories developed with local farmers 4 conclusions a spatial sediment source fingerprinting exercise has been used to provide a tier 1 screening of sediment provenance in a mountainous agricultural catchment in western iran three composite signatures were selected using different statistical tests all of which suggested that sub basin 1 draining the upper portions of the study area dominates source contributions to the target sediment samples collected on the riverbed at the catchment outlet the consistency of the signatures in all identifying sub basin 1 as the dominant spatial sediment source lends weight to the results since it is established that different composite signatures have the potential to generate contrasting sediment source estimates using mixing models collins et al 2017b the inclusion of weathering indices in initial tracer sets from which composite signatures are selected warrants further evaluation regardless of their inclusion or otherwise in final composite signatures weathering indices potentially offer useful information for helping pre selection of tracers e g mineralogical elemental and for interpreting tracer conservation test results in the context of climate lithology and hydro geomorphological processes in river basins with regards tracer conservation longitudinal sediment sampling in large drainage basins would permit the weathering indices to be used to explore any potential evolution of tracer transformation risks across scales weathering indices offer potential for ensuring composite signatures have a physical rather than a purely statistical basis in the context of study area lithology and the requirement to discriminate individual spatial sources across landscapes follow up investigations are required to confirm the relative contributions of the dry land and rangeland farming and of channel banks in the study area to downstream sediment loads nonetheless the evidence generated by this study will be used to help engage land owners in the need for
