china corresponding author corresponding author the accuracy of the linear and nonlinear properties embodied in multi layer boussinesq type models with the highest spatial derivative n being 2 as proposed by liu et al 2018 is theoretically and numerically investigated in this paper theoretical analysis shows that the four layer model has the highest accuracy and is applicable up to kh 179 3 where k is the wavenumber and h is a typical water depth in phase celerity at a 1 tolerance error kh 69 7 in the linear velocity components and kh 141 8 in linear shoaling amplitude at the same tolerance error the super and sub harmonic transfer functions are accurate up to kh 138 5 and 80 respectively and the third order harmonics and amplitude dispersion are accurate up to kh 127 2 a high accuracy of the linear velocity profiles is also achieved and is approximately kh 4 5 14 9 and 69 7 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively vertical two dimensional 2d numerical models are established with a composite fourth order adams bashforth moulton scheme in time integration numerical simulations including linear shoaling of regular waves over a mild slope nonlinear regular wave evolution over a submerged breakwater and focusing wave group evolution over a constant water depth are carried out the computed results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data furthermore the cpu times for the two layer model with n 2 and the two layer model with n 3 are compared and the numerical efficiency of the two layer model with n 2 increases by approximately 1 3 keywords multi layer boussinesq type models dispersion shoaling gradient nonlinear property numerical models 1 introduction free surface waves in oceans and along coasts are an important environmental load in the design of coastal and offshore structures and an important hydrodynamic factor that remarkably impacts the transportation of coastal materials sediment pollutants etc from deep water to shallow water waves undergo a complex physical process that includes refraction reflection diffraction and even wave breaking and run up various kinds of wave propagation equations have been developed to accurately describe this process the phase resolving boussinesq type bt model has become increasingly popular in wave modeling in the fields of ocean and coastal engineering for the following reasons 1 the bt model transforms a complex three dimensional wave problem into a horizontal two dimensional problem thereby greatly reducing the computational time compared to the three dimensional potential wave theory and the navier stokes equations and 2 the bt model has good linear dispersion and acceptable nonlinear properties and is suitable for nonlinear shortwave simulations compared to the nonlinear shallow water equations over the past three decades both the bt theories and the numerical methods have made great progress the development of bt theories has contributed most to the continuously increased use of bt models though many proposed bt equations differ in complexity and accuracy all research has followed the sole principle of achieving a high accuracy this could be partially fulfilled by extending the lower order equations to higher order ones with more accuracy following a similar approach wei et al 1995 madsen and schäffer 1998 gobbi et al 2000 zou and fang 2008 or by improving the original equations with some deliberate skills such as adding third order dispersive terms to the governing equations madsen et al 1991 schäffer and madsen 1995 liu and sun 2005 adopting horizontal velocity variables defined at an arbitrary water depth nwogu 1993 and adopting a horizontal velocity variable defined at an arbitrary total water depth kennedy et al 2001 however the accuracy of the nonlinearity of these conventional bt models is far more limited than that of linear dispersion thus limiting their usage for highly nonlinear water waves for example the linear dispersion of the fourth order boussinesq type equations by zou and fang 2008 is accurate up to kh 6 while the second order nonlinearity is only accurate up to kh 1 therefore there is an urgent need to develop new bt equations that have the same level of accuracy in both linear and nonlinear properties agnon et al 1999 pioneered this work in the derivation of the bt model by decoupling the linear parts from the nonlinear parts of the wave motion and the final boussinesq wave model incorporates the exact dynamic and kinematic conditions at the free surface and at the bottom with the finite expansion series of the horizontal velocity and vertical velocity components from the still water level the bt model agnon et al 1999 can be applicable to kh 6 for both linear and nonlinear properties however the acceptably accurate velocity profile is only limited to kh 2 to further improve the accuracy of velocity profiles madsen et al 2002 2003 generalized the research work of agnon et al 1999 by using the velocity variables defined at an arbitrary water depth and these velocity variables were further replaced by the pseudo velocity computational velocity the concept of the pseudo velocity was also applied in some conventional bt models to enhance the accuracy of linear dispersion gobbi et al 2000 zou 2000 liu and sun 2005 the highly nonlinear and strongly dispersive bt equations are currently hot research topics madsen et al 2002 2003 chazel et al 2009 liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 these equations lay a solid theoretical foundation for their potential numerical use in more challenging circumstances in which the conventional bt equations might fail successful numerical implementation builds a bridge between the bt theories and the practical applications for solving both scientific and engineering problems the bt models should not cause much difficulty in numerical implementation when their practical application is considered the conventional fourth order bt equations are more accurate than the second order bt equations in linear and nonlinear properties however such an improvement is a significant increase in the computational cost since the fifth order derivatives embodied in the equations requires a complex numerical scheme lynett and liu 2004b recently kirby 2016 conducted a state of the art review on the development and application of bt models and he stated that there was a great deal of ongoing use and development of low order bt models for both scientific and practical applications no matter what kinds of numerical methods are used for discretization scientists and engineers tend to choose the bt equations that are relatively simple but with an acceptable accuracy from the viewpoint of practical applications in general the bt equations with the highest spatial derivative over 3 are not preferred because the high order derivatives will inevitably cause substantial trouble for numerical discretization especially in dealing with the boundary conditions thus the bt formula with a spatial derivative over 5 has rarely been used in the literature and the corresponding two horizontal dimensional numerical models are even more scarce to avoid high order spatial derivatives lynett and liu 2004a 2004b divided the vertical water depth into multi layers and proposed the multi layer concept to derive bt equations with good dispersion and nonlinearity the multi layer approach to avoid high order derivatives in the bt equations can also be found in many studies chazel et al 2009 liu and fang 2015 2016 liu and fang 2016 the multi layer approach could be regarded as a good compromise between the accuracy of the bt equations and the operational convenience of numerical implementation using the multi layer approach lynett and liu 2004a 2004b liu et al 2018 systematically derived multi layer bt models with the highest spatial derivatives n being 2 3 and 5 in their work the linear and nonlinear characteristics of the multi layer model with third order spatial derivatives were analyzed and some numerical simulations were carried out and the high accuracy of both the linear and nonlinear properties was demonstrated as mentioned above the model with second order spatial derivatives would be preferred for numerical implementation the multi layer bt model n 2 could be regarded as the simplified version of the previous multi layer bt model liu et al 2018 because these models almost share the same derivation and analysis procedures and the multi layer bt model serves as an alternative choice when considering the numerical efficiency in practical applications since a detailed analysis of the multi layer model n 2 was not presented in liu et al 2018 its application range remains unknown thus the objectives of the present paper are to theoretically analyze the properties of the multi layer model n 2 and to investigate its performance and efficiency by conducting numerical experiments a brief introduction to the derivation of the reduced multi layer model with second order spatial derivatives is given in section 2 section 3 presents the basic theoretical analysis of the multi layer models in section 4 a vertical 2d multi layer numerical model is developed and some analytical and experimental data are used to examine the model discussions of the cpu time consumptions and some numerical performances are presented in section 5 finally the concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 a brief derivation of a multi layer boussinesq type model with second order spatial derivatives the multi layer concept for surface waves over a slowly varying seabed is shown in fig 1 in the cartesian coordinate system the x and y axes are located on the undisturbed still water level z 0 with the z axis pointing vertically upward in this figure η x y t is the surface elevation measured from z 0 h i is the thickness of the i th layer i 1 n where n is the number of layers d i represents the interfacial locations between artificial adjacent layers and z αi stands for the velocity locations the h i d i and z αi are defined as 1 h i 2 α i h d 0 0 d i j 1 i h j z α i d i d i 1 2 where α i is the dispersive coefficient which will be determined in subsection 3 1 starting from the laplace equation and using the pseudo velocity variables to replace the velocity variables defined on the middle location in each layer liu et al 2018 derived three sets of multi layer models with different order spatial derivatives the multi layer model n 2 second order spatial derivatives can be written as follows the exact kinematic and dynamics equations on the surface are 2 η t u η w η 1 η η 0 3 u t g η 1 2 u u w η 2 1 η η 0 and 4 u u η w η η where the velocity u is the horizontal gradient of the velocity potential defined on the free surface elevation η u η and w η are the horizontal velocity vector and the vertical velocity component defined on the free surface respectively and g is the acceleration due to gravity the matching conditions for the velocities at the interfacial locations z d i 1 are 5 u i x d i 1 t u i 1 x d i 1 t 6 w i x d i 1 t w i 1 x d i 1 t where i 2 n x represents x y and the velocities u i x z t and w i x z t are defined in each layer first the velocity field is expressed in terms of the velocity variables u αi w αi which are defined at the mid water depth using the taylor expansion method liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 second to further improve the accuracy of the equations the velocities u αi w αi can be replaced by the pseudo velocity variables u i and w i madsen et al 2002 2003 liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 and thus the velocity field can be written as 7 u i x z t u i 1 2 z z α i 2 1 6 α i h 2 u i z z α i z α i u i z z α i w i 1 3 z z α i α i h 1 d i 1 z α i z z α i 2 z α i w i 8 w i x z t w i 1 2 z z α i 2 1 6 α i h 2 w i z z α i z α i w i z z α i u i 1 3 z z α i α i h 1 d i 1 z α i z z α i 2 z α i u i where the relationship between the velocity group u αi w αi and the pseudo velocity group u i w i is written as 9 u α i u i 1 6 α i h 2 u i 10 w α i w i 1 6 α i h 2 w i the relationship between the velocities on the surface u η w η and the velocities on z 0 u 0 w 0 are 11 u η u 0 η w 0 1 2 η 2 u 0 12 w η w 0 η u 0 1 2 η 2 w 0 the velocities u 0 w 0 are obtained by inserting z 0 into the first layer as shown in expressions 7 and 8 we use the expressions 11 and 12 instead of the expressions 7 and 8 i 1 to calculate the velocity variables u η w η because this will enhance the accuracy of third order nonlinearity and amplitude dispersion madsen et al 2002 2003 liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 notice that if the surface elevation is below the still water level the velocity variables u 0 w 0 do not actually exist which was also observed by chazel et al 2009 in such a condition we consider them to be pseudo velocity variables the bottom kinematic boundary equation is 13 u b h w b 0 where the velocities u b and w b can be obtained by inserting z h into expressions 7 and 8 because the terms related to h 2 and 2 h in deriving the velocity fields have been neglected under the assumption of a mild slope the terms related to h in the expressions for u b are similarly neglected equations 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 and 11 13 constitute the final multi layer bt model n 2 liu et al 2018 the model is expressed in terms of the surface elevation and n 2 groups of the velocity variables x y and z directions with n groups of pseudo velocity variables u i w i and two other group of velocity variables u η w η and u 0 w 0 the total number of variables is 3n 7 in a 3d case and 2n 5 in vertical a 2d case the unique feature of the present multi layer model relative to the work presented in liu et al 2018 is that the highest order spatial derivative in the equations is only 2 3 theoretical analysis of the multi layer boussinesq type model the multi layer bt model is analyzed with respect to seven properties including linear dispersion the second order transfer function for regular waves super and sub harmonics for bichromatic waves third order harmonics amplitude dispersion linear velocity profiles and the linear shoaling amplitude liu et al 2018 here we restrict our study to the models with n 2 3 and 4 the detailed analysis process exactly follows our previous work liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 and is not repeated here for clarity 3 1 accuracy of the linear phase celerity linear dispersion is the fundamental property of a bt model the accuracy of linear phase celerity represents the ability of the bt model to capture a wave phase the dispersive coefficients used in the multi layer model are α i the maximum i is 2 3 and 4 for two layer three layer and four layer model respectively and they satisfy i 1 n α i 0 5 liu et al 2018 different values of these coefficients will lead to different linear dispersion accuracies to determine the dispersion coefficients the linear velocity dominant method vdm proposed by liu et al 2018 is used 14 f v κ 1 κ 0 κ f u 2 f w 2 d k h where the velocity errors f u κ and f w κ are identical to those proposed by madsen et al 2003 and are expressed as 15 f u k h 1 h h 0 u z u s z u s 0 2 d z and f w k h 1 h h 0 w z w s z w s 0 2 d z where u s 0 and w s 0 are the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities on the still water level respectively thus we can obtain the dispersion coefficients and they are α 1 0 172 α 2 0 328 α 1 0 07 α 2 0 154 α 3 0 276 and α 1 0 022 α 2 0 044 α 3 0 111 and α 4 0 323 for two layer n 2 three layer n 3 and four layer n 4 models respectively the phase celerity is shown in fig 2 the maximum water depth of the multi layer models is applicable to kh 19 7 54 4 and 179 3 at a 1 tolerance error in contrast the traditional bt models with padé 4 4 dispersion are only accurate to kh 6 28 at a 2 tolerance error 3 2 accuracy of the linear velocity profiles the linear velocity profiles can be directly obtained from expressions 7 and 8 and the depth integrated errors calculated by expressions 15 are shown in fig 3 the accuracy of the linear velocity profiles improves with the increase of the layer number n the applicable range is approximately kh 4 5 for n 2 to kh 14 9 for n 3 and to kh 69 7 for n 4 at a 1 tolerance error for both horizontal and vertical velocities 3 3 accuracy of second order harmonic amplitude third order harmonic amplitude and amplitude dispersion the nonlinear properties include wave wave same frequency interaction generated second and third order harmonic amplitude as well as amplitude dispersion and wave wave different frequency interaction generated sub harmonic and super harmonic amplitudes a high accuracy of these properties will enable the model to simulate a highly nonlinear wave case liu and fang 2019 fig 4 shows the theoretical results of second and third order harmonics amplitudes and amplitude dispersion the multi layer bt model is more accurate with the increase of the number of layers considering the combined effect of these three nonlinear properties the maximum water depth is applicable to kh 13 6 39 1 and 127 2 at a 1 tolerance error for two layer three layer and four layer models respectively a slightly larger error appears in the finite water depth but it is approximately less than 0 4 to sum up these good nonlinear properties are attributed to the method of decoupling the linear and nonlinear parts agnon et al 1999 the method of adopting pseudo velocity vectors gobbi et al 2000 madsen et al 2002 2003 and the multi layer concept lynett and liu 2004a 2004b 3 4 accuracy of sub harmonics and super harmonics the transfer functions are the ratios of the amplitude of the high nonlinear wave components to the linear wave amplitude and their accuracy can be checked by comparing with the analytical solutions of the stokes wave theory the second order transfer functions for the sub harmonics and super harmonics of the two three and four layer models are plotted in fig 5 we can see that the multi layer model can present accurate harmonic amplitudes generated by wave wave interaction the application range has been clearly shown to increase with the increase in the number of layers the excellent properties should be attributed to the approaches used in previous studies agnon et al 1999 madsen et al 2002 lynett and liu 2004a 2004b and this has also been demonstrated in other versions of the multi layer bt model with third order spatial derivatives liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 3 5 the accuracy of the linear shoaling property the linear shoaling gradient and shoaling amplitude of the multi layer equations are shown in fig 6 they are in good agreement with the analytical solutions at a 1 tolerance error in the linear shoaling amplitude the application water depth is kh 15 8 41 7 and 143 9 for the two three and four layer models respectively 3 6 summary of the linear and nonlinear properties we summarize the theoretical results of the multi layer model the order of highest spatial derivatives n 2 and 3 with respect to the linear and nonlinear properties and the maximum water depth kh max at a 1 tolerance error is listed in table 1 it can be seen that kh max increases with the number of layers given a fixed multilayer model kh max for linear dispersion is the largest followed by the linear shoaling amplitude as amplitude dispersion ω 13 second order harmonics a 2 third order harmonics a 3 and linear velocity profiles if the surface elevation is the only target of concern in wave evolution the third order harmonics a 3 is the main restriction and kh max is 13 6 for the two layer model if both the surface elevation and interior wave kinematics are issues of concern the velocity profiles are the main restriction and kh max is 4 5 for the two layer model in other words considering all the properties kh max is 4 5 14 9 and 69 7 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively for comparison the theoretical results of the multi layer model with n 3 liu et al 2018 are also given in table 1 the application range of the multi layer model n 3 is indeed larger than that of the reduced multi layer model n 2 but considering the numerical efficiency which will be shown in subsection 5 2 the multi layer model n 2 is also an alternative choice for practical simulations 4 a vertical two dimension numerical model and numerical verifications 4 1 a brief introduction of the vertical two dimensional multi layer model the present multi layer model is the simplified version of the model of liu et al 2018 the highest order spatial derivative is 2 which is much more convenient than the previous numerical discretization because the highest order spatial derivative in liu et al 2018 and liu and fang 2019 is 3 following the same process used in liu et al 2018 and liu and fang 2019 we can also solve the present vertical two dimensional numerical model accordingly the main process is similar to that proposed by kirby et al 1998 for solving variables such as the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity at the free surface other variables can be obtained according to the approaches used in liu and fang 2019 a finite difference method with a regular mesh is used to approximate the spatial derivatives a composite fourth order predictor corrector adams bashforth moulton integration scheme is employed for time integration the convergence of the iterations is accelerated by using an over relaxation technique kirby et al 1998 in the following numerical experiments the internal wave generation method hsiao et al 2005 and the boundary incident wave conditions are incorporated in these models two or one sponge layers are employed in the computation domain to absorb the reflected waves according to different wave generation methods and a sponge layer that is at least two wavelengths long is adopted in present study 4 2 numerical verifications to examine the fundamental ability of multi layer bt numerical models we conduct three sets of numerical simulations as follows 4 2 1 linear wave shoaling from deep water to shallow water to examine the linear shoaling performance of the present two three and four layer models numerical experiments of a linear wave propagating over a mild slope bottom are conducted in these experiments the linear regular waves with a period of t 6 4 s propagate from a deep water depth of h 1 101 782 m kh 10 to a shallow one of h 2 0 623 m kh 0 25 and the connection of the two water depths is an infinitely smooth bottom profile fuhrman 2004 bingham and zhang 2007 benoit et al 2017 liu and fang 2019 which is written as 16 h x h 1 h 1 h 2 2 1 tanh sin π x 1 l 1 2 x 1 l 2 where the length l is 3180 m x 1 x l 2 x b and we use the starting location at x b 270 m in a numerical flume with a total length of 3700 m the wave generation method hsiao et al 2005 is used with the centerline located at x s 150 m and the sponge layer width is 140 m at the left boundary and 40 m at the right boundary a temporal step of 0 05 s and a spatial step of 0 25 m are used in these three models fig 7 shows a comparison between the calculated surface elevations from the numerical results and the linear shoaling amplitude envelope from the analytical solution at the time t 200 t in general there is no clear difference in the surface elevations computed from the multi layer models and the agreement is good which demonstrates that the models can accurately capture the linear shoaling process to show the difference we use the relative amplitude error 1 a a s which is 0 0007 0 0011 and 0 0013 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively this error in the numerical simulations is slightly larger than the abovementioned theoretical error and it might be caused by the reflections from the boundary and the bathymetry meanwhile the linear wavelength calculated from the surface elevation in fig 7 is compared with that of a linear stokes wave the relative wavelength error 1 l n l t is approximately 0 0002 in deep water and 0 0005 in shallow water for n 2 3 and 4 which numerically demonstrates that the present three models show a high accuracy in linear dispersion 4 2 2 regular wave evolution over a submerged breakwater the evolution of a regular wave over a submerged breakwater is a complicated physical process that includes 1 a weakly nonlinear shoaling and de shoaling process 2 wave wave interaction generated nonlinear energy transfer among different order harmonics and 3 a physical phenomenon of phase locked and unlocked processes the shoaling process occurs after the wave propagates over the front slope from the constant water depth before it arrives at the top of the submerged breakwater and with the phase locked process when the waves propagate down the back slope the waves undergo a de shoaling process and a de phase process each wave component travels at its own speed the nonlinear wave wave interaction is apparent over the constant water depth on the submerged breakwater to accurately simulate the full physical process a phase resolving numerical model must possess high accuracy in combined properties such as amplitude dispersion shoaling amplitude and high nonlinear amplitudes and velocity profiles the physical experiment is usually used to test phase resolving models the laboratory data from the physical experiment by luth et al 1994 are used to examine the multi layer model the incident regular wave period t is 2 02 s kh 0 673 and the wave height h is 0 02 m h l 0 0054 the spatial and temporal steps are 0 03 m and 0 01 s respectively and the two layer three layer and four layer models are used in the simulations the internal wave generation method hsiao et al 2005 with the centerline x s 10 m is used in the numerical simulations the computed surface elevations compared with the experimental data are plotted in fig 8 the agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data is fairly good thereby validating the three models furthermore the surface elevations and velocities on the surface elevations along the entire numerical flume at t 80 s from the two layer three layer and four layer models are given in fig 9 a and an enlarged picture is shown in fig 9 b overall the surface elevations and velocities on the surface elevations from the two layer model agree well with those from the three layer and four layer models 4 2 3 a focused wave group evolution over a constant water depth the phase focusing method is usually used to generate a large crest of the focusing wave group and numerous physical experiments and numerical simulations have been reported baldock et al 1996 carried out a series of experiments to investigate the spatial temporal focusing of a wide range of unidirectional water waves on constant deep and shallow water depths the incident wave group consists of a number of wave components the motion of each component and their nonlinear interactions result in a very complicated physical process to accurately capture the whole process a numerical model must possess high accuracy in linear dispersion and nonlinear properties such as the third order nonlinear amplitude and amplitude dispersion liu and fang 2019 the data set collected by baldock et al 1996 has been widely used for validating hobem a quadratic higher order boundary element model based on the potential theory ning et al 2009 a multi layer non hydrostatic model ai et al 2014 and some highly dispersive and highly nonlinear bt models fuhrman and madsen 2009 liu and fang 2019 the wave groups of a broad band covering the range of 0 714 hz f 1 667 hz case b55 kh 1 568 7 825 and a narrow frequency band covering the range of 0 833 hz f 1 25 hz case d55 kh 2 026 4 403 from the physical experiments baldock et al 1996 are used to verify the present models in these cases the wave group consists of n 29 individual wave components with equal wave amplitudes the total wave amplitude is 55 mm and equal period intervals additional details can be found in baldock et al 1996 in d55 the local wave steepness h l at the focusing position is approximately 0 097 h 0 1163 m l 1 2 m as mentioned in liu and fang 2019 and thus d55 represents a highly nonlinear wave case the computational length is set to be 20 m and the water depth is 0 7 m the linearized wave group with the first order stokes wave solution for each wave component is imposed at x 0 m and a 5 m long sponge layer is applied at the end of the computational domain the temporal and spatial steps are 0 01 s and 0 04 m respectively the surface elevation comparisons from the two layer three layer and four layer models and the experimental data from baldock et al 1996 are shown in fig 10 and the computed horizontal velocity profile at the largest wave crest location is shown in fig 11 for comparison the results of ai et al 2014 are also plotted in these two figures as shown in fig 10 we can roughly see that there is no great difference between the results from our three models and the results from ai et al 2014 they are all in good agreement with the experimental data from fig 11 we can see that all the simulated horizontal velocities are consistent with the experimental results and the apparent difference between the results from our multi layer models and the results of ai et al 2014 is that their model cannot present the velocity results near the free surface of the bottom because the number of simulated horizontal velocity points along the vertical coordinate is determined by the number of layers adopted in their model overall both the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity profile at the focused point calculated from the three models are in good agreement with the experimental data demonstrating that the multi layer model indeed possesses high accuracy in linear and nonlinear properties all simulations were conducted using an intel r core tm i7 7700 processor running at a clock speed of 3 6 ghz for the case of d55 the physical time is 40 s with a space grid number of 3000 and a time step number of 10 000 the cpu time is 28 95 s 34 75 s and 44 58 s for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively 5 discussion 5 1 highly nonlinear regular wave cases as described in subsection 3 6 the multi layer model is mostly restricted to the accuracy of the linear velocity profiles the linear horizontal velocity profile is only accurate up to kh 5 1 within a 1 error for the two layer model thus the two layer model is not apparently attractive in deep water e g kh 10 if the accuracy of the velocity profile is considered only the three layer and four layer models are used in this subsection the stream function solution is used to examine the three layer and four layer models the wave period is 6 0 s and the wave height is 6 0 m three cases with different water depths are shown in table 2 the nonlinear wave steepness h l 6 61 703 is approximately 0 097 in each case the computational domain is 10l l is the nonlinear wavelength and a wave generation zone fuhrman 2004 covering 0 2l and a sponge layer covering 8 10l are imposed at the incident and end boundaries respectively a spatial step of l 32 and a temporal step of t 120 are used in the numerical simulations for case 3 the simulated surface elevations the horizontal velocity and the vertical velocity on the surface elevation are shown in fig 12 the horizontal velocity profiles at the wave crest are plotted in fig 13 as shown in fig 12 case 3 the simulated horizontal and vertical velocities on the surface elevation from the three layer model show no apparent error compared to those from the four layer model however this is not true for the horizontal velocity profile as shown in fig 13 with the increase of the non dimensional water depth the three layer model shows a great error in the horizontal velocity profile therefore the three layer model cannot be applied to model kh 36 66 5 2 efficiency comparison to compare the efficiency of the models with different order spatial derivatives we use both the present two layer model n 2 and the two layer model n 3 from liu and fang 2016 to simulate bichromatic wave evolution case b39 in hsiao et al 2005 in a 300 m long wave flume with a constant water depth of 3 5 m in the thl of national cheng kung university of taiwan in case b39 the bichromatic wave is composed of two wave periods of 1 8 s k 1 h 4 347 and 2 2 s k 2 h 2 927 with an equal wave height of 0 15 m h l 1 0 02966 h l 2 0 01997 in the numerical simulations the temporal and spatial steps are 0 04 s and 0 1 m respectively with a grid number of 3000 and time steps of 10 000 the physical time is 400 s for the present two layer model n 2 the cpu time to finish the simulation was 1494 16 s while it was 2285 81 s for the two layer model n 3 and the efficiency improved by 34 6 6 conclusions a theoretical analysis is conducted on the multi layer boussinesq type model with second order spatial derivatives a finite difference scheme is proposed to solve the vertical 2d multi layer model on a regular uniform grid system a composite fourth order adams bashforth moulton predictor and corrector scheme is used for time marching the numerical models are validated through this research the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the high accuracy of the linear and nonlinear properties for a multi layer model can be obtained as the layer number increases considering the comprehensive performance the maximum water depth is 4 5 14 9 and 69 7 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively 2 the linear shoaling amplitudes are computed by the multi layer models n 2 3 and 4 and good agreement is observed which reflects the high accuracy of the shoaling gradient and linear dispersion in multi layer models 3 the wave evolution over a submerged bar is numerically reproduced by the multi layer models n 2 3 and 4 and the good agreement between the computed surface elevation and the experiment data show that the whole evolution process of a weakly nonlinear regular wave is well demonstrated numerically 4 the computed surface elevation and interior wave velocity profiles are consistent with the experimental data of baldock et al 1996 and with the stream function solution highly nonlinear wave cases in subsection 5 1 this result shows that the multi layer model possesses high accuracy in the linear and nonlinear properties since the wave steepness h l in case d55 and in the three cases in subsection 5 1 is nearly 0 1 5 compared with the two layer boussinesq type model with third order spatial derivatives liu and fang 2016 the cpu time of the present two layer model with second order spatial derivatives decreased by nearly 1 3 this result partially demonstrates the efficiency of the present multi layer model with n 2 over that of the multi layer model with n 3 acknowledgements the

china corresponding author corresponding author the accuracy of the linear and nonlinear properties embodied in multi layer boussinesq type models with the highest spatial derivative n being 2 as proposed by liu et al 2018 is theoretically and numerically investigated in this paper theoretical analysis shows that the four layer model has the highest accuracy and is applicable up to kh 179 3 where k is the wavenumber and h is a typical water depth in phase celerity at a 1 tolerance error kh 69 7 in the linear velocity components and kh 141 8 in linear shoaling amplitude at the same tolerance error the super and sub harmonic transfer functions are accurate up to kh 138 5 and 80 respectively and the third order harmonics and amplitude dispersion are accurate up to kh 127 2 a high accuracy of the linear velocity profiles is also achieved and is approximately kh 4 5 14 9 and 69 7 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively vertical two dimensional 2d numerical models are established with a composite fourth order adams bashforth moulton scheme in time integration numerical simulations including linear shoaling of regular waves over a mild slope nonlinear regular wave evolution over a submerged breakwater and focusing wave group evolution over a constant water depth are carried out the computed results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data furthermore the cpu times for the two layer model with n 2 and the two layer model with n 3 are compared and the numerical efficiency of the two layer model with n 2 increases by approximately 1 3 keywords multi layer boussinesq type models dispersion shoaling gradient nonlinear property numerical models 1 introduction free surface waves in oceans and along coasts are an important environmental load in the design of coastal and offshore structures and an important hydrodynamic factor that remarkably impacts the transportation of coastal materials sediment pollutants etc from deep water to shallow water waves undergo a complex physical process that includes refraction reflection diffraction and even wave breaking and run up various kinds of wave propagation equations have been developed to accurately describe this process the phase resolving boussinesq type bt model has become increasingly popular in wave modeling in the fields of ocean and coastal engineering for the following reasons 1 the bt model transforms a complex three dimensional wave problem into a horizontal two dimensional problem thereby greatly reducing the computational time compared to the three dimensional potential wave theory and the navier stokes equations and 2 the bt model has good linear dispersion and acceptable nonlinear properties and is suitable for nonlinear shortwave simulations compared to the nonlinear shallow water equations over the past three decades both the bt theories and the numerical methods have made great progress the development of bt theories has contributed most to the continuously increased use of bt models though many proposed bt equations differ in complexity and accuracy all research has followed the sole principle of achieving a high accuracy this could be partially fulfilled by extending the lower order equations to higher order ones with more accuracy following a similar approach wei et al 1995 madsen and schäffer 1998 gobbi et al 2000 zou and fang 2008 or by improving the original equations with some deliberate skills such as adding third order dispersive terms to the governing equations madsen et al 1991 schäffer and madsen 1995 liu and sun 2005 adopting horizontal velocity variables defined at an arbitrary water depth nwogu 1993 and adopting a horizontal velocity variable defined at an arbitrary total water depth kennedy et al 2001 however the accuracy of the nonlinearity of these conventional bt models is far more limited than that of linear dispersion thus limiting their usage for highly nonlinear water waves for example the linear dispersion of the fourth order boussinesq type equations by zou and fang 2008 is accurate up to kh 6 while the second order nonlinearity is only accurate up to kh 1 therefore there is an urgent need to develop new bt equations that have the same level of accuracy in both linear and nonlinear properties agnon et al 1999 pioneered this work in the derivation of the bt model by decoupling the linear parts from the nonlinear parts of the wave motion and the final boussinesq wave model incorporates the exact dynamic and kinematic conditions at the free surface and at the bottom with the finite expansion series of the horizontal velocity and vertical velocity components from the still water level the bt model agnon et al 1999 can be applicable to kh 6 for both linear and nonlinear properties however the acceptably accurate velocity profile is only limited to kh 2 to further improve the accuracy of velocity profiles madsen et al 2002 2003 generalized the research work of agnon et al 1999 by using the velocity variables defined at an arbitrary water depth and these velocity variables were further replaced by the pseudo velocity computational velocity the concept of the pseudo velocity was also applied in some conventional bt models to enhance the accuracy of linear dispersion gobbi et al 2000 zou 2000 liu and sun 2005 the highly nonlinear and strongly dispersive bt equations are currently hot research topics madsen et al 2002 2003 chazel et al 2009 liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 these equations lay a solid theoretical foundation for their potential numerical use in more challenging circumstances in which the conventional bt equations might fail successful numerical implementation builds a bridge between the bt theories and the practical applications for solving both scientific and engineering problems the bt models should not cause much difficulty in numerical implementation when their practical application is considered the conventional fourth order bt equations are more accurate than the second order bt equations in linear and nonlinear properties however such an improvement is a significant increase in the computational cost since the fifth order derivatives embodied in the equations requires a complex numerical scheme lynett and liu 2004b recently kirby 2016 conducted a state of the art review on the development and application of bt models and he stated that there was a great deal of ongoing use and development of low order bt models for both scientific and practical applications no matter what kinds of numerical methods are used for discretization scientists and engineers tend to choose the bt equations that are relatively simple but with an acceptable accuracy from the viewpoint of practical applications in general the bt equations with the highest spatial derivative over 3 are not preferred because the high order derivatives will inevitably cause substantial trouble for numerical discretization especially in dealing with the boundary conditions thus the bt formula with a spatial derivative over 5 has rarely been used in the literature and the corresponding two horizontal dimensional numerical models are even more scarce to avoid high order spatial derivatives lynett and liu 2004a 2004b divided the vertical water depth into multi layers and proposed the multi layer concept to derive bt equations with good dispersion and nonlinearity the multi layer approach to avoid high order derivatives in the bt equations can also be found in many studies chazel et al 2009 liu and fang 2015 2016 liu and fang 2016 the multi layer approach could be regarded as a good compromise between the accuracy of the bt equations and the operational convenience of numerical implementation using the multi layer approach lynett and liu 2004a 2004b liu et al 2018 systematically derived multi layer bt models with the highest spatial derivatives n being 2 3 and 5 in their work the linear and nonlinear characteristics of the multi layer model with third order spatial derivatives were analyzed and some numerical simulations were carried out and the high accuracy of both the linear and nonlinear properties was demonstrated as mentioned above the model with second order spatial derivatives would be preferred for numerical implementation the multi layer bt model n 2 could be regarded as the simplified version of the previous multi layer bt model liu et al 2018 because these models almost share the same derivation and analysis procedures and the multi layer bt model serves as an alternative choice when considering the numerical efficiency in practical applications since a detailed analysis of the multi layer model n 2 was not presented in liu et al 2018 its application range remains unknown thus the objectives of the present paper are to theoretically analyze the properties of the multi layer model n 2 and to investigate its performance and efficiency by conducting numerical experiments a brief introduction to the derivation of the reduced multi layer model with second order spatial derivatives is given in section 2 section 3 presents the basic theoretical analysis of the multi layer models in section 4 a vertical 2d multi layer numerical model is developed and some analytical and experimental data are used to examine the model discussions of the cpu time consumptions and some numerical performances are presented in section 5 finally the concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 a brief derivation of a multi layer boussinesq type model with second order spatial derivatives the multi layer concept for surface waves over a slowly varying seabed is shown in fig 1 in the cartesian coordinate system the x and y axes are located on the undisturbed still water level z 0 with the z axis pointing vertically upward in this figure η x y t is the surface elevation measured from z 0 h i is the thickness of the i th layer i 1 n where n is the number of layers d i represents the interfacial locations between artificial adjacent layers and z αi stands for the velocity locations the h i d i and z αi are defined as 1 h i 2 α i h d 0 0 d i j 1 i h j z α i d i d i 1 2 where α i is the dispersive coefficient which will be determined in subsection 3 1 starting from the laplace equation and using the pseudo velocity variables to replace the velocity variables defined on the middle location in each layer liu et al 2018 derived three sets of multi layer models with different order spatial derivatives the multi layer model n 2 second order spatial derivatives can be written as follows the exact kinematic and dynamics equations on the surface are 2 η t u η w η 1 η η 0 3 u t g η 1 2 u u w η 2 1 η η 0 and 4 u u η w η η where the velocity u is the horizontal gradient of the velocity potential defined on the free surface elevation η u η and w η are the horizontal velocity vector and the vertical velocity component defined on the free surface respectively and g is the acceleration due to gravity the matching conditions for the velocities at the interfacial locations z d i 1 are 5 u i x d i 1 t u i 1 x d i 1 t 6 w i x d i 1 t w i 1 x d i 1 t where i 2 n x represents x y and the velocities u i x z t and w i x z t are defined in each layer first the velocity field is expressed in terms of the velocity variables u αi w αi which are defined at the mid water depth using the taylor expansion method liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 second to further improve the accuracy of the equations the velocities u αi w αi can be replaced by the pseudo velocity variables u i and w i madsen et al 2002 2003 liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 and thus the velocity field can be written as 7 u i x z t u i 1 2 z z α i 2 1 6 α i h 2 u i z z α i z α i u i z z α i w i 1 3 z z α i α i h 1 d i 1 z α i z z α i 2 z α i w i 8 w i x z t w i 1 2 z z α i 2 1 6 α i h 2 w i z z α i z α i w i z z α i u i 1 3 z z α i α i h 1 d i 1 z α i z z α i 2 z α i u i where the relationship between the velocity group u αi w αi and the pseudo velocity group u i w i is written as 9 u α i u i 1 6 α i h 2 u i 10 w α i w i 1 6 α i h 2 w i the relationship between the velocities on the surface u η w η and the velocities on z 0 u 0 w 0 are 11 u η u 0 η w 0 1 2 η 2 u 0 12 w η w 0 η u 0 1 2 η 2 w 0 the velocities u 0 w 0 are obtained by inserting z 0 into the first layer as shown in expressions 7 and 8 we use the expressions 11 and 12 instead of the expressions 7 and 8 i 1 to calculate the velocity variables u η w η because this will enhance the accuracy of third order nonlinearity and amplitude dispersion madsen et al 2002 2003 liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 notice that if the surface elevation is below the still water level the velocity variables u 0 w 0 do not actually exist which was also observed by chazel et al 2009 in such a condition we consider them to be pseudo velocity variables the bottom kinematic boundary equation is 13 u b h w b 0 where the velocities u b and w b can be obtained by inserting z h into expressions 7 and 8 because the terms related to h 2 and 2 h in deriving the velocity fields have been neglected under the assumption of a mild slope the terms related to h in the expressions for u b are similarly neglected equations 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 and 11 13 constitute the final multi layer bt model n 2 liu et al 2018 the model is expressed in terms of the surface elevation and n 2 groups of the velocity variables x y and z directions with n groups of pseudo velocity variables u i w i and two other group of velocity variables u η w η and u 0 w 0 the total number of variables is 3n 7 in a 3d case and 2n 5 in vertical a 2d case the unique feature of the present multi layer model relative to the work presented in liu et al 2018 is that the highest order spatial derivative in the equations is only 2 3 theoretical analysis of the multi layer boussinesq type model the multi layer bt model is analyzed with respect to seven properties including linear dispersion the second order transfer function for regular waves super and sub harmonics for bichromatic waves third order harmonics amplitude dispersion linear velocity profiles and the linear shoaling amplitude liu et al 2018 here we restrict our study to the models with n 2 3 and 4 the detailed analysis process exactly follows our previous work liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 and is not repeated here for clarity 3 1 accuracy of the linear phase celerity linear dispersion is the fundamental property of a bt model the accuracy of linear phase celerity represents the ability of the bt model to capture a wave phase the dispersive coefficients used in the multi layer model are α i the maximum i is 2 3 and 4 for two layer three layer and four layer model respectively and they satisfy i 1 n α i 0 5 liu et al 2018 different values of these coefficients will lead to different linear dispersion accuracies to determine the dispersion coefficients the linear velocity dominant method vdm proposed by liu et al 2018 is used 14 f v κ 1 κ 0 κ f u 2 f w 2 d k h where the velocity errors f u κ and f w κ are identical to those proposed by madsen et al 2003 and are expressed as 15 f u k h 1 h h 0 u z u s z u s 0 2 d z and f w k h 1 h h 0 w z w s z w s 0 2 d z where u s 0 and w s 0 are the maximum horizontal and vertical velocities on the still water level respectively thus we can obtain the dispersion coefficients and they are α 1 0 172 α 2 0 328 α 1 0 07 α 2 0 154 α 3 0 276 and α 1 0 022 α 2 0 044 α 3 0 111 and α 4 0 323 for two layer n 2 three layer n 3 and four layer n 4 models respectively the phase celerity is shown in fig 2 the maximum water depth of the multi layer models is applicable to kh 19 7 54 4 and 179 3 at a 1 tolerance error in contrast the traditional bt models with padé 4 4 dispersion are only accurate to kh 6 28 at a 2 tolerance error 3 2 accuracy of the linear velocity profiles the linear velocity profiles can be directly obtained from expressions 7 and 8 and the depth integrated errors calculated by expressions 15 are shown in fig 3 the accuracy of the linear velocity profiles improves with the increase of the layer number n the applicable range is approximately kh 4 5 for n 2 to kh 14 9 for n 3 and to kh 69 7 for n 4 at a 1 tolerance error for both horizontal and vertical velocities 3 3 accuracy of second order harmonic amplitude third order harmonic amplitude and amplitude dispersion the nonlinear properties include wave wave same frequency interaction generated second and third order harmonic amplitude as well as amplitude dispersion and wave wave different frequency interaction generated sub harmonic and super harmonic amplitudes a high accuracy of these properties will enable the model to simulate a highly nonlinear wave case liu and fang 2019 fig 4 shows the theoretical results of second and third order harmonics amplitudes and amplitude dispersion the multi layer bt model is more accurate with the increase of the number of layers considering the combined effect of these three nonlinear properties the maximum water depth is applicable to kh 13 6 39 1 and 127 2 at a 1 tolerance error for two layer three layer and four layer models respectively a slightly larger error appears in the finite water depth but it is approximately less than 0 4 to sum up these good nonlinear properties are attributed to the method of decoupling the linear and nonlinear parts agnon et al 1999 the method of adopting pseudo velocity vectors gobbi et al 2000 madsen et al 2002 2003 and the multi layer concept lynett and liu 2004a 2004b 3 4 accuracy of sub harmonics and super harmonics the transfer functions are the ratios of the amplitude of the high nonlinear wave components to the linear wave amplitude and their accuracy can be checked by comparing with the analytical solutions of the stokes wave theory the second order transfer functions for the sub harmonics and super harmonics of the two three and four layer models are plotted in fig 5 we can see that the multi layer model can present accurate harmonic amplitudes generated by wave wave interaction the application range has been clearly shown to increase with the increase in the number of layers the excellent properties should be attributed to the approaches used in previous studies agnon et al 1999 madsen et al 2002 lynett and liu 2004a 2004b and this has also been demonstrated in other versions of the multi layer bt model with third order spatial derivatives liu and fang 2016 liu et al 2018 3 5 the accuracy of the linear shoaling property the linear shoaling gradient and shoaling amplitude of the multi layer equations are shown in fig 6 they are in good agreement with the analytical solutions at a 1 tolerance error in the linear shoaling amplitude the application water depth is kh 15 8 41 7 and 143 9 for the two three and four layer models respectively 3 6 summary of the linear and nonlinear properties we summarize the theoretical results of the multi layer model the order of highest spatial derivatives n 2 and 3 with respect to the linear and nonlinear properties and the maximum water depth kh max at a 1 tolerance error is listed in table 1 it can be seen that kh max increases with the number of layers given a fixed multilayer model kh max for linear dispersion is the largest followed by the linear shoaling amplitude as amplitude dispersion ω 13 second order harmonics a 2 third order harmonics a 3 and linear velocity profiles if the surface elevation is the only target of concern in wave evolution the third order harmonics a 3 is the main restriction and kh max is 13 6 for the two layer model if both the surface elevation and interior wave kinematics are issues of concern the velocity profiles are the main restriction and kh max is 4 5 for the two layer model in other words considering all the properties kh max is 4 5 14 9 and 69 7 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively for comparison the theoretical results of the multi layer model with n 3 liu et al 2018 are also given in table 1 the application range of the multi layer model n 3 is indeed larger than that of the reduced multi layer model n 2 but considering the numerical efficiency which will be shown in subsection 5 2 the multi layer model n 2 is also an alternative choice for practical simulations 4 a vertical two dimension numerical model and numerical verifications 4 1 a brief introduction of the vertical two dimensional multi layer model the present multi layer model is the simplified version of the model of liu et al 2018 the highest order spatial derivative is 2 which is much more convenient than the previous numerical discretization because the highest order spatial derivative in liu et al 2018 and liu and fang 2019 is 3 following the same process used in liu et al 2018 and liu and fang 2019 we can also solve the present vertical two dimensional numerical model accordingly the main process is similar to that proposed by kirby et al 1998 for solving variables such as the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity at the free surface other variables can be obtained according to the approaches used in liu and fang 2019 a finite difference method with a regular mesh is used to approximate the spatial derivatives a composite fourth order predictor corrector adams bashforth moulton integration scheme is employed for time integration the convergence of the iterations is accelerated by using an over relaxation technique kirby et al 1998 in the following numerical experiments the internal wave generation method hsiao et al 2005 and the boundary incident wave conditions are incorporated in these models two or one sponge layers are employed in the computation domain to absorb the reflected waves according to different wave generation methods and a sponge layer that is at least two wavelengths long is adopted in present study 4 2 numerical verifications to examine the fundamental ability of multi layer bt numerical models we conduct three sets of numerical simulations as follows 4 2 1 linear wave shoaling from deep water to shallow water to examine the linear shoaling performance of the present two three and four layer models numerical experiments of a linear wave propagating over a mild slope bottom are conducted in these experiments the linear regular waves with a period of t 6 4 s propagate from a deep water depth of h 1 101 782 m kh 10 to a shallow one of h 2 0 623 m kh 0 25 and the connection of the two water depths is an infinitely smooth bottom profile fuhrman 2004 bingham and zhang 2007 benoit et al 2017 liu and fang 2019 which is written as 16 h x h 1 h 1 h 2 2 1 tanh sin π x 1 l 1 2 x 1 l 2 where the length l is 3180 m x 1 x l 2 x b and we use the starting location at x b 270 m in a numerical flume with a total length of 3700 m the wave generation method hsiao et al 2005 is used with the centerline located at x s 150 m and the sponge layer width is 140 m at the left boundary and 40 m at the right boundary a temporal step of 0 05 s and a spatial step of 0 25 m are used in these three models fig 7 shows a comparison between the calculated surface elevations from the numerical results and the linear shoaling amplitude envelope from the analytical solution at the time t 200 t in general there is no clear difference in the surface elevations computed from the multi layer models and the agreement is good which demonstrates that the models can accurately capture the linear shoaling process to show the difference we use the relative amplitude error 1 a a s which is 0 0007 0 0011 and 0 0013 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively this error in the numerical simulations is slightly larger than the abovementioned theoretical error and it might be caused by the reflections from the boundary and the bathymetry meanwhile the linear wavelength calculated from the surface elevation in fig 7 is compared with that of a linear stokes wave the relative wavelength error 1 l n l t is approximately 0 0002 in deep water and 0 0005 in shallow water for n 2 3 and 4 which numerically demonstrates that the present three models show a high accuracy in linear dispersion 4 2 2 regular wave evolution over a submerged breakwater the evolution of a regular wave over a submerged breakwater is a complicated physical process that includes 1 a weakly nonlinear shoaling and de shoaling process 2 wave wave interaction generated nonlinear energy transfer among different order harmonics and 3 a physical phenomenon of phase locked and unlocked processes the shoaling process occurs after the wave propagates over the front slope from the constant water depth before it arrives at the top of the submerged breakwater and with the phase locked process when the waves propagate down the back slope the waves undergo a de shoaling process and a de phase process each wave component travels at its own speed the nonlinear wave wave interaction is apparent over the constant water depth on the submerged breakwater to accurately simulate the full physical process a phase resolving numerical model must possess high accuracy in combined properties such as amplitude dispersion shoaling amplitude and high nonlinear amplitudes and velocity profiles the physical experiment is usually used to test phase resolving models the laboratory data from the physical experiment by luth et al 1994 are used to examine the multi layer model the incident regular wave period t is 2 02 s kh 0 673 and the wave height h is 0 02 m h l 0 0054 the spatial and temporal steps are 0 03 m and 0 01 s respectively and the two layer three layer and four layer models are used in the simulations the internal wave generation method hsiao et al 2005 with the centerline x s 10 m is used in the numerical simulations the computed surface elevations compared with the experimental data are plotted in fig 8 the agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data is fairly good thereby validating the three models furthermore the surface elevations and velocities on the surface elevations along the entire numerical flume at t 80 s from the two layer three layer and four layer models are given in fig 9 a and an enlarged picture is shown in fig 9 b overall the surface elevations and velocities on the surface elevations from the two layer model agree well with those from the three layer and four layer models 4 2 3 a focused wave group evolution over a constant water depth the phase focusing method is usually used to generate a large crest of the focusing wave group and numerous physical experiments and numerical simulations have been reported baldock et al 1996 carried out a series of experiments to investigate the spatial temporal focusing of a wide range of unidirectional water waves on constant deep and shallow water depths the incident wave group consists of a number of wave components the motion of each component and their nonlinear interactions result in a very complicated physical process to accurately capture the whole process a numerical model must possess high accuracy in linear dispersion and nonlinear properties such as the third order nonlinear amplitude and amplitude dispersion liu and fang 2019 the data set collected by baldock et al 1996 has been widely used for validating hobem a quadratic higher order boundary element model based on the potential theory ning et al 2009 a multi layer non hydrostatic model ai et al 2014 and some highly dispersive and highly nonlinear bt models fuhrman and madsen 2009 liu and fang 2019 the wave groups of a broad band covering the range of 0 714 hz f 1 667 hz case b55 kh 1 568 7 825 and a narrow frequency band covering the range of 0 833 hz f 1 25 hz case d55 kh 2 026 4 403 from the physical experiments baldock et al 1996 are used to verify the present models in these cases the wave group consists of n 29 individual wave components with equal wave amplitudes the total wave amplitude is 55 mm and equal period intervals additional details can be found in baldock et al 1996 in d55 the local wave steepness h l at the focusing position is approximately 0 097 h 0 1163 m l 1 2 m as mentioned in liu and fang 2019 and thus d55 represents a highly nonlinear wave case the computational length is set to be 20 m and the water depth is 0 7 m the linearized wave group with the first order stokes wave solution for each wave component is imposed at x 0 m and a 5 m long sponge layer is applied at the end of the computational domain the temporal and spatial steps are 0 01 s and 0 04 m respectively the surface elevation comparisons from the two layer three layer and four layer models and the experimental data from baldock et al 1996 are shown in fig 10 and the computed horizontal velocity profile at the largest wave crest location is shown in fig 11 for comparison the results of ai et al 2014 are also plotted in these two figures as shown in fig 10 we can roughly see that there is no great difference between the results from our three models and the results from ai et al 2014 they are all in good agreement with the experimental data from fig 11 we can see that all the simulated horizontal velocities are consistent with the experimental results and the apparent difference between the results from our multi layer models and the results of ai et al 2014 is that their model cannot present the velocity results near the free surface of the bottom because the number of simulated horizontal velocity points along the vertical coordinate is determined by the number of layers adopted in their model overall both the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity profile at the focused point calculated from the three models are in good agreement with the experimental data demonstrating that the multi layer model indeed possesses high accuracy in linear and nonlinear properties all simulations were conducted using an intel r core tm i7 7700 processor running at a clock speed of 3 6 ghz for the case of d55 the physical time is 40 s with a space grid number of 3000 and a time step number of 10 000 the cpu time is 28 95 s 34 75 s and 44 58 s for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively 5 discussion 5 1 highly nonlinear regular wave cases as described in subsection 3 6 the multi layer model is mostly restricted to the accuracy of the linear velocity profiles the linear horizontal velocity profile is only accurate up to kh 5 1 within a 1 error for the two layer model thus the two layer model is not apparently attractive in deep water e g kh 10 if the accuracy of the velocity profile is considered only the three layer and four layer models are used in this subsection the stream function solution is used to examine the three layer and four layer models the wave period is 6 0 s and the wave height is 6 0 m three cases with different water depths are shown in table 2 the nonlinear wave steepness h l 6 61 703 is approximately 0 097 in each case the computational domain is 10l l is the nonlinear wavelength and a wave generation zone fuhrman 2004 covering 0 2l and a sponge layer covering 8 10l are imposed at the incident and end boundaries respectively a spatial step of l 32 and a temporal step of t 120 are used in the numerical simulations for case 3 the simulated surface elevations the horizontal velocity and the vertical velocity on the surface elevation are shown in fig 12 the horizontal velocity profiles at the wave crest are plotted in fig 13 as shown in fig 12 case 3 the simulated horizontal and vertical velocities on the surface elevation from the three layer model show no apparent error compared to those from the four layer model however this is not true for the horizontal velocity profile as shown in fig 13 with the increase of the non dimensional water depth the three layer model shows a great error in the horizontal velocity profile therefore the three layer model cannot be applied to model kh 36 66 5 2 efficiency comparison to compare the efficiency of the models with different order spatial derivatives we use both the present two layer model n 2 and the two layer model n 3 from liu and fang 2016 to simulate bichromatic wave evolution case b39 in hsiao et al 2005 in a 300 m long wave flume with a constant water depth of 3 5 m in the thl of national cheng kung university of taiwan in case b39 the bichromatic wave is composed of two wave periods of 1 8 s k 1 h 4 347 and 2 2 s k 2 h 2 927 with an equal wave height of 0 15 m h l 1 0 02966 h l 2 0 01997 in the numerical simulations the temporal and spatial steps are 0 04 s and 0 1 m respectively with a grid number of 3000 and time steps of 10 000 the physical time is 400 s for the present two layer model n 2 the cpu time to finish the simulation was 1494 16 s while it was 2285 81 s for the two layer model n 3 and the efficiency improved by 34 6 6 conclusions a theoretical analysis is conducted on the multi layer boussinesq type model with second order spatial derivatives a finite difference scheme is proposed to solve the vertical 2d multi layer model on a regular uniform grid system a composite fourth order adams bashforth moulton predictor and corrector scheme is used for time marching the numerical models are validated through this research the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the high accuracy of the linear and nonlinear properties for a multi layer model can be obtained as the layer number increases considering the comprehensive performance the maximum water depth is 4 5 14 9 and 69 7 for the two layer three layer and four layer models respectively 2 the linear shoaling amplitudes are computed by the multi layer models n 2 3 and 4 and good agreement is observed which reflects the high accuracy of the shoaling gradient and linear dispersion in multi layer models 3 the wave evolution over a submerged bar is numerically reproduced by the multi layer models n 2 3 and 4 and the good agreement between the computed surface elevation and the experiment data show that the whole evolution process of a weakly nonlinear regular wave is well demonstrated numerically 4 the computed surface elevation and interior wave velocity profiles are consistent with the experimental data of baldock et al 1996 and with the stream function solution highly nonlinear wave cases in subsection 5 1 this result shows that the multi layer model possesses high accuracy in the linear and nonlinear properties since the wave steepness h l in case d55 and in the three cases in subsection 5 1 is nearly 0 1 5 compared with the two layer boussinesq type model with third order spatial derivatives liu and fang 2016 the cpu time of the present two layer model with second order spatial derivatives decreased by nearly 1 3 this result partially demonstrates the efficiency of the present multi layer model with n 2 over that of the multi layer model with n 3 acknowledgements the

22421,this paper presents the scantling optimization of a typical internal turret area for mooring system of fpso under full loaded and ballast conditions the thickness variables are determined by minimizing the weight of the turret area subjected to yeild stress constraints the radial basis function rbf model is built as a surrogate for computationally expensive finite element method fem analysis to improve the efficiency of the optimization the evolutionary strategy is applied to the optimization a turret area structure model has been taken as a verification model the optimization result shows the advantage of achieving optimal thickness distribution of the turret that minimizes the weight under actural engineering constraints keywords fpso turret area scantling optimization rbf evolutionary strategy 1 introduction floating production storage and offloading fpso units are some of the popular production platforms used in offshore oil exploitation since they have the main advantages of flexibiliy of installation and relocation great storage capacity sufficient deck area and load capacity for needed prodcution equipment song et al 2011 as the offshore industry continues to operate in increasing water depth the usage of fpsos are growing one reason is that for fpsos the oil export can be performed by shuttle tankers instead of pipeline infrastructure which cost high tippee and beckman 2016 barton et al 2016 thus fpsos are feasible for ultra deep water depths and are profitable for moderate depths compared with fixed offshore structures the overall structure of fpso itself is generally based on oil tanker which is not depth sensitive while the riser and mooring system remain the mainly challenges related to greater water depths for mooring system the internal turret mooring system is typically used to allow weathervaning according to environmental loads england et al 2001 the internal turret mooring system includes a rotating turret which is integrated into the hull structure at the bow of the vessel mooring lines are extended out from the bottom of the turret as the turret transfers the loads from risers and mooring lines to the vessel structures interacting with turret are always reinforcing designed also a calculation using finite element fe method is recommended to verify the strength of the structure a number of studies has been focused on strength analysis of fpso turret area lee et al lee et al 2014 investigated the interaction of fpso hull structure with the turret system utilizing the linear gap function to represent the nonlinear contact behavior between the hull and turret structures cao et al cao et al 2013 studied the local strength of internal turret structure with fine mesh model considering the proper loads from hull beam and mooring forces xu and xiao xu et al 2004 carried out the finite element calculating of the local parts of the turret system vålandsmyr barton et al 2016 calculated the hydrodynamic loads and structural response of the fpso turret area interacting with the hull in his master s thesis as shown above the nonlinear fem for calculation of turret area is computationally very demanding however the expense of direct use of fem in optimization remains non trivial as several hundreds analysis of different variants are needed during optimization to solve such a problem surrogate models are often applied as approximations of expensive computer analysis codes simpson et al 2001 forrester and keane 2009 prebeg et al 2014 actually the surrogate techniques has been widely used in support of design process by model approximation design space exploration problem formulation and optimization support simpson et al 2001 among the various kinds of surrogate models rbf model has been proved as a good choice for approximating deterministic computer models and has been applied for structure optimization including shape and topology optimization wang et al 2006 optimization of doubly curved laminated composite natural frequencies tornabene et al 2013 etc in this study we focus on the scantling optimization of a typical internal turret area structure the rbf model is applied as a surrogate for fem analysis to improve the efficiency of the optimization the present work is organized as follows section 2 states the optimization problem of the turret area including the basic information of the turret and the decision of design variables 2 section 3 introduces the detailed fem analysis method of turret area consisting of fe modeling load cases and stress reslut of the original structure model section 4 describes the application of rbf model to approximate the stresses of the structure section 5 performs the optimization process on the structure and discusses the typical results of the example finally section 6 draws the conclusion 2 problem statement 2 1 description of the turret area fpso is designed for the production storage and export of hydrocarbon products in remote or deep water regions and the vessel is single moored up by the turret system to specified water depth according to the oil field environment the turret system is seen as a self contained module which integrates the mooring system the installation equipment the fluid transfer system and subsea control system into one cylinder compartment england et al 2001 the turret area discussed locates between the no 1 cargo oil tank and fore peak tank shown as fig 1 in order to provide the function that the mooring and riser systems can be quickly disconnected from the turret a so called buoy is applied the buoy is a conical shape that mates smoothly into a mating cone located at the bottom of the turret in the vessel hull fig 1 shows the connection area of the buoy and the mating cone the vertical radial web frames are arranged between the mating cone and the turret system cylinder which ensure a proper load transfer and support stiffness around the buoy 2 2 optimization problem of the turret area in general the basic elements of an optimization problem consist of design variables objective function and design constraints the design variables are chosen according to the characteristic of the structure as the design variables are set as the input data during the optimization the availability of the input data should be considered commonly the thickness of plate and the main scantlings are available for design variables because it is easy for them to parameterization and extraction for turret area structure all the thicknesses of plates are selected as the variables and minimum weight of turret area constitutes the objective different types of constraints are considered including technological constraints that define the upper and lower bounds of the design variables structural constraints related to safety such as yield stress stability requirements etc in this paper the yield stresses of each component of turret area are considered as the structural constraints as the complication of loads from mooring system and sea environment in the turret area direct calculation by fem is required to obtain the yield stress distribution of the turret area however the direct analysis method can be expensive and time consuming it is not efficient to apply the analysis method directly during the optimization process because several hundred analysis of different variables are demand in optimization hence the rbf model which is one of the popular surrogate models simpson et al 2001 is implemented to approximate the fem analysis of the structure fig 2 shows the main factors of an optimization problem and points out the specific contents of each factor in the optimization of turret area 2 3 design variables the thicknesses of the plates of turret area are chosen as the design variables as listed in table 1 and the positions of the plates corresponding to the thickness property is shown in fig 3 3 fem analysis of turret area 3 1 finite element modeling as mentioned above an example of an internal turret type fpso is to be utilized to investigate the further developed methods for the optimization patran nastran software is applied for fe modeling and analysis in order to accommodate the effect of global loads the fea model for fpso turret area is extended over in length of three tanks as shown in fig 4 including fore peak tank turret area and no 1 cargo oil tank also the cartesian coordinate system is identified with origin at center line ship base line and aft bulkhead of no 1 cargo oil tank x is positive forwards y is positive port z is positive upwards all primary load carrying members are modeled following the bureau veritas rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b the model contains 98446 elements consisting of shell and beam element types the mesh size is defined as the stiffener spacing mechanical material properties used for fea are summarized in table 2 the mesh of turret area are shown in fig 5 the boundary condition is set at the bulkhead of no 1 cargo oil tank which is far away from the turret area to avoid the boundary influence on the analysis results 3 2 load cases the loading conditions of strength analysis are considered according to the ship class rules loading analysis motion analyses etc song et al 2011 according to bv rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b the yield analysis of turret area should be carried out for two draughts i e minimum draught and maximum draught hence two loading conditions including full loaded and ballast condition are considered global loads such as the hull girder bending moment and motion induced acceleration act on the hull structure while local loads caused by the internal cargo and ballast water external sea pressures and hydrodynamic act directly on the local structure for turret area the mooring loads are mainly considered the extreme mooring loads including r h v forces are taken into account for five directions of 0 45 90 135 180 which are associated with the corresponding wave headings fig 6 shows the schematic of mooring loads the v force is applied with vertical direction in mating cones averagely the r and h forces are applied with 5 directions to the vessel longitudinal axis shown as fig 6 b and the reaction forces in way of the bearings are distributed according to the bureau veritas rules bureau veritas 2016a i e over an 120 angle with a cosine distribution fig 7 shows the r and h forces of the mooring load at one load case added in the buoy cone totally five load cases corresponding to five wave headings and direction of mooring load are considered for each load condition listed as table 3 3 3 analysis method and results the yield stress of turret area is calculated for each load case stated in section 3 2 based on linear analysis the stress distribution for each load is obtained the von mises stress is proposed to evaluate the yield stress of the structure during the optimization the maximum von mises stress among all the load cases under each loading condition is extracted and listed in table 4 as listed in table 4 the structure has the maximum stress under lc5 full loaded condition wave heading 180 fig 8 a shows the stress contour of turret area under full loaded condition with wave heading of 180 and fig 8 b shows the stress distribution under ballast condition with wave heading of 180 4 approximation of the stress 4 1 surrogate model as stated above single fem analysis of one design solution takes about 7 min optimization demands several hundreds analysis of different variants the relationship between design variables and stresses of the structure is established by surrogate model which is a method for obtaining mathematical model that approximates the functional relationship between the input and output variables the surrogate modeling actually evolves from classical design of experiments doe theory montgomery 2001 in which polynomial functions are used as surrogate models prebeg et al 2014 steps necessary for generating a surrogate model includes 1 training data selection the training data are typically determined using experiment design methods such as factorial design central composite design latin hypercube sampling etc myers 2009 a good experimental design is essential to simultaneously reduce the effect of noise and bias errors tushar et al 2008 in our study the optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs method jin et al 2005 is proposed for sampling in olhs method the combination of factor levels for each factor is optimized rather than randomly uniformly divided 2 execution of simulations each sample selected by 1 is analyzed by fea to obtain response values according to section 3 3 creation of selected surrogate model firstly a surrogate model type and corresponding fitting method are chosen which depends mostly on characteristic of physical phenomenon that is approximated prebeg et al 2014 in engineering field some surrogate models have been widely used consisting of respond surface model rsm kriging rbf artificial neural network ann in this study the rbf model is applied which has been developed for scattered multivariate data interpolation wang et al 2006 powell 1992 rbf is a type of neural network employing a hidden layer of radial units and an output layer of linear units devanathan and koch 2011 and it is proved as a good choice for approximating deterministic computer models 4 validation of surrogate model adequacy a group of samples are randomly created for validation four error type methods are applied for error and reliability analysis including relative average absolute error raae relative maximum absolute error rmae root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r 2 myers 2009 typically when all the error values achieve the acceptance levels it is concluded that the surrogate model meet the requirements of the optimization four error values are calculated as follows 1 r a a e i 1 p f x i f ˆ x i p σ 2 r m a e max 1 i p f x i f ˆ x i σ 3 r m s e i 1 p f x i f ˆ x i 2 p 4 r 2 1 i 1 p f x i f ˆ x i 2 i 1 p f x i f x i 2 where p is the number of validation point f x i is the actual value obtained by simulation at the ith validation point f ˆ x i is the predicted value calculated from the surrogate model at the ith validation point f x i is the mean of actual values of validation points σ is the standard deviation of actual values of validation points 4 2 application of the rbf model to turret stress approximation the rbf model is applied for turret stress approximation all the design variables shown in table 1 are taken as the input parameters and the maximum stresses of the turret area are defined as the output parameters the yield stress is evaluated separately for different positions of the structure as different materials are used in different positions two materials are applied in the example so two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ b r a c k e t are defined as the output parameters then the training and validation data are chosen the accuracy of the rbf model directly depends on the number of training samples at least 2n 1 training samples are required for initialization of the rbf model where n is the number of input parameters devanathan and koch 2011 hence the minimum required number of sample in this study is 15 with 7 input parameters in addition 100 training sample is recommended to obtain more accurate models as a result 100 samples table a 1 are created by olhs as training data 50 samples table a 2 are randomly created for validation the information of all samples are listed in appendix a the yield stress calculation of each sample is performed on 40 core processor with 32g of ram for approximately 7 min then the rbf models are built using the approximation model available in isight and the error analysis is performed table 5 lists the error analysis results of rbf models according to table 5 all values of the error are at acceptable level in addition fig 9 presents the fitness of the two output parameters the abscissa is the calculated stress values of the design points and the ordinate is the predicted values by the rbf model the closer the scatter points approach to the diagonal line the better the correlation between the rbf model and the design point is indicating the better establishment of input output relationship model in fig 9 it is seen that the scatter points of the calculated stress values and the predicted stress values are approximately distributed around the diagonal line therefore the rbf models fit the design points well from the result of rbf models the effects of x6 and x7 on the two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ b r a c k e t are much more significant than other 5 input variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 fig 10 shows the 3d graphs of two output parameters with respect to x 6 and x 7 5 application of optimum design on the fpso turret 5 1 definition of the optimization module as stated above a typical internal turret area of the fpso is taken as an example to validate the optimization method 7 variables as listed in table 1 are selected as design variables considering the plate thickness of the structure is discrete in the practical engineering application all the design variables are set as integer during the optimization minimum weight of the turret area constitutes the objective considered in this application structural constraints that limit stress to avoid yielding are considered as the main design constraints according to criteria of allowable stresses in bv rules xu et al 2004 and the difference on material property two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ b r a c k e t should not exceed the allowable stresses besides the technological constraints that provide the upper and lower bounds of the design variables are added therefore the optimization model can be specified as table 6 5 2 the evolutionary strategy the evolutionary strategy available in isight is selected for optimization as it has been proved well suited for non linear and discontinuous design spaces rechenberg 1973 schwefel 1977 the evolutionary strategies were first proposed by bienert rechenberg and schwefel in the 1960s at the techanical universtiy of berlin tub in germany bäck 1996 currently the commonly used evolutionary strategy is the μ λ e s bäck 1996 muc and muc wierzgoń 2012 which is therefore applied in our study similar to other evolutionary computation methods e g genetic algorithms evolutionary programming genetic programming the basic operations of the μ λ e s include mutation recombination and selection bäck 1996 muc and muc wierzgoń 2012 simon 2013 each individual in μ λ e s consists of two parts the object variable x and standard deviations σ expressing as 5 x σ x 1 x 2 x i x n σ 1 σ 2 σ i σ n where n is the problem dimension the parent individuals x σ are modified by mutating the standard deviations using a multiplicative logarithmic normally distributed process which expressed as follows 6 x x n 0 σ 7 σ σ e n 0 δ σ where x σ is the offspring individual n 0 σ denotes a realization of a normally distributed random variable array having expectation zero and standard deviation σ for recombination a series of different recombination mechanisms are recently applied in es in our study the operators are sexual which act on two individuals randomly chosen from the parent population for selection best individuals out of the offspring are selected to form the next parent generation in the μ λ e s the parents of the next generation are selected as the best μ individuals from among the λ children 5 3 optimization results and discussion the optimization is performed by establishing an automatic optimization platform based on isight in which stress analysis with patran nastran rbf model evolutionary strategy and automatic edit programming are integrated according to schwefel s research 1 5 es is recommended in the original implementation the prototype is chosen as a starting point the standard deviation σ i 0 are initialized as 3 as indicated in section 5 2 search points in es are object parameter vectors so that the fitness function is in principle identical to the objective function the maximum iteration is given as 100 times which is a useful setting bäck 1996 best of the children in each iteration is plotted in fig 11 showing the iteration history of the optimization and the history values of corresponding stress constraints are drawn in fig 12 the feasible solutions are marked with blue dot while unfeasible solutions with red dot the optimum solution marked with green triangle in fig 11 is obtained after 80 iterations the green line in fig 11 shows the improvement of the iterations it can be seen that there is no improved solutions during the remaining 20 iterations proving the optimum solution in 80th iteration is acceptable the optimum solution is compared with prototype as listed in table 7 5 4 validation of optimization results and rbf models in order to validate the accuracy of the rbf model and the optimization results the optimum case is analyzed by fem method as stated in section 3 the stresses calculated by fem method are compared to the predicted values by rbf models as listed in table 8 it can be seen that the errors between the predicted values and the calculated values are small proving the efficiency of the rbf model fig 13 shows the thickness distribution of optimal case fig 14 shows the von mises stress overview of turret area under lc5 in which the maximum stress occurred moreover in order to prove the rapidity of the optimization method the direct optimization without rbf is performed under the same hardware and software condition the optimized solution with the objective function value of 140889 kg is obtained which is 0 59 higher than the rbf based optimization however the optimization time of direct optimization is approximately 12 h which is relatively much longer than the rbf based method 27 min table 9 lists the comparison of objective and optimization duration between rbf based method and direct optimization 6 conclusion this paper explores a scantling optimization approach to minimize the weight of internal turret area of a fpso subject to yield stress constraints under the full loaded and ballast conditions the yield strength of turret area is analyzed by fem direct calculation according to bv rules in order to effectively reduces the computational time necessary for fem analysis and improves the efficiency of the optimization the rbf method is employed to approximate the maximum stress of the structure among all the load cases the response of rbf model is obtained from fem direct calculation the optimization is performed by applying the evolutionary strategy a typical inner turret area of fpso is taken as an example for scantling optimization as a result the optimal case is achieved with weight reduction of 10 2 the stress results of the optimal case obtained from rbf method are validated through fem analysis proving the reliability of the rbf model the analysis progress and optimization result show the feasibility and reliability of the analysis method and optimization strategy which are well suited for use in

22421,this paper presents the scantling optimization of a typical internal turret area for mooring system of fpso under full loaded and ballast conditions the thickness variables are determined by minimizing the weight of the turret area subjected to yeild stress constraints the radial basis function rbf model is built as a surrogate for computationally expensive finite element method fem analysis to improve the efficiency of the optimization the evolutionary strategy is applied to the optimization a turret area structure model has been taken as a verification model the optimization result shows the advantage of achieving optimal thickness distribution of the turret that minimizes the weight under actural engineering constraints keywords fpso turret area scantling optimization rbf evolutionary strategy 1 introduction floating production storage and offloading fpso units are some of the popular production platforms used in offshore oil exploitation since they have the main advantages of flexibiliy of installation and relocation great storage capacity sufficient deck area and load capacity for needed prodcution equipment song et al 2011 as the offshore industry continues to operate in increasing water depth the usage of fpsos are growing one reason is that for fpsos the oil export can be performed by shuttle tankers instead of pipeline infrastructure which cost high tippee and beckman 2016 barton et al 2016 thus fpsos are feasible for ultra deep water depths and are profitable for moderate depths compared with fixed offshore structures the overall structure of fpso itself is generally based on oil tanker which is not depth sensitive while the riser and mooring system remain the mainly challenges related to greater water depths for mooring system the internal turret mooring system is typically used to allow weathervaning according to environmental loads england et al 2001 the internal turret mooring system includes a rotating turret which is integrated into the hull structure at the bow of the vessel mooring lines are extended out from the bottom of the turret as the turret transfers the loads from risers and mooring lines to the vessel structures interacting with turret are always reinforcing designed also a calculation using finite element fe method is recommended to verify the strength of the structure a number of studies has been focused on strength analysis of fpso turret area lee et al lee et al 2014 investigated the interaction of fpso hull structure with the turret system utilizing the linear gap function to represent the nonlinear contact behavior between the hull and turret structures cao et al cao et al 2013 studied the local strength of internal turret structure with fine mesh model considering the proper loads from hull beam and mooring forces xu and xiao xu et al 2004 carried out the finite element calculating of the local parts of the turret system vålandsmyr barton et al 2016 calculated the hydrodynamic loads and structural response of the fpso turret area interacting with the hull in his master s thesis as shown above the nonlinear fem for calculation of turret area is computationally very demanding however the expense of direct use of fem in optimization remains non trivial as several hundreds analysis of different variants are needed during optimization to solve such a problem surrogate models are often applied as approximations of expensive computer analysis codes simpson et al 2001 forrester and keane 2009 prebeg et al 2014 actually the surrogate techniques has been widely used in support of design process by model approximation design space exploration problem formulation and optimization support simpson et al 2001 among the various kinds of surrogate models rbf model has been proved as a good choice for approximating deterministic computer models and has been applied for structure optimization including shape and topology optimization wang et al 2006 optimization of doubly curved laminated composite natural frequencies tornabene et al 2013 etc in this study we focus on the scantling optimization of a typical internal turret area structure the rbf model is applied as a surrogate for fem analysis to improve the efficiency of the optimization the present work is organized as follows section 2 states the optimization problem of the turret area including the basic information of the turret and the decision of design variables 2 section 3 introduces the detailed fem analysis method of turret area consisting of fe modeling load cases and stress reslut of the original structure model section 4 describes the application of rbf model to approximate the stresses of the structure section 5 performs the optimization process on the structure and discusses the typical results of the example finally section 6 draws the conclusion 2 problem statement 2 1 description of the turret area fpso is designed for the production storage and export of hydrocarbon products in remote or deep water regions and the vessel is single moored up by the turret system to specified water depth according to the oil field environment the turret system is seen as a self contained module which integrates the mooring system the installation equipment the fluid transfer system and subsea control system into one cylinder compartment england et al 2001 the turret area discussed locates between the no 1 cargo oil tank and fore peak tank shown as fig 1 in order to provide the function that the mooring and riser systems can be quickly disconnected from the turret a so called buoy is applied the buoy is a conical shape that mates smoothly into a mating cone located at the bottom of the turret in the vessel hull fig 1 shows the connection area of the buoy and the mating cone the vertical radial web frames are arranged between the mating cone and the turret system cylinder which ensure a proper load transfer and support stiffness around the buoy 2 2 optimization problem of the turret area in general the basic elements of an optimization problem consist of design variables objective function and design constraints the design variables are chosen according to the characteristic of the structure as the design variables are set as the input data during the optimization the availability of the input data should be considered commonly the thickness of plate and the main scantlings are available for design variables because it is easy for them to parameterization and extraction for turret area structure all the thicknesses of plates are selected as the variables and minimum weight of turret area constitutes the objective different types of constraints are considered including technological constraints that define the upper and lower bounds of the design variables structural constraints related to safety such as yield stress stability requirements etc in this paper the yield stresses of each component of turret area are considered as the structural constraints as the complication of loads from mooring system and sea environment in the turret area direct calculation by fem is required to obtain the yield stress distribution of the turret area however the direct analysis method can be expensive and time consuming it is not efficient to apply the analysis method directly during the optimization process because several hundred analysis of different variables are demand in optimization hence the rbf model which is one of the popular surrogate models simpson et al 2001 is implemented to approximate the fem analysis of the structure fig 2 shows the main factors of an optimization problem and points out the specific contents of each factor in the optimization of turret area 2 3 design variables the thicknesses of the plates of turret area are chosen as the design variables as listed in table 1 and the positions of the plates corresponding to the thickness property is shown in fig 3 3 fem analysis of turret area 3 1 finite element modeling as mentioned above an example of an internal turret type fpso is to be utilized to investigate the further developed methods for the optimization patran nastran software is applied for fe modeling and analysis in order to accommodate the effect of global loads the fea model for fpso turret area is extended over in length of three tanks as shown in fig 4 including fore peak tank turret area and no 1 cargo oil tank also the cartesian coordinate system is identified with origin at center line ship base line and aft bulkhead of no 1 cargo oil tank x is positive forwards y is positive port z is positive upwards all primary load carrying members are modeled following the bureau veritas rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b the model contains 98446 elements consisting of shell and beam element types the mesh size is defined as the stiffener spacing mechanical material properties used for fea are summarized in table 2 the mesh of turret area are shown in fig 5 the boundary condition is set at the bulkhead of no 1 cargo oil tank which is far away from the turret area to avoid the boundary influence on the analysis results 3 2 load cases the loading conditions of strength analysis are considered according to the ship class rules loading analysis motion analyses etc song et al 2011 according to bv rules bureau veritas 2016a 2016b the yield analysis of turret area should be carried out for two draughts i e minimum draught and maximum draught hence two loading conditions including full loaded and ballast condition are considered global loads such as the hull girder bending moment and motion induced acceleration act on the hull structure while local loads caused by the internal cargo and ballast water external sea pressures and hydrodynamic act directly on the local structure for turret area the mooring loads are mainly considered the extreme mooring loads including r h v forces are taken into account for five directions of 0 45 90 135 180 which are associated with the corresponding wave headings fig 6 shows the schematic of mooring loads the v force is applied with vertical direction in mating cones averagely the r and h forces are applied with 5 directions to the vessel longitudinal axis shown as fig 6 b and the reaction forces in way of the bearings are distributed according to the bureau veritas rules bureau veritas 2016a i e over an 120 angle with a cosine distribution fig 7 shows the r and h forces of the mooring load at one load case added in the buoy cone totally five load cases corresponding to five wave headings and direction of mooring load are considered for each load condition listed as table 3 3 3 analysis method and results the yield stress of turret area is calculated for each load case stated in section 3 2 based on linear analysis the stress distribution for each load is obtained the von mises stress is proposed to evaluate the yield stress of the structure during the optimization the maximum von mises stress among all the load cases under each loading condition is extracted and listed in table 4 as listed in table 4 the structure has the maximum stress under lc5 full loaded condition wave heading 180 fig 8 a shows the stress contour of turret area under full loaded condition with wave heading of 180 and fig 8 b shows the stress distribution under ballast condition with wave heading of 180 4 approximation of the stress 4 1 surrogate model as stated above single fem analysis of one design solution takes about 7 min optimization demands several hundreds analysis of different variants the relationship between design variables and stresses of the structure is established by surrogate model which is a method for obtaining mathematical model that approximates the functional relationship between the input and output variables the surrogate modeling actually evolves from classical design of experiments doe theory montgomery 2001 in which polynomial functions are used as surrogate models prebeg et al 2014 steps necessary for generating a surrogate model includes 1 training data selection the training data are typically determined using experiment design methods such as factorial design central composite design latin hypercube sampling etc myers 2009 a good experimental design is essential to simultaneously reduce the effect of noise and bias errors tushar et al 2008 in our study the optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs method jin et al 2005 is proposed for sampling in olhs method the combination of factor levels for each factor is optimized rather than randomly uniformly divided 2 execution of simulations each sample selected by 1 is analyzed by fea to obtain response values according to section 3 3 creation of selected surrogate model firstly a surrogate model type and corresponding fitting method are chosen which depends mostly on characteristic of physical phenomenon that is approximated prebeg et al 2014 in engineering field some surrogate models have been widely used consisting of respond surface model rsm kriging rbf artificial neural network ann in this study the rbf model is applied which has been developed for scattered multivariate data interpolation wang et al 2006 powell 1992 rbf is a type of neural network employing a hidden layer of radial units and an output layer of linear units devanathan and koch 2011 and it is proved as a good choice for approximating deterministic computer models 4 validation of surrogate model adequacy a group of samples are randomly created for validation four error type methods are applied for error and reliability analysis including relative average absolute error raae relative maximum absolute error rmae root mean square error rmse determination coefficient r 2 myers 2009 typically when all the error values achieve the acceptance levels it is concluded that the surrogate model meet the requirements of the optimization four error values are calculated as follows 1 r a a e i 1 p f x i f ˆ x i p σ 2 r m a e max 1 i p f x i f ˆ x i σ 3 r m s e i 1 p f x i f ˆ x i 2 p 4 r 2 1 i 1 p f x i f ˆ x i 2 i 1 p f x i f x i 2 where p is the number of validation point f x i is the actual value obtained by simulation at the ith validation point f ˆ x i is the predicted value calculated from the surrogate model at the ith validation point f x i is the mean of actual values of validation points σ is the standard deviation of actual values of validation points 4 2 application of the rbf model to turret stress approximation the rbf model is applied for turret stress approximation all the design variables shown in table 1 are taken as the input parameters and the maximum stresses of the turret area are defined as the output parameters the yield stress is evaluated separately for different positions of the structure as different materials are used in different positions two materials are applied in the example so two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ b r a c k e t are defined as the output parameters then the training and validation data are chosen the accuracy of the rbf model directly depends on the number of training samples at least 2n 1 training samples are required for initialization of the rbf model where n is the number of input parameters devanathan and koch 2011 hence the minimum required number of sample in this study is 15 with 7 input parameters in addition 100 training sample is recommended to obtain more accurate models as a result 100 samples table a 1 are created by olhs as training data 50 samples table a 2 are randomly created for validation the information of all samples are listed in appendix a the yield stress calculation of each sample is performed on 40 core processor with 32g of ram for approximately 7 min then the rbf models are built using the approximation model available in isight and the error analysis is performed table 5 lists the error analysis results of rbf models according to table 5 all values of the error are at acceptable level in addition fig 9 presents the fitness of the two output parameters the abscissa is the calculated stress values of the design points and the ordinate is the predicted values by the rbf model the closer the scatter points approach to the diagonal line the better the correlation between the rbf model and the design point is indicating the better establishment of input output relationship model in fig 9 it is seen that the scatter points of the calculated stress values and the predicted stress values are approximately distributed around the diagonal line therefore the rbf models fit the design points well from the result of rbf models the effects of x6 and x7 on the two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ b r a c k e t are much more significant than other 5 input variables x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 fig 10 shows the 3d graphs of two output parameters with respect to x 6 and x 7 5 application of optimum design on the fpso turret 5 1 definition of the optimization module as stated above a typical internal turret area of the fpso is taken as an example to validate the optimization method 7 variables as listed in table 1 are selected as design variables considering the plate thickness of the structure is discrete in the practical engineering application all the design variables are set as integer during the optimization minimum weight of the turret area constitutes the objective considered in this application structural constraints that limit stress to avoid yielding are considered as the main design constraints according to criteria of allowable stresses in bv rules xu et al 2004 and the difference on material property two maximum stresses σ c o n e p l a t σ b r a c k e t should not exceed the allowable stresses besides the technological constraints that provide the upper and lower bounds of the design variables are added therefore the optimization model can be specified as table 6 5 2 the evolutionary strategy the evolutionary strategy available in isight is selected for optimization as it has been proved well suited for non linear and discontinuous design spaces rechenberg 1973 schwefel 1977 the evolutionary strategies were first proposed by bienert rechenberg and schwefel in the 1960s at the techanical universtiy of berlin tub in germany bäck 1996 currently the commonly used evolutionary strategy is the μ λ e s bäck 1996 muc and muc wierzgoń 2012 which is therefore applied in our study similar to other evolutionary computation methods e g genetic algorithms evolutionary programming genetic programming the basic operations of the μ λ e s include mutation recombination and selection bäck 1996 muc and muc wierzgoń 2012 simon 2013 each individual in μ λ e s consists of two parts the object variable x and standard deviations σ expressing as 5 x σ x 1 x 2 x i x n σ 1 σ 2 σ i σ n where n is the problem dimension the parent individuals x σ are modified by mutating the standard deviations using a multiplicative logarithmic normally distributed process which expressed as follows 6 x x n 0 σ 7 σ σ e n 0 δ σ where x σ is the offspring individual n 0 σ denotes a realization of a normally distributed random variable array having expectation zero and standard deviation σ for recombination a series of different recombination mechanisms are recently applied in es in our study the operators are sexual which act on two individuals randomly chosen from the parent population for selection best individuals out of the offspring are selected to form the next parent generation in the μ λ e s the parents of the next generation are selected as the best μ individuals from among the λ children 5 3 optimization results and discussion the optimization is performed by establishing an automatic optimization platform based on isight in which stress analysis with patran nastran rbf model evolutionary strategy and automatic edit programming are integrated according to schwefel s research 1 5 es is recommended in the original implementation the prototype is chosen as a starting point the standard deviation σ i 0 are initialized as 3 as indicated in section 5 2 search points in es are object parameter vectors so that the fitness function is in principle identical to the objective function the maximum iteration is given as 100 times which is a useful setting bäck 1996 best of the children in each iteration is plotted in fig 11 showing the iteration history of the optimization and the history values of corresponding stress constraints are drawn in fig 12 the feasible solutions are marked with blue dot while unfeasible solutions with red dot the optimum solution marked with green triangle in fig 11 is obtained after 80 iterations the green line in fig 11 shows the improvement of the iterations it can be seen that there is no improved solutions during the remaining 20 iterations proving the optimum solution in 80th iteration is acceptable the optimum solution is compared with prototype as listed in table 7 5 4 validation of optimization results and rbf models in order to validate the accuracy of the rbf model and the optimization results the optimum case is analyzed by fem method as stated in section 3 the stresses calculated by fem method are compared to the predicted values by rbf models as listed in table 8 it can be seen that the errors between the predicted values and the calculated values are small proving the efficiency of the rbf model fig 13 shows the thickness distribution of optimal case fig 14 shows the von mises stress overview of turret area under lc5 in which the maximum stress occurred moreover in order to prove the rapidity of the optimization method the direct optimization without rbf is performed under the same hardware and software condition the optimized solution with the objective function value of 140889 kg is obtained which is 0 59 higher than the rbf based optimization however the optimization time of direct optimization is approximately 12 h which is relatively much longer than the rbf based method 27 min table 9 lists the comparison of objective and optimization duration between rbf based method and direct optimization 6 conclusion this paper explores a scantling optimization approach to minimize the weight of internal turret area of a fpso subject to yield stress constraints under the full loaded and ballast conditions the yield strength of turret area is analyzed by fem direct calculation according to bv rules in order to effectively reduces the computational time necessary for fem analysis and improves the efficiency of the optimization the rbf method is employed to approximate the maximum stress of the structure among all the load cases the response of rbf model is obtained from fem direct calculation the optimization is performed by applying the evolutionary strategy a typical inner turret area of fpso is taken as an example for scantling optimization as a result the optimal case is achieved with weight reduction of 10 2 the stress results of the optimal case obtained from rbf method are validated through fem analysis proving the reliability of the rbf model the analysis progress and optimization result show the feasibility and reliability of the analysis method and optimization strategy which are well suited for use in

22422,the constrained nonlinear thrust allocation problem in ship application is studied in this work based on optimization and multivariate analysis the optimization models in the previous works have been reviewed and a new model is proposed in order to reduce the complexity of searching space slack variables are discarded based on optimization equivalence only two components of fuel consumption generated from real thrusts and rotations of azimuth thrusters are considered the singularity avoiding is achieved by adding the rank constraint of the configure matrix rather than just adding into objective function through weight additional computation mechanism multi start is added to the traditional sequential quadratic programming sqp to enhance the global searching ability a newly developed metaheuristic algorithm mine blast algorithm mba is used for finding the solution of new model its improved version imba which aims to strengthen the searching ability in exploitation phase is also investigated moreover the multiobjective optimization concept is introduced for thrust allocation the pareto set of fuel consumption from thrust and rotation is studied then finally the hidden information in the optimization model is mined through a widely used data mining technique self organizing map som a remote operated vessel rov example is employed in this work to illustrate the above analysis procedure the results show that the discard of slack can be reasonable without degrading the accuracy of the model the objective function of new model has clear physical meaning sqp combined with multi start mechanism is an effective way to find close to global solution metaheuristic algorithms can treat any fitness functions and should be given further considerations some new insight can be obtained from multiobjective optimization problem analysis and data mining keywords thrust allocation optimization sqp mba nsga ii som remote operation vessel rov 1 introduction offshore exploration and exploitation activities have been becoming more and more important all over the world due to the scarce resources of the continent these operations have increased interest in the development of dynamic positioning systems dps in surface ships and underwater vessels dps are widely equipped in service ships pipe layers and multi purpose platforms dps are usually employed to keep the vessel position and heading subjected to environment disturbances such as wind currents and waves in general 4 components are included in a complete dps which are control thrust allocation propulsion and measurement respectively fossen 2011 thrust allocation ta also known as control allocation johansen and fossen 2013 is one of the key parts of dps ta subsystem receives the commands from upper system i e ship motion and control and distributes all these commands into actuators mounted on the vessels usually in contemporary dps it has become a common phenomenon that the number of control input is large than the degree which are needed to be controlled as an over actuated system how to distribute the load among actuators is quite a challenge work first the goals of ta could be minimal error between the command generalized force and allocated force or minimization of power consumption depending on the main purpose of designer second during the allocation process many constraints will be considered such as physical limits saturation condition maximum thrust of each propeller etc and previous status of system therefore this allocation task usually rises to a typical constrained optimization problem moreover apart from just finding the optimal solution to an over actuated system more insight about this topic will be needed for further research this can be obtained with the help of optimization algorithms and data mining techniques ta problem has received much attention from academia many works have been devoted to the solutions finding of thrust allocation problems via optimization algorithms e g won kim and hyun kim 2018 koschorrek et al 2018 witkowska and smierzchalski 2018 a comprehensive review about this topic was provided by johansen and fossen 2013 linear and nonlinear optimization models are discussed together with different algorithms employed in ta procedure in optimization model construction a slack variable vector is introduced to minimize the allocation error first objective in case that the command virtual input cannot be achieved exactly furthermore the secondary objective will be added to the first one several optimization criteria can be chosen as the secondary objective such as fuel consumption won kim and hyun kim 2018 rindarøy 2013 li et al 2018 actuator tear and wear sørdalen 1997 wu et al 2014 variation in the power consumption veksler et al 2015 or singularity avoidance johansen et al 2004 xu et al 2019 it should be noted that these objectives are added together directly just through weights the priority of each part of objectives can be adjusted by varying these weights many algorithms have been used in ta procedure including traditional gradient based algorithms such as quadratic programming qp johansen et al 2005 koschorrek et al 2018 sequential quadratic programming sqp johansen et al 2004 liang and cheng 2004 witkowska and smierzchalski 2018 and modern heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithm ga da wei et al 2010 particle swarm optimization pso ji and yi 2014 and artificial bee colony algorithm abc wu et al 2014 compared with traditional algorithms modern heuristic algorithms can solve any objective function style and any type of constraints they have high flexibility and can be used in many cases the main concerns of designers are to construct the optimization problem not the features of the algorithm itself despite the recent progress reviewed in the survey work of johansen and fossen 2013 some issues about optimization in ta problem solving are still needed to research further first slack variables are usually introduced in optimization model in the previous works johansen et al 2004 this will increase the complexity of the model and enlarge the search space from the viewpoint of practical application and the intrinsic feature of slack variables the equality constraint about desired thrust and command thrust can be converted into inequality ones without introducing slack variables thus reducing the complexity and computational tasks second singularity phoneme will emerge for some combinations of angles in more azimuth actuators cases and it should be avoided in practical design from the viewpoint of optimization this feature should be considered as constraints not the objective as used in many works e g wu et al 2016 fossen 2011 third the objective function expression is usually composed up to 4 parts fossen 2011 namely total power consumption penalization item about slack variables items related to rate of change in azimuths and singularity the physical meanings of all these items should be studied in detail these items reflect different considerations about ta procedure they are combined together just through weights therefore only one objective function is left for optimization solving two problems will be introduced then the first problem is how to determine those weights the other is that the meaning of objective space is not clear now a sequential problem will emerge what is the relationship among these 4 parts the relationships among the 4 parts of objective function are needed to be studied further forth the solving approaches to the optimization problem can be extended from twofold one is strengthen the performance of traditional approach e g sqp and another is to extend the application of heuristic methods johansen and fossen 2013 traditional nonlinear optimization approach is based on initial start point and gradient information it will stick into the local minimums easily its local optimization ability can be extended by additional computational mechanism on the other hand metaheuristic techniques are easily to implement and no gradient information is needed in optimization procedure they have intrinsic stochastic features to avoid local optimum entrapment however the convergence speed of heuristic methods should be given much attention when they are used in dps moreover the relationships between decision variables and objective function are not studied yet in the previous works after optimization how to find the intrinsic information or features hidden in this model what are the effects of decision variable upon the objective function then in this work we focus on the optimization model construction optimization study and data mining first we build a ta model to address above issues in objective function expression only two parts related with fuel consumption are remained the equality constraint about thrust is converted into an inequality expression taking equivalence of optimization problem into consideration with without slack variables models are also considered and compared in this study singularity issue is considered as a constraint not a part of objective function second multi start mechanism is added to traditional optimization approach sqp in order to search global optima one easy method is to run sqp from multiple initial points a newly developed heuristic method mine blast algorithm mba sadollah et al 2012 and its updated version imba sadollah et al 2014 are adopted to find the optimization solution of ta problem the results from these 2 algorithms are compared the global optimization features of sqp multi start and convergence speed of imba are studied in the present work at last a well known multiobjective optimization technique nsga ii deb et al 2002 is used to find the features of objective function space which is composed by two parts of fuel consumption moreover self organization maps som kohonen 2013 method is employed to find the relationships among the decision variables and objective functions much information hidden in the optimization model can be mined through these two approaches this work provides a deep investigation of ta problem through optimization and data mining approaches the main contributions of the present study are as follows 1 the widely used ta analysis model is evaluated thoroughly and a new model is constructed based on equivalent transition operation the new model has clearly physical meaning and the volume of searching space decrease 2 the application of optimization approaches in ta have been investigated in twofold metaheuristic algorithms mba imba are used to find the global optimal result this extend the applications of metaheuristics in ta moreover sqp with multi start mechanism is introduced to enhance the capability of sqp 3 furthermore data mining idea is introduced to study the feature of ta especially the relationship of objectives 4 som is used to find correlation among decision variables and objectives hidden information can be found through image reading the structure of the present work is as follows the theory analysis about optimization model and algorithm are described briefly in section 2 in section 3 a numerical example of ta for a remotely operated vehicle rov is provided the optimization and data mining results are given there the concluding remarks and future direction are listed in section 4 2 theory in this section the construction of the optimization model in this work is described first followed by 3 kinds of optimization approaches the mechanism of self organization maps for data mining is also provided briefly here 2 1 optimization model in general 3 aspects will be considered in constructing an optimization model namely objective function or cost function decision variables and constraints respectively these 3 parts of ta problem are discussed as follows 2 1 1 objective function in the previous works many features of ta were selected as objective function such as minimization of fuel consumption tear and wear on thrusters and variation in the power consumption johansen and fossen 2013 in this work fuel consumption is adopted as objective function various types of thrusters are used in vessels for example azimuth thrusters tunnel thrusters and so on fossen 2011 the components of fuel consumption from these thrusters can be classified as 2 categories force and moment from the viewpoint of energy conversion the objective function can be expressed as sum of two parts 1 min j u α i 1 m w i u i α α 0 t ψ α α 0 where w i the power consumption of ith thruster u i the axial force of ith thruster u u 1 u m α azimuth angles vector of thrusters m the number of thrusters the first part represents the sum of consumption of m thrusters resulting from thrust force the second part is the fuel consumption generated by the rate of change in azimuths α 0 previous status of azimuth vector t transpose of vector in this work in order to convert the rate of change of azimuths into energy features a transfer variable ψ is used here it is worthy to note that ψ is not a weight compared with first part and not used to tune the second part of objective function the function of ψ is the same as those of w i only depending on the fuel features of the individual thrusters in dps the fuel consumption will vary according to external load of wind currents and waves in a time sample it is also reasonable to expect that each part of eq 1 to be minimized concurrently this will lead to another kind of optimization problem multiobjective optimization problem mop lobato and steffen 2017 briefly the problem can be expressed as follows 2 min f 1 f 2 where f 1 i 1 m w i u i f 2 α α 0 t ψ α α 0 2 1 2 decision variables the primary objective of ta subsystem is to distribute the commanded thrust into the individual actuators therefore the thrust and azimuth angle of each actuator are chosen as decision variables consequently slack variables are usually adopted in many works johansen and fossen 2013 the main idea of introducing of slack variables is to get a feasible solution in case of failure of primary objective of ta commanded force exceed the capability of the ta subsystem etc the objective of optimization will be changed to finding minimal value of allocation error in the previous works the introducing of slack variables also leads to the increase of components in objective function johansen and fossen 2013 therefore the original optimization problem has been changed now however the mathematical operation of equivalent transition boyd and vandenberghe 2004 should not change the original objective function furthermore this slack variable virtual force cannot contribute the fuel consumption of the dps in fact the fuel consumption which generated from generalized force can only be obtained from real thrust of individual actuators eq 1 in practical design the difference between commanded and achieved generalized force is permitted due to the uncertainty of external load wind currents and waves and can be limited in some extent through appropriate constraints setting in this work the models with without slack variables are also studied and compared 2 1 3 constraints the constraints of ta problem can include individual capacity of thrusters rate of limits azimuth thrusters and singularity avoiding johansen et al 2004 johansen and fossen 2013 in the previous works the bounds of slack variables are determined through setting the corresponding weight i e item s t q s as large as possible if slack variables are taken into consideration the tolerance of slack variable vector should be determined first the singularity will emerge for some combinations of azimuth angles in case of singularity the commanded generalized force cannot be achieved and the manipulation of vessels will be lost this case should be avoided in design and operation the key feature of singular configuration of thrusters is that the configure matrix b α hasn t full rank in mathematics therefore in order to taking singularity avoiding into consideration an additional constraint is added as follows 3 r a n k b α m where rank means the rank of matrix similar to the slack variables analysis the singularity avoiding should not contribute the fuel consumption actually the dynamic increase in power consumption due to near singular configurations will be expressed in the enlargement of thruster or variation of angles rather than the singularity items in objective function directly through weight johansen et al 2004 2 1 4 models in this work according to the analysis above 3 kinds of optimization models are proposed in this work they are listed in table 1 the model 1 is identical to those of johansen et al 2004 ω in model 1 is a weight compare to the 1st part of j u s α johansen et al 2004 2 2 optimization algorithms in this subsection 3 types of optimization algorithms are described briefly the additional computational mechanism of sqp multi start method is given first a newly developed metaheuristic algorithm mine blast algorithm mba and its updated version imba will be introduced then these 3 approaches are used to find the minimization of fuel consumption of dps in a time span however in the multiobjective optimization analysis a specific time instant is selected first the objective function space at this time point will be explored through nsga ii approach 2 2 1 sqp multi start sqp is a gradient based optimization in this method a quadratic programming qp sub problem will be constructed and solved bfgs method can be used to update the hessian matrix of the lagrangian expression during iteration nocedal and wright 2006 an initial guess solution should be provided to the algorithm different initial solutions may lead to different local minimal values the sqp method has been used for ta problem by many researchers e g liang and cheng 2004 johansen et al 2004 witkowska and śmierzchalski 2018 in order to find the global minimal solution one method is to run the sqp solver from various initial points concurrently the evaluations load can be distributed among a number of processors and increase the speed of execution however the parallel gradient estimation will be disabled the evaluations are run on processors independently in fact the final minimal value can be filtered from this sqp multi start mechanism then 2 2 2 mba and imba mine blast algorithm is newly developed metaheuristic algorithm for optimization which is inspired from the mechanism of landmines explosion sadollah et al 2012 during the process of blast the shrapnel pieces will be thrown they may collide with other shrapnel pieces thus leading further explosions i e more victims will be generated suppose if we want to clear the mines in the field the goal is just to find the mine with the most explosive effect the position of the mine corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem minimal or maximum value of function the mba is designed to find the mine with the most casualties in which the casualties of each of shrapnel piece are calculated by cost function i e objective function the total procedure of mba can be classified as 3 phases 1 initialization 2 exploration and 3 exploitation 1 initialization phase similar to other methods mba is also a population based algorithm the initial population n p o p also the number of shrapnel pieces n s is generated randomly from the decision space and can be expressed by 4 x 0 x l r a n d x u x l where x 0 first short point x l and x u are lower and upper bounds of the decision variables respectively r a n d random numbers which is distributed uniformly in 0 1 suppose x is the current location of population 5 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m 2 where m 2 is the number of the decision variables assume this initial solution is the best point i e x b e s t x 0 2 exploration phase in order to explore the search space comprehensively an exploration factor μ is introduced in the exploration phase of mba this factor is also a border between exploration phase and exploitation phase the function of exploration will decrease along with iteration history the distance of shrapnel pieces will shrink on the contrary the power of exploitation will increase then the landmine explosion location triggered by shrapnel pieces are calculated as follows 6 x e d t 1 r a n d n 2 cos θ t 1 2 μ 7 x e x b e s t x e t μ 8 θ k 360 n s k 1 2 n s 1 where θ the shrapnel angle randn uniformly distributed random number d t 1 the distance of the thrown shrapnel piece at t 1 th iteration the initial distance x u x l will be decreased gradually to increase the global search ability through following expression 9 d t d t 1 exp t α 1 t 1 2 3 m a x i t e r a t i o n where α 1 the reduction constants 3 exploitation phase when iteration step t μ mba will go to the exploitation phase it tries to find the solution closet to the current best solution then the mechanism used for this phase can be expressed as follows 10 x e d t 1 r a n d cos θ t μ m a x i t e r a t i o n 11 x e x b e s t x e t μ m a x i t e r a t i o n the improved version of mba imba a new location updating formulation is proposed as 12 x e x e exp 1 d r a n d x b e s t x b e s t 1 where d is the euclidean distance between current and last best landmines m 2 dimensions the schematic view of imba is shown in fig 1 sadollah et al 2014 in order to handling constraints a direct approach is employed coello coello and montes 2002 deb 2000 four rules are included according to the features objective function values and violation of constraints of each solution more details about mba and imba including initial parameters setting and convergence criteria etc can be found in the works of sadollah et al 2012 and sadollah et al 2014 2 2 3 nsga ii the multiobjective optimization problem mop is defined to find a vector which satisfies a vector of functions which are usually in conflict with each other coello coello et al 2007 in this case the word optimization means that the solutions to the problem are acceptable to the designer in mop several functions are to be optimized simultaneously and a set of solutions will be obtained rather than one unique solution in sop usually a decision making procedure is required for designer to select the final compromising solution branke et al 2008 a key concept in mop is pareto optimal which means that there exists no feasible solution which would decrease some criterion without increase of at least another criterion for minimization problem concurrently coello coello et al 2007 for example in eq 2 in this work no other feasible x in the solution set x p exists such that f 1 x f 1 x p and f 2 x f 2 x p for at least one objective many approaches are available for solving mop such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea coello coello et al 2007 multiobjective particle swarm optimization mopso mousa et al 2012 and multiobjective simulated annealing mosa bandyopadhyay et al 2008 nsga ii is a well known approach in moea proposed by deb et al 2002 three features are embedded into the flowchart of algorithm 1 elitist principle 2 diversity preserving mechanism and 3 non dominated solution emphasis the main procedure of optimization can be summarized as follows 1 offspring population q t population size n is created from parent population p t through ordinary evolutionary operators 2 merge these two populations into a new population r t population size 2 n 3 non domination sorting operation upon r t several non domination fronts will be formed 4 new population forming in last allowed front the points with the highest diversity will be chosen the schematic view of nsga ii procedure is shown in fig 2 2 3 data analysis the distributed force and moment for individual actuators in dps can be obtained from above single or multiobjective optimization process if only one total fuel consumption objective is considered the minimal objective function is the final solution however if two separate objective functions eq 2 are selected concurrently the solutions of the problem is a set of pareto solutions another decision procedure is needed for finding final solution from this solution set moreover in order to find the features of objectives relationships between decision variables and objective function s a widely used data analysis approach self organizing mapping som kohonen 2013 is utilized in this work the hidden information in the ta problem can be mined through this approach from the definition of ta the feasible solutions will be infinite due to that the dps is an over actuated mechanical system the optimization task is to find a solution or a set of solutions with some minimal criterion while satisfying constraints the ta problem usually includes several decision variables and one or more than one objective function the space composed from decision variables and objective function s is a high dimensional one during the optimization procedure so many feasible solutions with high dimensions will be obtained and they can be expressed as follows 13 data x 11 x 1 q x n 1 x n q where n entities in the dataset q attributes or properties under consideration n value is determined by the solution size in optimization process the attributes may include thrust and angles of individual actuators and objectives eq 2 the som algorithm is first proposed by t kohonen in 1982 the som network is a kind of unsupervised learning network with which the data in high dimensional space can be mapped to one or two dimensional grid the network learns to form its own classifications of the training data without external help a typical som architecture is shown in fig 3 a som map of size 20 12 units neighborhoods size 1 2 and 3 of the unit marked with black dot the som network has 2 layers the input layer is connected to the cell in the output layer the map before training the units of map are initialized first when data pattern is given to som the distance between every unit will be calculated then the best matching unit bmu can be selected according to nearest euclidean distance after the network has been trained the pattern reflecting the input data will be mapped to the units in the map more details about som algorithm may refer to kohonen s work 2013 3 numerical examples and discussion 3 1 rov model in this section thrust allocation of a remotely operated vehicle rov is studied this virtual rov is a modification of minerva kajanus 2014 a 4dof control model this model is rated for 700 m depth 4 thrusters are equipped in the rov compared with original minerva the thrusters no 3 4 have been changed into azimuth thrusters for the present research purpose the thrust layout of this rov is shown in fig 4 the parameters used for simulation of this virtual rov are listed in table 2 the designed generalized force will be transformed into thruster revolutions rpm the max revolutions of thrusters are 1450 rpm the thruster coefficients between force and rpm are also given in table 2 the label c and c represent the positive and negative rotational direction of the thrust force respectively in this work the coupling effect between roll pitch are neglected and 4dof i e surge sway heave and yaw remained therefore the thruster configuration matrix b can be expressed as 14 b c o s α 1 s i n α 1 0 l 1 x 0 0 1 0 c o s α 3 s i n α 3 0 l 3 x sin α 3 l 3 y c o s α 3 c o s α 4 s i n α 4 0 l 4 x sin α 4 l 4 y c o s α 4 during the optimization the rank of b matrix should be equal 4 thus singularity avoiding can be achieved 3 2 optimization examples according to the analysis in section 2 3 optimization models are constructed here the upper and lower bound of decision variables are shown in tables 3 and 4 for these models respectively slack variables are decision variables in example 1 its bounds should be defined clearly before optimization according to the definition of slack variable difference between commanded force and achieved force it should be as small as possible in this example it is given rather small values i e between 1 n and 1 n however slack variables are not considered in examples 2 and 3 the rate of change thrust force is set as 20 n i e δ u i m i n 20 n δ u i m a x 20 n i 1 2 3 4 while the rate of change in azimuths is 40 i e δ α i m i n 40 δ α i m a x 40 i 1 3 4 an example of the external force history is shown in fig 5 kajanus 2014 the main task of ta is to distribute 4 directional forces surge sway heave and moment in yaw τ x y z n into the 4 thrusters that is to find suitable combinations of decision variables in tables 3 and 4 3 3 results and discussions in this work all optimization tasks are carried out on matlab 2016b with windows 7 64bit environment intel i5 3470 cpu 4 cores 3 20 ghz 4 0 gb ram 3 examples are studied and the results are list as follows 3 3 1 example 1 this example is solved by traditional sqp sqp multi start and mba approaches respectively the parameters for sqp are max iterations 1000 constraint tolerance and step tolerance are set as 1 e 3 respectively 100 random initial start points are used in sqp multi start via matlab s parallel computation in mba algorithm population size ns 30 number of objective function evaluations nfes is 10000 max iteration 500 the switchover point for exploration and exploitation μ is 100 max iteration 5 the mba algorithm was run 50 times independently to collect the lowest value for comparison in this example the weights among components of objective function are used i e q 1000 d i a g 1 1 1 1 kajanus 2014 ω 1000 d i a g 1 1 1 and ϱ 1 e 3 ε 1 e 2 the objective functions of the three approaches are listed in fig 6 the results of sqp are highly dependent on the initial point at the beginning of the computation the initial point is provided just from decision space different initial points will lead different final function values distinct peaks can be seen in the curve of sqp result in fig 6 moreover each run of sqp may also result in different solutions the result from multi start mechanism can erase these peaks in fact it is an envelope for objective values from many runs of traditional sqp computation the additional computation cost in multi start is rather little in this example only about 1 8s is needed for 100 initial start points running the result of mba is quite close to that of sqp multi start before 80s when time is larger than 80s the deviation between these 2 methods is little higher the time cost for each time step in mba is about 10 2s features of the decision variables between sqp multi start and mba are depicted in fig 7 compared with sqp multi start the decision variables of mba will have many local variations peaks and valleys in the history this is due to the feature of ta problem and the intrinsic global searching attribute of mba as a complex engineering problem many local peaks will emerge in the objective space it will be seen from the maps of som in the following sections at each time step the mba similar to other population based metaheuristic approaches will generate a new initial population this random and completely new population will be quite different from last time step and will lead to a rather different final objective value thus the variations of decision variables may be sharp in fig 7 the searching capability in decision space of mba is demonstrated here for example the bounds for slack variables are 1 1 it can be seen that this bound is utilized by mba to a great extent in fig 7 d on the contrary the sqp multi start mechanism will confine this searching ability thus the history curve will be much smoothly it is worthy to be noted that even local variations exist in the history of decision variables these solutions of mba approach satisfied all constraints from the figuration matrix b and layout of rov it can be seen that the force in heave direction is conducted by u 2 independently the force constraint in this direction b 3 2 u 2 τ 3 s 3 is only about u 2 i e independent on other variables s 3 is a small value in sqp multi start and mba therefore the history of u 2 from these two approaches are quite close figs 7 a b 3 3 2 example 2 the introduction of slack variables is to ensure that optimization problem always has a feasible solution johansen et al 2004 it should be noted that the original optimization question has been changed due to 1 increase of slack variable vector and 2 modification of constraints and objective function the physical meaning of this additional objective function s t q s resulted from these mathematic operations are questionable the actual fuel consumption cannot be generated from this virtual variable in fact moreover the achieved force either large or less than the commanded force should be considered as a whole then transform it into power consumption according to the physical law thrust power relationship in ship motion i e the first part of objective function rather than just two independent parts in example 1 the slack variable vector is defined as difference between achieved force and commanded force and it is small based on this idea example 1 can be transformed to example 2 in terms of constraint handling that is the equality constraint which contains slack variables is replaced with such inequality constraint suppose ε 1 is a much smaller value e g 1 e 3 this handling is common in optimization analysis and widely used in actual engineering design only consumption generated from actual thrust forces and moments are considered in example 2 the consumption of rotation from azimuth thrusters can be studied from actual physical law or experimental study the scope of this work is just a more general testing of optimization rather than a detailed exploration of the performance for rov design in example 2 ψ 1000 d i a g 1 1 1 1 even this value is identical to that ω in example 1 however this variable is still supposed from physical law between rotation angle and fuel consumption the singularity avoiding is achieved by adding a constraint about rank of b matrix listed in table 1 this example is solved by imba and sqp multi start respectively the objective function and relative difference percent between these two approaches are given in fig 8 it is found that the difference of objectives from these 2 methods is very small in the vessel motion period compared with example 1 slack variables are not considered in example 2 the search space decreases the time consumption decrease due to the variation of search space in optimization is not distinct however history of the decision variables for example 2 are shown in fig 9 local peaks and valleys does exist in imba in example 2 too however the amplitude of variation is smaller than those in example 1 this is due to the enhance power of imba in the exploitation phase new location updating formulation is based on previous best solution 12 i e focusing on the solution closed to the current best solution the searching space has been confined by current best solution and its surrounding space which is composed by previous status and current location this mechanism will lead to less variation in the history plot compared with original mba this may suggest that with the emphasis of exploitation phase more smooth of history plot would be expected the discarding of slack variables is based on the equivalence of the optimization problem in example 2 the objective function and all constraints of these 2 examples are different actually for example even the similar history trend can be found in figs 7 and 9 for these 2 approaches the differences of objectives thrusts and azimuth angles between 2 examples are clearly shown in fig 10 the objective components of slack variables and singularity issue are neglected in example 2 it is expected that the overall fuel consumption will decrease as shown in fig 10 a it should be noted that the objective functions used in this work is deduced from a standard qp problem the power of sqp algorithm can be seen than compared with sqp or sqp multi start the application fields of mba imba or other metaheuristic algorithms are much wide 3 3 3 example 3 in this example a multiobjective optimization problem is studied the two components of consumption f 1 and f 2 are considered as objective functions concurrently the other settings are identical to those of the example 2 this problem is defined at some time step for example time 60s in the rov motion history at this time the external vector is τ 42 82 n 256 00 n 19 04 n 1 50 n m u 0 1 6774 e 02 n 2 3738 e 01 n 5 6231 e 01 n 7 1721 e 01 n m α 0 1 6226 e 00 rad 9 1647 e 01 rad 2 5010 e 00 rad respectively the parameters of nsga ii are as follows population size 200 maximum iteration number 2000 crossover probability 0 9 mutation probability 0 1 distribution index of crossover and mutation 20 deb et al 2002 respectively the pareto solutions obtained at the end of iteration are shown in fig 11 in the previous work johansen et al 2004 the four components of objective function come from multiple aspects including penalization of slack variables and singularity avoiding 3 kinds of weights are added there in fact that handling is just an application of priori preference articulation in multiobjective optimization coello coello et al 2007 i e the decision making procedure is made before search the multiobjective problem has been converted into a single objective optimization the search space for original problem decrease heavily therefore only one solution will be found at last nsga ii is a posteriori preference articulation method taking the ranking and sorting of pareto solution into consideration thus provide more alternative solutions for designers in fig 11 all 200 populations are solutions of the example 3 the designer can choose any one as final solution depending on the preference of oneself this means that an additional decision making procedure is needed after multiple optimization solving process deb 2001 according to this example the fuel consumption of thrust force are quite large than that of rotation the decision making of these solutions is easy it should be noted that if a real physical law about rotation angle and fuel consumption is used and the values of f 1 and f 2 are at same level more efforts may be required in the decision making procedure then the relationship between decision variables and f 1 is provided in fig 12 it can be seen that the variations of decision variables of actuators are small 3 4 data mining in example 3 the main task is to find the pareto set fig 11 at this time step the external force is determined by environment wind current and waves during the evolutionary procedure of nsga ii so many feasible solutions will be generated refer to fig 2 pareto set is a kind of special feasible solutions which satisfying the definition of multiple optimization problem coello coello et al 2007 it is interesting to explore the whole objective function space to get much insight of this ta problem this whole feasible space for example 3 is given in fig 13 the pareto set also pareto front in fig 13 locates at the left down corner the relationships between objectives f 1 and f 2 and decision variables thrusts and angles can be mined through som technique som is a kind of widely used technique in data mining field it can map higher dimension data into 2 dimension and provide visual images hidden information in the data set can be found through reading those maps the dimension of data set is 9 which is the sum of 2 objective functions 4 thrusts and 3 azimuth angles the all feasible samples obtained in finding pareto set process are collected in example 3 the number of samples is 342039 therefore the size of data set eq 13 for som analysis is 342039 9 here the mapping procedure is conducted with the help of som toolbox vesanto 2002 a freeware matlab code developed in helsinki university the map was created on 94 units high and 31 units wide hexagonal plane the component graphs are shown in fig 14 the information of these graphs is visualized concurrently all 342039 samples are expressed in these units when a variable changes location in its graph the other dimension values in other graphs will also change corresponding locations in a similar pattern polzlbauer 2008 the designer can obtain correlation difference among these attributes from fig 14 1 the variation trends of f 1 and f 2 are similar this phenomenon suggests that when f 1 increase f 2 will increase too the correlation about these two objective functions is high this feature can also be observed from fig 13 2 several areas with different colors exist in f 1 and f 2 graphs it shows that this thrust problem is a multi peak optimization problem the traditional gradient based optimization algorithm is sensitive to local initial solution in order to find global minimal value it should jump out local optimal values it can also be observed that many different combinations of decision variables will lead to the almost same objective functions 3 the higher objective function areas locate at the lower left part of f 1 and f 2 graphs in these areas the main contribution of f 1 is u 1 i e x directional thrust the contributions from other 3 directions are small as for rotational fuel consumption f 2 the main components are two aft azimuth thrusters i e thrusters 3 4 4 the no 2 thruster is response for z directional motion of the vessel mainly its force variation is quite small suggests its contribution to the power consumption is nearly a constant 5 the angles variation trends of aft 2 thrusters are similar but the upper and lower bounds of them are different the angles of lateral thruster no 1 however vary in contrary direction 4 conclusions in this work the thrust allocation problem in ship applications is studied based on optimization and data mining techniques the optimization models are revisited and constructed according to fuel consumption the slack variables and singularity avoiding are considered traditional sqp and its multi start mechanism mba and imba nsga ii are used to research the thrust allocation of a rov example followed by a useful data mining procedure with the help of som technique several conclusions and recommendations for future work can be given here 1 previous work about thrust allocation which is based on single optimization objective can be extended to a multiobjective problem original single objective composed from several aspects of the thrust allocation can be treated as separate several objective functions concurrently rather than combined with weights the sum weighted approach confined the search space in fact much insight can be obtained from mop and data mining techniques 2 sqp is sensitive to the initial solution the sqp will lead to local optimal value due to the random choice of initial solution the very close to global solution could be found by adding multi start mechanism in sqp the local peak can be erased through this mechanism in fact the envelope line can be filtered from many runs of sqp results through this mechanism additional time costs are not distinct with the help of parallel computation of matlab software 3 mba can be applied in thrust allocation problem the variation of decision variable will be larger than those of sqp multi start this is due to the intrinsic feature of global searching ability of mba itself in decision space the constraints are satisfied and the accuracy of objective function is well if the local searching ability is strengthened in exploitation phase imba the variation of decision variable will decrease then this may suggest that if one wants to erase those sharp variations just like sqp the local search could be given more attention 4 the time cost of metaheuristic algorithms is higher than those of sqp and sqp multi start because dps is a very low speed motion control procedure the time cost for thrust allocation using metaheuristic algorithms in real engineering applications is still acceptable 5 additional decision procedure is needed after the pareto set has been obtained from multiobjective optimization sophisticated decision making techniques are so many and easily used for choosing final compromise solution 6 som technique can be used in thrust allocation to find hidden information of the optimization model the contribution of thrust or angles for fuel consumption can be learned from the component graphs for future works it is suggested that more attention can be paid to the exploitation phase of metaheuristic algorithms hybrid algorithms which composed by metaheuristic approach and local search algorithm either metaheuristic or gradient based such as sqp could be tested in future also it is worth to explore the dynamic thrust allocation i e the total fuel consumption in a time period 
22422,the constrained nonlinear thrust allocation problem in ship application is studied in this work based on optimization and multivariate analysis the optimization models in the previous works have been reviewed and a new model is proposed in order to reduce the complexity of searching space slack variables are discarded based on optimization equivalence only two components of fuel consumption generated from real thrusts and rotations of azimuth thrusters are considered the singularity avoiding is achieved by adding the rank constraint of the configure matrix rather than just adding into objective function through weight additional computation mechanism multi start is added to the traditional sequential quadratic programming sqp to enhance the global searching ability a newly developed metaheuristic algorithm mine blast algorithm mba is used for finding the solution of new model its improved version imba which aims to strengthen the searching ability in exploitation phase is also investigated moreover the multiobjective optimization concept is introduced for thrust allocation the pareto set of fuel consumption from thrust and rotation is studied then finally the hidden information in the optimization model is mined through a widely used data mining technique self organizing map som a remote operated vessel rov example is employed in this work to illustrate the above analysis procedure the results show that the discard of slack can be reasonable without degrading the accuracy of the model the objective function of new model has clear physical meaning sqp combined with multi start mechanism is an effective way to find close to global solution metaheuristic algorithms can treat any fitness functions and should be given further considerations some new insight can be obtained from multiobjective optimization problem analysis and data mining keywords thrust allocation optimization sqp mba nsga ii som remote operation vessel rov 1 introduction offshore exploration and exploitation activities have been becoming more and more important all over the world due to the scarce resources of the continent these operations have increased interest in the development of dynamic positioning systems dps in surface ships and underwater vessels dps are widely equipped in service ships pipe layers and multi purpose platforms dps are usually employed to keep the vessel position and heading subjected to environment disturbances such as wind currents and waves in general 4 components are included in a complete dps which are control thrust allocation propulsion and measurement respectively fossen 2011 thrust allocation ta also known as control allocation johansen and fossen 2013 is one of the key parts of dps ta subsystem receives the commands from upper system i e ship motion and control and distributes all these commands into actuators mounted on the vessels usually in contemporary dps it has become a common phenomenon that the number of control input is large than the degree which are needed to be controlled as an over actuated system how to distribute the load among actuators is quite a challenge work first the goals of ta could be minimal error between the command generalized force and allocated force or minimization of power consumption depending on the main purpose of designer second during the allocation process many constraints will be considered such as physical limits saturation condition maximum thrust of each propeller etc and previous status of system therefore this allocation task usually rises to a typical constrained optimization problem moreover apart from just finding the optimal solution to an over actuated system more insight about this topic will be needed for further research this can be obtained with the help of optimization algorithms and data mining techniques ta problem has received much attention from academia many works have been devoted to the solutions finding of thrust allocation problems via optimization algorithms e g won kim and hyun kim 2018 koschorrek et al 2018 witkowska and smierzchalski 2018 a comprehensive review about this topic was provided by johansen and fossen 2013 linear and nonlinear optimization models are discussed together with different algorithms employed in ta procedure in optimization model construction a slack variable vector is introduced to minimize the allocation error first objective in case that the command virtual input cannot be achieved exactly furthermore the secondary objective will be added to the first one several optimization criteria can be chosen as the secondary objective such as fuel consumption won kim and hyun kim 2018 rindarøy 2013 li et al 2018 actuator tear and wear sørdalen 1997 wu et al 2014 variation in the power consumption veksler et al 2015 or singularity avoidance johansen et al 2004 xu et al 2019 it should be noted that these objectives are added together directly just through weights the priority of each part of objectives can be adjusted by varying these weights many algorithms have been used in ta procedure including traditional gradient based algorithms such as quadratic programming qp johansen et al 2005 koschorrek et al 2018 sequential quadratic programming sqp johansen et al 2004 liang and cheng 2004 witkowska and smierzchalski 2018 and modern heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithm ga da wei et al 2010 particle swarm optimization pso ji and yi 2014 and artificial bee colony algorithm abc wu et al 2014 compared with traditional algorithms modern heuristic algorithms can solve any objective function style and any type of constraints they have high flexibility and can be used in many cases the main concerns of designers are to construct the optimization problem not the features of the algorithm itself despite the recent progress reviewed in the survey work of johansen and fossen 2013 some issues about optimization in ta problem solving are still needed to research further first slack variables are usually introduced in optimization model in the previous works johansen et al 2004 this will increase the complexity of the model and enlarge the search space from the viewpoint of practical application and the intrinsic feature of slack variables the equality constraint about desired thrust and command thrust can be converted into inequality ones without introducing slack variables thus reducing the complexity and computational tasks second singularity phoneme will emerge for some combinations of angles in more azimuth actuators cases and it should be avoided in practical design from the viewpoint of optimization this feature should be considered as constraints not the objective as used in many works e g wu et al 2016 fossen 2011 third the objective function expression is usually composed up to 4 parts fossen 2011 namely total power consumption penalization item about slack variables items related to rate of change in azimuths and singularity the physical meanings of all these items should be studied in detail these items reflect different considerations about ta procedure they are combined together just through weights therefore only one objective function is left for optimization solving two problems will be introduced then the first problem is how to determine those weights the other is that the meaning of objective space is not clear now a sequential problem will emerge what is the relationship among these 4 parts the relationships among the 4 parts of objective function are needed to be studied further forth the solving approaches to the optimization problem can be extended from twofold one is strengthen the performance of traditional approach e g sqp and another is to extend the application of heuristic methods johansen and fossen 2013 traditional nonlinear optimization approach is based on initial start point and gradient information it will stick into the local minimums easily its local optimization ability can be extended by additional computational mechanism on the other hand metaheuristic techniques are easily to implement and no gradient information is needed in optimization procedure they have intrinsic stochastic features to avoid local optimum entrapment however the convergence speed of heuristic methods should be given much attention when they are used in dps moreover the relationships between decision variables and objective function are not studied yet in the previous works after optimization how to find the intrinsic information or features hidden in this model what are the effects of decision variable upon the objective function then in this work we focus on the optimization model construction optimization study and data mining first we build a ta model to address above issues in objective function expression only two parts related with fuel consumption are remained the equality constraint about thrust is converted into an inequality expression taking equivalence of optimization problem into consideration with without slack variables models are also considered and compared in this study singularity issue is considered as a constraint not a part of objective function second multi start mechanism is added to traditional optimization approach sqp in order to search global optima one easy method is to run sqp from multiple initial points a newly developed heuristic method mine blast algorithm mba sadollah et al 2012 and its updated version imba sadollah et al 2014 are adopted to find the optimization solution of ta problem the results from these 2 algorithms are compared the global optimization features of sqp multi start and convergence speed of imba are studied in the present work at last a well known multiobjective optimization technique nsga ii deb et al 2002 is used to find the features of objective function space which is composed by two parts of fuel consumption moreover self organization maps som kohonen 2013 method is employed to find the relationships among the decision variables and objective functions much information hidden in the optimization model can be mined through these two approaches this work provides a deep investigation of ta problem through optimization and data mining approaches the main contributions of the present study are as follows 1 the widely used ta analysis model is evaluated thoroughly and a new model is constructed based on equivalent transition operation the new model has clearly physical meaning and the volume of searching space decrease 2 the application of optimization approaches in ta have been investigated in twofold metaheuristic algorithms mba imba are used to find the global optimal result this extend the applications of metaheuristics in ta moreover sqp with multi start mechanism is introduced to enhance the capability of sqp 3 furthermore data mining idea is introduced to study the feature of ta especially the relationship of objectives 4 som is used to find correlation among decision variables and objectives hidden information can be found through image reading the structure of the present work is as follows the theory analysis about optimization model and algorithm are described briefly in section 2 in section 3 a numerical example of ta for a remotely operated vehicle rov is provided the optimization and data mining results are given there the concluding remarks and future direction are listed in section 4 2 theory in this section the construction of the optimization model in this work is described first followed by 3 kinds of optimization approaches the mechanism of self organization maps for data mining is also provided briefly here 2 1 optimization model in general 3 aspects will be considered in constructing an optimization model namely objective function or cost function decision variables and constraints respectively these 3 parts of ta problem are discussed as follows 2 1 1 objective function in the previous works many features of ta were selected as objective function such as minimization of fuel consumption tear and wear on thrusters and variation in the power consumption johansen and fossen 2013 in this work fuel consumption is adopted as objective function various types of thrusters are used in vessels for example azimuth thrusters tunnel thrusters and so on fossen 2011 the components of fuel consumption from these thrusters can be classified as 2 categories force and moment from the viewpoint of energy conversion the objective function can be expressed as sum of two parts 1 min j u α i 1 m w i u i α α 0 t ψ α α 0 where w i the power consumption of ith thruster u i the axial force of ith thruster u u 1 u m α azimuth angles vector of thrusters m the number of thrusters the first part represents the sum of consumption of m thrusters resulting from thrust force the second part is the fuel consumption generated by the rate of change in azimuths α 0 previous status of azimuth vector t transpose of vector in this work in order to convert the rate of change of azimuths into energy features a transfer variable ψ is used here it is worthy to note that ψ is not a weight compared with first part and not used to tune the second part of objective function the function of ψ is the same as those of w i only depending on the fuel features of the individual thrusters in dps the fuel consumption will vary according to external load of wind currents and waves in a time sample it is also reasonable to expect that each part of eq 1 to be minimized concurrently this will lead to another kind of optimization problem multiobjective optimization problem mop lobato and steffen 2017 briefly the problem can be expressed as follows 2 min f 1 f 2 where f 1 i 1 m w i u i f 2 α α 0 t ψ α α 0 2 1 2 decision variables the primary objective of ta subsystem is to distribute the commanded thrust into the individual actuators therefore the thrust and azimuth angle of each actuator are chosen as decision variables consequently slack variables are usually adopted in many works johansen and fossen 2013 the main idea of introducing of slack variables is to get a feasible solution in case of failure of primary objective of ta commanded force exceed the capability of the ta subsystem etc the objective of optimization will be changed to finding minimal value of allocation error in the previous works the introducing of slack variables also leads to the increase of components in objective function johansen and fossen 2013 therefore the original optimization problem has been changed now however the mathematical operation of equivalent transition boyd and vandenberghe 2004 should not change the original objective function furthermore this slack variable virtual force cannot contribute the fuel consumption of the dps in fact the fuel consumption which generated from generalized force can only be obtained from real thrust of individual actuators eq 1 in practical design the difference between commanded and achieved generalized force is permitted due to the uncertainty of external load wind currents and waves and can be limited in some extent through appropriate constraints setting in this work the models with without slack variables are also studied and compared 2 1 3 constraints the constraints of ta problem can include individual capacity of thrusters rate of limits azimuth thrusters and singularity avoiding johansen et al 2004 johansen and fossen 2013 in the previous works the bounds of slack variables are determined through setting the corresponding weight i e item s t q s as large as possible if slack variables are taken into consideration the tolerance of slack variable vector should be determined first the singularity will emerge for some combinations of azimuth angles in case of singularity the commanded generalized force cannot be achieved and the manipulation of vessels will be lost this case should be avoided in design and operation the key feature of singular configuration of thrusters is that the configure matrix b α hasn t full rank in mathematics therefore in order to taking singularity avoiding into consideration an additional constraint is added as follows 3 r a n k b α m where rank means the rank of matrix similar to the slack variables analysis the singularity avoiding should not contribute the fuel consumption actually the dynamic increase in power consumption due to near singular configurations will be expressed in the enlargement of thruster or variation of angles rather than the singularity items in objective function directly through weight johansen et al 2004 2 1 4 models in this work according to the analysis above 3 kinds of optimization models are proposed in this work they are listed in table 1 the model 1 is identical to those of johansen et al 2004 ω in model 1 is a weight compare to the 1st part of j u s α johansen et al 2004 2 2 optimization algorithms in this subsection 3 types of optimization algorithms are described briefly the additional computational mechanism of sqp multi start method is given first a newly developed metaheuristic algorithm mine blast algorithm mba and its updated version imba will be introduced then these 3 approaches are used to find the minimization of fuel consumption of dps in a time span however in the multiobjective optimization analysis a specific time instant is selected first the objective function space at this time point will be explored through nsga ii approach 2 2 1 sqp multi start sqp is a gradient based optimization in this method a quadratic programming qp sub problem will be constructed and solved bfgs method can be used to update the hessian matrix of the lagrangian expression during iteration nocedal and wright 2006 an initial guess solution should be provided to the algorithm different initial solutions may lead to different local minimal values the sqp method has been used for ta problem by many researchers e g liang and cheng 2004 johansen et al 2004 witkowska and śmierzchalski 2018 in order to find the global minimal solution one method is to run the sqp solver from various initial points concurrently the evaluations load can be distributed among a number of processors and increase the speed of execution however the parallel gradient estimation will be disabled the evaluations are run on processors independently in fact the final minimal value can be filtered from this sqp multi start mechanism then 2 2 2 mba and imba mine blast algorithm is newly developed metaheuristic algorithm for optimization which is inspired from the mechanism of landmines explosion sadollah et al 2012 during the process of blast the shrapnel pieces will be thrown they may collide with other shrapnel pieces thus leading further explosions i e more victims will be generated suppose if we want to clear the mines in the field the goal is just to find the mine with the most explosive effect the position of the mine corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem minimal or maximum value of function the mba is designed to find the mine with the most casualties in which the casualties of each of shrapnel piece are calculated by cost function i e objective function the total procedure of mba can be classified as 3 phases 1 initialization 2 exploration and 3 exploitation 1 initialization phase similar to other methods mba is also a population based algorithm the initial population n p o p also the number of shrapnel pieces n s is generated randomly from the decision space and can be expressed by 4 x 0 x l r a n d x u x l where x 0 first short point x l and x u are lower and upper bounds of the decision variables respectively r a n d random numbers which is distributed uniformly in 0 1 suppose x is the current location of population 5 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m 2 where m 2 is the number of the decision variables assume this initial solution is the best point i e x b e s t x 0 2 exploration phase in order to explore the search space comprehensively an exploration factor μ is introduced in the exploration phase of mba this factor is also a border between exploration phase and exploitation phase the function of exploration will decrease along with iteration history the distance of shrapnel pieces will shrink on the contrary the power of exploitation will increase then the landmine explosion location triggered by shrapnel pieces are calculated as follows 6 x e d t 1 r a n d n 2 cos θ t 1 2 μ 7 x e x b e s t x e t μ 8 θ k 360 n s k 1 2 n s 1 where θ the shrapnel angle randn uniformly distributed random number d t 1 the distance of the thrown shrapnel piece at t 1 th iteration the initial distance x u x l will be decreased gradually to increase the global search ability through following expression 9 d t d t 1 exp t α 1 t 1 2 3 m a x i t e r a t i o n where α 1 the reduction constants 3 exploitation phase when iteration step t μ mba will go to the exploitation phase it tries to find the solution closet to the current best solution then the mechanism used for this phase can be expressed as follows 10 x e d t 1 r a n d cos θ t μ m a x i t e r a t i o n 11 x e x b e s t x e t μ m a x i t e r a t i o n the improved version of mba imba a new location updating formulation is proposed as 12 x e x e exp 1 d r a n d x b e s t x b e s t 1 where d is the euclidean distance between current and last best landmines m 2 dimensions the schematic view of imba is shown in fig 1 sadollah et al 2014 in order to handling constraints a direct approach is employed coello coello and montes 2002 deb 2000 four rules are included according to the features objective function values and violation of constraints of each solution more details about mba and imba including initial parameters setting and convergence criteria etc can be found in the works of sadollah et al 2012 and sadollah et al 2014 2 2 3 nsga ii the multiobjective optimization problem mop is defined to find a vector which satisfies a vector of functions which are usually in conflict with each other coello coello et al 2007 in this case the word optimization means that the solutions to the problem are acceptable to the designer in mop several functions are to be optimized simultaneously and a set of solutions will be obtained rather than one unique solution in sop usually a decision making procedure is required for designer to select the final compromising solution branke et al 2008 a key concept in mop is pareto optimal which means that there exists no feasible solution which would decrease some criterion without increase of at least another criterion for minimization problem concurrently coello coello et al 2007 for example in eq 2 in this work no other feasible x in the solution set x p exists such that f 1 x f 1 x p and f 2 x f 2 x p for at least one objective many approaches are available for solving mop such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithm moea coello coello et al 2007 multiobjective particle swarm optimization mopso mousa et al 2012 and multiobjective simulated annealing mosa bandyopadhyay et al 2008 nsga ii is a well known approach in moea proposed by deb et al 2002 three features are embedded into the flowchart of algorithm 1 elitist principle 2 diversity preserving mechanism and 3 non dominated solution emphasis the main procedure of optimization can be summarized as follows 1 offspring population q t population size n is created from parent population p t through ordinary evolutionary operators 2 merge these two populations into a new population r t population size 2 n 3 non domination sorting operation upon r t several non domination fronts will be formed 4 new population forming in last allowed front the points with the highest diversity will be chosen the schematic view of nsga ii procedure is shown in fig 2 2 3 data analysis the distributed force and moment for individual actuators in dps can be obtained from above single or multiobjective optimization process if only one total fuel consumption objective is considered the minimal objective function is the final solution however if two separate objective functions eq 2 are selected concurrently the solutions of the problem is a set of pareto solutions another decision procedure is needed for finding final solution from this solution set moreover in order to find the features of objectives relationships between decision variables and objective function s a widely used data analysis approach self organizing mapping som kohonen 2013 is utilized in this work the hidden information in the ta problem can be mined through this approach from the definition of ta the feasible solutions will be infinite due to that the dps is an over actuated mechanical system the optimization task is to find a solution or a set of solutions with some minimal criterion while satisfying constraints the ta problem usually includes several decision variables and one or more than one objective function the space composed from decision variables and objective function s is a high dimensional one during the optimization procedure so many feasible solutions with high dimensions will be obtained and they can be expressed as follows 13 data x 11 x 1 q x n 1 x n q where n entities in the dataset q attributes or properties under consideration n value is determined by the solution size in optimization process the attributes may include thrust and angles of individual actuators and objectives eq 2 the som algorithm is first proposed by t kohonen in 1982 the som network is a kind of unsupervised learning network with which the data in high dimensional space can be mapped to one or two dimensional grid the network learns to form its own classifications of the training data without external help a typical som architecture is shown in fig 3 a som map of size 20 12 units neighborhoods size 1 2 and 3 of the unit marked with black dot the som network has 2 layers the input layer is connected to the cell in the output layer the map before training the units of map are initialized first when data pattern is given to som the distance between every unit will be calculated then the best matching unit bmu can be selected according to nearest euclidean distance after the network has been trained the pattern reflecting the input data will be mapped to the units in the map more details about som algorithm may refer to kohonen s work 2013 3 numerical examples and discussion 3 1 rov model in this section thrust allocation of a remotely operated vehicle rov is studied this virtual rov is a modification of minerva kajanus 2014 a 4dof control model this model is rated for 700 m depth 4 thrusters are equipped in the rov compared with original minerva the thrusters no 3 4 have been changed into azimuth thrusters for the present research purpose the thrust layout of this rov is shown in fig 4 the parameters used for simulation of this virtual rov are listed in table 2 the designed generalized force will be transformed into thruster revolutions rpm the max revolutions of thrusters are 1450 rpm the thruster coefficients between force and rpm are also given in table 2 the label c and c represent the positive and negative rotational direction of the thrust force respectively in this work the coupling effect between roll pitch are neglected and 4dof i e surge sway heave and yaw remained therefore the thruster configuration matrix b can be expressed as 14 b c o s α 1 s i n α 1 0 l 1 x 0 0 1 0 c o s α 3 s i n α 3 0 l 3 x sin α 3 l 3 y c o s α 3 c o s α 4 s i n α 4 0 l 4 x sin α 4 l 4 y c o s α 4 during the optimization the rank of b matrix should be equal 4 thus singularity avoiding can be achieved 3 2 optimization examples according to the analysis in section 2 3 optimization models are constructed here the upper and lower bound of decision variables are shown in tables 3 and 4 for these models respectively slack variables are decision variables in example 1 its bounds should be defined clearly before optimization according to the definition of slack variable difference between commanded force and achieved force it should be as small as possible in this example it is given rather small values i e between 1 n and 1 n however slack variables are not considered in examples 2 and 3 the rate of change thrust force is set as 20 n i e δ u i m i n 20 n δ u i m a x 20 n i 1 2 3 4 while the rate of change in azimuths is 40 i e δ α i m i n 40 δ α i m a x 40 i 1 3 4 an example of the external force history is shown in fig 5 kajanus 2014 the main task of ta is to distribute 4 directional forces surge sway heave and moment in yaw τ x y z n into the 4 thrusters that is to find suitable combinations of decision variables in tables 3 and 4 3 3 results and discussions in this work all optimization tasks are carried out on matlab 2016b with windows 7 64bit environment intel i5 3470 cpu 4 cores 3 20 ghz 4 0 gb ram 3 examples are studied and the results are list as follows 3 3 1 example 1 this example is solved by traditional sqp sqp multi start and mba approaches respectively the parameters for sqp are max iterations 1000 constraint tolerance and step tolerance are set as 1 e 3 respectively 100 random initial start points are used in sqp multi start via matlab s parallel computation in mba algorithm population size ns 30 number of objective function evaluations nfes is 10000 max iteration 500 the switchover point for exploration and exploitation μ is 100 max iteration 5 the mba algorithm was run 50 times independently to collect the lowest value for comparison in this example the weights among components of objective function are used i e q 1000 d i a g 1 1 1 1 kajanus 2014 ω 1000 d i a g 1 1 1 and ϱ 1 e 3 ε 1 e 2 the objective functions of the three approaches are listed in fig 6 the results of sqp are highly dependent on the initial point at the beginning of the computation the initial point is provided just from decision space different initial points will lead different final function values distinct peaks can be seen in the curve of sqp result in fig 6 moreover each run of sqp may also result in different solutions the result from multi start mechanism can erase these peaks in fact it is an envelope for objective values from many runs of traditional sqp computation the additional computation cost in multi start is rather little in this example only about 1 8s is needed for 100 initial start points running the result of mba is quite close to that of sqp multi start before 80s when time is larger than 80s the deviation between these 2 methods is little higher the time cost for each time step in mba is about 10 2s features of the decision variables between sqp multi start and mba are depicted in fig 7 compared with sqp multi start the decision variables of mba will have many local variations peaks and valleys in the history this is due to the feature of ta problem and the intrinsic global searching attribute of mba as a complex engineering problem many local peaks will emerge in the objective space it will be seen from the maps of som in the following sections at each time step the mba similar to other population based metaheuristic approaches will generate a new initial population this random and completely new population will be quite different from last time step and will lead to a rather different final objective value thus the variations of decision variables may be sharp in fig 7 the searching capability in decision space of mba is demonstrated here for example the bounds for slack variables are 1 1 it can be seen that this bound is utilized by mba to a great extent in fig 7 d on the contrary the sqp multi start mechanism will confine this searching ability thus the history curve will be much smoothly it is worthy to be noted that even local variations exist in the history of decision variables these solutions of mba approach satisfied all constraints from the figuration matrix b and layout of rov it can be seen that the force in heave direction is conducted by u 2 independently the force constraint in this direction b 3 2 u 2 τ 3 s 3 is only about u 2 i e independent on other variables s 3 is a small value in sqp multi start and mba therefore the history of u 2 from these two approaches are quite close figs 7 a b 3 3 2 example 2 the introduction of slack variables is to ensure that optimization problem always has a feasible solution johansen et al 2004 it should be noted that the original optimization question has been changed due to 1 increase of slack variable vector and 2 modification of constraints and objective function the physical meaning of this additional objective function s t q s resulted from these mathematic operations are questionable the actual fuel consumption cannot be generated from this virtual variable in fact moreover the achieved force either large or less than the commanded force should be considered as a whole then transform it into power consumption according to the physical law thrust power relationship in ship motion i e the first part of objective function rather than just two independent parts in example 1 the slack variable vector is defined as difference between achieved force and commanded force and it is small based on this idea example 1 can be transformed to example 2 in terms of constraint handling that is the equality constraint which contains slack variables is replaced with such inequality constraint suppose ε 1 is a much smaller value e g 1 e 3 this handling is common in optimization analysis and widely used in actual engineering design only consumption generated from actual thrust forces and moments are considered in example 2 the consumption of rotation from azimuth thrusters can be studied from actual physical law or experimental study the scope of this work is just a more general testing of optimization rather than a detailed exploration of the performance for rov design in example 2 ψ 1000 d i a g 1 1 1 1 even this value is identical to that ω in example 1 however this variable is still supposed from physical law between rotation angle and fuel consumption the singularity avoiding is achieved by adding a constraint about rank of b matrix listed in table 1 this example is solved by imba and sqp multi start respectively the objective function and relative difference percent between these two approaches are given in fig 8 it is found that the difference of objectives from these 2 methods is very small in the vessel motion period compared with example 1 slack variables are not considered in example 2 the search space decreases the time consumption decrease due to the variation of search space in optimization is not distinct however history of the decision variables for example 2 are shown in fig 9 local peaks and valleys does exist in imba in example 2 too however the amplitude of variation is smaller than those in example 1 this is due to the enhance power of imba in the exploitation phase new location updating formulation is based on previous best solution 12 i e focusing on the solution closed to the current best solution the searching space has been confined by current best solution and its surrounding space which is composed by previous status and current location this mechanism will lead to less variation in the history plot compared with original mba this may suggest that with the emphasis of exploitation phase more smooth of history plot would be expected the discarding of slack variables is based on the equivalence of the optimization problem in example 2 the objective function and all constraints of these 2 examples are different actually for example even the similar history trend can be found in figs 7 and 9 for these 2 approaches the differences of objectives thrusts and azimuth angles between 2 examples are clearly shown in fig 10 the objective components of slack variables and singularity issue are neglected in example 2 it is expected that the overall fuel consumption will decrease as shown in fig 10 a it should be noted that the objective functions used in this work is deduced from a standard qp problem the power of sqp algorithm can be seen than compared with sqp or sqp multi start the application fields of mba imba or other metaheuristic algorithms are much wide 3 3 3 example 3 in this example a multiobjective optimization problem is studied the two components of consumption f 1 and f 2 are considered as objective functions concurrently the other settings are identical to those of the example 2 this problem is defined at some time step for example time 60s in the rov motion history at this time the external vector is τ 42 82 n 256 00 n 19 04 n 1 50 n m u 0 1 6774 e 02 n 2 3738 e 01 n 5 6231 e 01 n 7 1721 e 01 n m α 0 1 6226 e 00 rad 9 1647 e 01 rad 2 5010 e 00 rad respectively the parameters of nsga ii are as follows population size 200 maximum iteration number 2000 crossover probability 0 9 mutation probability 0 1 distribution index of crossover and mutation 20 deb et al 2002 respectively the pareto solutions obtained at the end of iteration are shown in fig 11 in the previous work johansen et al 2004 the four components of objective function come from multiple aspects including penalization of slack variables and singularity avoiding 3 kinds of weights are added there in fact that handling is just an application of priori preference articulation in multiobjective optimization coello coello et al 2007 i e the decision making procedure is made before search the multiobjective problem has been converted into a single objective optimization the search space for original problem decrease heavily therefore only one solution will be found at last nsga ii is a posteriori preference articulation method taking the ranking and sorting of pareto solution into consideration thus provide more alternative solutions for designers in fig 11 all 200 populations are solutions of the example 3 the designer can choose any one as final solution depending on the preference of oneself this means that an additional decision making procedure is needed after multiple optimization solving process deb 2001 according to this example the fuel consumption of thrust force are quite large than that of rotation the decision making of these solutions is easy it should be noted that if a real physical law about rotation angle and fuel consumption is used and the values of f 1 and f 2 are at same level more efforts may be required in the decision making procedure then the relationship between decision variables and f 1 is provided in fig 12 it can be seen that the variations of decision variables of actuators are small 3 4 data mining in example 3 the main task is to find the pareto set fig 11 at this time step the external force is determined by environment wind current and waves during the evolutionary procedure of nsga ii so many feasible solutions will be generated refer to fig 2 pareto set is a kind of special feasible solutions which satisfying the definition of multiple optimization problem coello coello et al 2007 it is interesting to explore the whole objective function space to get much insight of this ta problem this whole feasible space for example 3 is given in fig 13 the pareto set also pareto front in fig 13 locates at the left down corner the relationships between objectives f 1 and f 2 and decision variables thrusts and angles can be mined through som technique som is a kind of widely used technique in data mining field it can map higher dimension data into 2 dimension and provide visual images hidden information in the data set can be found through reading those maps the dimension of data set is 9 which is the sum of 2 objective functions 4 thrusts and 3 azimuth angles the all feasible samples obtained in finding pareto set process are collected in example 3 the number of samples is 342039 therefore the size of data set eq 13 for som analysis is 342039 9 here the mapping procedure is conducted with the help of som toolbox vesanto 2002 a freeware matlab code developed in helsinki university the map was created on 94 units high and 31 units wide hexagonal plane the component graphs are shown in fig 14 the information of these graphs is visualized concurrently all 342039 samples are expressed in these units when a variable changes location in its graph the other dimension values in other graphs will also change corresponding locations in a similar pattern polzlbauer 2008 the designer can obtain correlation difference among these attributes from fig 14 1 the variation trends of f 1 and f 2 are similar this phenomenon suggests that when f 1 increase f 2 will increase too the correlation about these two objective functions is high this feature can also be observed from fig 13 2 several areas with different colors exist in f 1 and f 2 graphs it shows that this thrust problem is a multi peak optimization problem the traditional gradient based optimization algorithm is sensitive to local initial solution in order to find global minimal value it should jump out local optimal values it can also be observed that many different combinations of decision variables will lead to the almost same objective functions 3 the higher objective function areas locate at the lower left part of f 1 and f 2 graphs in these areas the main contribution of f 1 is u 1 i e x directional thrust the contributions from other 3 directions are small as for rotational fuel consumption f 2 the main components are two aft azimuth thrusters i e thrusters 3 4 4 the no 2 thruster is response for z directional motion of the vessel mainly its force variation is quite small suggests its contribution to the power consumption is nearly a constant 5 the angles variation trends of aft 2 thrusters are similar but the upper and lower bounds of them are different the angles of lateral thruster no 1 however vary in contrary direction 4 conclusions in this work the thrust allocation problem in ship applications is studied based on optimization and data mining techniques the optimization models are revisited and constructed according to fuel consumption the slack variables and singularity avoiding are considered traditional sqp and its multi start mechanism mba and imba nsga ii are used to research the thrust allocation of a rov example followed by a useful data mining procedure with the help of som technique several conclusions and recommendations for future work can be given here 1 previous work about thrust allocation which is based on single optimization objective can be extended to a multiobjective problem original single objective composed from several aspects of the thrust allocation can be treated as separate several objective functions concurrently rather than combined with weights the sum weighted approach confined the search space in fact much insight can be obtained from mop and data mining techniques 2 sqp is sensitive to the initial solution the sqp will lead to local optimal value due to the random choice of initial solution the very close to global solution could be found by adding multi start mechanism in sqp the local peak can be erased through this mechanism in fact the envelope line can be filtered from many runs of sqp results through this mechanism additional time costs are not distinct with the help of parallel computation of matlab software 3 mba can be applied in thrust allocation problem the variation of decision variable will be larger than those of sqp multi start this is due to the intrinsic feature of global searching ability of mba itself in decision space the constraints are satisfied and the accuracy of objective function is well if the local searching ability is strengthened in exploitation phase imba the variation of decision variable will decrease then this may suggest that if one wants to erase those sharp variations just like sqp the local search could be given more attention 4 the time cost of metaheuristic algorithms is higher than those of sqp and sqp multi start because dps is a very low speed motion control procedure the time cost for thrust allocation using metaheuristic algorithms in real engineering applications is still acceptable 5 additional decision procedure is needed after the pareto set has been obtained from multiobjective optimization sophisticated decision making techniques are so many and easily used for choosing final compromise solution 6 som technique can be used in thrust allocation to find hidden information of the optimization model the contribution of thrust or angles for fuel consumption can be learned from the component graphs for future works it is suggested that more attention can be paid to the exploitation phase of metaheuristic algorithms hybrid algorithms which composed by metaheuristic approach and local search algorithm either metaheuristic or gradient based such as sqp could be tested in future also it is worth to explore the dynamic thrust allocation i e the total fuel consumption in a time period 
22423,corrosion assessment analysis and failure pressure prediction of pipelines with corrosion defects are essential in the integrity assessment of transmission pipelines a series of semi empirical corrosion criteria have been proposed to predict the failure pressure however the influence of defect width on the failure pressure is not considered in theory in this paper an improved model for the end capped pipe with infinite length defect is developed based on plastic instability theory and finite strain theory by considering the corrosion depth and width the constitutive behavior of the pipe steel material is characterized by a power law hardening stress strain curve thus two theoretical solutions are developed based on von mises and tresca criteria by considering the strain hardening effect finite element analysis and sixty one full scale burst tests for each pipe with a single longitudinal defect are performed to validate and define the application scope of these new solutions the results show that the proposed model based on von mises criterion makes the best prediction and is suitable for the cases of defect length longer than 20 d t keywords strength criterion corrosion defect failure pressure analytical solution corrosion depth corrosion width 1 introduction pipelines have been widely used as an efficient means of high volume transportation for oil gas and other products in petroleum chemical and other energy industries however the corrosive media transported by pipelines the corrosive substances within the seawater and the soil around the pipeline usually generate local corrosion defects on its inner and outer walls which destroys the integrity of the pipeline structure these reduce its ultimate bearing capacity and increase the possibility of leakage or catastrophic burst accident jin et al 2004 meanwhile corrosion has been recognized as one of the most common causes of damage and failures in onshore and offshore oil and gas transmission pipelines in western europe and north america bolt and owen 1999 eiber et al 1995 hence accurate assessment of the defect and prediction of burst pressure are two important considerations in engineering designs for the safety and integrity assessment of pipelines the burst pressure is defined as the ultimate load or failure pressure of a pipe at plastic collapse which represents the maximum load bearing capacity of the pipe under internal pressure over the past decades extensive experimental numerical and theoretical investigations have been conducted to estimate the burst pressure of corroded pipes and several methods and criteria for corrosion defect assessment have been developed stephens and francini 2000 bjørnøy et al 2004 cosham et al 2007a belachew et al 2009 besel et al 2010 some of these methods have been incorporated in industry practices while others exist in published literatures however early analyses of failure pressure did not consider the material hardening behavior in the early 1970s battelle maxey et al 1972 developed a semi empirical ng 18 surface crack equation to predict the residual strength of corroded pipelines whereafter the american society of mechanical engineering asme b31g 1991 proposed the asme b31g standard for corrosion evaluation based on ng 18 equation by considering the experimental burst data available from real pipes with corrosion defects removed from service at that time subsequently kiefner and vieth 1989 1990 developed the modified b31g standard or 0 85 dl method and used rstreng effective area method to analyze the corroded area however recent experimental data have shown that these methods are extremely conservative fu and batte 1999 stephens et al 1999 cronin and pick 2000 kim et al 2002a with rstreng being slightly less conservative than b31g this conservatism is due to the definition of the flow stress related to the specified minimum yield stress syms as the critical failure strength moreover several newer residual strength criteria have been developed based on ultimate tensile stress uts including the lpc criterion by british gas fu and batte 1999 pcorrc criterion by battelle stephens et al 1999 and the dnv rp f101 standard by british gas and norwegian classification society dnv dnv rp f101 2015 to improve the predictions of failure pressure these criteria significantly improved the failure pressure predictions for corrosion defects in comparison with the olders in addition other residual strength criteria including api 579 standard by the american petroleum institute api rp579 1990 bs 7910 standard by the british standards association bs 7910 2005 and cas z184 m86 standard by the canadian standards association n a z184 m86 and gas pip 1996 have been developed in recent years however none of these methods completely considered the effect of material hardening modern pipeline steels such as x70 and x80 with higher tensile strengths have different hardening behavior than the traditional low strength steels meanwhile zhu and leis 2005a discovered that the strain hardening of materials has a significant effect on the failure behavior of line pipes thus different failure criteria may predict different limit pressure of pipes based on the strain hardening behavior of the material corrosion may be difficult to characterize because it usually has an irregular depth profile and extends in an irregular pattern in longitudinal and circumferential directions to briefly describe the profile a corrosion defect in a pipeline is represented by several length scale parameters namely depth d longitudinal length l and circumferential width w chouchaoui and pick 1994 fu and kirkwood 1995 and batte et al 1997 have shown that the longitudinal extent of a corroded area is the most important parameter for the burst strength under internal pressure loading while the influence of corrosion width on failures is insignificant meanwhile defects in the longitudinal orientation are the most severe since they alter the hoop stress distribution and promote bulging concurrently current assessment practices use a single simple corrosion geometry while the corrosion circumferential width w is not considered however chiodo et al chiodo and ruggieri 2009 indicated that the stress based criteria in failure pressure predictions exhibit a potential dependence on defect geometry furthermore the effect of the width to length ratios of the corrosion defect on the failure pressure was investigated by other authors fekete and varga 2012 chen et al 2009 su et al 2016 they obtained the calculation formulas of the failure pressure from the regression analysis of the finite element fe results based on the corrosion depth length and width the accuracies of these formulas were verified by full scale test results however these formulas were statistical results and did not reflect the failure mechanism of corroded pipelines completely this paper reviews the most commonly used strength based evaluation methods for corrosion defect assessments these solutions are then extended to a corroded pipe with an infinitely long defect furthermore a plastic collapse model for end capped pipes with infinite length corrosion defect is developed for power law strain hardening materials based on the instability of deformation and finite strain theory in addition new theoretical closed forms solutions of failure pressure for defect are proposed based on von mises and tresca criteria and the associated deformation theory of plasticity to validate the proposed model finite element analysis and extensive full scale burst tests for various pipeline steels are analyzed and compared with different evaluation methods 2 corrosion assessment methods real corrosion defects can occur in any size shape and orientation however this research considers only single and longitudinally oriented blunt corrosion defects in thin walled pipes where the defect length is larger than its width defect interaction sharp cracks and crack like flaws are not considered here in all cases only physical models are addressed without considering safety factors several existing design methods have been widely used in the pipeline industry to estimate the reliability assessment of corroded pipelines namely asme b31g modified asme b31g 0 85 dl rstreng effective area shell 92 dnv rp f101 part b and pcorrc methods however these methods take into account only the corrosion depth d and longitudinal length l parameters in their equations and ignore the corrosion depth w and strengthening effect of the material is not considered systematically in addition all these methods are semi empirical these methods are usually based on a fracture mechanics semi empirical relationship assuming that failure is due to a flow stress σ f dependent mechanism and can therefore be described by the tensile properties yield strength or ultimate tensile strength of the pipe steel these methods are similar in their general form of a failure pressure fp model which is originated from the ng 18 surface flaw equation a semi empirical flow stress dependent form of the part wall failure criterion developed by battelle maxey et al 1972 1 p f σ f 2 t d 1 a a 0 1 a a 0 1 m where a 0 is the intact longitudinal area before the corrosion defect takes place i e a 0 lt and a is the corroded area which is a function of the defect depth d and length l these areas correspond to metal loss projections in the longitudinal plane based on the wall thickness in this direction different defect shapes such as parabolic 2 3 dl rectangular dl or mixed 0 85 dl approaches have been proposed d is the nominal outer diameter of the pipe t is the nominal wall thickness m is the folias or bulging factor which is a geometry correction factor to account for the stress concentration that is caused by radial deflection of the pipe surrounding a defect σ f is the flow stress of pipe steel several modifications have been made to the above parameters based on available test data and study techniques these include i flow stress σ f ii defect profile or projected corrosion area a and iii geometry correction factor folias factor or bulging correction factor m 2 1 asme b31g based on the ng 18 equation a corrosion defect assessment criterion called asme b31g asme b31g 1991 was developed in the early 1980s with consideration of experimental burst data available at that time for real corrosion defects removed from service for a short corrosion defect with a length l 20 d t b31g assumed that the corroded area has a parabolic shape with a curved bottom and for a long corrosion defect with a length l 20 d t b31g assumed that the corroded area is a rectangle with a flat bottom therefore the failure pressure of corroded pipeline was obtained as 2 p f σ f 2 t d 1 2 3 d t 1 2 3 d t m for l 20 d t σ f 2 t d 1 d t for l 20 d t the flow stress of pipeline steel is defined as 3 σ f 1 1 smys where smys denotes the specified minimum yield stress and m is defined as 4 m 1 0 8 l d t 2 2 2 modified b31g 0 85 dl method in order to reduce the over conservatism of asme b31g criterion that may cause unnecessary replacement of corroded pipes kiefner and vieth 1989 1990 proposed a modified version of asme b31g in a prci report as 5 p f σ f 2 t d 1 0 85 d t 1 0 85 d t m this modified b31g criterion was also called 0 85 dl method where corroded area was assumed to be larger than a parabola and the factor of 2 3 in eq 2 was replaced by 0 85 to support their test data in eq 5 the flow stress was redefined as 6 σ f s m y s 68 95 mpa and the bulging factor was given as 7 m 1 0 6275 l d t 2 0 003375 l d t 4 for l 50 d t 3 3 0 032 l d t 2 for l 50 d t 2 3 rstreng effective area method in order to more accurately represent the real corrosion area with a river bottom profile an effective area method was proposed by kiefner and vieth 1989 1990 to estimate the remaining strength of the corroded pipe 8 p f σ f 2 t d 1 a d a 0 1 a d a 0 m where the flow stress is given in eq 6 the bulging factor is given in eq 7 ad denotes the effective area of a complex corrosion profile and a0 lt is the cross section area with the maximum defect length this effective area method permits to determine accurate corroded area using the discrete method and thus to determine more accurate burst pressure for a real corrosion defect 2 4 shell 92 in 1995 ritchie and last cosham et al 2007b believed that the use of 0 9σ u as the reference stress would give a relatively conservative prediction of the ultimate internal pressure of corroded pipelines based on this assumption shell92 method was proposed as follows 9 p f 0 9 σ u 2 t d t 1 d t 1 d t m where σ u is the ultimate tensile strength of pipeline steel and the bulging factor was given by eq 4 2 5 dnv rp f101 part b this recommended practice emerged from a collaboration between dnv det norske veritas and bg technology through comprehensive databases of burst tests and 3d non linear finite element simulations it is preferred for carbon steel pipelines with inner or outer corrosion defects corrosion seam welds interacting colonies and metal loss due to routine repairs dnv rp f101 2015 the dnv burst pressure initiates with a simplified approach of a capacity equation using a rectangular shape 10 p f σ u 2 t d t 1 d t 1 d t q where the bulging factor was given as 11 m 1 0 31 l d t 2 2 6 pcorrc criteria pcorrc was developed by stephens leis from the battelle company under the sponsorship of the line pipe research supervisory committee of prc international stephens et al 1999 this approach predicts the remaining strength of corroded pipelines that have a moderate to high toughness based on a plastic collapse failure this strength was determined based on a series of fe analyses of elliptical defects using pcorr which is a shell based finite element code to estimate the stress and strain the obtained expression is shown in eq 12 12 p f σ u 2 t d 1 d t 1 exp 0 157 l d t d 2 for a corrosion defect with a very long rectangle profile the folias factor m is assumed to be infinite thus the equations listed above can be simplified as 13 p f σ f 2 t d 1 d t σ f smys 68 95 mpa for ng 18 modified b 31 g and rstreng 1 1 smys for asme b 31 g smts for shell 92 dnv rp f 101 and pcorrc meanwhile theoretical models zl models based on plastic instability theory were developed to improve the failure pressure prediction for defect free pipes by zhu and leis 2005b the models considered the strain hardening response for defect free pipes based on tresca and von mises criterion the failure pressure solutions were then extended to an infinitely long defect in the plastic collapse analysis via the ligament thickness of t d zhu and leis 2012 given below 14 p f k 2 n 1 4 t σ u d 1 d t k 1 for tresca criterion 2 3 for von mises criterion where n is the strain hardening exponent the above corrosion evaluation methods and the proposed theoretical models in eq 14 were evaluated using experimental burst data for long machined defects and long real corrosion defects cut from the pipes removed from service zhu and leis 2012 the asme b31g method was found to be over conservative for long defects while rstreng was conservative for short defects however for long corrosion defects considered the proposed zl model based on von mises criterion seemed to predict a better result and the pcorrc or dnv rp f101 predicted reasonably conservative results 3 analytical failure pressure of infinitely long corrosion since the stress and strain states within the defect zone are similar to the corresponding states of an intact pipe this paper derives the closed form analytical solutions of the failure pressure for pipelines with infinitely long corrosion defect by partially referring to zhu leis zhu and leis 2003 theory 3 1 basic assumptions the following assumptions have been adopted to obtain the analytical solutions of the failure pressure for pipelines with infinitely long corrosion defects 1 corrosion is assumed to be volume like defect rather than crack like flaw 2 defect is idealized as infinitely long in the longitudinal direction the actual corrosion shape is simplified as an idealized constant depth shape as shown in fig 1 3 the pipe is considered to be a thin walled structure thus the radial and shear stresses are ignored 4 the material is incompressible the volume of the corrosion and non corrosion zones remain unchanged during the deformation process 5 the residual wall thickness within the corrosion zone decreases while the wall thickness in the non corrosive zone remains unchanged during the deformation process 3 2 stress strain relationship the strain hardening behavior of the material has a great influence on the failure of the pipeline at the initiation of burst a ductile pipeline usually experiences large plastic deformation mok mok et al 1991 found that the post yield behavior of the material can be expressed by a power law relationship through five sets of tensile tests of x52 and x60 pipe steel given as 15 σ k ε n where σ and ε are the uniaxial true stress and true strain in simple tension respectively k is the strength coefficient and n is the strain hardening exponent the parameters k and n can be determined by curve fitting of experimental data in the measured true stress strain curve as 16 k σ u n n e n n σ u 17 n ε u ln 1 ε u where σ u and σ u are the true stress and the engineering stress at the ultimate load respectively e 2 7183 is the natural constant ε u and ε u are the true stain and the engineering strain corresponding to the ultimate load respectively 3 3 stress and strain in corrosion region consider a long thin walled pipe having an infinitely long rectangle defect with end caps subjected to internal pressure the radial stress can be ignored for this case i e σ r 0 fig 1 shows the general stress distribution of the pipe cross section where r 1 and r 0 are the current inner and original inner radii respectively d 1 and d 0 are the current and original corrosion depths respectively θ 1 and θ 0 are the current and original corrosion circumferential half angles respectively t 0 is the original pipe wall thickness p is the internal pressure load σ θc and σ wc are the hoop stresses within the corrosion zone and the pipe wall respectively σ zc and σ zw are the axial stresses within the corrosion zone and the pipe wall respectively s zc and s zw are the cross sectional areas of the corrosion zone and the pipe wall zone symmetrical to the corrosion zone respectively when an internal pressure p is applied the pipe cross section maintains a static equilibrium state the equilibrium equation for the moment at point q is given by 18 σ θ c t 0 d 1 2 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 t 0 2 0 π p r 1 r 1 t 0 2 sin θ d θ where q is the midpoint of the wall thickness of s zw in the oil and gas industry a transmission pipeline usually has a large diameter and a thin wall thickness which often leads to a high diameter to thickness ratio say d t 30 therefore the ratio of t 0 to r 0 or r 1 is very close to zero and can thus be neglected the hoop stress expression is obtained by simplifying eq 18 as 19 σ θ c 2 p r 1 1 t 0 2 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 t 0 d 1 2 r 1 t 0 2 r 1 p r 1 t 0 d 1 a zero moment is obtained by the axial stresses in the cross section which is expressed as 20 2 0 θ 1 σ z c t 0 d 1 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 2 cos θ d θ 2 0 π θ 1 σ z w t 0 r 1 t 0 2 2 cos θ d θ furthermore the resultant force of the axial stresses in the cross section should be equal to the force of the internal pressure on the end caps which is given as 21 σ z c t 0 d 1 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 2 θ 1 σ z w t 0 r 1 t 0 2 2 π 2 θ 1 p π r 0 2 from eq 20 22 σ z c σ z w t 0 1 t 0 2 r 1 2 t 0 d 1 1 t 0 d 1 2 r 1 2 t 0 t 0 d 1 substituting eq 22 into eq 21 to obtain σ zc and σ zw 23 σ z c p r 0 2 2 r 1 t 0 d 1 24 σ z w p r 0 2 2 r 1 t 0 according to eqs 19 and 23 25 σ θ c σ z c 2 r 1 2 r 0 2 with m r 0 2 2 r 1 2 the axial stress in the corroded area is expressed using hoop stress as 26 σ z c m σ θ c meanwhile based on assumption 3 the radial stress of the pipe is ignored i e 27 σ r c 0 in the three dimensional stress state von mises effective stress is determined as 28 σ m σ θ c 2 σ θ c σ z c σ z c 2 1 m m 2 p r 1 t 0 d 1 freire et al 2006a conducted a series of burst tests of corroded pipes and confirmed that the axial strain in the corroded region was very small with respect to the hoop strain in the corroded region and can thus be neglected i e ε zc 0 for a finite strain formulation the strain displacement relation within corrosion region for a thin walled pipe is expressed as 29 ε θ c ln r 1 t 0 d 1 2 θ 1 r 0 t 0 d 0 2 θ 0 ln r 1 θ 1 r 0 θ 0 30 ε r c ln t 0 d 1 t 0 d 0 ln t 0 t 1 where t 0 t 0 d 0 and t 1 t 0 d 1 represent the remaining wall thickness before and after deformation respectively when the applied pressure in the pipe approaches its maximum value failure pressure plastic deformation will dominate the total deformation of the pipe such that the elastic deformation can be ignored cronin and pick 2002 for a large plastic deformation the condition of volume incompressibility is approximately met as ε θc ε zc ε rc 0 from eqs 29 and 30 31 ε θ c ε r c 2 ε θ c ln r 1 θ 1 r 0 θ 0 t 0 t 1 the von mises effective strain is then given by 32 ε m 2 3 ε θ c 2 ε r c 2 ε z c 2 2 3 ε θ c 2 3 ln r 1 θ 1 r 0 θ 0 from eqs 31 and 32 33 r 1 θ 1 t 1 r 0 θ 0 t 0 e 3 ε m 3 4 failure pressure solutions for infinite length defect theoretical solutions to predict the failure pressure of pipes with infinite length defect based on plastic instability theory will be derived in this subsection according to assumption 4 the volume of the corrosion and non corrosion zones remain unchanged during the deformation process such that the following two relationships can be obtained 34 r 0 t 0 2 θ 0 t 0 r 1 t 1 2 θ 1 t 1 35 r 0 t 0 2 π θ 0 t 0 r 1 t 0 2 π θ 1 t 0 the ratio of pipe diameter to wall thickness d t is large enough to assume that the values of t 0 2r 0 t 0 2r 0 and t 1 2r 0 can be neglected thus the following relationships can be obtained by simplifying eqs 34 and 35 36 r 0 θ 0 t 0 r 1 θ 1 t 1 37 r 0 π θ 0 r 1 π θ 1 substituting eq 36 into eq 33 38 t 1 t 0 e 3 ε m 2 substituting eq 36 into eq 37 39 r 1 t 1 r 0 1 β t 1 r 0 β t 0 t 1 2 where β θ 0 π is a dimensionless corrosion circumferential half angle representing the half corrosion width substituting eqs 16 28 and 32 into eq 15 to obtain the pressure of the corroded pipe 40 p 1 1 m m 2 t 0 d 0 r 0 e n n σ u ε m n e 3 ε m 2 1 β β e 3 ε m 2 note that the expression of p consists of three parts which can be represented by a b and c respectively as shown in eqs 41 43 for a certain pipe steel the strain hardening exponent n and engineering ultimate tensile strength σ u are known therefore part a can be considered as a constant however parts b and c are functions of effective strain ε m which affect the failure pressure 41 a t 0 d 0 r 0 e n n σ u 42 b 1 1 m m 2 43 c ε m n e 3 ε m 2 1 β β e 3 ε m 2 plastic collapse or instability of the pipe can be mathematically defined using the limit condition p ε m 0 however the limit effective strain cannot be obtained feasibly by solving p ε m 0 since the parameters m and ε m in eq 40 are coupled to each other such that it is difficult to obtain a relatively simple partial differential equation for simplicity regardless of the relationship between the parameters b and c in eq 40 and considering that they are independent of each other the pipe reaches its limit state when b and c reach their respective maximum values from m r 0 2 2 r 1 2 0 1 2 one obtains b 1 2 3 since the deformation mainly occurs in the defect area the difference in the pipe radius before and after deformation is not obvious therefore the value of m can be considered to be approximately equal to 1 2 and the value of b equal to 2 3 from eq 43 44 c ε m ε m n 1 e 3 ε m 2 n 1 β β e 3 ε m 2 3 ε m 2 1 β 2 β e 3 ε m 2 1 β β e 3 ε m 2 2 if we set 45 a e 3 2 ε m solving c ε m 0

pressure p f m of a corroded pipe with infinite length defect based on von mises criterion can finally be determined as 48 p f m 2 3 n 1 e n n σ u t 0 d 0 r 0 ln a n a a β a 2 β the failure pressures p f t of a corroded pipe with infinite length defect based on tresca criteria can be determined by similar procedures as above however the detailed derivation process is not described here due to the constraints of space hence only the effective stress effective strain and the corresponding failure derived from tresca criterion are given as follows 49 σ t σ θ c σ r c 2 p r 1 2 t 0 d 1 50 ε t ε θ c

classical yield criteria can be expressed by the following general form 52 p f k n 1 e n n σ u 2 t 0 d 0 2 t 0 1 d 0 t 0 ln a n a a β a 2 β k 1 for tresca criterion 2 3 for von mises criterion where d

pipeline steel grades from grade b to x80 the estimated value of n ranges from 0 076 to 0 217 zhu and leis 2003 therefore the failure pressure predicted by eq 53 is a little larger than those predicted by eq 54 grade b is the highest hardening steel with the largest relative error of 16 23 and x80 is the lowest hardening steel with the smallest relative error of 5 42 for the case of β 1 corresponding to a fully circumferential defect eq 52 is simplified as 56 p f 1 proposed k n 1 2 e n n σ u 4 t 0 d 0 2 t 0 1 d 0 t 0 ln a n a 2 k 1 for tresca criterion 2 3 for von mises criterion

between eq 52 and eq 57 as shown in fig 2 was carried out the ratio of p f proposed to p f zhu leis decreases as β increases the ratio is close to 1 when β 1 indicating that the predicted values of these two formulas are nearly equal for a pipe with a fully circumferential defect while the ratios are in the range of 1 02 1 12 when β 0 4 application and validation 4 1 failure behavior of longitudinal defects long and short corrosion defects are two metal loss damage defect geometries that may occur in oil and gas pipelines the terms long and short defects defined in this paper mean blunt corrosion flaws that are longitudinally oriented with long or short lengths the difference between the behavior of a short defect and a long defect is based on the support given by the full thickness material that surrounds the defect freire et al 2006a a short defect is supported by the full thickness material at its four sides its two longitudinal sides and two circumferential sides as the longitudinal defect length l increases the support given to the defect by the full thickness material located along the circumferential sides decreases in the hypothetical situation of an infinitely long defect the support of the circumferential sides vanishes thus a long defect is mainly supported by the full thickness material at its two longitudinal sides the pressure strength of longitudinal defect is a function of its length l the longer the defect the lower the failure pressure however there is a limit value for l beyond which the increasing length of corrosion defect results in an insignificant reduction of the failure pressure therefore the defect whose length is longer than this limit value l l can be considered to have the same pressure strength of an infinitely long defect thus diverse forms of l l have been developed by different research institution and scholars as listed in table 1 4 2 numerical validation freire benjamin et al freire et al 2006b carried out nine full scaled burst tests for api 5 l x60 pipeline with axial long corrosion to study the internal pressure failure mechanism the nominal outside diameter nominal wall thickness and length of the specimens were respectively 323 9 mm 12 75 in 9 53 mm 3 8 in and 2 m resulting in a nominal d t 34 detailed finite element analyses fea were performed using the commercial fea software abaqus standard due to symmetry only one quarter of the specimen was modeled as shown in fig 3 mesh convergence study was carried out to ensure computational efficiency and accuracy four layers were divided along the thickness of the defect grid transition was conducted outside of the range of 75 mm around the defect to reduce the amount of element the eight node quadratic parametric element with reduced integration c3d8r was used in the numerical simulation applied load was internal pressure only symmetric displacement boundary conditions were employed in this fe model experimental data of true stress true strain curve for x60 pipeline steel were adopted as input data of material properties in the fea as shown in fig 4 the yield stress was 452 mpa the ultimate tensile stress was 542 mpa and so y t 0 834 in all fea calculations the elastic modulus e 207 gpa and poisson s ratio was taken as ν 0 3 large strains and displacements stress stiffening and material nonlinearity were all considered the modified risk algorithm was used for it is particularly effective at passing over limit point the failure load of interest was the burst capacity which was quantified by the maximum pressure a pipeline is able to sustain in the fe models the defect dimensionless depth d t was selected as 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 dimensionless length l d t was selected as 20 6 0 10 and 15 which present the long defect dimensionless width β was selected as 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 appendix a presents the failure pressure predicted by the fea and those predicted by the proposed method the relative errors and the basic statistics of these two predicted results are calculated and summarized in table 2 which are also displayed in fig 5 the relative error was calculated as error 100 predicted fea fea the results in table 2 show that the maximum error minimum error and mean error of the proposed method based on von mises criterion are 5 57 2 90 and 0 59 respectively which indicates that the von mises criterion based method can predict the failure pressure of defected pipelines with l 20 d t excellently to the contrary the maximum error minimum error and mean error of the proposed method based on tresca criterion are 19 21 11 96 and 14 95 respectively indicating that the tresca criterion based method shows a poor prediction of the failure pressure of defected pipelines with l 20 d t with obvious conservatism in addition the mean relative errors for l d t 20 6 10 15 are 2 76 1 17 0 66 0 91 respectively it indicates that the prediction result from the von mises based method is more accurate with the increase of defect length except the case of l d t 15 which is slightly larger than the case of l d t 10 from the comparison it can be obtained that the results from the proposed method based on the von mises criterion are in good agreement with the fe results 4 3 experimental validation the corrosion length is not infinite in actual conditions therefore it is necessary to define the application scope of the proposed formulas to predict the failure pressure of actual corrosion pipelines in this paper a database of 61 full scale burst tests for corroded pipes were established based on the data published in literatures mok et al 1991 freire et al 2006b kim et al 2002b 2004 chen and meng 1998 shuai et al 2017 mannucci and harris 2002 to compare the predictive accuracy of different assessment methods and to define the application scope of the proposed formulas the specimens were thin walled i e d t 20 and subjected to internal pressure only each specimen contained a single isolated external machine simulated milled or spark eroded metal loss defect these defects were longitudinally oriented and flat bottomed with uniform depth d and uniform width w i e the shape of the metal loss area was rectangular with smooth edges the specimen index number was consistent with that in literatures while the superscript indicates the literature number the mean values of the measured wall thickness of the specimen and the minimum measured residual wall thickness of the defect were used to calculate the predicted failure pressure the residual wall thickness value was assumed to be the same all over the defect even for rstreng effective area method that considers defect variations where necessary the mean yield stress and ultimate stress were used the parameters representing the pipe strength and defect geometry are given in appendix b while the range of specific parameters for the burst tests are listed in table 3 appendix c presents the failure pressure measured in the laboratory tests of all the specimens along with those predicted by asme b31g 0 85 dl rstreng effective area shell92 dnv rp f101 pcorrc zhu leis and the proposed method the results are also displayed in fig 6 and can be seen that the proposed method and zhu leis method based on von mises criterion can provide better predictions compared to the tresca method the relative errors of the predicted pressure with respect to the actual pressure are calculated and summarized in appendix d the basic statistics of prediction relative errors are calculated and summarized in table 4 the results in table 4 show that the maximum errors of the assessment methods are greater than 0 while the minimum errors are less than 0 indicating that the methods may both overestimate and underestimate the residual strength of corroded pipelines however the maximum and minimum errors of the proposed method and zhu leis method based on tresca criterion are less than zero indicating that these tresca based methods underestimate the residual strength of corroded pipelines in addition the average relative error of each method is between 37 04 and 4 62 indicating that all the methods provide relatively conservative predictions from statistical analysis for all test specimens having l d t between 0 43 and 17 61 0 85 dl method presents the smallest mean error 4 62 with a coefficient of variation cov of 3 56 which gives the best prediction of actual failure pressure this is followed by the dnv rp f101 method mean error of 5 13 and cov of 2 47 and pcorrc method mean error of 8 92 and cov of 1 23 the asme b31g method is apparently over conservative for all specimens and has a poor predictive accuracy mean error of 20 72 and cov of 0 75 meanwhile shell 92 is more conservative than dnv rp f101 although they have similar expressions the former method employs 0 9σ u rather than σ u as the material strength and a more conservative equation for calculating the folias factor zhu and leis 2005a concluded that the tresca flow solution predicted a lower bound and the von mises flow solution predicted an upper bound of the failure pressure for defect free pipes however the proposed method and zhu leis method based on von mises criterion give the better prediction of actual failure pressure when compared to the methods based on tresca criteria in table 4 thus only the methods based on von mises criterion are discussed in the following text what s more the proposed method and zhu leis method are both conservative for all specimens with mean errors of 17 87 and 26 28 respectively this is because both methods were derived based on the hypothesis of infinite length defect which ignore the support that the full thickness material located along the circumferential sides gives to the defect thus these two methods are not applicable for short defects 4 4 application of the proposed formula as mentioned in table 1 there are diverse forms of l l which define the dividing line of infinitely long defect therefore different subsets of specimens can be obtained based on l l however no specimen with a defect length greater than 2d exists thus the value of 2d is not considered based on the experimental results in section 4 3 fig 7 shows the actual versus predicted failure pressures using different methods for cases with l l l table 5 lists the mean error of the failure pressure predictions for different l l when l l l while fig 8 shows the mean error results when l l is equal to 20 d t in table 5 the proposed method criterion presents the smallest mean error 3 70 which gives the best prediction of actual failure pressure although the average prediction results are slightly less than the actual results it also can be concluded that the proposed method predicts the failure pressure of steel pipelines with defect longer than 20 d t thereby establishing its validity moreover all the methods provide relatively conservative predictions except 0 85 dl method which gives a non conservative prediction with a mean error of 4 33 the reason may be that 0 85 dl method assumes an arbitrary profile with the 0 85 factor in the equation to present the actual rectangle profile which introduces some inaccuracy in this situation dnv rp f101 method also provides good predictions with a mean error of 5 41 when compared to the other methods as mentioned above the asme b31g method is the most conservative when l l is defined as 50 d t 20 0 d t 0 75d and d the proposed method still provides the most accurate prediction for all the subsets of the test data with mean errors of 0 43 2 59 4 01 and 1 35 respectively while the average mean relative error is 1 21 indicating that the proposed method provides good predictions regardless of the value of l l moreover all the methods provide relatively conservative predictions except 0 85 dl method the dnv rp f101 method provides relatively better predictions than the other methods while the asme b31g method is the most conservative theoretically the prediction result should be more accurate as l increases this is because the support effect that the full thickness material located along the circumferential sides gives to the defect weakens as l increases therefore the prediction accuracy should be the highest when l l 20 0 d t and higher when l l 50 d t in comparison with l l 20 d t this conclusion is verified when l l 50 d t with an average error of 0 43 which is more accurate than the corresponding value of l l 20 d t 3 70 however the prediction for l l 200 d t with an average error of 2 59 is not the most accurate due to the small sample size selected hence it is difficult to make a general conclusion even so the prediction results are still acceptable when l l 200 d t therefore the value of l l is determined to be 20 d t to expand the application scope of the proposed formula the parameters describing the geometry of the pipe generally include the diameter d and the wall thickness t thus it is more common to represent the length of the defect as d t hence l 0 75d and l d are not discussed in detail in this paper however the conclusions made for both cases are consistent with the previous conclusions 5 conclusions this paper investigated the failure pressure assessment methods for steel pipeline with a single longitudinally oriented corrosion defect two improved theoretical solutions were proposed by considering the effect of strain hardening and corrosion width on the failure pressure to predict the residual strength of pipe with an infinite long defect based on von mises and tresca criteria respectively from the present study the following conclusions were made 1 considering the effect of corrosion width the proposed analytical formulas could theoretically reflect the failure mechanism of corroded pipelines under internal pressure according to the instability theory of deformation 2 the numerical method suggested for the validation of the proposed model indicates that the proposed method in terms of von mises criterion can predict the failure pressure of defected pipelines with l 20 d t very well 3 based on the full scale burst tests of specimen pipes with machined corrosion defects the results from the commonly used assessment methods and the proposed solutions were compared all the methods may overestimate or underestimate the residual strength of corroded pipelines the proposed analytical method based on von mises criterion shows the best prediction of the failure pressure of pipeline containing a long corrosion defect with l 20 d t in comparison with current methods acknowledgments this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology of china

22423,corrosion assessment analysis and failure pressure prediction of pipelines with corrosion defects are essential in the integrity assessment of transmission pipelines a series of semi empirical corrosion criteria have been proposed to predict the failure pressure however the influence of defect width on the failure pressure is not considered in theory in this paper an improved model for the end capped pipe with infinite length defect is developed based on plastic instability theory and finite strain theory by considering the corrosion depth and width the constitutive behavior of the pipe steel material is characterized by a power law hardening stress strain curve thus two theoretical solutions are developed based on von mises and tresca criteria by considering the strain hardening effect finite element analysis and sixty one full scale burst tests for each pipe with a single longitudinal defect are performed to validate and define the application scope of these new solutions the results show that the proposed model based on von mises criterion makes the best prediction and is suitable for the cases of defect length longer than 20 d t keywords strength criterion corrosion defect failure pressure analytical solution corrosion depth corrosion width 1 introduction pipelines have been widely used as an efficient means of high volume transportation for oil gas and other products in petroleum chemical and other energy industries however the corrosive media transported by pipelines the corrosive substances within the seawater and the soil around the pipeline usually generate local corrosion defects on its inner and outer walls which destroys the integrity of the pipeline structure these reduce its ultimate bearing capacity and increase the possibility of leakage or catastrophic burst accident jin et al 2004 meanwhile corrosion has been recognized as one of the most common causes of damage and failures in onshore and offshore oil and gas transmission pipelines in western europe and north america bolt and owen 1999 eiber et al 1995 hence accurate assessment of the defect and prediction of burst pressure are two important considerations in engineering designs for the safety and integrity assessment of pipelines the burst pressure is defined as the ultimate load or failure pressure of a pipe at plastic collapse which represents the maximum load bearing capacity of the pipe under internal pressure over the past decades extensive experimental numerical and theoretical investigations have been conducted to estimate the burst pressure of corroded pipes and several methods and criteria for corrosion defect assessment have been developed stephens and francini 2000 bjørnøy et al 2004 cosham et al 2007a belachew et al 2009 besel et al 2010 some of these methods have been incorporated in industry practices while others exist in published literatures however early analyses of failure pressure did not consider the material hardening behavior in the early 1970s battelle maxey et al 1972 developed a semi empirical ng 18 surface crack equation to predict the residual strength of corroded pipelines whereafter the american society of mechanical engineering asme b31g 1991 proposed the asme b31g standard for corrosion evaluation based on ng 18 equation by considering the experimental burst data available from real pipes with corrosion defects removed from service at that time subsequently kiefner and vieth 1989 1990 developed the modified b31g standard or 0 85 dl method and used rstreng effective area method to analyze the corroded area however recent experimental data have shown that these methods are extremely conservative fu and batte 1999 stephens et al 1999 cronin and pick 2000 kim et al 2002a with rstreng being slightly less conservative than b31g this conservatism is due to the definition of the flow stress related to the specified minimum yield stress syms as the critical failure strength moreover several newer residual strength criteria have been developed based on ultimate tensile stress uts including the lpc criterion by british gas fu and batte 1999 pcorrc criterion by battelle stephens et al 1999 and the dnv rp f101 standard by british gas and norwegian classification society dnv dnv rp f101 2015 to improve the predictions of failure pressure these criteria significantly improved the failure pressure predictions for corrosion defects in comparison with the olders in addition other residual strength criteria including api 579 standard by the american petroleum institute api rp579 1990 bs 7910 standard by the british standards association bs 7910 2005 and cas z184 m86 standard by the canadian standards association n a z184 m86 and gas pip 1996 have been developed in recent years however none of these methods completely considered the effect of material hardening modern pipeline steels such as x70 and x80 with higher tensile strengths have different hardening behavior than the traditional low strength steels meanwhile zhu and leis 2005a discovered that the strain hardening of materials has a significant effect on the failure behavior of line pipes thus different failure criteria may predict different limit pressure of pipes based on the strain hardening behavior of the material corrosion may be difficult to characterize because it usually has an irregular depth profile and extends in an irregular pattern in longitudinal and circumferential directions to briefly describe the profile a corrosion defect in a pipeline is represented by several length scale parameters namely depth d longitudinal length l and circumferential width w chouchaoui and pick 1994 fu and kirkwood 1995 and batte et al 1997 have shown that the longitudinal extent of a corroded area is the most important parameter for the burst strength under internal pressure loading while the influence of corrosion width on failures is insignificant meanwhile defects in the longitudinal orientation are the most severe since they alter the hoop stress distribution and promote bulging concurrently current assessment practices use a single simple corrosion geometry while the corrosion circumferential width w is not considered however chiodo et al chiodo and ruggieri 2009 indicated that the stress based criteria in failure pressure predictions exhibit a potential dependence on defect geometry furthermore the effect of the width to length ratios of the corrosion defect on the failure pressure was investigated by other authors fekete and varga 2012 chen et al 2009 su et al 2016 they obtained the calculation formulas of the failure pressure from the regression analysis of the finite element fe results based on the corrosion depth length and width the accuracies of these formulas were verified by full scale test results however these formulas were statistical results and did not reflect the failure mechanism of corroded pipelines completely this paper reviews the most commonly used strength based evaluation methods for corrosion defect assessments these solutions are then extended to a corroded pipe with an infinitely long defect furthermore a plastic collapse model for end capped pipes with infinite length corrosion defect is developed for power law strain hardening materials based on the instability of deformation and finite strain theory in addition new theoretical closed forms solutions of failure pressure for defect are proposed based on von mises and tresca criteria and the associated deformation theory of plasticity to validate the proposed model finite element analysis and extensive full scale burst tests for various pipeline steels are analyzed and compared with different evaluation methods 2 corrosion assessment methods real corrosion defects can occur in any size shape and orientation however this research considers only single and longitudinally oriented blunt corrosion defects in thin walled pipes where the defect length is larger than its width defect interaction sharp cracks and crack like flaws are not considered here in all cases only physical models are addressed without considering safety factors several existing design methods have been widely used in the pipeline industry to estimate the reliability assessment of corroded pipelines namely asme b31g modified asme b31g 0 85 dl rstreng effective area shell 92 dnv rp f101 part b and pcorrc methods however these methods take into account only the corrosion depth d and longitudinal length l parameters in their equations and ignore the corrosion depth w and strengthening effect of the material is not considered systematically in addition all these methods are semi empirical these methods are usually based on a fracture mechanics semi empirical relationship assuming that failure is due to a flow stress σ f dependent mechanism and can therefore be described by the tensile properties yield strength or ultimate tensile strength of the pipe steel these methods are similar in their general form of a failure pressure fp model which is originated from the ng 18 surface flaw equation a semi empirical flow stress dependent form of the part wall failure criterion developed by battelle maxey et al 1972 1 p f σ f 2 t d 1 a a 0 1 a a 0 1 m where a 0 is the intact longitudinal area before the corrosion defect takes place i e a 0 lt and a is the corroded area which is a function of the defect depth d and length l these areas correspond to metal loss projections in the longitudinal plane based on the wall thickness in this direction different defect shapes such as parabolic 2 3 dl rectangular dl or mixed 0 85 dl approaches have been proposed d is the nominal outer diameter of the pipe t is the nominal wall thickness m is the folias or bulging factor which is a geometry correction factor to account for the stress concentration that is caused by radial deflection of the pipe surrounding a defect σ f is the flow stress of pipe steel several modifications have been made to the above parameters based on available test data and study techniques these include i flow stress σ f ii defect profile or projected corrosion area a and iii geometry correction factor folias factor or bulging correction factor m 2 1 asme b31g based on the ng 18 equation a corrosion defect assessment criterion called asme b31g asme b31g 1991 was developed in the early 1980s with consideration of experimental burst data available at that time for real corrosion defects removed from service for a short corrosion defect with a length l 20 d t b31g assumed that the corroded area has a parabolic shape with a curved bottom and for a long corrosion defect with a length l 20 d t b31g assumed that the corroded area is a rectangle with a flat bottom therefore the failure pressure of corroded pipeline was obtained as 2 p f σ f 2 t d 1 2 3 d t 1 2 3 d t m for l 20 d t σ f 2 t d 1 d t for l 20 d t the flow stress of pipeline steel is defined as 3 σ f 1 1 smys where smys denotes the specified minimum yield stress and m is defined as 4 m 1 0 8 l d t 2 2 2 modified b31g 0 85 dl method in order to reduce the over conservatism of asme b31g criterion that may cause unnecessary replacement of corroded pipes kiefner and vieth 1989 1990 proposed a modified version of asme b31g in a prci report as 5 p f σ f 2 t d 1 0 85 d t 1 0 85 d t m this modified b31g criterion was also called 0 85 dl method where corroded area was assumed to be larger than a parabola and the factor of 2 3 in eq 2 was replaced by 0 85 to support their test data in eq 5 the flow stress was redefined as 6 σ f s m y s 68 95 mpa and the bulging factor was given as 7 m 1 0 6275 l d t 2 0 003375 l d t 4 for l 50 d t 3 3 0 032 l d t 2 for l 50 d t 2 3 rstreng effective area method in order to more accurately represent the real corrosion area with a river bottom profile an effective area method was proposed by kiefner and vieth 1989 1990 to estimate the remaining strength of the corroded pipe 8 p f σ f 2 t d 1 a d a 0 1 a d a 0 m where the flow stress is given in eq 6 the bulging factor is given in eq 7 ad denotes the effective area of a complex corrosion profile and a0 lt is the cross section area with the maximum defect length this effective area method permits to determine accurate corroded area using the discrete method and thus to determine more accurate burst pressure for a real corrosion defect 2 4 shell 92 in 1995 ritchie and last cosham et al 2007b believed that the use of 0 9σ u as the reference stress would give a relatively conservative prediction of the ultimate internal pressure of corroded pipelines based on this assumption shell92 method was proposed as follows 9 p f 0 9 σ u 2 t d t 1 d t 1 d t m where σ u is the ultimate tensile strength of pipeline steel and the bulging factor was given by eq 4 2 5 dnv rp f101 part b this recommended practice emerged from a collaboration between dnv det norske veritas and bg technology through comprehensive databases of burst tests and 3d non linear finite element simulations it is preferred for carbon steel pipelines with inner or outer corrosion defects corrosion seam welds interacting colonies and metal loss due to routine repairs dnv rp f101 2015 the dnv burst pressure initiates with a simplified approach of a capacity equation using a rectangular shape 10 p f σ u 2 t d t 1 d t 1 d t q where the bulging factor was given as 11 m 1 0 31 l d t 2 2 6 pcorrc criteria pcorrc was developed by stephens leis from the battelle company under the sponsorship of the line pipe research supervisory committee of prc international stephens et al 1999 this approach predicts the remaining strength of corroded pipelines that have a moderate to high toughness based on a plastic collapse failure this strength was determined based on a series of fe analyses of elliptical defects using pcorr which is a shell based finite element code to estimate the stress and strain the obtained expression is shown in eq 12 12 p f σ u 2 t d 1 d t 1 exp 0 157 l d t d 2 for a corrosion defect with a very long rectangle profile the folias factor m is assumed to be infinite thus the equations listed above can be simplified as 13 p f σ f 2 t d 1 d t σ f smys 68 95 mpa for ng 18 modified b 31 g and rstreng 1 1 smys for asme b 31 g smts for shell 92 dnv rp f 101 and pcorrc meanwhile theoretical models zl models based on plastic instability theory were developed to improve the failure pressure prediction for defect free pipes by zhu and leis 2005b the models considered the strain hardening response for defect free pipes based on tresca and von mises criterion the failure pressure solutions were then extended to an infinitely long defect in the plastic collapse analysis via the ligament thickness of t d zhu and leis 2012 given below 14 p f k 2 n 1 4 t σ u d 1 d t k 1 for tresca criterion 2 3 for von mises criterion where n is the strain hardening exponent the above corrosion evaluation methods and the proposed theoretical models in eq 14 were evaluated using experimental burst data for long machined defects and long real corrosion defects cut from the pipes removed from service zhu and leis 2012 the asme b31g method was found to be over conservative for long defects while rstreng was conservative for short defects however for long corrosion defects considered the proposed zl model based on von mises criterion seemed to predict a better result and the pcorrc or dnv rp f101 predicted reasonably conservative results 3 analytical failure pressure of infinitely long corrosion since the stress and strain states within the defect zone are similar to the corresponding states of an intact pipe this paper derives the closed form analytical solutions of the failure pressure for pipelines with infinitely long corrosion defect by partially referring to zhu leis zhu and leis 2003 theory 3 1 basic assumptions the following assumptions have been adopted to obtain the analytical solutions of the failure pressure for pipelines with infinitely long corrosion defects 1 corrosion is assumed to be volume like defect rather than crack like flaw 2 defect is idealized as infinitely long in the longitudinal direction the actual corrosion shape is simplified as an idealized constant depth shape as shown in fig 1 3 the pipe is considered to be a thin walled structure thus the radial and shear stresses are ignored 4 the material is incompressible the volume of the corrosion and non corrosion zones remain unchanged during the deformation process 5 the residual wall thickness within the corrosion zone decreases while the wall thickness in the non corrosive zone remains unchanged during the deformation process 3 2 stress strain relationship the strain hardening behavior of the material has a great influence on the failure of the pipeline at the initiation of burst a ductile pipeline usually experiences large plastic deformation mok mok et al 1991 found that the post yield behavior of the material can be expressed by a power law relationship through five sets of tensile tests of x52 and x60 pipe steel given as 15 σ k ε n where σ and ε are the uniaxial true stress and true strain in simple tension respectively k is the strength coefficient and n is the strain hardening exponent the parameters k and n can be determined by curve fitting of experimental data in the measured true stress strain curve as 16 k σ u n n e n n σ u 17 n ε u ln 1 ε u where σ u and σ u are the true stress and the engineering stress at the ultimate load respectively e 2 7183 is the natural constant ε u and ε u are the true stain and the engineering strain corresponding to the ultimate load respectively 3 3 stress and strain in corrosion region consider a long thin walled pipe having an infinitely long rectangle defect with end caps subjected to internal pressure the radial stress can be ignored for this case i e σ r 0 fig 1 shows the general stress distribution of the pipe cross section where r 1 and r 0 are the current inner and original inner radii respectively d 1 and d 0 are the current and original corrosion depths respectively θ 1 and θ 0 are the current and original corrosion circumferential half angles respectively t 0 is the original pipe wall thickness p is the internal pressure load σ θc and σ wc are the hoop stresses within the corrosion zone and the pipe wall respectively σ zc and σ zw are the axial stresses within the corrosion zone and the pipe wall respectively s zc and s zw are the cross sectional areas of the corrosion zone and the pipe wall zone symmetrical to the corrosion zone respectively when an internal pressure p is applied the pipe cross section maintains a static equilibrium state the equilibrium equation for the moment at point q is given by 18 σ θ c t 0 d 1 2 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 t 0 2 0 π p r 1 r 1 t 0 2 sin θ d θ where q is the midpoint of the wall thickness of s zw in the oil and gas industry a transmission pipeline usually has a large diameter and a thin wall thickness which often leads to a high diameter to thickness ratio say d t 30 therefore the ratio of t 0 to r 0 or r 1 is very close to zero and can thus be neglected the hoop stress expression is obtained by simplifying eq 18 as 19 σ θ c 2 p r 1 1 t 0 2 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 t 0 d 1 2 r 1 t 0 2 r 1 p r 1 t 0 d 1 a zero moment is obtained by the axial stresses in the cross section which is expressed as 20 2 0 θ 1 σ z c t 0 d 1 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 2 cos θ d θ 2 0 π θ 1 σ z w t 0 r 1 t 0 2 2 cos θ d θ furthermore the resultant force of the axial stresses in the cross section should be equal to the force of the internal pressure on the end caps which is given as 21 σ z c t 0 d 1 r 1 t 0 d 1 2 2 θ 1 σ z w t 0 r 1 t 0 2 2 π 2 θ 1 p π r 0 2 from eq 20 22 σ z c σ z w t 0 1 t 0 2 r 1 2 t 0 d 1 1 t 0 d 1 2 r 1 2 t 0 t 0 d 1 substituting eq 22 into eq 21 to obtain σ zc and σ zw 23 σ z c p r 0 2 2 r 1 t 0 d 1 24 σ z w p r 0 2 2 r 1 t 0 according to eqs 19 and 23 25 σ θ c σ z c 2 r 1 2 r 0 2 with m r 0 2 2 r 1 2 the axial stress in the corroded area is expressed using hoop stress as 26 σ z c m σ θ c meanwhile based on assumption 3 the radial stress of the pipe is ignored i e 27 σ r c 0 in the three dimensional stress state von mises effective stress is determined as 28 σ m σ θ c 2 σ θ c σ z c σ z c 2 1 m m 2 p r 1 t 0 d 1 freire et al 2006a conducted a series of burst tests of corroded pipes and confirmed that the axial strain in the corroded region was very small with respect to the hoop strain in the corroded region and can thus be neglected i e ε zc 0 for a finite strain formulation the strain displacement relation within corrosion region for a thin walled pipe is expressed as 29 ε θ c ln r 1 t 0 d 1 2 θ 1 r 0 t 0 d 0 2 θ 0 ln r 1 θ 1 r 0 θ 0 30 ε r c ln t 0 d 1 t 0 d 0 ln t 0 t 1 where t 0 t 0 d 0 and t 1 t 0 d 1 represent the remaining wall thickness before and after deformation respectively when the applied pressure in the pipe approaches its maximum value failure pressure plastic deformation will dominate the total deformation of the pipe such that the elastic deformation can be ignored

solutions for infinite length defect theoretical solutions to predict the failure pressure of pipes with infinite length defect based on plastic instability theory will be derived in this subsection according to assumption 4 the volume of the corrosion and non corrosion zones remain unchanged during the deformation process such that the following two relationships can be obtained 34 r 0 t 0 2 θ 0

considered as a constant however parts b and c are functions of effective strain ε m which affect the failure pressure 41 a t 0 d 0 r 0 e n n σ u 42 b 1 1 m m 2 43 c ε m n e 3 ε m 2 1 β β e 3 ε m 2 plastic collapse or instability of the pipe can be mathematically defined using the limit condition p ε m 0 however the limit effective strain cannot be obtained feasibly by solving p ε m 0 since the parameters m and ε m in eq 40 are coupled to each other such that it is difficult to obtain a relatively simple partial differential equation for simplicity regardless of the relationship between the parameters b and c in eq 40 and considering that they are independent of each other the pipe reaches its limit state when b and c reach their respective maximum values from m r 0 2 2 r 1 2 0 1 2 one obtains b 1 2 3 since the deformation mainly occurs in the defect area the difference in the pipe radius before and after deformation is not obvious therefore the value of m can be considered to be

p f t of a corroded pipe with infinite length defect based on tresca criteria can be determined by similar procedures as above however the detailed derivation process is not described here due to the

pipeline steel grades from grade b to x80 the estimated value of n ranges from 0 076 to 0 217 zhu and leis 2003 therefore the failure pressure predicted by eq 53 is a little larger than those predicted by eq 54 grade b is the highest hardening steel with the largest relative error of 16 23 and x80 is the lowest hardening steel with the smallest relative error of 5 42 for the case of β 1

between eq 52 and eq 57 as shown in fig 2 was carried out the ratio of p f proposed to p f zhu leis decreases as β increases the ratio is close to 1 when β 1 indicating that the predicted values of these two formulas are nearly equal for a pipe with a fully circumferential defect while the ratios are in the range of 1 02 1 12 when β 0 4 application and validation 4 1 failure behavior of longitudinal defects long and short corrosion defects are two metal loss damage defect geometries that may occur in oil and gas pipelines the terms long and short defects defined in this paper mean blunt corrosion flaws that are longitudinally oriented with long or short lengths the difference between the behavior of a short defect and a long defect is based on the support given by the full thickness material that surrounds the defect freire et al 2006a a short defect is supported by the full thickness material at its four sides its two longitudinal sides and two circumferential sides as the longitudinal defect length l increases the support given to the defect by the full thickness material located along the circumferential sides decreases in the hypothetical situation of an infinitely long defect the support of the circumferential sides vanishes thus a long defect is mainly supported by the full thickness material at its two longitudinal sides the pressure strength of longitudinal defect is a function of its length l the longer the defect the lower the failure pressure however there is a limit value for l beyond which the increasing length of corrosion defect results in an insignificant reduction of the failure pressure therefore the defect whose length is longer than this limit value l l can be considered to have the same pressure strength of an infinitely long defect thus diverse forms of l l have been developed by different research institution and scholars as listed in table 1 4 2 numerical validation freire benjamin et al freire et al 2006b carried out nine full scaled burst tests for api 5 l x60 pipeline with axial long corrosion to study the internal pressure failure mechanism the nominal outside diameter nominal wall thickness and length of the specimens were respectively 323 9 mm 12 75 in 9 53 mm 3 8 in and 2 m resulting in a nominal d t 34 detailed finite element analyses fea were performed using the commercial fea software abaqus standard due to symmetry only one quarter of the specimen was modeled as shown in fig 3 mesh convergence study was carried out to ensure computational efficiency and accuracy four layers were divided along the thickness of the defect grid transition was conducted outside of the range of 75 mm around the defect to reduce the amount of element the eight node quadratic parametric element with reduced integration c3d8r was used in the numerical simulation applied load was internal pressure only symmetric displacement boundary conditions were employed in this fe model experimental data of true stress true strain curve for x60 pipeline steel were adopted as input data of material properties in the fea as shown in fig 4 the yield stress was 452 mpa the ultimate tensile stress was 542 mpa and so y t 0 834 in all fea calculations the elastic modulus e 207 gpa and poisson s ratio was taken as ν 0 3 large strains and displacements stress stiffening and material nonlinearity were all considered the modified risk algorithm was used for it is particularly effective at passing over limit point the failure load of interest was the burst capacity which was quantified by the maximum pressure a pipeline is able to sustain in the fe models the defect dimensionless depth d t was selected as 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 dimensionless length l d t was selected as 20 6 0 10 and 15 which present the long defect dimensionless width β was selected as 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 appendix a presents the failure pressure predicted by the fea and those predicted by the proposed method the relative errors and the basic statistics of these two predicted results are calculated and summarized in table 2 which are also displayed in fig 5 the relative error was calculated as error 100 predicted fea fea the results in table 2 show that the maximum error minimum error and mean error of the proposed method based on von mises criterion are 5 57 2 90 and 0 59 respectively which indicates that the von mises criterion based method can predict the failure pressure of defected pipelines with l 20 d t excellently to the contrary the maximum error minimum error and mean error of the proposed method based on tresca criterion are 19 21 11 96 and 14 95 respectively indicating that the tresca criterion based method shows a poor prediction of the failure pressure of defected pipelines with l 20 d t with obvious conservatism in addition the mean relative errors for l d t 20 6 10 15 are 2 76 1 17 0 66 0 91 respectively it indicates that the prediction result from the von mises based method is more accurate with the increase of defect length except the case of l d t 15 which is slightly larger than the case of l d t 10 from the comparison it can be obtained that the results from the proposed method based on the von mises criterion are in good agreement with the fe results 4 3 experimental validation the corrosion length is not infinite in actual conditions therefore it is necessary to define the application scope of the proposed formulas to predict the failure pressure of actual corrosion pipelines in this paper a database of 61 full scale burst tests for corroded pipes were established based on the data published in literatures mok et al 1991 freire et al 2006b kim et al 2002b 2004 chen and meng 1998 shuai et al 2017 mannucci and harris 2002 to compare the predictive accuracy of different assessment methods and to define the application scope of the proposed formulas the specimens were thin walled i e d t 20 and subjected to internal pressure only each specimen contained a single isolated external machine simulated milled or spark eroded metal loss defect these defects were longitudinally oriented and flat bottomed with uniform depth d and uniform width w i e the shape of the metal loss area was rectangular with smooth edges the specimen index number was consistent with that in literatures while the superscript indicates the literature number the mean values of the measured wall thickness of the specimen and the minimum measured residual wall thickness of the defect were used to calculate the predicted failure pressure the residual wall thickness value was assumed to be the same all over the defect even for rstreng effective area method that considers defect variations where necessary the mean yield stress and ultimate stress were used the parameters representing the pipe strength and defect geometry are given in appendix b while the range of specific parameters for the burst tests are listed in table 3 appendix c presents the failure pressure measured in the laboratory tests of all the specimens along with those predicted by asme b31g 0 85 dl rstreng effective area shell92 dnv rp f101 pcorrc zhu leis and the proposed method the results are also displayed in fig 6 and can be seen that the proposed method and zhu leis method based on von mises criterion can provide better predictions compared to the tresca method the relative errors of the predicted pressure with respect to the actual pressure are calculated and summarized in appendix d the basic statistics of prediction relative errors are calculated and summarized in table 4 the results in table 4 show that the maximum errors of the assessment methods are greater than 0 while the minimum errors are less than 0 indicating that the methods may both overestimate and underestimate the residual strength of corroded pipelines however the maximum and minimum errors of the proposed method and zhu leis method based on tresca criterion are less than zero indicating that these tresca based methods underestimate the residual strength of corroded pipelines in addition the average relative error of each method is between 37 04 and 4 62 indicating that all the methods provide relatively conservative predictions from statistical analysis for all test specimens having l d t between 0 43 and 17 61 0 85 dl method presents the smallest mean error 4 62 with a coefficient of variation cov of 3 56 which gives the best prediction of actual failure pressure this is followed by the dnv rp f101 method mean error of 5 13 and cov of 2 47 and pcorrc method mean error of 8 92 and cov of 1 23 the asme b31g method is apparently over conservative for all specimens and has a poor predictive accuracy mean error of 20 72 and cov of 0 75 meanwhile shell 92 is more conservative than dnv rp f101 although they have similar expressions the former method employs 0 9σ u rather than σ u as the material strength and a more conservative equation for calculating the folias factor zhu and leis 2005a concluded that the tresca flow solution predicted a lower bound and the von mises flow solution predicted an upper bound of the failure pressure for defect free pipes however the proposed method and zhu leis method based on von mises criterion give the better prediction of actual failure pressure when compared to the methods based on tresca criteria in table 4 thus only the methods based on von mises criterion are discussed in the following text what s more the proposed method and zhu leis method are both conservative for all specimens with mean errors of 17 87 and 26 28 respectively this is because both methods were derived based on the hypothesis of infinite length defect which ignore the support that the full thickness material located along the circumferential sides gives to the defect thus these two methods are not applicable for short defects 4 4 application of the proposed formula as mentioned in table 1 there are diverse forms of l l which define the dividing line of infinitely long defect therefore different subsets of specimens can be obtained based on l l however no specimen with a defect length greater than 2d exists thus the value of 2d is not considered based on the experimental results in section 4 3 fig 7 shows the actual versus predicted failure pressures using different methods for cases with l l l table 5 lists the mean error of the failure pressure predictions for different l l when l l l while fig 8 shows the mean error results when l l is equal to 20 d t in table 5 the proposed method criterion presents the smallest mean error 3 70 which gives the best prediction of actual failure pressure although the average prediction results are slightly less than the actual results it also can be concluded that the proposed method predicts the failure pressure of steel pipelines with defect longer than 20 d t thereby establishing its validity moreover all the methods provide relatively conservative predictions except 0 85 dl method which gives a non conservative prediction with a mean error of 4 33 the reason may be that 0 85 dl method assumes an arbitrary profile with the 0 85 factor in the equation to present the actual rectangle profile which introduces some inaccuracy in this situation dnv rp f101 method also provides good predictions with a mean error of 5 41 when compared to the other methods as mentioned above the asme b31g method is the most conservative when l l is defined as 50 d t 20 0 d t 0 75d and d the proposed method still provides the most accurate prediction for all the subsets of the test data with mean errors of 0 43 2 59 4 01 and 1 35 respectively while the average mean relative error is 1 21 indicating that the proposed method provides good predictions regardless of the value of l l moreover all the methods provide relatively conservative predictions except 0 85 dl method the dnv rp f101 method provides relatively better predictions than the other methods while the asme b31g method is the most conservative theoretically the prediction result should be more accurate as l increases this is because the support effect that the full thickness material located along the circumferential sides gives to the defect weakens as l increases therefore the prediction accuracy should be the highest when l l 20 0 d t and higher when l l 50 d t in comparison with l l 20 d t this conclusion is verified when l l 50 d t with an average error of 0 43 which is more accurate than the corresponding value of l l 20 d t 3 70 however the prediction for l l 200 d t with an average error of 2 59 is not the most accurate due to the small sample size selected hence it is difficult to make a general conclusion even so the prediction results are still acceptable when l l 200 d t therefore the value of l l is determined to be 20 d t to expand the application scope of the proposed formula the parameters describing the geometry of the pipe generally include the diameter d and the wall thickness t thus it is more common to represent the length of the defect as d t hence l 0 75d and l d are not discussed in detail in this paper however the conclusions made for both cases are consistent with the previous conclusions 5 conclusions this paper investigated the failure pressure assessment methods for steel pipeline with a single longitudinally oriented corrosion defect two improved theoretical solutions were proposed by considering the effect of strain hardening and corrosion width on the failure pressure to predict the residual strength of pipe with an infinite long defect based on von mises and tresca criteria respectively from the present study the following conclusions were made 1 considering the effect of corrosion width the proposed analytical formulas could theoretically reflect the failure mechanism of corroded pipelines under internal pressure according to the instability theory of deformation 2 the numerical method suggested for the validation of the proposed model indicates that the proposed method in terms of von mises criterion can predict the failure pressure of defected pipelines with l 20 d t very well 3 based on the full scale burst tests of specimen pipes with machined corrosion defects the results from the commonly used assessment methods and the proposed solutions were compared all the methods may overestimate or underestimate the residual strength of corroded pipelines the proposed analytical method based on von mises criterion shows the best prediction of the failure pressure of pipeline containing a long corrosion defect with l 20 d t in comparison with current methods acknowledgments this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology of china

22424,this research addresses two kinds of problems related to optimal trajectory tracking of a maritime autonomous surface ship mass those caused by the time varying external disturbances including winds waves and ocean currents as well as those resulting from inherent dynamical uncertainties as the paper shows an accurate and robust optimal controller can successfully deal with both issues an improved optimal adaptive super twisting sliding mode control oast smc algorithm is proposed here as a robust optimal adaptive strategy in this strategy in order to improve performance of the standard super twisting approach we apply an approximate dynamic programming adp based optimal tuning of gains and an underlying concept based on time delay estimation tde an adp algorithm is implemented using an actor critic neural network to deal with the curse of dimensionality in hamilton jacobi bellman hjb equation the critical role of tde part in this algorithm is estimating the impact of disturbances and uncertainties on the mass model the results have shown that oast tde significantly outperforms the st tde and ast tde algorithm in terms of the optimal control efforts also compared with a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc proposed controller meets the optimal control efforts and accurate tracking concurrently keywords mass super twisting smc time delay estimation approximate dynamic programming actor critic network optimal adaptive gains 1 introduction contemporary maritime activities can be grouped into surface and underwater operations the latter include underwater explorations inspection of the undersea structures parameter measurement and maritime transportation nowadays marine robotics is one of the paramount research areas in the maritime industries where numerous numbers of researchers institutes and industries have presented kinds of these robots including underwater robot autonomous underwater vehicle auv and autonomous surface vehicle asv in case of ships the term of maritime autonomous surface ship mass has been introduced the international maritime organization imo specifies four degrees of autonomy for mass 1 ship with automated processes and decision support seafarers are on board to operate and control shipboard systems and functions some operations may be automated 2 remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board the ship is controlled and operated from another location but seafarers are on board 3 remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board the ship is controlled and operated from another location there are no seafarers on board 4 fully autonomous ship the operating system of the ship is able to make decisions and determine actions by itself as can be seen the role of human operator is expected to be reduced throughout the development of mass it can also be expected that during this process the exploited ships may fuse two or more degrees of autonomy a common feature of all autonomy degrees is that the diminished role of a human operator results in a larger role of the systems on board this includes control systems and tracking of a given trajectory with the best possible accuracy and minimum control efforts to decrease fuel consumption the latter is particularly challenging in the face of unavoidable time varying disturbances induced by the winds waves and ocean currents upon or under the sea and inherent uncertainties in a marine vehicle dynamical model therefore a high performance control approach is required to tackle with these perturbations the topic of control algorithms for autonomous ships and marine robots has been widely researched in case of this paper the related works can be roughly grouped into 1 nonlinear conventional control algorithms 2 nonlinear robust control algorithms 3 nonlinear robust adaptive control algorithms as for the first group the robustness issue of mpc has always been a challenge many researchers in control theory have presented some approaches to designing robust nonlinear model predictive controllers nmpc an nmpc was used for an unmanned surface vehicle usv in liu et al 2013 this controller was adopted for an underactuated usv to track a desired trajectory using surge force and yaw torque as control inputs however in this paper a normal form of mpc was used without any discussion concerning its robustness also the environmental disturbances including winds currents and waves have not been considered there an improved trajectory tracking controller based backstepping control algorithm combined with sliding mode control method was later designed to address the trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated usv in j j liu et al 2016 an autonomous robotic boat was designed by wang et al 2018 who adopted a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc to tackle with the trajectory tracking problems however the uncertain nonlinearities resulting from the changes in inertia and drag matrices of the robotic boat were not taken into account there this can be a serious limitation considering that the values of these matrices may change drastically when transporting people and goods other weakness of this work was neglecting the influences due to winds waves and ocean current disturbances two kinds of mpc controllers were proposed zheng et al 2014 including nmpc which solved a constrained multi variable nonlinear programming problem and linearized mpc lmpc designed to solved a constrained quadratic programming problem through on line iterative optimization however again the environmental disturbances winds waves and currents were not taken into account regarding the second group the main author of this paper has already presented works in which the robust strategies such as sliding mode control smc and robust model predictive control rmpc were adopted for control of marine robots nejatbakhsh et al 2015 esfahani et al 2013 2014 esfahani 2019 a robust nonlinear model predictive control algorithm was also proposed by abdelaal et al 2018 in this research a nonlinear disturbance observer was adopted to estimate unknown parameters and external disturbances however this observer was able to estimate only constant or very slowly changing disturbances a guidance law for path following of marine vessel was proposed in yi et al 2016 where a singular perturbation method was used to decompose the system into two lyapunov based control subsystems some researches were carried out concerning adopting the higher order sliding mode algorithms such as super twisting for control of the maritime autonomous robots valenciaga 2014 tanakitkorn et al 2017 concerning surface robots two control strategies for the path following goal of an autonomous marine vehicle were presented hung et al 2018 in which the input constraints and disturbances caused by constant ocean currents were dealt with the first approach in this research was obtained by using a lyapunov based design strategy while the second was developed by adopting a mpc algorithm for tuning of gains in a pid controller a self regulator pid was designed jamalzade et al 2016 whose coefficients have been adjusted by using some adaptive fuzzy rules in general despite significant progress none of the above nonlinear conventional control algorithms and nonlinear robust control algorithms managed to successfully combine handling internal and external uncertainty and disturbances with sufficient accuracy in order to successfully deal with uncertainty another approach has been proposed adaptive robust control among others a disturbance observer was proposed in zhang 2018 for the trajectory tracking of unmanned marine vehicles umvs researchers in this work adopted an adaptive law to estimate and compensate the disturbance observer error following this by combining a nonlinear disturbance observer dynamic surface control and adaptive robust backstepping together they developed a dynamic surface adaptive robust controller in another robust adaptive approach huang et al 2019 a nonlinear tracking differentiator combined with a reduced order extended state observer eso was adopted to estimate outer disturbances and inherent uncertainties with a small estimation error another interesting work has been accomplished using the finite time extended state observer based distributed formation control for marine surface vehicles with input saturation and external disturbances in this study researchers proposed a novel algorithm for estimating the unavailable velocity measurements and external disturbances simultaneously the time varying external disturbances induced by winds waves and ocean currents are considered there in the computer simulations fu and yu 2018 a novel robust adaptive formation control scheme based on the minimal learning parameter mlp algorithm and the disturbance observer dob was presented in lu et al 2018 by using the mlp algorithm a remarkable descent in tunable parameters for the controller and dob has been achieved which in turn led to great reduction of the online computational time an artificial intelligence based robust control strategy in the form of a multi layer neural network was combined with adaptive robust techniques in shojaei 2016 this resulted in the control system of great robustness against uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances the proposed approach efficiently compensated both parametric and non parametric uncertainties including time varying disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents a saturated neural adaptive robust output feedback formation controller was designed there to satisfy control objectives researchers liu et al 2015 employed an adaptive sliding mode controller in which a hierarchical sliding mode was adopted to deal with the underactuation of the model neural network as an adaptive part was used there for approximating the unknown nonlinear part in the dynamical model in this way the robustness of the proposed controller was strengthened and the chattering phenomenon of sliding mode strategy was eliminated in this study the nonlinear damping terms of ship s model were considered which are neglected in many studies and the time varying disturbances were taken into account to test the robustness of the designed controller following this the researchers then developed a predictor based robust algorithm adopted for a line of sight approach l liu et al 2016 which offered a significant improvement in the transient response in particular the convergence was greatly sped up due to fast estimation of uncertainties some other efficient algorithms were proposed in sharma et al 2014 where the authors evaluated two novel non linear autopilot designs for mass based on non linear local control network lcn and non linear model predictive control approaches the chosen approaches allowed them to improve the effectiveness in terms of control activity expenditure power consumption and mission duration length under similar operating conditions the above described autopilot systems have been used to control the non linear yaw dynamics of an unmanned surface vehicle named springer in which yaw dynamics of the vehicle has been modelled using a multi layer perceptron type neural network simulation results in this study showed that the autopilot based on local control network method performed better then non linear model predictive control approach apart from the already listed works a robust adaptive approaches may also be successfully adopted to trajectory tracking of an autonomous surface platform which has been evidenced in sun et al 2017 liu et al 2019 overall the sliding mode control based adaptive algorithms are often combined with other solutions in order to control various nonlinear and uncertain dynamical systems the strong argument behind using such a control structure is its promising performance in terms of sufficient robustness disturbance rejection and fast convergence in most of applications an intelligent part such as neural network or fuzzy inference system has been adopted to bring an adaptive attribute for the proposed controllers for instance a double hidden layer recurrent neural network dhlrnn based adaptive global sliding mode controller was proposed for an active power filter apf in which researchers chu et al 2019 fei and chu 2019 used a recurrent neural network rnn in order to estimate the nonlinearities and cope with the unknown system uncertainties and external disturbances in other research on apf fang et al 2019 an adaptive sliding mode control based on the finite time concept was proposed in which a fuzzy neural estimator was designed to tackle the unknown part of dynamical model for a pv grid connected inverter a robust adaptive approach based on sliding mode control algorithm was proposed in zhu and fei 2018 in this research a disturbance observer was used to compensate the external disturbances and also a fuzzy inference system was adopted to meet a promising attenuation in chattering phenomenon other intelligent based sliding mode control algorithm proposed for apf consists of two main parts hou et al 2019 an adaptive fuzzy neural network afnn part was adopted to alleviate the effect of external disturbances and model uncertainties and the second part was designed based on the combination of two control approaches including nonsingular terminal sliding mode and backstepping ntsmb concepts to fulfill the robustness and accuracy considering the above it might be concluded that sliding mode based controllers have an inherent robustness and that they have shown impressive results against uncertainties resulting from parameter variations and external disturbances however the control of autonomous ship brings new challenges which have not been yet directly addressed in the previous studies or have not been solved in a satisfying way namely both the robustness and optimal parameter tuning properties in the control algorithms should be considered during the designing of controllers for mass in order to terminate a task and track a desired trajectory with the best possible accuracy and minimum energy consumption in presence of complex time varying external disturbances it is therefore solving this issue that the current paper aims at in the paper we first and foremost adopt an improved higher order sliding mode based controller st tde as our robust concept for the trajectory tracking of a mass following this two newly proposed control algorithms ast tde and oast tde are presented in order to meet the minimum control efforts motivated by the robust performance of the st tde control algorithm in handling complex disturbances and uncertainties as well as adaptive and near optimal behavior of the adp based control systems we propose a robust optimal control approach which fulfills all the mentioned properties the major achievements of this work are as follows an improved performance in terms of path tracking is achieved in combined st tde algorithm in comparison with the conventional super twisting cst algorithm in the proposed ast tde a lyapunov based adaptive strategy is applied to the super twisting part of st tde algorithm in order to improve the control performance in terms of reducing control efforts in the proposed oast tde an optimal parameter tuning part is designed based on approximate dynamic programming approach as an online optimal solver in order to reduce control efforts in the st tde and decrease fuel consumption without losing the acceptable accuracy in trajectory tracking especially in early stages of tracking near optimal performance similar to the nmpc algorithm has been achieved in the proposed oast tde control algorithm the proposed adp based optimal adaptive tuning algorithm can be extended to applications of other kinds of tunable controllers the rest of the paper is organized as follows a mathematical model of mass with considering all induced conditions such as variation in parameters and external disturbances is described in section 2

promote robustness property and acquire a high performance with an optimal control effort the proposed method consists of two control parts 1 adaptive super twisting ast part and 2 time delay estimation tde part the tde concept is applied here so as to take advantage of its model free nature this part provides an estimation of perturbations by observing the inputs and the states of the mass one step into the past without an exact knowledge of the dynamics and the upper bound of uncertainties as a supplementary part of the proposed algorithm the ast is used to compensate tde error and illuminate chattering as well as to ensure the convergence in an acceptable condition at the same time the applied adaptive law is brought in order to generate adaptive gains which cover the reduction in the control efforts putting together all of the above elements an adaptive super twisting time delay estimation ast tde algorithm is proposed which combines the advantages of the previously described approaches to effectively and accurately control a maritime autonomous surface ship fig 2 illustrates the proposed ast tde controller block diagram this tde based super twisting algorithm can estimate all of the perturbations stemmed from the ocean circumstances and dynamical uncertainties upon the mass and finally this combined approach can achieve a high accuracy for trajectory tracking of the presented maritime autonomous platform also we can define adaptive gains for the super twisting control law given by eq 10 with considering the following theorem theorem regard control input in eq 10 assume that the perturbation p is bounded as p σ s 1 2 where σ 0 is unknown then for any initial conditions η 0 s 0 the sliding surface s 0 will be reached in finite time

in terms of minimum control efforts and optimal velocities this kind of optimal path tracking for maritime autonomous surface ships can lead to minimum fuel consumption in their propulsion systems an actor critic approximate dynamic programming ac adp algorithm is adopted for optimal gain tuning of st tde which is based on a heuristic dynamic programming hdp as a powerful adp algorithm liu et al 2012 si et al 2001 sokolov et al 2015 taking into account δ t as a simulation step size for implementing of ac adp iteration algorithm and optimized gains g a c t as outputs of actor network the optimal adaptive gains of st tde control algorithm in eq 15 k 1 k 2 k t are expressed as follows 16 k t k t 1 δ t g a c t the main concept for the proposed oast tde is illustrated in fig 3 let us define a continuous reward reinforcement signal as follows 17 r t g r t p r g r t t where g r t i t t g a c t t g a c t k a c s u r g e k a c s w a y k a c y a w t p r is a positive definite diagonal matrix with a proper dimensions we define i t including defined sliding surfaces in eq 6 s t s 1 t s 2 t s 3 t t and ship s velocities ϑ t which is applied to the backpropagation actor neural network as an input vector in the input layer 18 i t s 1 t s 2 t s 3 t u t v t r t we adopt a cost to go function as 19 j i t g a c t i 0 ζ r i t i δ t g a c t i δ t in above equation ζ 0 ζ 1 is a discount factor we adopt j i t as a solution of 19 the result of minimization of the mentioned cost to go function which satisfies hjb equation as an optimal solution can be expressed as 20 j i t min o g a c t

hjb equation in other words j i t is approximated by j ˆ i t which is the output of the critic neural network the critic network is a function of i t g a c t where the optimal gains generated by the actor neural network is also the input to the critic neural network let s define an evaluation factor as an error function for the backpropagation critic neural network as follows 21 e c t ζ j ˆ t j ˆ

and number of neurons in hidden layer of critic network respectively n c i n m n is number of inputs in actor network and m is number of outputs in actor network we adopt a hyperbolic tangent threshold activation function for both actor and critic networks as follows 23 σ t 1 e t 1 e t where σ c t σ a t σ t let us define w c 1 and w c 2 as weights of the critic network for its input layer and its output layer respectively also two new variables c j t and θ c j t for the jth neuron in hidden layer are expressed as 24 c j t i 1 n i i t w c 1 i j t i 1 m g a c i t w c 1 i j t j 1 n c h 25 θ c j t σ c c j t 1 e c j t 1 e c j t j 1 n c h 26 j ˆ t j 1 n c h w c 2 j t θ c j t we use a gradient based adaption algorithm for updating the weights of the actor and critic neural networks therefore the weights of the critic network can be calculated using this algorithm as follows 27 δ w c 2 j t ρ c t e c t j ˆ t j ˆ t w c 2 j t 28 δ w c 1 i j t ρ c t e c t j ˆ t j ˆ t θ c j t θ c j t

weights of the input to hidden layer are randomly initialized and remain fixed for both the action network w a 1 i j and the critic network w c 1 i j we choose the updating strategy for the critic output weights w c as the normalized gradient descent algorithm as in sokolov et al 2015 31 w c t δ t w c t ρ c t σ c t ζ w c t t ρ c t r t w c t t δ t σ c t δ t t the critic neural network is depicted in fig 4 which consists of 3 layers 9 inputs c i t i t t g a c t t t in input layer 12 neurons in hidden layer and 1 output c o t j ˆ t in output layer an actor neural network is a function of i t w a t we define n a i n a h and n a o as number of inputs number of neurons in hidden layer and number of outputs of an actor network respectively g a c k k 1 n a o analogically to the procedure for the critic network design we adopt three variables a j t θ a j t and γ a k t therefore the output of actor network g a c k t can be calculated as follows 32 a j t i 1 n a i i i t w a 1 i

is trained using an iterative evaluation loop which appraises the error between the desired objective o d and the approximated cost to go function provided by the critic network regarding desired objective o d is the objective value of the total cost to go and is usually set to 0 36 e a t j ˆ t o d we can express an objective function for the actor neural network as 37 min w a t e a t min w a t 1 2 e a t t e a t following this we then use a gradient based adaption approach in order to update the actor weights adaptively it is done similarly as for critic network based on mentioned assumption for the critic network in which the weights of the input to hidden layer are randomly initialized and retained fixed for both networks the output weights of the actor neural network are obtained as follows 38 w a t δ t w a t ρ a t σ a t w c t t α t w c t t σ c t t where α t is a matrix with dimension n c h m and its elements can be calculated as 39 α j k t 1 2 1 σ c j 2 t w c j n k j

in a form proper for the lyapunov stability analysis therefore the new states are introduced as follows 42 w w 1 w 2 t s 1 2 s i g n s z t the eq 41 is rewritten as follows 43 w 1 1 w 1 k 1 2 w 1 1 2 w 2 w 2 k 2 w 1 w 1 1 2 δ in a state space form of the above equation eq 43 is expressed as 44 w 1 w 1 a w b δ w 1 where a k 1 2 1 2 k 2 0 b 0 1 2 we choose lyapunov function candidate as 45 v w β 4 ε 2 w 1 2 w 2 2 4 ε w 1 w 2 in a matrix form v w is written as follows 46 v w w t r w w t β 4 ε 2 2 ε 2 ε 1 w β 0 ε 0 where r is positive definite if β 0 and ε is any real number while the following boundary law is fulfilled 47 λ m i n r w 2 2 v w λ m a x r w 2 2 where λ m i n λ m a x are minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the matrix r and w 2 2 is an euclidean norm of the states w derivative of lyapunov function in eq 45 is presented as follows 48 v w t r w w t r w 1 w 1 w t a t r r a w δ w 1 w 1 b t r w where δ is bounded δ γ kali et al 2018 49 δ w 1 b t r w δ 2 w 1 2 w t r b b t r w γ 2 w

guarantee the positive definiteness of the matrix q we can define the following condition 53 k 2 k 1 ε 1 2 ε for the first proposed control algorithm ast tde using derivative of eq 53 the second adaptive gain in eq 11 is explored as follows 54 d k 2 d t ε d k 1 d t also in the second proposed control algorithm oast tde we can demonstrate a bounded condition based on definition of uniformly ultimately bounded uub for the optimal gain k t k t 1 δ t g a c t as output of the actor neural network in the approximate dynamic programming adp algorithm indeed a convergence bound for the ac adp portion of the proposed controller using the uub theorem and lyapunov stability analysis was provided by liu et al 2012 and it was shown that the estimation errors of the actor and critic weights in the hdp approach are uub based on our assumption in which the weights of the input to hidden layer are randomly initialized and retained fixed for both networks the cost to go function and output of actor network can be rewritten as follows 55 j ˆ t w c t t σ c t 56 g a c t w a t t σ a t we know that the activation functions σ c t and σ a t are always bounded within 1 1 therefore if we demonstrate that weights w a t and w c t are uub we can consider g a c t and j ˆ t as bounded parameters and consequently the optimal gains k t in the proposed oast tde would be bounded taking into account the equations 31 and 38 we define a dynamical system of estimation errors as follows 57 w a c t δ t w a c t f w a c t δ t w a c t σ a c t δ t σ a c t let w a c t w a c w a c be the weight estimation error in which the optimal weights of critic and actor networks are shown by w c and w a respectively and assume they are bounded by two positive numbers 58 w a t w a m t w c t w c m t definition 1 a dynamical system is said to be uub with ultimate bound b 0 if for any a 0 and t 0 0 there exists a positive number n n a b independent of t 0 such that w t b for all t n t 0 whenever w t 0 a theorem 1 if for system 57 there exists a function l w t t such that for all w t 0 in a compact set s l w t t is positive definite and the first difference l w t t 0 for w t 0 b for some b 0 such that b neighborhood of w t is contained in s then the system is uub and the norm of state is bounded to within a neighborhood of b based on above theorem and definition a lyapunov function can be adopted as follows 59 l t l 1 t l 2 t l 1 t 1 σ c t r w c t w c l 2 t 1 σ a t r w a t w a the first difference of l t is δ l t l t δ t l t δ l 1 t δ l 2 t therefore for both critic and actor networks 60 δ l 1 t 1 σ c t r w c t t δ t w c t δ t w c t t w c t 61 δ l 2 t 1 σ a t r w a t t δ t w a t δ t w a t t w a t where 62 w c t δ t w c t δ t w c 63 w a t δ t w a t δ t w a substituting eq 31 into eq 62 and also eq 38 into eq 63 we can obtain the parameters w c t δ t and w a t δ t which they are substituted in eq 60 and eq 61 respectively according to the bounded assumptions given in liu et al 2012 as 64 1 2 ζ 1 ρ c 1 ζ 2 σ c t 2 ρ a 1 σ a t 2 then the first difference δ l t can satisfy the inequality δ l t 0 according to the above mentioned theorem for uub systems and the lyapunov function this demonstrates that the errors between the optimal weights of the actor and critic neural networks w a w c and their estimates w a w c which are approximated using the ac adp algorithm can be all

100 s e c are as follows 67 η d x d 20 s i n 0 02 π t y d 20 c o s 0 02 π t ψ d 0 01 π t we compare the proposed ast tde and oast tde algorithms with two other controllers of different classes in the first comparative study the class is based on variable structure systems vss which includes the robust controllers cst and st tde and for the second comparative study we consider an optimal control class nmpc 6 2 discussion comparative study 1 all of adjustable parameters for controllers in the first study are assigned by the values given in table 1 and the outputs of these computer simulations are shown in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 as output results for the cst st tde and ast tde respectively an objectionable transient response with high magnitude of over shoot is clearly observed in the tracking errors depicted in fig 6 a in comparison with the smooth and accurate responses with a very small magnitude of over shoot in figs 7 a and fig 8 a concerning control inputs they are shown in the figs 6 b fig 7 b and fig 8 b for the conventional super twisting controller proposed tde based super twisting controller and the proposed tde based adaptive super twisting algorithm respectively as it is depicted the amplitudes in commencement time of control input signals are smaller for the proposed controllers than conventional super twisting controller therefore the beginning control efforts are decreased in comparison with the conventional super twisting control approach concerning path following conditions we can observe an underdamped response during trajectory tracking of both circle path and yaw angle for all three controllers however for the cts the high damping leads to the increase in control input magnitudes illustrated in fig 6 b particularly during transient period in comparison the same paths are smoothly tracked by the mass with the low control efforts presented in figs 7 b and fig 8 b meanwhile from the point of view of maintenance the applied mechanical stress on thrusters has been drastically decreased by the proposed controllers of st tde and ast tde which can increase life time of used actuators in comparison with the proposed st tde approach a better management of control efforts is accomplished by adaptive gains in the proposed algorithm of ast tde which is illustrated in fig 8 c moreover a trade off between controller efforts and tracking errors is observed and high accuracy and fast response are demonstrated as advantages for the proposed controller of ast tde in terms of the robustness feature the proposed st tde and ast tde controllers aptly estimate high complex disturbances and compensate their influence the proposed controller consists of two parts responsible for two tasks executed by ast tde algorithm these tasks are estimation and compensation which are fulfilled by the tde part and ast smc part respectively although the induced perturbations including time varying disturbances and uncertainties have been estimated by the tde part shown in fig 8 d this estimation will be inaccurate and bring in large estimation errors when the mass has fast time varying dynamics therefore we have adopted ast smc part in order to incessantly compensate tde errors and increase convergence speed this compensation procedure is illustrated in fig 8 e furthermore the nonlinear parts of damping coefficients are regarded in the drag force modeling which can increase the probability of occurring unexpected behaviors due to nonlinear dynamic uncertainties therefore parts of the perturbations are compensated by the estimations shown in fig 8 d using time delay estimation strategy other non compensated perturbations are compensated by the ast smc algorithm as is shown in fig 8 the proposed algorithm acts as a robust controller and despite the above mentioned perturbations we have an accurate and fast response with minimum control efforts from fig 8 it is clear that ast smc control inputs can successfully and effectively compensate the perturbations which have not been estimated by the tde part regarding adaptive gains in the proposed control law eq 15 adding the adaptive feature to the proposed st tde brings about a significant reduction of control efforts for the proposed ast tde indeed while the proposed st tde has a higher accuracy when compared to the cst the trajectory tracking by means of ast tde can be done with lower control efforts and roughly the same accuracy as the st tde the latter is confirmed by the acquired results in fig 8 b the results of a comparative analysis concerning control efforts are given in table 2 where their magnitudes have been calculated using the following equation 68 1 n i 1 n u i e i comparative study 2 the parameters of simulated controllers in the second comparative study are given in table 3 in which two parameters n c and n a are set as maximal backpropagation cycles of the critic and actor neural networks respectively in this study main factor for the performance evaluation is capability of controllers in control effort reduction without negative influence on the performance of trajectory tracking motivated by this important factor in order to cope with it we have proposed oast tde as a new adaptive robust control algorithm with near optimal property based on optimal gain tuning using an actor critic approximate dynamic programming strategy a comparative analysis between the lyapunov based ast tde with the adp based oast tde is depicted in fig 9 although in comparison with the st tde shown in fig 8 the proposed ast tde has a much better control inputs in terms of effort reduction but some small ripples and fluctuations are yet observed in the control inputs of ast tde as it is demonstrated in fig 9 the tracking accuracies for both proposed control algorithms are close to each as for control effort the proposed oast tde has minimum control efforts without any ripples and acts near to an optimal controller such as nmpc with input constraint u p 20 shown in fig 10 however it must be emphasized here that we cannot expect an acceptable accuracy from a nmpc controller for such a highly disturbed and uncertain dynamics in mass the robust stability of mpc is obtained only if the nominal model is inherently robust without estimation errors uncertainties and parameter variations kayacan et al 2016 indeed there are always challenging problems regarding the robust nmpc strategies adopted for the dynamics under both matched and unmatched disturbances even though in general the performance of these kinds of algorithms can still be considered an unsolved problem some preliminary results are available in some of these works the sliding mode control concept has been combined with the nmpc to cope with the robustness feature of nmpc errouissi et al 2016 x x liu et al 2016 the presented responses of nmpc in fig 10 result from using the implementation of single shooting optimization algorithm we have simulated three different levels of constraints for the control inputs in nmpc which their peaks are 60 30 and 20 the nmpc controller has not a satisfying performance in path tracking even without applying the constraint upon the control inputs no con line shown in fig 10 a based on the acquired results in the second comparative study we can conclude that the proposed oast tde algorithm concurrently fulfills advantages of the ast tde and nmpc in terms of good tracking accuracy and minimum control efforts respectively 7 summary and conclusion the paper presents two improved super twisting sliding mode control algorithms based on time delay estimation method lyapunov based adaptive gains and adp based optimal adaptive gains which have been designed to solve the problems of control system for the maritime autonomous platforms particularly autonomous ship we have basically adopted a robust adaptive strategy for tackling with the complex nonlinearities and unexpected conditions in an ocean environment which are caused by the time varying disturbances of winds waves and ocean currents moreover an autonomous ship motion is incessantly affected by changes in its inertia and drag force matrices which in turn intensify the nonlinear uncertainties in the mass dynamics a super twisting sliding mode algorithm has been well known to be a control strategy in which the chattering phenomenon is completely eliminated however despite the above mentioned robustness feature of super twisting algorithm for addressing the uncertainties in case of enforced time varying disturbances it is desired to further reinforce algorithm against those perturbations in our case study the improvements have been applied by adopting two strategies namely time delay estimation as a perturbation estimator and adaptive gains lyapunov and adp based for control effort energy consumption management in other words there is a trade off between super twisting part and tde part as this combined robust approach is able to mitigate the effects of external disturbances on performance of the super twisting algorithm some simulation studies conducted in two different control classes have been carried out to compare the proposed controllers with conventional super twisting and nmpc algorithms in comparison with the nmpc algorithm the new controller oast tde concurrently assures fast convergence accurate trajectory tracking and optimal control efforts which facilitate an overall effective control in addition its robustness has been tested in presence of above mentioned perturbations the simulation results depicted that this procedure has significant properties in fuel consumption reduction and trajectory tracking with acceptable precision concerning the future works the next step is to implement the presented algorithm upon an underactuated autonomous surface ship equipped with a rudder navigation system moreover the oast part of the algorithm will be enhanced by a model predictive control strategy in order to meet additional constraints appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia

22424,this research addresses two kinds of problems related to optimal trajectory tracking of a maritime autonomous surface ship mass those caused by the time varying external disturbances including winds waves and ocean currents as well as those resulting from inherent dynamical uncertainties as the paper shows an accurate and robust optimal controller can successfully deal with both issues an improved optimal adaptive super twisting sliding mode control oast smc algorithm is proposed here as a robust optimal adaptive strategy in this strategy in order to improve performance of the standard super twisting approach we apply an approximate dynamic programming adp based optimal tuning of gains and an underlying concept based on time delay estimation tde an adp algorithm is implemented using an actor critic neural network to deal with the curse of dimensionality in hamilton jacobi bellman hjb equation the critical role of tde part in this algorithm is estimating the impact of disturbances and uncertainties on the mass model the results have shown that oast tde significantly outperforms the st tde and ast tde algorithm in terms of the optimal control efforts also compared with a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc proposed controller meets the optimal control efforts and accurate tracking concurrently keywords mass super twisting smc time delay estimation approximate dynamic programming actor critic network optimal adaptive gains 1 introduction contemporary maritime activities can be grouped into surface and underwater operations the latter include underwater explorations inspection of the undersea structures parameter measurement and maritime transportation nowadays marine robotics is one of the paramount research areas in the maritime industries where numerous numbers of researchers institutes and industries have presented kinds of these robots including underwater robot autonomous underwater vehicle auv and autonomous surface vehicle asv in case of ships the term of maritime autonomous surface ship mass has been introduced the international maritime organization imo specifies four degrees of autonomy for mass 1 ship with automated processes and decision support seafarers are on board to operate and control shipboard systems and functions some operations may be automated 2 remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board the ship is controlled and operated from another location but seafarers are on board 3 remotely controlled ship without seafarers on board the ship is controlled and operated from another location there are no seafarers on board 4 fully autonomous ship the operating system of the ship is able to make decisions and determine actions by itself as can be seen the role of human operator is expected to be reduced throughout the development of mass it can also be expected that during this process the exploited ships may fuse two or more degrees of autonomy a common feature of all autonomy degrees is that the diminished role of a human operator results in a larger role of the systems on board this includes control systems and tracking of a given trajectory with the best possible accuracy and minimum control efforts to decrease fuel consumption the latter is particularly challenging in the face of unavoidable time varying disturbances induced by the winds waves and ocean currents upon or under the sea and inherent uncertainties in a marine vehicle dynamical model therefore a high performance control approach is required to tackle with these perturbations the topic of control algorithms for autonomous ships and marine robots has been widely researched in case of this paper the related works can be roughly grouped into 1 nonlinear conventional control algorithms 2 nonlinear robust control algorithms 3 nonlinear robust adaptive control algorithms as for the first group the robustness issue of mpc has always been a challenge many researchers in control theory have presented some approaches to designing robust nonlinear model predictive controllers nmpc an nmpc was used for an unmanned surface vehicle usv in liu et al 2013 this controller was adopted for an underactuated usv to track a desired trajectory using surge force and yaw torque as control inputs however in this paper a normal form of mpc was used without any discussion concerning its robustness also the environmental disturbances including winds currents and waves have not been considered there an improved trajectory tracking controller based backstepping control algorithm combined with sliding mode control method was later designed to address the trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated usv in j j liu et al 2016 an autonomous robotic boat was designed by wang et al 2018 who adopted a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc to tackle with the trajectory tracking problems however the uncertain nonlinearities resulting from the changes in inertia and drag matrices of the robotic boat were not taken into account there this can be a serious limitation considering that the values of these matrices may change drastically when transporting people and goods other weakness of this work was neglecting the influences due to winds waves and ocean current disturbances two kinds of mpc controllers were proposed zheng et al 2014 including nmpc which solved a constrained multi variable nonlinear programming problem and linearized mpc lmpc designed to solved a constrained quadratic programming problem through on line iterative optimization however again the environmental disturbances winds waves and currents were not taken into account regarding the second group the main author of this paper has already presented works in which the robust strategies such as sliding mode control smc and robust model predictive control rmpc were adopted for control of marine robots nejatbakhsh et al 2015 esfahani et al 2013 2014 esfahani 2019 a robust nonlinear model predictive control algorithm was also proposed by abdelaal et al 2018 in this research a nonlinear disturbance observer was adopted to estimate unknown parameters and external disturbances however this observer was able to estimate only constant or very slowly changing disturbances a guidance law for path following of marine vessel was proposed in yi et al 2016 where a singular perturbation method was used to decompose the system into two lyapunov based control subsystems some researches were carried out concerning adopting the higher order sliding mode algorithms such as super twisting for control of the maritime autonomous robots valenciaga 2014 tanakitkorn et al 2017 concerning surface robots two control strategies for the path following goal of an autonomous marine vehicle were presented hung et al 2018 in which the input constraints and disturbances caused by constant ocean currents were dealt with the first approach in this research was obtained by using a lyapunov based design strategy while the second was developed by adopting a mpc algorithm for tuning of gains in a pid controller a self regulator pid was designed jamalzade et al 2016 whose coefficients have been adjusted by using some adaptive fuzzy rules in general despite significant progress none of the above nonlinear conventional control algorithms and nonlinear robust control algorithms managed to successfully combine handling internal and external uncertainty and disturbances with sufficient accuracy in order to successfully deal with uncertainty another approach has been proposed adaptive robust control among others a disturbance observer was proposed in zhang 2018 for the trajectory tracking of unmanned marine vehicles umvs researchers in this work adopted an adaptive law to estimate and compensate the disturbance observer error following this by combining a nonlinear disturbance observer dynamic surface control and adaptive robust backstepping together they developed a dynamic surface adaptive robust controller in another robust adaptive approach huang et al 2019 a nonlinear tracking differentiator combined with a reduced order extended state observer eso was adopted to estimate outer disturbances and inherent uncertainties with a small estimation error another interesting work has been accomplished using the finite time extended state observer based distributed formation control for marine surface vehicles with input saturation and external disturbances in this study researchers proposed a novel algorithm for estimating the unavailable velocity measurements and external disturbances simultaneously the time varying external disturbances induced by winds waves and ocean currents are considered there in the computer simulations fu and yu 2018 a novel robust adaptive formation control scheme based on the minimal learning parameter mlp algorithm and the disturbance observer dob was presented in lu et al 2018 by using the mlp algorithm a remarkable descent in tunable parameters for the controller and dob has been achieved which in turn led to great reduction of the online computational time an artificial intelligence based robust control strategy in the form of a multi layer neural network was combined with adaptive robust techniques in shojaei 2016 this resulted in the control system of great robustness against uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances the proposed approach efficiently compensated both parametric and non parametric uncertainties including time varying disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents a saturated neural adaptive robust output feedback formation controller was designed there to satisfy control objectives researchers liu et al 2015 employed an adaptive sliding mode controller in which a hierarchical sliding mode was adopted to deal with the underactuation of the model neural network as an adaptive part was used there for approximating the unknown nonlinear part in the dynamical model in this way the robustness of the proposed controller was strengthened and the chattering phenomenon of sliding mode strategy was eliminated in this study the nonlinear damping terms of ship s model were considered which are neglected in many studies and the time varying disturbances were taken into account to test the robustness of the designed controller following this the researchers then developed a predictor based robust algorithm adopted for a line of sight approach l liu et al 2016 which offered a significant improvement in the transient response in particular the convergence was greatly sped up due to fast estimation of uncertainties some other efficient algorithms were proposed in sharma et al 2014 where the authors evaluated two novel non linear autopilot designs for mass based on non linear local control network lcn and non linear model predictive control approaches the chosen approaches allowed them to improve the effectiveness in terms of control activity expenditure power consumption and mission duration length under similar operating conditions the above described autopilot systems have been used to control the non linear yaw dynamics of an unmanned surface vehicle named springer in which yaw dynamics of the vehicle has been modelled using a multi layer perceptron type neural network simulation results in this study showed that the autopilot based on local control network method performed better then non linear model predictive control approach apart from the already listed works a robust adaptive approaches may also be successfully adopted to trajectory tracking of an autonomous surface platform which has been evidenced in sun et al 2017 liu et al 2019 overall the sliding mode control based adaptive algorithms are often combined with other solutions in order to control various nonlinear and uncertain dynamical systems the strong argument behind using such a control structure is its promising performance in terms of sufficient robustness disturbance rejection and fast convergence in most of applications an intelligent part such as neural network or fuzzy inference system has been adopted to bring an adaptive attribute for the proposed controllers for instance a double hidden layer recurrent neural network dhlrnn based adaptive global sliding mode controller was proposed for an active power filter apf in which researchers chu et al 2019 fei and chu 2019 used a recurrent neural network rnn in order to estimate the nonlinearities and cope with the unknown system uncertainties and external disturbances in other research on apf fang et al 2019 an adaptive sliding mode control based on the finite time concept was proposed in which a fuzzy neural estimator was designed to tackle the unknown part of dynamical model for a pv grid connected inverter a robust adaptive approach based on sliding mode control algorithm was proposed in zhu and fei 2018 in this research a disturbance observer was used to compensate the external disturbances and also a fuzzy inference system was adopted to meet a promising attenuation in chattering phenomenon other intelligent based sliding mode control algorithm proposed for apf consists of two main parts hou et al 2019 an adaptive fuzzy neural network afnn part was adopted to alleviate the effect of external disturbances and model uncertainties and the second part was designed based on the combination of two control approaches including nonsingular terminal sliding mode and backstepping ntsmb concepts to fulfill the robustness and accuracy considering the above it might be concluded that sliding mode based controllers have an inherent robustness and that they have shown impressive results against uncertainties resulting from parameter variations and external disturbances however the control of autonomous ship brings new challenges which have not been yet directly addressed in the previous studies or have not been solved in a satisfying way namely both the robustness and optimal parameter tuning properties in the control algorithms should be considered during the designing of controllers for mass in order to terminate a task and track a desired trajectory with the best possible accuracy and minimum energy consumption in presence of complex time varying external disturbances it is therefore solving this issue that the current paper aims at in the paper we first and foremost adopt an improved higher order sliding mode based controller st tde as our robust concept for the trajectory tracking of a mass following this two newly proposed control algorithms ast tde and oast tde are presented in order to meet the minimum control efforts motivated by the robust performance of the st tde control algorithm in handling complex disturbances and uncertainties as well as adaptive and near optimal behavior of the adp based control systems we propose a robust optimal control approach which fulfills all the mentioned properties the major achievements of this work are as follows an improved performance in terms of path tracking is achieved in combined st tde algorithm in comparison with the conventional super twisting cst algorithm in the proposed ast tde a lyapunov based adaptive strategy is applied to the super twisting part of st tde algorithm in order to improve the control performance in terms of reducing control efforts in the proposed oast tde an optimal parameter tuning part is designed based on approximate dynamic programming approach as an online optimal solver in order to reduce control efforts in the st tde and decrease fuel consumption without losing the acceptable accuracy in trajectory tracking especially in early stages of tracking near optimal performance similar to the nmpc algorithm has been achieved in the proposed oast tde control algorithm the proposed adp based optimal adaptive tuning algorithm can be extended to applications of other kinds of tunable controllers the rest of the paper is organized as follows a mathematical model of mass with considering all induced conditions such as variation in parameters and external disturbances is described in section 2

promote robustness property and acquire a high performance with an optimal control effort the proposed method consists of two control parts 1 adaptive super twisting ast part and 2 time delay estimation tde part the tde concept is applied here so as to take advantage of its model free nature this part provides an estimation of perturbations by observing the inputs and the states of the mass one step into the past without an exact knowledge of the dynamics and the upper bound of uncertainties as a supplementary part of the proposed algorithm the ast is used to compensate tde error and illuminate chattering as well as to ensure the convergence in an acceptable condition at the same time the applied adaptive law is brought in order to generate adaptive gains which cover the reduction in the control efforts putting together all of the above elements an adaptive super twisting time delay estimation ast tde algorithm is proposed which combines the advantages of the previously described approaches to effectively and accurately control a maritime autonomous surface ship fig 2 illustrates the proposed ast tde controller block diagram this tde based super twisting algorithm can estimate all of the perturbations stemmed from the ocean circumstances and dynamical uncertainties upon the mass and finally this combined approach can achieve a high accuracy for trajectory tracking of the presented maritime autonomous platform also we can define adaptive gains for the super twisting control law given by eq 10 with considering the following theorem theorem regard control input in eq 10 assume that the perturbation p is bounded as p σ s 1 2 where σ 0 is unknown then for any initial conditions η 0 s 0 the sliding surface s 0 will be reached in finite time

in terms of minimum control efforts and optimal velocities this kind of optimal path tracking for maritime autonomous surface ships can lead to minimum fuel consumption in their propulsion systems an actor critic approximate dynamic programming ac adp algorithm is adopted for optimal gain tuning of st tde which is based on a heuristic dynamic programming hdp as a powerful adp algorithm liu et al 2012 si et al 2001 sokolov et al 2015 taking into account δ t as a simulation step size for implementing of ac adp iteration algorithm and optimized gains g a c t as outputs of actor network the

threshold activation function for both actor and critic networks as follows 23 σ t 1 e t 1 e t where σ c t σ a t σ t let us define w c 1 and w c 2 as weights of the critic network for its input layer

therefore the weights of the critic network can be calculated using this algorithm as follows 27 δ w c 2 j t ρ c t e c t j ˆ t j ˆ t w c 2 j t 28 δ w c 1 i j t ρ c t e c t j ˆ t j ˆ t θ c j t θ c j t

weights of the input to hidden layer are randomly initialized and remain fixed for both the action network w a 1 i j and the critic network w c 1 i j we choose the updating strategy for the critic output weights w c as the normalized gradient descent algorithm as in sokolov et al 2015 31 w c t δ t w c t ρ c t σ c t ζ w c t t ρ c t r t w c t t δ t σ c t δ t t the critic neural network is

assumption for the critic network in which the weights of the input to hidden layer are randomly initialized and retained fixed for both networks the output weights of the actor neural network are obtained as follows 38 w a t δ t w a t ρ a t σ a t w c t t α t w c t t σ c t t where α t is a matrix with dimension n c h m and its elements can be calculated as 39 α j k t 1 2 1 σ c j 2 t w c j n k j

in a form proper for the lyapunov stability analysis therefore the new states are introduced as follows 42 w w 1 w 2 t s 1 2 s i g n s z t the eq 41 is rewritten as follows 43 w 1 1 w 1 k 1 2 w 1 1 2 w 2 w 2 k 2 w 1 w 1 1 2 δ in a state space form of the above equation eq 43 is expressed as 44 w 1 w 1 a w b δ w 1 where a k 1 2 1 2 k 2 0 b 0 1 2 we choose lyapunov function candidate as 45 v w β 4 ε

boundary law is fulfilled 47 λ m i n r w 2 2 v w λ m a x r w 2 2 where λ m i n λ m a x are minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the matrix r and w 2 2 is an euclidean norm of the states w derivative of lyapunov function in eq 45 is presented as follows 48 v w t r w w t r w 1 w 1 w t a t r r a w δ w 1 w 1 b t r w where δ is bounded δ γ kali et al 2018 49 δ w 1 b t r w δ 2 w 1 2 w t r b b t r w γ 2 w

guarantee the positive definiteness of the matrix q we can define the following condition 53 k 2 k 1 ε 1 2 ε for the first proposed control algorithm ast tde using derivative of eq 53 the second adaptive gain in eq 11 is explored as follows 54 d k 2 d t ε d k 1 d t also in the second proposed control algorithm oast tde we can demonstrate a bounded condition based on definition of uniformly ultimately bounded uub for the optimal gain k t k t 1 δ t g a c t as output of the actor neural network in the approximate dynamic programming adp algorithm indeed a convergence bound for the ac adp portion of the proposed controller using the uub theorem and lyapunov stability analysis was provided by liu et al 2012 and it was shown that the estimation errors of the actor and critic weights in the hdp approach are uub based on our assumption in which the weights of the input to hidden layer are randomly initialized and retained fixed for both networks the cost to go function and output of actor network can be rewritten as follows 55 j ˆ t w c t t σ c t 56 g a c t w a t t σ a t we know that the activation functions σ c t and σ a t are always bounded within 1 1 therefore if we demonstrate that weights w a t and w c t are uub we can consider g a c t and j ˆ t as bounded parameters and consequently the optimal gains k t in the proposed oast tde would be bounded taking into account the equations 31 and 38 we define a dynamical system of estimation errors as follows 57 w a c t δ t w a c t f w a c t δ t w a c t σ a c t δ t σ a c t let w a c t w a c w a c be the weight estimation error in which the optimal weights of critic and actor networks are shown by w c and w a respectively and assume they are bounded by two positive numbers 58 w a t w a m t w c t w c m t definition 1 a dynamical system is said to be uub with ultimate bound b 0 if for any a 0 and t 0 0 there exists a positive number n n a b independent of t 0 such that w t b for all t n t 0 whenever w t 0 a theorem 1 if for system 57 there exists a function l w t t such that for all w t 0 in a compact set s l w t t is positive definite and the first difference l w t t 0 for w t 0 b for some b 0 such that b neighborhood of w t is contained in s then the system is uub and the norm of state is bounded to within a neighborhood of b based on above theorem and definition a lyapunov function can be adopted as follows 59 l t l 1 t l 2 t l 1 t 1 σ c t r w c t w c l 2 t 1 σ a t r w a t w a the first difference of l t is δ l t l t δ t l t δ l 1 t δ l 2 t therefore for both critic and actor networks 60 δ l 1 t 1 σ c t r w c t t δ t w c t δ t w c t t w c t 61 δ l 2 t 1 σ a t r w a t t δ t w a t δ t w a t t w a t where 62 w c t δ t w c t δ t w c 63 w a t δ t w a t δ t w a substituting eq 31 into eq 62 and also eq 38 into eq 63 we can obtain the parameters w c t δ t and w a t δ t which they are substituted in eq 60 and eq 61 respectively according to the bounded assumptions given in liu et al 2012 as 64 1 2 ζ 1 ρ c 1 ζ 2 σ c t 2 ρ a 1 σ a t 2 then the first difference δ l t can satisfy the inequality δ l t 0 according to the above mentioned theorem for uub systems and the lyapunov function this demonstrates that the errors between the optimal weights of the actor and critic neural networks w a w c and their estimates w a w c which are approximated using the ac adp algorithm can be all uub 6 computer simulations and discussion 6 1 simulation conditions the main purpose of this section is a comparative study upon the computer simulation results of the proposed adaptive super twisting time delay estimation ast tde controller proposed optimal adaptive super twisting time delay estimation oast tde control algorithm super twisting time delay estimation st tde conventional super twisting cst controller and a nonlinear model predictive control nmpc algorithm in order to investigate resilient factor of the five controllers against unexpected perturbations all of the time varying external disturbances induced by the winds waves and ocean currents are envisaged these disturbances are considered for applying upon the mass with 3 d o f in which their respective vectors γ γ u γ v γ r t can be modelled as follows fu and yu 2018 65 γ u 0 1 v 3 0 06 u 0 01 sin t γ v u r 0 1 u 0 01 sin t γ r 0 4 u r v 2 0 01 sin t in the mathematical modeling of mass the nonlinear parts of

desired yaw angle are adopted to be tracked by mass in the surge sway 2d plane and yaw angle respectively the equations of these desired paths with the initial conditions 0 0 0 and simulation time t 100 s e c are as follows 67 η d x d 20 s i n 0 02 π t y d 20 c o s 0 02 π t ψ d 0 01 π t we compare the proposed ast tde and oast tde algorithms with two other controllers of different classes in the first comparative study the class is based on variable structure systems vss which includes the robust controllers cst and st tde and for the second comparative study we consider an optimal control class nmpc 6 2 discussion comparative study 1 all of adjustable parameters for controllers in the first study are assigned by the values given in table 1 and the outputs of these computer simulations are shown in fig 6 fig 7 and fig 8 as output results for the cst st tde and ast tde respectively an objectionable transient response with high magnitude of over shoot is clearly observed in the tracking errors depicted in fig 6 a in comparison with the smooth and accurate responses with a very small magnitude of over shoot in figs 7 a and fig 8 a concerning control inputs they are shown in the figs 6 b fig 7 b and fig 8 b for the conventional super twisting controller proposed tde based super twisting controller and the proposed tde based adaptive super twisting algorithm respectively as it is depicted the amplitudes in commencement time of control input signals are smaller for the proposed controllers than conventional super twisting controller therefore the beginning control efforts are decreased in comparison with the conventional super twisting control approach concerning path following conditions we can observe an underdamped response during trajectory tracking of both circle path and yaw angle for all three controllers however for the cts the high damping leads to the increase in control input magnitudes illustrated in fig 6 b particularly during transient period in comparison the same paths are smoothly tracked by the mass with the low control efforts presented in figs 7 b and fig 8 b meanwhile from the point of view of maintenance the applied mechanical stress on thrusters has been drastically decreased by the proposed controllers of st tde and ast tde which can increase life time of used actuators in comparison with the proposed st tde approach a better management of control efforts is accomplished by adaptive gains in the proposed algorithm of ast tde which is illustrated in fig 8 c moreover a trade off between controller efforts and tracking errors is observed and high accuracy and fast response are demonstrated as advantages for the proposed controller of ast tde in terms of the robustness feature the proposed st tde and ast tde controllers aptly estimate high complex disturbances and compensate their influence the proposed controller consists of two parts responsible for two tasks executed by ast tde algorithm these tasks are estimation and compensation which are fulfilled by the tde part and ast smc part respectively although the induced perturbations including time varying disturbances and uncertainties have been estimated by the tde part shown in fig 8 d this estimation will be inaccurate and bring in large estimation errors when the mass has fast time varying dynamics therefore we have adopted ast smc part in order to incessantly compensate tde errors and increase convergence speed this compensation procedure is illustrated in fig 8 e furthermore the nonlinear parts of damping coefficients are regarded in the drag force modeling which can increase the probability of occurring unexpected behaviors due to nonlinear dynamic uncertainties therefore parts of the perturbations are compensated by the estimations shown in fig 8 d using time delay estimation strategy other non compensated perturbations are compensated by the ast smc algorithm as is shown in fig 8 the proposed algorithm acts as a robust controller and despite the above mentioned perturbations we have an accurate and fast response with minimum control efforts from fig 8 it is clear that ast smc control inputs can successfully and effectively compensate the perturbations which have not been estimated by the tde part regarding adaptive gains in the proposed control law eq 15 adding the adaptive feature to the proposed st tde brings about a significant reduction of control efforts for the proposed ast tde indeed while the proposed st tde has a higher accuracy when compared to the cst the trajectory tracking by means of ast tde can be done with lower control efforts and roughly the same accuracy as the st tde the latter is confirmed by the acquired results in fig 8 b the results of a comparative analysis concerning control efforts are given in table 2 where their magnitudes have been calculated using the following equation 68 1 n i 1 n u i e i comparative study 2 the parameters of simulated controllers in the second comparative study are given in table 3 in which two parameters n c and n a are set as maximal backpropagation cycles of the critic and actor neural networks respectively in this study main factor for the performance evaluation is capability of controllers in control effort reduction without negative influence on the performance of trajectory tracking motivated by this important factor in order to cope with it we have proposed oast tde as a new adaptive robust control algorithm with near optimal property based on optimal gain tuning using an actor critic approximate dynamic programming strategy a comparative analysis between the lyapunov based ast tde with the adp based oast tde is depicted in fig 9 although in comparison with the st tde shown in fig 8 the proposed ast tde has a much better control inputs in terms of effort reduction but some small ripples and fluctuations are yet observed in the control inputs of ast tde as it is demonstrated in fig 9 the tracking accuracies for both proposed control algorithms are close to each as for control effort the proposed oast tde has minimum control efforts without any ripples and acts near to an optimal controller such as nmpc with input constraint u p 20 shown in fig 10 however it must be emphasized here that we cannot expect an acceptable accuracy from a nmpc controller for such a highly disturbed and uncertain dynamics in mass the robust stability of mpc is obtained only if the nominal model is inherently robust without estimation errors uncertainties and parameter variations kayacan et al 2016 indeed there are always challenging problems regarding the robust nmpc strategies adopted for the dynamics under both matched and unmatched disturbances even though in general the performance of these kinds of algorithms can still be considered an unsolved problem some preliminary results are available in some of these works the sliding mode control concept has been combined with the nmpc to cope with the robustness feature of nmpc errouissi et al 2016 x x liu et al 2016 the presented responses of nmpc in fig 10 result from using the implementation of single shooting optimization algorithm we have simulated three different levels of constraints for the control inputs in nmpc which their peaks are 60 30 and 20 the nmpc controller has not a satisfying performance in path tracking even without applying the constraint upon the control inputs no con line shown in fig 10 a based on the acquired results in the second comparative study we can conclude that the proposed oast tde algorithm concurrently fulfills advantages of the ast tde and nmpc in terms of good tracking accuracy and minimum control efforts respectively 7 summary and conclusion the paper presents two improved super twisting sliding mode control algorithms based on time delay estimation method lyapunov based adaptive gains and adp based optimal adaptive gains which have been designed to solve the problems of control system for the maritime autonomous platforms particularly autonomous ship we have basically adopted a robust adaptive strategy for tackling with the complex nonlinearities and unexpected conditions in an ocean environment which are caused by the time varying disturbances of winds waves and ocean currents moreover an autonomous ship motion is incessantly affected by changes in its inertia and drag force matrices which in turn intensify the nonlinear uncertainties in the mass dynamics a super twisting sliding mode algorithm has been well known to be a control strategy in which the chattering phenomenon is completely eliminated however despite the above mentioned robustness feature of super twisting algorithm for addressing the uncertainties in case of enforced time varying disturbances it is desired to further reinforce algorithm against those perturbations in our case study the improvements have been applied by adopting two strategies namely time delay estimation as a perturbation estimator and adaptive gains lyapunov and adp based for control effort energy consumption management in other words there is a trade off between super twisting part and tde part as this combined robust approach is able to mitigate the effects of external disturbances on performance of the super twisting algorithm some simulation studies conducted in two different control classes have been carried out to compare the proposed controllers with conventional super twisting and nmpc algorithms in comparison with the nmpc algorithm the new controller oast tde concurrently assures fast convergence accurate trajectory tracking and optimal control efforts which facilitate an overall effective control in addition its robustness has been tested in presence of above mentioned perturbations the simulation results depicted that this procedure has significant properties in fuel consumption reduction and trajectory tracking with acceptable precision concerning the future works the next step is to implement the presented algorithm upon an underactuated autonomous surface ship equipped with a rudder navigation system moreover the oast part of the algorithm will be enhanced by a model predictive control strategy in order to meet additional constraints appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia
