25150,natural capital accounting aims to measure changes in the stock of natural assets i e soil air water and all living things and to integrate the value of ecosystem services into accounting systems that will contribute to better ecosystems management this study develops ecosystem services accounts at the european union level using nature based recreation as a case study and following the current international accounting framework system of environmental economic accounting experimental ecosystem accounting seea eea we adapt and integrate different biophysical and socio economic models illustrating the workflow necessary for ecosystem services accounts from a biophysical assessment of nature based recreation to an economic valuation and compilation of the accounting tables the biophysical assessment of nature based recreation is based on spatially explicit models for assessing different components of ecosystem services potential demand and actual flow deriving maps of ecosystem service potential and demand is a key step in quantifying the actual flow of the service used which is determined by the spatial relationship i e proximity in the case of nature based recreation between service potential and demand the nature based recreation accounts for 2012 show an actual flow of 40 million potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation with a total value of eur 50 billion this constitutes an important contribution of ecosystems to people s lives that has increased by 26 since 2000 practical examples of ecosystem services accounts as shown in this study are required to derive recommendations and further develop the conceptual and methodological framework proposed by the seea eea this paper highlights the importance of using spatially explicit models for ecosystem services accounts mapping the different components of ecosystem services allows proper identification of the drivers of changes in the actual service flow derived from ecosystems socio economic systems and or their spatial relationship this will contribute to achieving one of the main goals of ecosystem accounts namely measuring changes in natural capital but it

travel cost method un united nations 1 introduction a region s economic prosperity and wellbeing is underpinned by its natural capital natural capital is the world s stock of natural assets which includes geology soil air water and all living organisms it is from this natural capital that humans derive a wide range of ecosystem services such as protection against natural disasters climate regulation pollination and nature based recreation all of which make human life possible natural capital accounting is a tool to measure the changes in the stock of natural assets and to integrate the value of ecosystem services into accounting and reporting systems which will contribute to more effective ecosystem and land management measures the seventh environment action programme and the biodiversity strategy to 2020 of the european union eu include objectives to develop natural capital accounts in the eu with a focus on ecosystems and their services more specifically action 5 of the eu biodiversity strategy requires member states with the assistance of the european commission to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services they must also assess the economic value of such services and promote the integration of these values into accounting and reporting systems at the eu and national level by 2020 ecosystem services es are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human wellbeing teeb 2010 es are the flows from ecosystems to socio economic systems that are actually realised or used in a specific area and time maes et al 2013 we denote the realised or used flow of an ecosystem services here as the actual flow ecosystem services accounts focus on the actual flow of the service understood as a transaction from ecosystems to socio economic systems fig 1 in this sense different components of ecosystems and socio economic systems are fundamental to assess the actual flow of the service and understand the changes over time hein et al 2016 the amount of service that ecosystems can provide irrespective from the demand by people i e the es potential is usually assessed based on the ecosystem s properties and conditions that are recognised as being relevant to the service considered fig 1 an es flow is the fraction of the es potential driven by the demand for that service from human needs and preferences for some ecosystem services this fraction can be higher than the potential if the service is overused it is important to stress that the service flow is generated only if the following conditions are met 1 there is an ecosystem potential to generate the service in a service providing area spa 2 there is a demand for the service by the socio economic system and 3 there is a spatial connection between the demand and the spas bagstad et al 2014 burkhard and maes 2017 fisher et al 2009 syrbe and walz 2012 an es flow connects ecosystems to socio economic systems to ultimately generate benefits however drivers of change derived from socio economic systems also act on ecosystems by modifying their properties and conditions fig 1 some of these drivers of change result in pressures on the environment other drivers of change may have a positive impact on the ecosystem such as sustainable land management or protection measures drivers of change act on ecosystems modifying the es potential and hence the actual flow of the service therefore assessing all of these components and their inter connection is essential to quantify the actual flow of the service i e use and its integration into an accounting system the united nations un system of integrated environmental economic accounting experimental ecosystem accounts seea eea is currently developing a standard for natural capital accounts un et al 2014b the technical recommendations of seea eea make proposals on how to develop accounting tables of ecosystem extent condition service supply and use and asset values un 2017 the seea eea accounting tables for ecosystem services record the actual flow of services during an accounting period the supply of a service by each ecosystem type is recorded in the supply table and its use by different economic units i e industries and households is presented in the use table ultimately the main purpose of supply and use tables for ecosystem services is to show which ecosystem types generate the actual flow of a service and which economic units use it in accounting terms supply always equals use because both tables refer to the actual flow of the service the accounting tables are compiled first in biophysical units and then in monetary terms the accounting workflow starts from a biophysical assessment of the actual flow which is then economically valued using an appropriate valuation technique un 2017 the economic valuation of ecosystem services in accounting allows a direct comparison with the system of national accounts sna which is used to monitor the economy and thus an integrated ecological economic analysis natural capital accounting under the seea eea framework is experimental and only a limited number of studies have explored the feasibility of applying it in practice e g keith et al 2017 la notte et al 2017 remme et al 2014 2016 robinson et al 2017 ecosystem services accounts in particular still present many scientific and technical challenges data or indicators available for ecosystem services accounts are usually scarce and mainly limited to provisioning ecosystem services i e timber crops and water for which the accounting framework is provided by the seea central framework un et al 2014a in the case of regulating and cultural ecosystem services accounting needs to rely on spatially explicit models developed for the biophysical assessment of ecosystem services most frequently biophysical models quantify the es potential based on dimensionless indicators while models quantifying the actual flow are more limited hein et al 2016 villamagna et al 2013 however ecosystem service accounting as described above requires an assessment of the actual flow of the service based on spatially explicit information of the drivers of the ecosystem services use i e es potential and demand in this sense further research is needed to facilitate the integration of ecosystem services models into accounting systems this study develops an eu wide ecosystem service account following the current international accounting framework seea eea and makes suggestions for further developments based on this practical application we describe in detail the workflow necessary to build the accounts 1 conducting a biophysical assessment of the es accounting components potential demand and actual flow 2 applying a seea compliant valuation technique to translate the actual flow of the service into monetary units 3 filling in the accounting tables for each country and 4 conducting a benefit assessment last we analyse changes in the actual flow of the service over time the accounting workflow is illustrated for nature based recreation nature based recreation is a cultural ecosystem service comprising all physical and intellectual interactions with biota ecosystems and land seascapes more specifically in this study nature based recreation relates to the biophysical characteristics or qualities of ecosystems that people view observe experience or enjoy passively or actively on the daily activity it covers a wide variety of activities including walking jogging or running in nearby urban green space or by a river lake or sea cycling in nature after work picnicking and observing flora and fauna daily nature based recreation is measured as the potential visits people make to enjoy natural amenities fitting within the daily activities similar to other daily activities e g working going to school and shopping this benefits society by enhancing human wellbeing as a number of studies has demonstrated bowler et al 2010 korpela et al 2014 2 materials and methods a possible biophysical indicator of daily nature based recreation is the number of people using green space or natural areas for this purpose given the lack of data at eu level on nature based recreational use the ecosystem service has been modelled using an adapted version of the nature based recreation model implemented in the ecosystem services mapping tool estimap paracchini et al 2014 zulian et al 2017 estimap is a collection of models for a spatially explicit assessment of ecosystem services zulian et al 2017 as highlighted in the introduction the actual flow which is recorded in the accounting tables is driven by the es potential demand and the spatial relationship between them in the case of daily nature based recreation the service potential is quantified as the extent of high quality areas for daily recreation section 2 1 and the service demand is quantified as the number of inhabitants section 2 2 then the proximity between these two components section 2 2 1 is ultimately used to quantify the es flow section 2 3 the actual flow is expressed as the number of potential visits to areas suitable for daily recreation fig 2 and table 1 the actual flow is then translated into monetary terms section 2 4 which is finally reported in the supply and use tables section 2 5 we also present a first approach towards the assessment of the benefit derived from nature based recreation which in this case is the contribution to human wellbeing section 2 6 since accounts are mainly used to report changes over time we tried to cover a representative time series we took as reference years 2000 2006 and 2012 matching the years for which ecosystem extent accounts based on the corine land cover map will be available in a forthcoming working paper from the european environment agency note that the corine land cover map has a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha therefore land cover types with a restricted distribution such as green urban areas are not properly represented in this map for analysis of nature based recreation in urban areas data at finer spatial resolution should be considered zulian et al 2017 the years assessed for each component of nature based recreation depend on data availability table 1 recreation potential was assessed for all three years while the actual flow of nature based recreation can be estimated for 2000 and 2012 only assuming population density for 2015 equivalent to 2012 spatially explicit population data derived from national census are not available for 2006 european commission joint research centre et al 2015 we also compared the assessment of all components of nature based recreation potential demand and actual flow for all available years analysis of eu level trends can be done only for countries that were eu member states in 2000 eu 15 austria belgium germany denmark spain finland france greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal sweden and the united kingdom data on protected areas were not available for the remaining countries 2 1 nature based recreation potential areas with more recreation opportunities are more attractive to people and therefore have greater potential to be used nature based recreation potential is assessed based on the opportunities for recreation provided by ecosystems ecosystem based potential but also on other human inputs fig 3 appendix a shows all input data used in the model nature based recreation potential has been modelled using estimap model for nature based recreation paracchini et al 2014 zulian et al 2013 specifically adapted for accounting the estimap model for recreation is based on the advanced multiple layers lookup tables advanced lut method advanced luts assign ecosystem services scores to land units based on cross tabulation and spatial composition derived from overlaying thematic maps schröter et al 2015 ecosystem services scores for each input layer are derived from the literature and an expert based approach zulian et al 2017 the model provides a spatially explicit assessment of ecosystem potential to provide nature based recreation and leisure it integrates the two components shown in fig 2 1 ecosystem based potential eb p which estimates the potential capacity of ecosystems to support nature based recreation activities and 2 human inputs which integrates a proximity remoteness concept in relation to road networks and residential areas recreational areas close to these infrastructures can be reached more easily and have greater potential for daily nature based recreation this spatial component related to built infrastructure is especially important for assessing daily nature based recreation both eb p and human inputs are combined to assess daily recreation opportunities as a measure of recreation potential fig 3 presents a flow chart of the estimap model for nature based recreation adapted for the purpose of natural capital accounts since one of the main goals of ecosystem services accounts is tracking changes over time data from the original model paracchini et al 2014 without time series available i e high nature value farmland were not included with the exception of the road network natural pristine ecosystems assessed by the hemeroby index in paracchini et al 2014 was replaced with a scoring of the suitability to support recreation for each land cover type the terminology of the original model was also changed for consistency with the terminology used in accounting 2 1 1 ecosystem based potential ecosystem based potential eb p depends on three factors fig 3 1 suitability of land for supporting recreation each land cover type is scored according to its suitability for nature based recreation from very low or close to 0 in industrial or highly urbanised areas to maximum values of 1 for some semi natural areas such as forests and beaches appendix b 2 nature elements this includes other features that play a role in providing nature based recreational opportunities such as the presence of protected natural areas protected natural areas are scored according to the management categories for protected areas of the international union for conservation of nature iucn dudley 2008 the score matrix has been derived from the analysis of management objectives appendix c 3 water elements the presence of water is a key element of nature based leisure and recreation ghermandi 2015 jennings 2007 we consider coastal and inland elements as proxies for this component the former comprises coastal geomorphology proximity to the coast and presence of protected marine areas the latter relates to proximity to lakes data on bathing water quality which member states report to comply with the eu bathing water directive are also included finally the eb p map was reclassified into for classes very high 4 high 3 low 2 and very low 1 provision fig 3 2 1 2 the role of human inputs in ecosystem service potential the final quantification of recreation potential requires integration of the human inputs for human inputs we considered the distance from local roads and residential areas data on the local road network were only available for 2013 appendix a however changes in local roads for the time period assessed between 2000 and 2012 are not expected to be very significant especially when considering that the final spatial resolution of the analyses is 1 km2 fig 3 distances measured were cross tabulated to define five levels of proximity from near to far cross tabulation a fig 3 finally the levels of proximity were cross tabulated with the different classes of eb p generating nine categories of recreation opportunities the so called recreation opportunity spectrum cross tabulation b fig 3 paracchini et al 2014 the primary model output is a map with nine categories showing different levels of recreation provision and proximity fig 3 cross tabulations a and b were based on the same parameters applied in previous studies at the eu scale liquete et al 2016 accounting for daily nature based recreation requires quantifying the service flow in physical units with this goal in mind we limited the accounting of nature based recreation to locations with high quality recreation areas i e high provision close to urban areas and roads and therefore suitable for daily use this corresponds to category 9 of the recreation opportunity spectrum fig 3 we refer to this category as high quality areas for daily recreation which are considered in this application as the spa the extent of high quality areas for daily recreation is used in this accounting exercise as the ecosystem service potential it corresponds to all open space areas in and around towns that provide high nature based recreation opportunities therefore remote areas for nature based recreation or close to settlements but with medium or low provision are not considered as service providing area in this paper this choice was driven by the method adopted for the monetary valuation which was based on a mobility functional calibrated with survey data on daily recreation 2 2 demand for nature based recreation the actual flow of a service is partly determined by the demand assessing the demand enables the actual flow to be allocated to the users in the use table of the account demand for nature based recreation takes different forms people need nearby ecosystems such as urban green spaces forests or nature reserves for relaxing jogging walking or cycling there is also an important demand for nature based recreation that requires long distance travel for instance to visit a national park or to hike in the mountains however in this study we have accounted for only short distance recreation which estimates the value of ecosystems that have high potential for daily recreation to quantify the demand for nature based recreation we used population data from the global human settlement model european commission joint research centre et al 2015 this spatial raster depicts the distribution and density of the population expressed as the number of people per 1 km square cell to compare the demand for nature based recreation across the eu we estimated the population density for local administrative units laus 2 2 1 demand in relation to service potential before calculating the actual flow of the service it is necessary to first assess the spatial relationship between the spa i e high quality areas for daily recreation and the service benefiting areas sbas where the demand i e people is located this spatial relationship ultimately drives the service flow we quantified how the population in each lau is distributed over different distances from the nearest high quality areas for daily recreation this method is known as the cumulative opportunity model vale et al 2015 fig 3 which has been recognised as suitable for evaluating the benefits of green space and open air recreation areas ekkel and de vries 2017 it is based on raster operations using grass commands r distance and r recode grass development team 2017 see illustrative example in appendix d the distance buffers applied are within 1 km this is considered regular walking distance people living here can easily reach a recreation area after a short walk three distance buffers 1 2 km 2 3 km and 3 4 km at these distances recreational areas may be reached by long walks or by using a recreational standard bicycle beyond 4 km we took an intermediate value between the average cycling journey of 3 km and the 5 km threshold beyond which bicycles are generally not used according to research in the united kingdom barton and tsourou 2013 we considered people living beyond this distance as an unmet demand since they may need a car to reach high quality areas for daily recreation or might use recreational areas with lower opportunities for or lower quality of nature based recreation therefore generating fewer benefits although a spatial analysis of demand in relation to service potential is an intermediate step in estimating the actual flow of nature based recreation we also report the results on the unmet demand given its relevance to policy support this information could be used to plan measures guaranteeing equitable access to nature based recreation opportunities providing universal access to safe inclusive and accessible green and public space is one of the targets of united nations sustainable development goal 11 united nations 2015 this allows us to distinguish the part of the population whose need for daily nature based recreation is covered met demand within the first four kilometres from the part of the population to which access to high quality areas for daily recreation is not secured unmet demand the proportion with met demand may satisfy their need for nature based recreation relatively easily by foot or by bicycle citizens do not necessarily have to use motor transport to enjoy daily nature based recreation if they live close to places providing high recreation opportunities to assess the actual flow of daily nature based recreation we count only the proportion of population living within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation met demand 2 3 actual flow of nature based recreation the methodology used to assess actual flows in biophysical terms requires consistency with valuation techniques that translate the biophysical assessment into monetary terms the monetary valuation is based on the zonal travel cost method see section 2 4 this technique requires the number of visits generated at different distance buffers to be quantified which will then be considered in terms of actual biophysical flow since the observed number of visits per recreational area is not available at either the eu nor member state level we need to rely on a mobility function to move from the number of inhabitants to the number of potential visits that will be generated depending on the distance from high quality areas for daily recreation the mobility function represents the probability of potential visits as a function of the distance travelled geurs and ritsema van eck 2001 reviewed the literature on accessibility measures and presented the log logistic function as the most popular approach for determining the number of visits to shopping malls trains stations and job centres among other places using the log logistic approach our function models the number of daily recreation visits based on the spatial distribution of the population the function has been calibrated on a survey undertaken in england the monitor of engagement with the natural environment mene survey ferrini et al 2015 uk government 2014 the mene survey provides observation data on the exact type of services to value respondents are asked about occasions in the last week when you spent your time out of doors the survey focuses on daily activities and the users have to think about their usual behaviour the last week being a normal week and not something exceptional e g their last holiday by out of doors recreation the survey means open spaces in and around towns and cities including parks canals and nature areas the coast and beaches this definition perfectly matches the concept of daily nature based recreation considered in the biophysical assessment all open areas in and around towns that provide nature based recreation opportunities to process the mobility function we first need to set the data the observational units for mene are the english wards which correspond to the laus once the number of inhabitants is attributed to each buffer the log logistic function can be applied as follows n i 1 4 1 k i k i exp α i p o p i where n is the number of weekly visits pop i represents the population in distance buffer i and k i and α i are the parameters of interest table 2 the two parameters have been estimated on the mene outcomes for england and then applied to the other eu laus through a transfer function approach the number of visits is then multiplied by the 52 weeks in a year applying these estimates to the laus we can derive the number of recreational visits using the accessibility approach the only information needed for this model is the number of inhabitants in distance buffers from the recreational site 2 4 monetary valuation of nature based recreation to ensure consistency between the biophysical modelling and the monetary valuation the valuation method should take into account some of the key variables used in the biophysical assessment of the actual flow in this way changes in the biophysical assessment of the service flow will be reflected in changes in the monetary value of the service la notte et al 2015 in this study the actual flow of nature based recreation is expressed as potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation however the translation into monetary terms also requires spatial information on the relationship between the es potential and demand i e at which distance potential visits are generated this information is derived from the mobility function applied to different distance buffers and it is directly applicable to the zonal travel cost method zonal tcm the zonal tcm is a valuation technique in the family of revealed preference techniques whereby consumers preferences are disclosed by their purchasing habits this valuation technique is seea compliant permitting consistent comparison with valuation reflected in the sna un et al 2014b for zonal tcm consumers purchasing habits are estimated based on the number of trips that they make at different travel costs this method was chosen instead of other valuation techniques that might have been more suitable for this purpose such as hedonic pricing liebelt et al 2018 because of the lack of eu level data on house prices therefore the travel cost was the most suitable proxy to estimate the exchange value of visits generated at different distances even when assessing walking biking trips as time travelling or cycling to recreation sites cannot be valued with exchange price the travel expenses by car represent a replacement costs which proxy the value of recreation in line with seea guidelines the steps required to apply the zonal tcm to the actual flow i e number of potential visits are 1 calculating the percentage of eu citizens engaging in nature based recreation for each distance buffer from the outcomes obtained we can report that on average in the eu 28 of inhabitants at less than 1 km of high quality areas for daily recreation visit them weekly moving further away from these recreational areas the percentage of visits per inhabitant strongly decreases fig 4 2 multiplying the average travel cost per trip for each buffer using the cost of fuel as reported by the uk automobile association and validated for the rest of europe by the european road information centre for the sake of consistency constant prices were applied over time and across the eu 3 processing a trip generation function which constitutes a model of the use for the analysed site a regression is undertaken against travel costs from each zone the outcomes of the monetary valuation are expressed in absolute terms and include round trips this implies that a larger population close to high quality areas for daily recreation will lead to a greater number of potential visits that in turn will translate into higher monetary value in addition visits may also be derived from locations further away this still is part of recreation as a whole but overlaps with tourism already accounted for in the sna and so needs to be treated separately 2 5 seea eea accounting tables the actual flow of daily nature based recreation quantified in physical and monetary terms is used to fill in the seea eea accounting tables for illustrative purposes we show only the accounting tables in monetary terms however the same tables could be filled in with the number of potential visits the supply table assigns the contribution of each ecosystem type to the actual flow of nature based recreation as measured by the number of potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation per year to classify ecosystem types we have employed the ecosystem typology described in the eu initiative mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services maes et al 2013 the allocation of the actual flow to the different ecosystem types at national level was based on the relative extent of ecosystems within the high quality areas for nature based recreation weighted by the scores given to measure the suitability of the different land cover types to support recreation see section 2 1 1 appendix b next the use table allocates the service flow to the users which in this case are households in this sense the biophysical assessment of the demand should be based on the users to which the service flow is allocated 2 6 benefit assessment of nature based recreation one of the socio economic benefits of nature based recreation most frequently acknowledged in the literature is its contribution to and enhancement of human wellbeing bowler et al 2010 to assess the contribution of nature based recreation to human wellbeing we used the only eu wide data available related to wellbeing the indicator of country level life satisfaction for 2013 this indicator includes among other domains the satisfaction with recreational and green areas greensat coded in eurostat as ilc pw05 greensat indicates the percentage of the population rating their satisfaction with recreational and green areas as high medium or low we compared the greensat indicator with two components of nature based recreation that may be related to human wellbeing the actual flow and the proportion of the population whose need for daily nature based recreation is covered met demand 3 results 3 1 recreation potential the distribution of nature based recreation potential as measured by the extent of high quality areas for daily recreation covers 17 of the eu 28 territory however the service potential at lau level shows a heterogeneous pattern across the eu fig 5a countries such as slovenia and germany show the highest potential while ireland and croatia present the lowest recreation potential in relative terms 3 2 demand and its spatial distribution regions of central europe as well as the capital city of each country show the largest demand for nature based recreation because of their high population densities fig 5b having areas with high quality recreation opportunities nearby those regions would contribute to the wellbeing of more people thus increasing the benefits generated however the proportion of this demand whose accessibility to high quality areas for daily recreation is not guaranteed is spatially variable unmet demand in fig 5c in 2012 it was found that 62 of the eu population lived within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation considered as met demand of this proportion only 6 live within walking distance i e 1 km of high quality areas for daily recreation while 56 need a longer walk or a bicycle to reach such areas between 1 and 4 km fig 6 in contrast 173 million inhabitants 38 of the total eu 28 population live further than 4 km from high quality areas for daily recreation this proportion is considered an unmet demand and is unevenly distributed across the eu fig 5c countries such as romania and bulgaria show a large proportion of unmet demand across their whole territory figs 5c and 6 both show that access to recreational areas is inequitable 3 3 actual flow daily nature based recreation generated about 40 million potential visits in 2012 this flow has a monetary value of about eur 50 billion per year the map of the actual flow of nature based recreation quantified as the potential number of visits to high quality areas for daily recreation at the lau level shows particularly high values in big cities but also overall in germany fig 5d this is a consequence of this country s high population density but also of the high recreation potential as measured by the proportion of high quality areas for daily recreation fig 5a b importantly germany also shows a low proportion of its population considered as unmet demand it means that here accessibility to green areas is practically guaranteed when compared with countries such as spain and ireland where the unmet demand is higher fig 5c highly populated countries such as germany france and the united kingdom have larger actual flow because of the high demand for nature based recreation driving the actual flow of the service for a more meaningful comparison of the actual flow across countries the use of the service needs to be expressed in relative terms as the percentage of potential visits per inhabitant fig 7 shows that denmark and luxembourg have the highest percentage of potential visits per inhabitant this can be explained by the low proportion of the population considered as unmet demand 22 in denmark and 10 in luxembourg but also by a higher share of the population living very close less than 2 km to high quality areas for daily recreation within this distance the percentage of citizens engaging in daily nature based recreation is higher than further away fig 4 3 4 accounting tables at the eu level the actual flow of nature based recreation was valued at approximately eur 50 billion in 2012 the supply table for nature based recreation shows that woodland and forest are the ecosystems with the highest value at the eu level table 3 however the country level accounting tables appendix e show that different countries record higher nature based recreation for different ecosystem types for example in the united kingdom a high actual flow is recorded for grassland while in other countries such as germany italy and poland woodland and forest provide the highest actual flow table 3 reports the data in absolute terms however the actual flow expressed in relative terms as the value of potential visits per inhabitant shows a remarkable change in the ranking of countries fig 8 germany is the most populated country in europe and it records the highest value for nature based recreation in absolute terms if we consider the value of recreation per total inhabitants then estonia hungary and slovakia record the highest values while germany ranks ninth 3 5 benefit assessment we found a non significant correlation between the actual flow of daily nature based recreation in 2012 and the proportion of the population with different levels of satisfaction with recreational and green areas table 4 however the proportion of the population considered as met demand has a significantly positive correlation with the proportion of people highly satisfied with recreational and green areas this demonstrates that countries with higher recreation potential within 4 km of residential areas as assessed in this study have greater satisfaction with recreational and green areas as measured by the statistical indicator relevant to personal wellbeing measurements to reduce the unmet demand population living beyond 4 km from recreational areas may significantly contribute to increasing the level of satisfaction with recreational and green areas 3 6 trends in nature based recreation the actual flow of nature based recreation increased by about 26 between 2000 and 2012 a more detailed analysis of the drivers of change in the service flow shows that the overall increase in the use and value of the service is mainly due to the increase in the recreation potential of 23 to a lesser extent the increase in the demand population of about 6 also plays a role in driving changes in the actual flow of the service for all eu 15 countries the increase in recreation potential was significantly larger than the increase in demand improving their situation to potentially satisfy the demand for recreation belgium and ireland showed the largest increases in the actual flow of the service fig 9 however whereas in belgium the main driver of change in service use was an expansion of recreational areas in ireland this was not as important instead the increase in the actual flow was also driven by higher demand 4 discussion ecosystem services accounting is a very useful tool to assess the role of ecosystems and socio economics systems determining the ecosystem services flow and to measure changes arising from the interaction of different ecosystem service components service potential and demand fig 1 the experimental accounts for nature based recreation developed in this study show the importance of spatially explicit models for assessing ecosystem services in which different components can be mapped ecosystem service potential demand and actual flow in both biophysical and monetary units deriving maps of ecosystem service potential and demand is a key step in quantifying the actual flow of the service used which is determined by the spatial relationship i e proximity in the case of nature based recreation between spa and sba in addition spatially explicit data on the components of ecosystem services i e maps are useful for understanding the role of different drivers behind changes in the service flow and for supporting policy decisions related to the management of natural capital in this experimental account we focused on assessing only daily nature based recreation without accounting for visits to natural areas for which motor transport is required therefore what we present is only one of a range of nature based recreation possibilities and the results should be interpreted in the context of what is being measured different results would have been obtained if the focus was on areas that were far away from roads and settlements or those with medium potential for nature based recreation for this last option a new method should have been developed able to attribute different value to the different nature based alternatives i e areas far away and or with medium recreation potential 4 1 ecological models in ecosystem services accounts this study presents one of the first approaches of ecosystem services accounting at the eu level following the guidelines provided in seea eea and the seea technical recommendations un 2017 un et al 2014b national accounts are usually based on official data statistics reported by countries however as illustrated in this study accounts for ecosystem services require the use of spatially explicit models of ecosystem services models were needed because data on the number of users related to daily nature based recreation activity were missing these data could be used to quantify the actual flow and the economic value of nature based recreation some member states e g italy and the united kingdom have started to collect nature based recreation data istat 2018 uk government 2014 however using data on the real use of nature based recreation would lack a linkage with ecosystem service potential failing to capture the role of drivers of change in ecosystem service flow namely service potential and demand fig 9 in other words we might find an increase in the number of users of green areas simply because the population has increased the increase in actual flow driven by growth in demand could be masking changes in recreation potential such as a reduction in the extent or quality of nature areas for recreation in this sense natural capital accounting would fail in its goal to measure changes in the stock of natural capital as also formulated by hein et al 2016 ultimately data on the number of users would be useful to validate the model and relate real use data to the ecosystem potential we modelled in this study integrating spatial models in accounting is a key step in the development of robust accounts of ecosystem services in which the spatial connection between es potential and demand plays a key role ecosystem services integrate ecology and socio economical analysis in ecology service potential is more frequently assessed than service demand and the actual flow is only rarely quantified boerema et al 2017 mouchet et al 2017 verhagen et al 2017 the assessment of the actual flow required in accounting involves a higher level of complexity that arises from integrating ecosystems the service potential and socio economic systems the demand for the service this integration as demonstrated for nature based recreation requires the assessment of the spatial relationship between spas and sbas in the case of nature based recreation proximity between high quality areas for recreation and population users is the key spatial parameter for estimating service flow using the mobility function the spatial relationship between service potential and demand needs to be carefully established when quantifying the actual flow of ecosystem services however this relationship differs depending on the type of the ecosystem service being assessed syrbe and walz 2012 4 2 flow of nature based recreation from ecosystems to people nature based recreation accounts for 2012 show an actual flow of 40 million potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation with a total value of eur 50 billion this demonstrates the important contribution ecosystems make to satisfy people s recreation needs which has increased by 26 since 2000 woodland and forest are the ecosystem types with the greatest contribution to the use of nature based recreation by households as shown in the supply and use tables households are the only economic agent considered a direct user of this service services related to tourism are a consequence of a high influx of visits to some natural area of interest ad hoc satellite accounts are dedicated to tourism already united nations et al 2010 the role of natural attractions in tourism should be further developed within these tourism satellite accounts for consistency with the core sna and to avoid double counting the 40 million potential visits estimated in this study may look relatively small when compared with the approximately 500 million eu citizens this is explained by three factors in order of importance first the assessment of actual flow is based only on the proportion of the population considered as met demand i e living within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation which in the eu is 62 of the total population fig 6 second the actual flow is calculated by a calibrated mobility function using an average percentage of visits of 17 it implies that only this percentage of the met demand visits high quality areas for daily recreation fig 4 third the nature based recreation potential includes only high quality areas with high nature based recreation opportunities that are close to settlements and roads therefore the results should be interpreted given these assumptions loosening these rigid conditions would evidently increase the actual use reported in this paper in spite of the relatively small number of visits the monetary value of nature based recreation estimated at eur 50 billion annually is higher than that of other ecosystem services at the european level for instance water purification is valued at eur 16 billion per year la notte et al 2017 while the value of total crop pollination in europe amounts to eur 14 billion per year gallai et al 2009 although there might be limits to comparing ecosystem services values based on different valuation techniques the threefold value of nature based recreation may suggest a high importance of this service for society in fact there is a growing demand for nature based recreation in society as shown by the positive population trends in the eu except in germany fig 9 the increase in demand but especially the enhancement in recreation potential led to an increase of 26 in the potential number of visits between 2000 and 2012 fig 9 corresponding to an increase of 16 in the value of the service table 3 the increase in recreation potential is mainly due to two key drivers of the model land cover and protected areas in relation to land cover changes ecosystem extent accounts complementary to the service accounts seea eea would provide the data necessary to make an accurate interpretation of the role of land cover changes on increasing ecosystem service potential in each country the key land cover variables leading to an increase in service potential are the expansion of forest and semi natural areas in some cases urban sprawl may also play a key role if recreation hot spots become closer to residential areas changing the spatial distribution between ecosystem services potential and demand protected areas natura 2000 sites as included in the model do not necessarily imply any improvement in the physical suitability or condition of the ecosystems supporting recreation however new protected areas usually involve the development of recreation services and facilities such as adding walking paths and informative signs about designated areas with high natural value increasing the recreation potential although the nature based recreation model excludes strict nature reserves from analysis where access is not permitted category ia appendix c recreational use of protected areas may compromise the conservation management of those areas ultimately potential conflicts between nature conservation and recreation should be considered in management strategies working at the eu level imposes many limitations such as data availability and consistency as mentioned in section 2 3 for the biophysical mapping a procedure simplified from the original approach was applied excluding data that cannot be compared over time such as high nature value farmland paracchini et al 2014 this may result in an underestimation of the ecosystem based potential in some agricultural areas that should be taken into account availability of these data for different time periods would improve the assessment of changes in natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides in addition the mobility function for the eu 28 has been built using only data from england the lack of data also prevented us from applying more appropriate valuation techniques such as hedonic pricing since spatially explicit data on housing pricing are not available at the eu level european environment agency 2010 therefore the travel cost method was the most suitable technique to calculate a proxy of the value of walking biking trips consistently with the sna in future developments of nature based recreation accounts alternative valuation methods such as hedonic pricing could also be compared once datasets become available however attention should be paid to harmonising this technique with sna by avoiding double counting another limitation of the valuation technique used is the lack of integration with congestion effects congestion is a social sustainability component that ideally would need to be accounted for when valuing the service in future applications crowded recreation areas may contribute less to wellbeing thereby decreasing the benefit generated by the service and consequently its value congestion can also influence people to choose to go elsewhere if the location is too crowded what is known as displacement manning and valliere 2001 one possible way of calculating congestion is to assess the number of visits per square metre of high quality areas for daily recreation the area s size on its own cannot provide a measurement for congestion unless it is considered together with the visiting ratio of the population where there are many inhabitants larger sized areas or many smaller sized areas would be required to meet the demand for daily recreation in a socially sustainable way 4 3 application to land planning the spatial analysis required for nature based recreation accounting can be used to support policy decisions on land planning to identify priority areas for ecosystem restoration priority should be given to enhancing the recreation potential of those areas with a high unmet demand for the deployment of green infrastructure this kind of measure can increase the equitability of access to nature based recreation areas and contribute to the achievement of the sustainable development goal 11 united nations 2015 as shown in fig 6 38 of the eu population has limited access to high quality areas for daily recreation unmet demand improving proximity to those areas i e increasing the met demand will have a positive impact on the population by increasing their level of satisfaction with recreational and green areas table 4 which is a component of life satisfaction it is interesting to highlight that satisfaction with green areas is correlated with the proportion of the population with met demand but not with the actual flow this may suggest that those living within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation are also satisfied with the availability of recreational areas regardless of the distance this analysis constitutes an initial approach to assessing the benefits generated by nature based recreation however further research would be needed to properly account for the benefits generated by visits to recreational areas importantly the comparison of the nature based recreation assessment with external and independent indicators such as greensat may be interpreted as an ex post validation of the assumptions made in our assessment such as those taken for the delineation of high quality areas for daily recreation from the estimap model or the distances considered to distinguish between met and unmet demand 5 conclusions ecosystem services accounting is still experimental and requires the development of a number of accounts for different types of ecosystem services practical examples of ecosystem services accounts as shown in this study are required to further develop the conceptual and methodological framework proposed by the seea eea this study using nature based recreation as an example highlights the importance of spatially explicit models for ecosystem services accounts in which the different components of ecosystem services can be mapped i e potential demand and flow spatial models of ecosystems services are also required to properly address the drivers of changes in ecosystem services changes in ecosystems extent and condition and changes in socio economic systems or the spatial relationship between ecosystems and socio economic systems in addition using biophysical spatial models in ecosystem services accounts contributes to the development of policy measures targeting the enhancement of natural capital ecosystem services and the benefits they provide the accounting tables completed for a representative number of ecosystem services may become a useful tool to aid the analysis of synergies and trade offs among services including provisioning regulation and maintenance and cultural ecosystem services consistently applying the same accounting methodology across eu member states will enable accurate comparisons between countries and over time this is undertaken by employing the mechanism and rules of the sna and the seea eea allowing the integration of ecosystem services with traditional economic accounts so that environmental economic analyses can be

25150,natural capital accounting aims to measure changes in the stock of natural assets i e soil air water and all living things and to integrate the value of ecosystem services into accounting systems that will contribute to better ecosystems management this study develops ecosystem services accounts at the european union level using nature based recreation as a case study and following the current international accounting framework system of environmental economic accounting experimental ecosystem accounting seea eea we adapt and integrate different biophysical and socio economic models illustrating the workflow necessary for ecosystem services accounts from a biophysical assessment of nature based recreation to an economic valuation and compilation of the accounting tables the biophysical assessment of nature based recreation is based on spatially explicit models for assessing different components of ecosystem services potential demand and actual flow deriving maps of ecosystem service potential and demand is a key step in quantifying the actual flow of the service used which is determined by the spatial relationship i e proximity in the case of nature based recreation between service potential and demand the nature based recreation accounts for 2012 show an actual flow of 40 million potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation with a total value of eur 50 billion this constitutes an important contribution of ecosystems to people s lives that has increased by 26 since 2000 practical examples of ecosystem services accounts as shown in this study are required to derive recommendations and further develop the conceptual and methodological framework proposed by the seea eea this paper highlights the importance of using spatially explicit models for ecosystem services accounts mapping the different components of ecosystem services allows proper identification of the drivers of changes in the actual service flow derived from ecosystems socio economic systems and or their spatial relationship this will contribute to achieving one of the main goals of ecosystem accounts namely measuring changes in natural capital but it

travel cost method un united nations 1 introduction a region s economic prosperity and wellbeing is underpinned by its natural capital natural capital is the world s stock of natural assets which includes geology soil air water and all living organisms it is from this natural capital that humans derive a wide range of ecosystem services such as protection against natural disasters climate regulation pollination and nature based recreation all of which make human life possible natural capital accounting is a tool to measure the changes in the stock of natural assets and to integrate the value of ecosystem services into accounting and reporting systems which will contribute to more effective ecosystem and land management measures the seventh environment action programme and the biodiversity strategy to 2020 of the european union eu include objectives to develop natural capital accounts in the eu with a focus on ecosystems and their services more specifically action 5 of the eu biodiversity strategy requires member states with the assistance of the european commission to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services they must also assess the economic value of such services and promote the integration of these values into accounting and reporting systems at the eu and national level by 2020 ecosystem services es are the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human wellbeing teeb 2010 es are the flows from ecosystems to socio economic systems that are actually realised or used in a specific area and time maes et al 2013 we denote the realised or used flow of an ecosystem services here as the actual flow ecosystem services accounts focus on the actual flow of the service understood as a transaction from ecosystems to socio economic systems fig 1 in this sense different components of ecosystems and socio economic systems are fundamental to assess the actual flow of the service and understand the changes over time hein et al 2016 the amount of service that ecosystems can provide irrespective from the demand by people i e the es potential is usually assessed based on the ecosystem s properties and conditions that are recognised as being relevant to the service considered fig 1 an es flow is the fraction of the es potential driven by the demand for that service from human needs and preferences for some ecosystem services this fraction can be higher than the potential if the service is overused it is important to stress that the service flow is generated only if the following conditions are met 1 there is an ecosystem potential to generate the service in a service providing area spa 2 there is a demand for the service by the socio economic system and 3 there is a spatial connection between the demand and the spas bagstad et al 2014 burkhard and maes 2017 fisher et al 2009 syrbe and walz 2012 an es flow connects ecosystems to socio economic systems to ultimately generate benefits however drivers of change derived from socio economic systems also act on ecosystems by modifying their properties and conditions fig 1 some of these drivers of change result in pressures on the environment other drivers of change may have a positive impact on the ecosystem such as sustainable land management or protection measures drivers of change act on ecosystems modifying the es potential and hence the actual flow of the service therefore assessing all of these components and their inter connection is essential to quantify the actual flow of the service i e use and its integration into an accounting system the united nations un system of integrated environmental economic accounting experimental ecosystem accounts seea eea is currently developing a standard for natural capital accounts un et al 2014b the technical recommendations of seea eea make proposals on how to develop accounting tables of ecosystem extent condition service supply and use and asset values un 2017 the seea eea accounting tables for ecosystem services record the actual flow of services during an accounting period the supply of a service by each ecosystem type is recorded in the supply table and its use by different economic units i e industries and households is presented in the use table ultimately the main purpose of supply and use tables for ecosystem services is to show which ecosystem types generate the actual flow of a service and which economic units use it in accounting terms supply always equals use because both tables refer to the actual flow of the service the accounting tables are compiled first in biophysical units and then in monetary terms the accounting workflow starts from a biophysical assessment of the actual flow which is then economically valued using an appropriate valuation technique un 2017 the economic valuation of ecosystem services in accounting allows a direct comparison with the system of national accounts sna which is used to monitor the economy and thus an integrated ecological economic analysis natural capital accounting under the seea eea framework is experimental and only a limited number of studies have explored the feasibility of applying it in practice e g keith et al 2017 la notte et al 2017 remme et al 2014 2016 robinson et al 2017 ecosystem services accounts in particular still present many scientific and technical challenges data or indicators available for ecosystem services accounts are usually scarce and mainly limited to provisioning ecosystem services i e timber crops and water for which the accounting framework is provided by the seea central framework un et al 2014a in the case of regulating and cultural ecosystem services accounting needs to rely on spatially explicit models developed for the biophysical assessment of ecosystem services most frequently biophysical models quantify the es potential based on dimensionless indicators while models quantifying the actual flow are more limited hein et al 2016 villamagna et al 2013 however ecosystem service accounting as described above requires an assessment of the actual flow of the service based on spatially explicit information of the drivers of the ecosystem services use i e es potential and demand in this sense further research is needed to facilitate the integration of ecosystem services models into accounting systems this study develops an eu wide ecosystem service account following the current international accounting framework seea eea and makes suggestions for further developments based on this practical application we describe in detail the workflow necessary to build the accounts 1 conducting a biophysical assessment of the es accounting components potential demand and actual flow 2 applying a seea compliant valuation technique to translate the actual flow of the service into monetary units 3 filling in the accounting tables for each country and 4 conducting a benefit assessment last we analyse changes in the actual flow of the service over time the accounting workflow is illustrated for nature based recreation nature based recreation is a cultural ecosystem service comprising all physical and intellectual interactions with biota ecosystems and land seascapes more specifically in this study nature based recreation relates to the biophysical characteristics or qualities of ecosystems that people view observe experience or enjoy passively or actively on the daily activity it covers a wide variety of activities including walking jogging or running in nearby urban green space or by a river lake or sea cycling in nature after work picnicking and observing flora and fauna daily nature based recreation is measured as the potential visits people make to enjoy natural amenities fitting within the daily activities similar to other daily activities e g working going to school and shopping this benefits society by enhancing human wellbeing as a number of studies has demonstrated bowler et al 2010 korpela et al 2014 2 materials and methods a possible biophysical indicator of daily nature based recreation is the number of people using green space or natural areas for this purpose given the lack of data at eu level on nature based recreational use the ecosystem service has been modelled using an adapted version of the nature based recreation model implemented in the ecosystem services mapping tool estimap paracchini et al 2014 zulian et al 2017 estimap is a collection of models for a spatially explicit assessment of ecosystem services zulian et al 2017 as highlighted in the introduction the actual flow which is recorded in the accounting tables is driven by the es potential demand and the spatial relationship between them in the case of daily nature based recreation the service potential is quantified as the extent of high quality areas for daily recreation section 2 1 and the service demand is quantified as the number of inhabitants section 2 2 then the proximity between these two components section 2 2 1 is ultimately used to quantify the es flow section 2 3 the actual flow is expressed as the number of potential visits to areas suitable for daily recreation fig 2 and table 1 the actual flow is then translated into monetary terms section 2 4 which is finally reported in the supply and use tables section 2 5 we also present a first approach towards the assessment of the benefit derived from nature based recreation which in this case is the contribution to human wellbeing section 2 6 since accounts are mainly used to report changes over time we tried to cover a representative time series we took as reference years 2000 2006 and 2012 matching the years for which ecosystem extent accounts based on the corine land cover map will be available in a forthcoming working paper from the european environment agency note that the corine land cover map has a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha therefore land cover types with a restricted distribution such as green urban areas are not properly represented in this map for analysis of nature based recreation in urban areas data at finer spatial resolution should be considered zulian et al 2017 the years assessed for each component of nature based recreation depend on data availability table 1 recreation potential was assessed for all three years while the actual flow of nature based recreation can be estimated for 2000 and 2012 only assuming population density for 2015 equivalent to 2012 spatially explicit population data derived from national census are not available for 2006 european commission joint research centre et al 2015 we also compared the assessment of all components of nature based recreation potential demand and actual flow for all available years analysis of eu level trends can be done only for countries that were eu member states in 2000 eu 15 austria belgium germany denmark spain finland france greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal sweden and the united kingdom data on protected areas were not available for the remaining countries 2 1 nature based recreation potential areas with more recreation opportunities are more attractive to people and therefore have greater potential to be used nature based recreation potential is assessed based on the opportunities for recreation provided by ecosystems ecosystem based potential but also on other human inputs fig 3 appendix a shows all input data used in the model nature based recreation potential has been modelled using estimap model for nature based recreation paracchini et al 2014 zulian et al 2013 specifically adapted for accounting the estimap model for recreation is based on the advanced multiple layers lookup tables advanced lut method advanced luts assign ecosystem services scores to land units based on cross tabulation and spatial composition derived from overlaying thematic maps schröter et al 2015 ecosystem services scores for each input layer are derived from the literature and an expert based approach zulian et al 2017 the model provides a spatially explicit assessment of ecosystem potential to provide nature based recreation and leisure it integrates the two components shown in fig 2 1 ecosystem based potential eb p which estimates the potential capacity of ecosystems to support nature based recreation activities and 2 human inputs which integrates a proximity remoteness concept in relation to road networks and residential areas recreational areas close to these infrastructures can be reached more easily and have greater potential for daily nature based recreation this spatial component related to built infrastructure is especially important for assessing daily nature based recreation both eb p and human inputs are combined to assess daily recreation opportunities as a measure of recreation potential fig 3 presents a flow chart of the estimap model for nature based recreation adapted for the purpose of natural capital accounts since one of the main goals of ecosystem services accounts is tracking changes over time data from the original model paracchini et al 2014 without time series available i e high nature value farmland were not included with the exception of the road network natural pristine ecosystems assessed by the hemeroby index in paracchini et al 2014 was replaced with a scoring of the suitability to support recreation for each land cover type the terminology of the original model was also changed for consistency with the terminology used in accounting 2 1 1 ecosystem based potential ecosystem based potential eb p depends on three factors fig 3 1 suitability of land for supporting recreation each land cover type is scored according to its suitability for nature based recreation from very low or close to 0 in industrial or highly urbanised areas to maximum values of 1 for some semi natural areas such as forests and beaches appendix b 2 nature elements this includes other features that play a role in providing nature based recreational opportunities such as the presence of protected natural areas protected natural areas are scored according to the management categories for protected areas of the international union for conservation of nature iucn dudley 2008 the score matrix has been derived from the analysis of management objectives appendix c 3 water elements the presence of water is a key element of nature based leisure and recreation ghermandi 2015 jennings 2007 we consider coastal and inland elements as proxies for this component the former comprises coastal geomorphology proximity to the coast and presence of protected marine areas the latter relates to proximity to lakes data on bathing water quality which member states report to comply with the eu bathing water directive are also included finally the eb p map was reclassified into for classes very high 4 high 3 low 2 and very low 1 provision fig 3 2 1 2 the role of human inputs in ecosystem service potential the final quantification of recreation potential requires integration of the human inputs for human inputs we considered the distance from local roads and residential areas data on the local road network were only available for 2013 appendix a however changes in local roads for the time period assessed between 2000 and 2012 are not expected to be very significant especially when considering that the final spatial resolution of the analyses is 1 km2 fig 3 distances measured were cross tabulated to define five levels of proximity from near to far cross tabulation a fig 3 finally the levels of proximity were cross tabulated with the different classes of eb p generating nine categories of recreation opportunities the so called recreation opportunity spectrum cross tabulation b fig 3 paracchini et al 2014 the primary model output is a map with nine categories showing different levels of recreation provision and proximity fig 3 cross tabulations a and b were based on the same parameters applied in previous studies at the eu scale liquete et al 2016 accounting for daily nature based recreation requires quantifying the service flow in physical units with this goal in mind we limited the accounting of nature based recreation to locations with high quality recreation areas i e high provision close to urban areas and roads and therefore suitable for daily use this corresponds to category 9 of the recreation opportunity spectrum fig 3 we refer to this category as high quality areas for daily recreation which are considered in this application as the spa the extent of high quality areas for daily recreation is used in this accounting exercise as the ecosystem service potential it corresponds to all open space areas in and around towns that provide high nature based recreation opportunities therefore remote areas for nature based recreation or close to settlements but with medium or low provision are not considered as service providing area in this paper this choice was driven by the method adopted for the monetary valuation which was based on a mobility functional calibrated with survey data on daily recreation 2 2 demand for nature based recreation the actual flow of a service is partly determined by the demand assessing the demand enables the actual flow to be allocated to the users in the use table of the account demand for nature based recreation takes different forms people need nearby ecosystems such as urban green spaces forests or nature reserves for relaxing jogging walking or cycling there is also an important demand for nature based recreation that requires long distance travel for instance to visit a national park or to hike in the mountains however in this study we have accounted for only short distance recreation which estimates the value of ecosystems that have high potential for daily recreation to quantify the demand for nature based recreation we used population data from the global human settlement model european commission joint research centre et al 2015 this spatial raster depicts the distribution and density of the population expressed as the number of people per 1 km square cell to compare the demand for nature based recreation across the eu we estimated the population density for local administrative units laus 2 2 1 demand in relation to service potential before calculating the actual flow of the service it is necessary to first assess the spatial relationship between the spa i e high quality areas for daily recreation and the service benefiting areas sbas where the demand i e people is located this spatial relationship ultimately drives the service flow we quantified how the population in each lau is distributed over different distances from the nearest high quality areas for daily recreation this method is known as the cumulative opportunity model vale et al 2015 fig 3 which has been recognised as suitable for evaluating the benefits of green space and open air recreation areas ekkel and de vries 2017 it is based on raster operations using grass commands r distance and r recode grass development team 2017 see illustrative example in appendix d the distance buffers applied are within 1 km this is considered regular walking distance people living here can easily reach a recreation area after a short walk three distance buffers 1 2 km 2 3 km and 3 4 km at these distances recreational areas may be reached by long walks or by using a recreational standard bicycle beyond 4 km we took an intermediate value between the average cycling journey of 3 km and the 5 km threshold beyond which bicycles are generally not used according to research in the united kingdom barton and tsourou 2013 we considered people living beyond this distance as an unmet demand since they may need a car to reach high quality areas for daily recreation or might use recreational areas with lower opportunities for or lower quality of nature based recreation therefore generating fewer benefits although a spatial analysis of demand in relation to service potential is an intermediate step in estimating the actual flow of nature based recreation we also report the results on the unmet demand given its relevance to policy support this information could be used to plan measures guaranteeing equitable access to nature based recreation opportunities providing universal access to safe inclusive and accessible green and public space is one of the targets of united nations sustainable development goal 11 united nations 2015 this allows us to distinguish the part of the population whose need for daily nature based recreation is covered met demand within the first four kilometres from the part of the population to which access to high quality areas for daily recreation is not secured unmet demand the proportion with met demand may satisfy their need for nature based recreation relatively easily by foot or by bicycle citizens do not necessarily have to use motor transport to enjoy daily nature based recreation if they live close to places providing high recreation opportunities to assess the actual flow of daily nature based recreation we count only the proportion of population living within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation met demand 2 3 actual flow of nature based recreation the methodology used to assess actual flows in biophysical terms requires consistency with valuation techniques that translate the biophysical assessment into monetary terms the monetary valuation is based on the zonal travel cost method see section 2 4 this technique requires the number of visits generated at different distance buffers to be quantified which will then be considered in terms of actual biophysical flow since the observed number of visits per recreational area is not available at either the eu nor member state level we need to rely on a mobility function to move from the number of inhabitants to the number of potential visits that will be generated depending on the distance from high quality areas for daily recreation the mobility function represents the probability of potential visits as a function of the distance travelled geurs and ritsema van eck 2001 reviewed the literature on accessibility measures and presented the log logistic function as the most popular approach for determining the number of visits to shopping malls trains stations and job centres among other places using the log logistic approach our function models the number of daily recreation visits based on the spatial distribution of the population the function has been calibrated on a survey undertaken in england the monitor of engagement with the natural environment mene survey ferrini et al 2015 uk government 2014 the mene survey provides observation data on the exact type of services to value respondents are asked about occasions in the last week when you spent your time out of doors the survey focuses on daily activities and the users have to think about their usual behaviour the last week being a normal week and not something exceptional e g their last holiday by out of doors recreation the survey means open spaces in and around towns and cities including parks canals and nature areas the coast and beaches this definition perfectly matches the concept of daily nature based recreation considered in the biophysical assessment all open areas in and around towns that provide nature based recreation opportunities to process the mobility function we first need to set the data the observational units for mene are the english wards which correspond to the laus once the number of inhabitants is attributed to each buffer the log logistic function can be applied as follows n i 1 4 1 k i k i exp α i p o p i where n is the number of weekly visits pop i represents the population in distance buffer i and k i and α i are the parameters of interest table 2 the two parameters have been estimated on the mene outcomes for england and then applied to the other eu laus through a transfer function approach the number of visits is then multiplied by the 52 weeks in a year applying these estimates to the laus we can derive the number of recreational visits using the accessibility approach the only information needed for this model is the number of inhabitants in distance buffers from the recreational site 2 4 monetary valuation of nature based recreation to ensure consistency between the biophysical modelling and the monetary valuation the valuation method should take into account some of the key variables used in the biophysical assessment of the actual flow in this way changes in the biophysical assessment of the service flow will be reflected in changes in the monetary value of the service la notte et al 2015 in this study the actual flow of nature based recreation is expressed as potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation however the translation into monetary terms also requires spatial information on the relationship between the es potential and demand i e at which distance potential visits are generated this information is derived from the mobility function applied to different distance buffers and it is directly applicable to the zonal travel cost method zonal tcm the zonal tcm is a valuation technique in the family of revealed preference techniques whereby consumers preferences are disclosed by their purchasing habits this valuation technique is seea compliant permitting consistent comparison with valuation reflected in the sna un et al 2014b for zonal tcm consumers purchasing habits are estimated based on the number of trips that they make at different travel costs this method was chosen instead of other valuation techniques that might have been more suitable for this purpose such as hedonic pricing liebelt et al 2018 because of the lack of eu level data on house prices therefore the travel cost was the most suitable proxy to estimate the exchange value of visits generated at different distances even when assessing walking biking trips as time travelling or cycling to recreation sites cannot be valued with exchange price the travel expenses by car represent a replacement costs which proxy the value of recreation in line with seea guidelines the steps required to apply the zonal tcm to the actual flow i e number of potential visits are 1 calculating the percentage of eu citizens engaging in nature based recreation for each distance buffer from the outcomes obtained we can report that on average in the eu 28 of inhabitants at less than 1 km of high quality areas for daily recreation visit them weekly moving further away from these recreational areas the percentage of visits per inhabitant strongly decreases fig 4 2 multiplying the average travel cost per trip for each buffer using the cost of fuel as reported by the uk automobile association and validated for the rest of europe by the european road information centre for the sake of consistency constant prices were applied over time and across the eu 3 processing a trip generation function which constitutes a model of the use for the analysed site a regression is undertaken against travel costs from each zone the outcomes of the monetary valuation are expressed in absolute terms and include round trips this implies that a larger population close to high quality areas for daily recreation will lead to a greater number of potential visits that in turn will translate into higher monetary value in addition visits may also be derived from locations further away this still is part of recreation as a whole but overlaps with tourism already accounted for in the sna and so needs to be treated separately 2 5 seea eea accounting tables the actual flow of daily nature based recreation quantified in physical and monetary terms is used to fill in the seea eea accounting tables for illustrative purposes we show only the accounting tables in monetary terms however the same tables could be filled in with the number of potential visits the supply table assigns the contribution of each ecosystem type to the actual flow of nature based recreation as measured by the number of potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation per year to classify ecosystem types we have employed the ecosystem typology described in the eu initiative mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services maes et al 2013 the allocation of the actual flow to the different ecosystem types at national level was based on the relative extent of ecosystems within the high quality areas for nature based recreation weighted by the scores given to measure the suitability of the different land cover types to support recreation see section 2 1 1 appendix b next the use table allocates the service flow to the users which in this case are households in this sense the biophysical assessment of the demand should be based on the users to which the service flow is allocated 2 6 benefit assessment of nature based recreation one of the socio economic benefits of nature based recreation most frequently acknowledged in the literature is its contribution to and enhancement of human wellbeing bowler et al 2010 to assess the contribution of nature based recreation to human wellbeing we used the only eu wide data available related to wellbeing the indicator of country level life satisfaction for 2013 this indicator includes among other domains the satisfaction with recreational and green areas greensat coded in eurostat as ilc pw05 greensat indicates the percentage of the population rating their satisfaction with recreational and green areas as high medium or low we compared the greensat indicator with two components of nature based recreation that may be related to human wellbeing the actual flow and the proportion of the population whose need for daily nature based recreation is covered met demand 3 results 3 1 recreation potential the distribution of nature based recreation potential as measured by the extent of high quality areas for daily recreation covers 17 of the eu 28 territory however the service potential at lau level shows a heterogeneous pattern across the eu fig 5a countries such as slovenia and germany show the highest potential while ireland and croatia present the lowest recreation potential in relative terms 3 2 demand and its spatial distribution regions of central europe as well as the capital city of each country show the largest demand for nature based recreation because of their high population densities fig 5b having areas with high quality recreation opportunities nearby those regions would contribute to the wellbeing of more people thus increasing the benefits generated however the proportion of this demand whose accessibility to high quality areas for daily recreation is not guaranteed is spatially variable unmet demand in fig 5c in 2012 it was found that 62 of the eu population lived within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation considered as met demand of this proportion only 6 live within walking distance i e 1 km of high quality areas for daily recreation while 56 need a longer walk or a bicycle to reach such areas between 1 and 4 km fig 6 in contrast 173 million inhabitants 38 of the total eu 28 population live further than 4 km from high quality areas for daily recreation this proportion is considered an unmet demand and is unevenly distributed across the eu fig 5c countries such as romania and bulgaria show a large proportion of unmet demand across their whole territory figs 5c and 6 both show that access to recreational areas is inequitable 3 3 actual flow daily nature based recreation generated about 40 million potential visits in 2012 this flow has a monetary value of about eur 50 billion per year the map of the actual flow of nature based recreation quantified as the potential number of visits to high quality areas for daily recreation at the lau level shows particularly high values in big cities but also overall in germany fig 5d this is a consequence of this country s high population density but also of the high recreation potential as measured by the proportion of high quality areas for daily recreation fig 5a b importantly germany also shows a low proportion of its population considered as unmet demand it means that here accessibility to green areas is practically guaranteed when compared with countries such as spain and ireland where the unmet demand is higher fig 5c highly populated countries such as germany france and the united kingdom have larger actual flow because of the high demand for nature based recreation driving the actual flow of the service for a more meaningful comparison of the actual flow across countries the use of the service needs to be expressed in relative terms as the percentage of potential visits per inhabitant fig 7 shows that denmark and luxembourg have the highest percentage of potential visits per inhabitant this can be explained by the low proportion of the population considered as unmet demand 22 in denmark and 10 in luxembourg but also by a higher share of the population living very close less than 2 km to high quality areas for daily recreation within this distance the percentage of citizens engaging in daily nature based recreation is higher than further away fig 4 3 4 accounting tables at the eu level the actual flow of nature based recreation was valued at approximately eur 50 billion in 2012 the supply table for nature based recreation shows that woodland and forest are the ecosystems with the highest value at the eu level table 3 however the country level accounting tables appendix e show that different countries record higher nature based recreation for different ecosystem types for example in the united kingdom a high actual flow is recorded for grassland while in other countries such as germany italy and poland woodland and forest provide the highest actual flow table 3 reports the data in absolute terms however the actual flow expressed in relative terms as the value of potential visits per inhabitant shows a remarkable change in the ranking of countries fig 8 germany is the most populated country in europe and it records the highest value for nature based recreation in absolute terms if we consider the value of recreation per total inhabitants then estonia hungary and slovakia record the highest values while germany ranks ninth 3 5 benefit assessment we found a non significant correlation between the actual flow of daily nature based recreation in 2012 and the proportion of the population with different levels of satisfaction with recreational and green areas table 4 however the proportion of the population considered as met demand has a significantly positive correlation with the proportion of people highly satisfied with recreational and green areas this demonstrates that countries with higher recreation potential within 4 km of residential areas as assessed in this study have greater satisfaction with recreational and green areas as measured by the statistical indicator relevant to personal wellbeing measurements to reduce the unmet demand population living beyond 4 km from recreational areas may significantly contribute to increasing the level of satisfaction with recreational and green areas 3 6 trends in nature based recreation the actual flow of nature based recreation increased by about 26 between 2000 and 2012 a more detailed analysis of the drivers of change in the service flow shows that the overall increase in the use and value of the service is mainly due to the increase in the recreation potential of 23 to a lesser extent the increase in the demand population of about 6 also plays a role in driving changes in the actual flow of the service for all eu 15 countries the increase in recreation potential was significantly larger than the increase in demand improving their situation to potentially satisfy the demand for recreation belgium and ireland showed the largest increases in the actual flow of the service fig 9 however whereas in belgium the main driver of change in service use was an expansion of recreational areas in ireland this was not as important instead the increase in the actual flow was also driven by higher demand 4 discussion ecosystem services accounting is a very useful tool to assess the role of ecosystems and socio economics systems determining the ecosystem services flow and to measure changes arising from the interaction of different ecosystem service components service potential and demand fig 1 the experimental accounts for nature based recreation developed in this study show the importance of spatially explicit models for assessing ecosystem services in which different components can be mapped ecosystem service potential demand and actual flow in both biophysical and monetary units deriving maps of ecosystem service potential and demand is a key step in quantifying the actual flow of the service used which is determined by the spatial relationship i e proximity in the case of nature based recreation between spa and sba in addition spatially explicit data on the components of ecosystem services i e maps are useful for understanding the role of different drivers behind changes in the service flow and for supporting policy decisions related to the management of natural capital in this experimental account we focused on assessing only daily nature based recreation without accounting for visits to natural areas for which motor transport is required therefore what we present is only one of a range of nature based recreation possibilities and the results should be interpreted in the context of what is being measured different results would have been obtained if the focus was on areas that were far away from roads and settlements or those with medium potential for nature based recreation for this last option a new method should have been developed able to attribute different value to the different nature based alternatives i e areas far away and or with medium recreation potential 4 1 ecological models in ecosystem services accounts this study presents one of the first approaches of ecosystem services accounting at the eu level following the guidelines provided in seea eea and the seea technical recommendations un 2017 un et al 2014b national accounts are usually based on official data statistics reported by countries however as illustrated in this study accounts for ecosystem services require the use of spatially explicit models of ecosystem services models were needed because data on the number of users related to daily nature based recreation activity were missing these data could be used to quantify the actual flow and the economic value of nature based recreation some member states e g italy and the united kingdom have started to collect nature based recreation data istat 2018 uk government 2014 however using data on the real use of nature based recreation would lack a linkage with ecosystem service potential failing to capture the role of drivers of change in ecosystem service flow namely service potential and demand fig 9 in other words we might find an increase in the number of users of green areas simply because the population has increased the increase in actual flow driven by growth in demand could be masking changes in recreation potential such as a reduction in the extent or quality of nature areas for recreation in this sense natural capital accounting would fail in its goal to measure changes in the stock of natural capital as also formulated by hein et al 2016 ultimately data on the number of users would be useful to validate the model and relate real use data to the ecosystem potential we modelled in this study integrating spatial models in accounting is a key step in the development of robust accounts of ecosystem services in which the spatial connection between es potential and demand plays a key role ecosystem services integrate ecology and socio economical analysis in ecology service potential is more frequently assessed than service demand and the actual flow is only rarely quantified boerema et al 2017 mouchet et al 2017 verhagen et al 2017 the assessment of the actual flow required in accounting involves a higher level of complexity that arises from integrating ecosystems the service potential and socio economic systems the demand for the service this integration as demonstrated for nature based recreation requires the assessment of the spatial relationship between spas and sbas in the case of nature based recreation proximity between high quality areas for recreation and population users is the key spatial parameter for estimating service flow using the mobility function the spatial relationship between service potential and demand needs to be carefully established when quantifying the actual flow of ecosystem services however this relationship differs depending on the type of the ecosystem service being assessed syrbe and walz 2012 4 2 flow of nature based recreation from ecosystems to people nature based recreation accounts for 2012 show an actual flow of 40 million potential visits to high quality areas for daily recreation with a total value of eur 50 billion this demonstrates the important contribution ecosystems make to satisfy people s recreation needs which has increased by 26 since 2000 woodland and forest are the ecosystem types with the greatest contribution to the use of nature based recreation by households as shown in the supply and use tables households are the only economic agent considered a direct user of this service services related to tourism are a consequence of a high influx of visits to some natural area of interest ad hoc satellite accounts are dedicated to tourism already united nations et al 2010 the role of natural attractions in tourism should be further developed within these tourism satellite accounts for consistency with the core sna and to avoid double counting the 40 million potential visits estimated in this study may look relatively small when compared with the approximately 500 million eu citizens this is explained by three factors in order of importance first the assessment of actual flow is based only on the proportion of the population considered as met demand i e living within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation which in the eu is 62 of the total population fig 6 second the actual flow is calculated by a calibrated mobility function using an average percentage of visits of 17 it implies that only this percentage of the met demand visits high quality areas for daily recreation fig 4 third the nature based recreation potential includes only high quality areas with high nature based recreation opportunities that are close to settlements and roads therefore the results should be interpreted given these assumptions loosening these rigid conditions would evidently increase the actual use reported in this paper in spite of the relatively small number of visits the monetary value of nature based recreation estimated at eur 50 billion annually is higher than that of other ecosystem services at the european level for instance water purification is valued at eur 16 billion per year la notte et al 2017 while the value of total crop pollination in europe amounts to eur 14 billion per year gallai et al 2009 although there might be limits to comparing ecosystem services values based on different valuation techniques the threefold value of nature based recreation may suggest a high importance of this service for society in fact there is a growing demand for nature based recreation in society as shown by the positive population trends in the eu except in germany fig 9 the increase in demand but especially the enhancement in recreation potential led to an increase of 26 in the potential number of visits between 2000 and 2012 fig 9 corresponding to an increase of 16 in the value of the service table 3 the increase in recreation potential is mainly due to two key drivers of the model land cover and protected areas in relation to land cover changes ecosystem extent accounts complementary to the service accounts seea eea would provide the data necessary to make an accurate interpretation of the role of land cover changes on increasing ecosystem service potential in each country the key land cover variables leading to an increase in service potential are the expansion of forest and semi natural areas in some cases urban sprawl may also play a key role if recreation hot spots become closer to residential areas changing the spatial distribution between ecosystem services potential and demand protected areas natura 2000 sites as included in the model do not necessarily imply any improvement in the physical suitability or condition of the ecosystems supporting recreation however new protected areas usually involve the development of recreation services and facilities such as adding walking paths and informative signs about designated areas with high natural value increasing the recreation potential although the nature based recreation model excludes strict nature reserves from analysis where access is not permitted category ia appendix c recreational use of protected areas may compromise the conservation management of those areas ultimately potential conflicts between nature conservation and recreation should be considered in management strategies working at the eu level imposes many limitations such as data availability and consistency as mentioned in section 2 3 for the biophysical mapping a procedure simplified from the original approach was applied excluding data that cannot be compared over time such as high nature value farmland paracchini et al 2014 this may result in an underestimation of the ecosystem based potential in some agricultural areas that should be taken into account availability of these data for different time periods would improve the assessment of changes in natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides in addition the mobility function for the eu 28 has been built using only data from england the lack of data also prevented us from applying more appropriate valuation techniques such as hedonic pricing since spatially explicit data on housing pricing are not available at the eu level european environment agency 2010 therefore the travel cost method was the most suitable technique to calculate a proxy of the value of walking biking trips consistently with the sna in future developments of nature based recreation accounts alternative valuation methods such as hedonic pricing could also be compared once datasets become available however attention should be paid to harmonising this technique with sna by avoiding double counting another limitation of the valuation technique used is the lack of integration with congestion effects congestion is a social sustainability component that ideally would need to be accounted for when valuing the service in future applications crowded recreation areas may contribute less to wellbeing thereby decreasing the benefit generated by the service and consequently its value congestion can also influence people to choose to go elsewhere if the location is too crowded what is known as displacement manning and valliere 2001 one possible way of calculating congestion is to assess the number of visits per square metre of high quality areas for daily recreation the area s size on its own cannot provide a measurement for congestion unless it is considered together with the visiting ratio of the population where there are many inhabitants larger sized areas or many smaller sized areas would be required to meet the demand for daily recreation in a socially sustainable way 4 3 application to land planning the spatial analysis required for nature based recreation accounting can be used to support policy decisions on land planning to identify priority areas for ecosystem restoration priority should be given to enhancing the recreation potential of those areas with a high unmet demand for the deployment of green infrastructure this kind of measure can increase the equitability of access to nature based recreation areas and contribute to the achievement of the sustainable development goal 11 united nations 2015 as shown in fig 6 38 of the eu population has limited access to high quality areas for daily recreation unmet demand improving proximity to those areas i e increasing the met demand will have a positive impact on the population by increasing their level of satisfaction with recreational and green areas table 4 which is a component of life satisfaction it is interesting to highlight that satisfaction with green areas is correlated with the proportion of the population with met demand but not with the actual flow this may suggest that those living within 4 km of high quality areas for daily recreation are also satisfied with the availability of recreational areas regardless of the distance this analysis constitutes an initial approach to assessing the benefits generated by nature based recreation however further research would be needed to properly account for the benefits generated by visits to recreational areas importantly the comparison of the nature based recreation assessment with external and independent indicators such as greensat may be interpreted as an ex post validation of the assumptions made in our assessment such as those taken for the delineation of high quality areas for daily recreation from the estimap model or the distances considered to distinguish between met and unmet demand 5 conclusions ecosystem services accounting is still experimental and requires the development of a number of accounts for different types of ecosystem services practical examples of ecosystem services accounts as shown in this study are required to further develop the conceptual and methodological framework proposed by the seea eea this study using nature based recreation as an example highlights the importance of spatially explicit models for ecosystem services accounts in which the different components of ecosystem services can be mapped i e potential demand and flow spatial models of ecosystems services are also required to properly address the drivers of changes in ecosystem services changes in ecosystems extent and condition and changes in socio economic systems or the spatial relationship between ecosystems and socio economic systems in addition using biophysical spatial models in ecosystem services accounts contributes to the development of policy measures targeting the enhancement of natural capital ecosystem services and the benefits they provide the accounting tables completed for a representative number of ecosystem services may become a useful tool to aid the analysis of synergies and trade offs among services including provisioning regulation and maintenance and cultural ecosystem services consistently applying the same accounting methodology across eu member states will enable accurate comparisons between countries and over time this is undertaken by employing the mechanism and rules of the sna and the seea eea allowing the integration of ecosystem services with traditional economic accounts so that environmental economic analyses can be

25151,strategies on agricultural management can help to reduce global greenhouse gas ghg emissions however the potential of agricultural management to reduce ghg emissions at the global scale is unclear global ecosystem models often lack sufficient detail in their representation of management such as tillage this paper explores whether and how tillage can be incorporated in global ecosystem models for the analysis of nitrous oxide n2o emissions we identify the most important nitrogen processes in soils and their response to tillage we review how these processes and tillage effects are described in field scale models and evaluate whether they can be incorporated in the global scale models while considering the data requirements for a global application the most important processes are described in field scale models and the basic data requirements can be met at the global scale we therefore conclude that there is potential to incorporate tillage in global ecosystem models for the analysis of n2o emissions there are several options for how the relevant processes can be incorporated into global ecosystem models so that generally there is potential to study the effects of tillage on n2o emissions globally given the many interactions with other processes modelers need to identify the modelling approaches that are consistent with their modelling framework and test these keywords ghg emissions global ecosystem models mitigation soil management agriculture 1 introduction agriculture is responsible for approximately 14 of the global greenhouse gas ghg emissions carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o carter et al 2007 del grosso et al 2009 smith et al 2009 agriculture based mitigation strategies such as climate smart agriculture and the 4 initiative include soil management strategies that can substantially affect ghg emissions lipper et al 2014 minasny et al 2017 these management strategies include the reduction of nitrogen n fertilizers cover crops rotations with legume crops and reduced or no tillage paustian et al 2016 the effect of management on ghg emissions has been investigated in many field and modelling studies e g jian she et al 2011 kessavalou et al 1998 koga et al 2004 lee et al 2009 loubet et al 2011 at the global scale ghg emissions and their effects are estimated by global ecosystem models müller et al 2017a b however these models typically lack the ability to evaluate the effect of management on ghg emissions in sufficient detail implying that the models cannot evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies a good example is that many of the global ecosystem models which are used to simulate the terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles do not deal with tillage practices whereas zero tillage is proposed as one of the main measures to reduce n2o emissions and increase carbon sequestration mcdermid et al 2017 despite the limitations of global ecosystem models in representing the effects of agricultural management these models are used to evaluate agricultural ghg emissions studies bypass these limitations through different procedures some assume a simple response effect of management on ghg emissions for example the tier 1 method of the intergovernmental panel on climate change suggests a single emission factor across all fertilizer applications to agricultural soils buckingham et al 2014 sozanska et al 2002 however a single emission factor ignores that the effects of management on ghg emissions depend on e g soil conditions and climate butterbach bahl et al 2013a b oertel et al 2016 other studies apply models originally developed for field level applications field scale models at the global scale del grosso et al 2009 this procedure has several limitations errors may be introduced when models are used at scales or climatic conditions for which they were not developed harrison et al 2000 moreover detailed information for model initialization calibration and input for field scale models is typically not available at the global scale as a third option processes related to soil management are incorporated in global ecosystem models considering the variables and data available within the model for example waha et al 2012 derived crop specific sowing dates from climatic variables only because a global dynamic dataset of this management information is not available despite uncertainties global ecosystem models are an important tool that can be used to analyze quantify and project relevant processes to study interaction between plant soil atmosphere under changing practices and conditions tillage practices can affect these interactions as a result by altering soil properties e g soil moisture by understanding and incorporating relevant processes related to tillage and n2o emissions into models changes in practices and conditions could be analyzed whereas simple response effects of management e g tier 1 cannot however global ecosystem models now assume a standard increase in mineralization due to tillage e g pugh et al 2015 or they ignore the effect of tillage e g bondeau et al 2007 we aim to identify processes related to tillage that could be incorporated in global ecosystem models by using the existing modelling approaches and evaluating their suitability for the analysis of n2o emissions this article aims to explore the options to better represent tillage impacts on n2o emissions in global ecosystem models in 3 consecutive steps 1 identification of relevant processes 2 reviewing how these processes are described in field scale models and 3 evaluating the options to incorporate the process in global scale models for this we analyze how tillage can be included in global scale models to better estimate options to reduce agricultural n2o emissions if tillage were included in global scale models it would allow for the selection and promotion of proper tillage systems e g no tillage or reduced tillage to decrease ghg emissions e g paustian et al 2016 the study strongly builds on reviews that study tillage effects on soil properties carbon sequestration and tillage models e g maharjan et al 2018 strudley et al 2008 west and post 2002 2 materials and methods at the global scale the impact of tillage on n2o emissions can only be represented with reduced complexity because detailed information for initialization parameterization and input as often measured for field scale applications is not available at the global scale e g deng et al 2016 grant and pattey 2003 molina herrera et al 2016 modelling the impact of tillage on n2o emissions in reduced complexity can be achieved by focusing on the most important processes the various processes that affect n2o emissions therefore need to be analyzed for relevancy complexity and data requirements this analysis contains three different steps fig 1 1 inventory of processes with all n processes relevant to n2o emissions 2 analysis of the collected processes with respect to 2 1 how important is a particular process what are the drivers of the processes and how are they affected by tillage 2 2 how are tillage and n processes being represented 2 3 what are the data requirements 3 evaluation of ability to model tillage effects on n2o emissions at the global scale 2 1 inventory of processes step 1 for the analysis of the n2o producing processes all n processes that are relevant were assembled and summarized as well as all information that is needed in the further analysis i e the contribution importance of an n process to n2o emissions as well as the role of tillage for these processes how processes are described in models as well as their data requirements 2 2 analysis of processes step 2 2 2 1 importance of n processes step 2 1 the importance of n processes was evaluated in the context of the particular research question of interest a true assessment to the importance requires the implementation and testing of the processes in a global ecosystem model here we carried out an ex ante assessment based on global estimates of n fluxes found in literature to assess the importance of each process a process was considered to be important if 1 the flux of the process was relatively large which is admittedly rather a subjective choice and 2 it was a primary process to determine how the effects of tillage on n2o emissions can be modeled we considered the processes in which n2o is actually formed nitrification and denitrification primary processes as well as the processes that affect the performance of these primary processes secondary processes these are for instance all processes that affect the availability of the primary material and the environmental conditions drivers that determine the dynamics of the primary processes in order to incorporate tillage effects into a global ecosystem model we thus ensured that the mechanisms by which tillage affects the process drivers were also included 2 2 2 processes described in models step 2 2 after having identified n processes information was collected on how models describe them we focused on models that have been cited often used in environmental studies and whose performance has been tested and evaluated moreover preference was given to models that include all relevant soil n dynamics and tillage in order to link the identified processes to how models describe them modeling approaches the models were analyzed on 1 which processes are included and how they are represented 2 which drivers are considered and 3 how tillage affects these processes 2 2 3 data requirements step 2 3 any process representation in a model implies additional data and parameter requirements for the application at the global scale the data can either be available from external sources or can be computed within the model in this step the data requirements to model a process were analyzed as well as management related data such as tillage type and timing here the spatial and temporal resolution to represent a process was considered as well as of the global ecosystem model into which the processes are to be incorporated most global ecosystem models run at a spatial resolution of 0 5 or finer and with a daily time step the data for the consideration of a process therefore had to be available at a minimum spatial resolution of 0 5 the required temporal resolution of the data depends on the variability of the data to drive a process described in a model tillage practices for example do not occur on a daily basis but rather once or twice a year therefore we did not necessarily require data on a daily resolution but at the appropriate time scale or with explicit timing information hutchings et al 2012 depending on the global ecosystem model some data are calculated endogenously whereas others have to be supplied externally 2 3 evaluation step 3 the structured analysis of the importance availability of processes described in models and data requirements of processes allowed for an evaluation if and how tillage can be incorporated in global ecosystem models it also enabled an assessment of possible caveats where e g individual processes had to be combined from different models this could yield inconsistencies in approaches and or parameterization or where quality of available data does not match the quality requirements of the process formulation the analysis of available options guided alternative implementation strategies and the design of sensitivity studies in the evaluation of the model implementation the analysis of the ability to model a particular aspect of agricultural management at the global scale can help to identify the suitable scope of model application and interpretation 3 results 3 1 inventory of processes step 1 the addition transformation through internal processes and losses of n are the main elements of soil n dynamics fageria and baligar 2005 the main processes of these elements are depicted in fig 2 nitrogen is added to the soil through n fertilization mineral and organic atmospheric deposition biological n fixation and residue input fertilization residue input and in part biological n fixation are management related processes n addition can be either in organic forms residue input organic fertilization or in inorganic forms mineral fertilization atmospheric deposition and biological n fixation after n additions n is transformed through mineralization immobilization and nitrification nitrogen can be lost from the soil to the atmosphere through volatilization denitrification and nitrification to the groundwater through leaching and to surface water by erosion and surface runoff from the soils perspective also the uptake by the plants is a form of n loss 3 2 analysis of processes step 2 3 2 1 importance of processes step 2 1 in table 1 and fig 2 the main addition and loss fluxes of n into and from agricultural soils are shown these numbers are based on global estimates from different literature sources the primary processes nitrification and denitrification are regarded as important processes since they result in the formation of n2o inorganic n fertilization is the largest flux and therefore the most important secondary process this is followed by biological n fixation and organic fertilizers plant uptake is the major loss flux of n from soils since these fluxes are relatively large these processes are essential to incorporate in any simulation of n2o emissions the sizes of fluxes can also be influenced by tillage practices see e g minoli et al 2015 tillage affects n processes and therefore n2o emissions mainly indirectly i e by affecting the drivers rather than the processes themselves table 2 provides an overview of the drivers of relevant processes that were identified in the steps above of the n addition processes n fertilization and residue input are both determined by management decisions the amount of n that is added to the soil depends on the amount of n fertilizer and or residue and its incorporation into the soil biological n fixation by plant symbioses is partly driven by management decisions crop choice and partly by soil conditions brady and weil 2008 high levels of available n or low levels of phosphorus in the soil tend to depress biological n fixation brady and weil 2008 smith 1992 the atmospheric deposition of n depends on the location and on the deposition of rain snow and dust brady and weil 2008 it is much higher in areas with high emissions as in concentrated animal farming areas through volatilization of mineral n transformation of n through mineralization immobilization and nitrification is controlled by microbes whose activity is driven by the amount of substrate in the soil organic and inorganic n soil temperature soil moisture soil oxygen and the soil ph brady and weil 2008 the activity of the microbes is also driven by the size and complexity of organic n often indicated as the ratio of carbon c or lignin to n lignin n or c n during mineralization and immobilization losses from the soil occur to the atmosphere through volatilization nitrification and denitrification to the groundwater through leaching to surface water or other locations through erosion or to the plant through plant uptake the most important drivers that influence volatilization include the soil acidity ph cation exchange capacity cec temperature moisture content weather conditions and the amount of nh4 at the soil surface sigunga et al 2002 denitrification is also regulated by microbial organisms and is therefore driven by the presence of no3 soil temperature soil moisture and additionally the presence of dissolved c n leaching depends on the no3 content of the soil and the percolation of water which again depends on the water influx from precipitation irrigation and snowmelt soil moisture texture and soil structure of the profile brady and weil 2008 the slope gradient management tillage type residue management and cover crop and the amount and intensity of precipitation are important drivers for erosion kinnell 2010 li et al 2004 n uptake by the plant depends on crop growth soil moisture root length root length density and available n in the soil james and richards 2006 tillage affects some of these drivers and therefore processes tillage has a direct impact on the physical properties of the soil such as bulk density and porosity abdalla et al 2007 strudley et al 2008 tillage driven changes in physical properties have pronounced effects on soil moisture and soil temperature soil moisture and temperature will affect several processes the incorporation of crop residues or fertilizers through tillage changes the distribution of the different n forms in the profile the soil moisture and soil temperature together with the amount of n in the soil profile will therefore affect different n processes in agricultural soils and therefore n2o emissions as shown in table 2 tillage affects almost all n processes 3 2 2 processes described in models step 2 2 the models selected for the literature review have often been cited applied and evaluated in agricultural studies additionally they include both n dynamics and tillage table 3 lists the models with their main reference and validation references some of these models like dssat and expert n make use of other models for the simulation of certain processes for example the n dynamics in dssat can be based on the approaches of either ceres or century the n dynamics in expert n can be based on the approaches of leachn ceres soiln daisy and hydrus the models differ slightly in the number of c and n pools table 4 but can be generally distinguished into organic and inorganic pools the organic pools consist of the fresh organic matter om and soil organic matter som pools e g labile stabil and active pool the pools are characterized by the c n or lignin n ratio and the turnover time the inorganic matter pools represent concentrations of nh4 and no3 typically all pools are represented in all soil layers e g one nh4 pool per layer but models differ in the number and thicknesses of layers represented fertilization the models describe fertilization in similar ways table 4 nitrogen is added to the soil surface and can be incorporated to deeper layers by tillage the timing of fertilization is either predefined or can be modelled based on plant n demand the depth to which the fertilizer is incorporated depends on the tillage type inorganic n is added to the actual nh4 and no3 pool organic n is added to the fresh om pools crop residue incorporation the models describe crop residues incorporation in a similar way table 4 a fraction of the crop residues is incorporated into the soil the size of the fraction as well as the depth of incorporation depends on the tillage type based on its c n ratio the n contained in crop residues is then allocated to one of the fresh om pools which is then subject to mineralization biological n fixation in the various models biological n fixation in models is 1 not described 2 modelled as a function of plant demand 3 as a function of evapotranspiration or 4 modelled explicitly table 4 biological n fixation is not described in dndc dssat and in expert n in century rzwqm daisy and daycent it is modelled as a function of plant demand thereby the biological n fixation is assumed to occur only when there is insufficient mineral n to satisfy the plant n requirement and if the crop is able to fix n in lpj guess biological n fixation is modelled as a function of evapotranspiration see also cleveland et al 1999 the process is modelled explicitly in epic and cropsyst by calculating the biological n fixation rate taking into account the growth stage of the plant the soil water content and the soil n content by considering the growth stage biological n fixation is inhibited in young plants prior to development of functional nodules and in old plants with senescent nodules patterson and larue 1983 when the soil water content is below a critical level and or the soil n level above a certain level the biological n fixation rate is also reduced in cropsyst the soil temperature is used to limit the biological n fixation both for too low and too high temperatures mineralization mineralization is described according to the same principles in the studied models table 4 but the drivers differ the mineralization rate of n depends on the mineralization rate of c and the c n ratio of the om the c and n contained in the om are split into different som pools the c contained in those pools is mineralized which is described by first order kinetics with high rate constants for the microbial pool and low rate constants for the passive pool although the rate constant can be calculated based on the c n ratio shaffer et al 2001 the rate constants are predefined in the considered models the mineralization rates of c are then reduced by non optimal soil conditions such as soil moisture and soil temperature in most of the models the soil texture also influences the turnover rate in those models e g century and daisy an increase in clay content in the soil decreases the mineralization rate mimicking physical protection against mineralization of om in cropsyst the mineralization rate of c is reduced only by soil texture as described before the ph and the population size of heterotrophic microbes are also included as explicit drivers of mineralization in rzwqm2 in epic the bulk density is included in the mineralization rate in epic the bulk density and therefore the mineralization rate is affected when tillage occurs the mineralization of n occurs when the om is respired or transferred from a donor pool to a receiving pool with a higher c n ratio as shown in table 5 mineralization increases the soil mineral n pool which can be both nh4 and no3 e g century and epic or nh4 specifically e g dndc and daisy immobilization the models describe n immobilization according to the same principles table 4 as the opposite to mineralization see also above immobilization of n occurs when the c n ratio of the receiving pool is lower than the c n ratio of the donor pool this will result in a reduction of the mineral n pool nitrification nitrification in models is 1 not included 2 a fixed fraction of mineralization 3 modelled explicitly but only simulating total gaseous losses to the atmosphere without further sub division or 4 modelled explicitly with explicit simulation of different gaseous loss fluxes including n2o tables 4 and 5 nitrification is not explicitly described in century in lpj guess a fixed fraction of mineralization one percent is lost towards the atmosphere without further specifying the actual chemical compound of that n flux in the other models reviewed here nitrification is modelled explicitly nitrification is mostly modelled by a given maximum nitrification rate which is then reduced by environmental factors the environmental factors considered are soil moisture soil oxygen and soil temperature in all models and sometimes soil ph except daisy and cropsyst rzwqm2 and daycent also model the growth and death of nitrifying bacteria and then calculate the rate of nitrification based on this population the cec is included for the simulation of nitrification in expert n and its sub model leachn in order to take adsorption of nh4 to clay particles into account in stics nitrification is only modelled in tropical regions whereas it assumes that nh4 is directly transformed into no3 in non tropical regions the stics implementation assumes that this is not always the case in tropical environments because the ph of the soils combined with high temperatures and low water contents in the topsoil slow nitrification down the dndc model uses a more chemistry based approach with an integrated nernst and michaelis menten equation to track microbial activities therefore first a redox potential is calculated based on concentrations of the dominant oxidants o2 and reductants existing in the soil liquid phase the redox potential is then integrated with the michaelis menten equation in which the reaction rate is calculated by including doc and the oxidant concentration the integrated equation can then track the interaction between redox potential dynamics and a microbe mediated redox reaction in the soil in most of the models the loss of n2o during the process is also modelled table 5 except for rzwqm2 and some sub models of expert n ceres and leachn these losses are modelled as a fixed proportion of nitrification the quantity of the proportion is not always the same in dndc the proportion is 0 24 whereas in daycent the proportion is 2 and in expert n 1 in rzwqm2 the n lost as n2o in the nitrification also depend on the soil moisture in epic and dssat the loss of n2o is not explicitly considered but included in an overall gaseous loss flux volatilization volatilization is described in most of the models ranging from relative simplistic to more detailed approaches table 4 in general the simulation of volatilization can be categorized into four categories 1 not included 2 estimated simultaneously with nitrification 3 estimated proportional to mineralization and 4 modelled explicitly volatilization is not modelled in century stics daycent or lpj guess in epic the process is estimated simultaneously with nitrification in daisy volatilization is modelled as a fixed proportion 20 of the applied mineral n fertilizer that is lost to the atmosphere in the other models the process is modelled explicitly the drivers of these processes are different per model in cropsyst dndc and dssat the soil ph and cec are the main drivers of volatilization in these models the langmuir isotherm equation is used to firstly quantify the concentration of the adsorbed nh4 distributed between its free ion phase and adsorbed phase based on the isotherm equilibrium see e g li et al 2006 the cec is used as an indicator to the soil s potential for adsorption see e g li et al 2006 in dndc and dssat the volatilization rate is also affected by soil temperature in dndc also the moisture and clay content of the soil determine the volatilization rate wind speed is only considered in rzwqm2 where the volatilization flux is proportional to the wind speed denitrification denitrification in the models is 1 not included 2 a function of mineral n remaining after plant uptake 3 modelled explicitly but only simulating total gaseous losses to the atmosphere without further sub division or 4 modelled explicitly with explicit simulation of different gaseous loss fluxes including n2o tables 4 and 5 denitrification is not described in lpj guess in century the process is a function of mineral n remaining after plant uptake in the other models denitrification is modelled explicitly some of these models specify the n2o emissions rzwqm2 dndc cropsyst stics daycent expert n whereas in other models the combined gaseous n n2 no n2o emissions are modelled daisy epic dssat sub models of expert n most of these models simulate denitrification based on soil temperature soil moisture and labile c labile c is not included in stics and in one of the sub models of expert n leachn the soil ph and microbial activity are included as drivers of denitrification in rzwqm2 and dndc the dndc model uses a more chemistry based approach in which both the redox potential and michaelis menten equation to track the microbial activity see also li 2007 in stics the soil bulk density is also taken into account in this model the n2o emissions are a fixed proportion of the denitrification flux whereas in the other models labile c and soil moisture also affect the simulation of the n2o flux rzwqm2 cropsyst and daycent use the same approach but here the ratios of n2 to n2o and no to n2o are estimated and modified based on soil moisture labile c and no3 concentration more details are provided by del grosso et al 2000 in rzwqm2 the n2o diffusion within the soil is also accounted for by adding the soil depth into their equation gillette et al 2017 in expert n n2o emissions can either be distinguished as a proportion of n2 or it can be distinguished as a function of soil moisture and so il temperature daisy epic dssat and some sub models of expert n soiln and ceres simulate denitrification explicitly in terms of the combined gaseous n n2 no n2o emissions based on soil moisture soil oxygen and labile c plant uptake the uptake of n from the inorganic n pools by a plant can be divided in four categories 1 not described 2 modelled as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n 3 modelled as a proportion of plant transpiration and as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n or 4 as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n and the movement of n from the soil to the root surface table 4 the uptake of n by plants is not explicitly described in the documentation of century and daycent in dndc epic dssat expert n and sub model leachn and lpj guess the uptake of n is modelled as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n the plant n demand depends thereby on the growth stage and its corresponding n content of the plant the potential uptake of n depends on the supply soil mineral n in the soil profile in all models and on the soil moisture in most of the models except for lpj guess additionally the soil temperature the root length density the water uptake rate and the transpiration of the plant are taken into account in some of the models see table 4 in rzwqm the n uptake of the plant is modelled in similar matters however the n uptake in this model is not the minimum of or the difference between potential uptake and plant demand but a michaelis menten equation is used which requires information on the maximum uptake rate of mineral n constant and soil mineral n content in the profile see also team et al 1998 additionally a passive n uptake is taken into account for this the n uptake is calculated proportionally to the transpiration rate of the plant in cropsyst daisy and stics also the transport of n from the soil to the root surfaces is calculated through convection and diffusion as shown by see also hansen et al 1990 the soil n supply in each soil layer is thereby determined by the transport of mineral n from a given soil location to the nearest root the actual uptake of n by the plant is then calculated by a michaelis menten equation which requires a maximum uptake rate of mineral n constants the root density and rooting depth cropsyst and daisy in stics the minimum of potential uptake and plant demand is considered as the actual uptake leaching the models describe leaching as the movement of dissolved inorganic n with the soil water movement the dissolved inorganic n is mostly described in the form of no3 and leaching constitutes a loss of no3 from the corresponding pool to lower layers or to the aquifer daisy and expert n including sub models consider nh4 explicitly table 5 the main difference between the models is how the soil water movement is computed table 4 the movement is modelled by using either the capacity soil water balance approach century epic stics daycent and lpj guess or the more detailed mechanistic richard equation rzwqm2 expert n and sub models or a combination of the two dndc daisy dssat epic and lpj guess in the capacity approach the water infiltrating into a soil layer fills the compartment to field capacity when the soil water exceeds field capacity the water percolates to the next soil layer and or goes to runoff epic and lpj guess the leaching flux is that n that percolates out of the lowest layer or goes to runoff del grosso et al 2008 the nitrate contained in the pool is assumed to be dissolved completely in the water of the soil layer the transport rate of n out of a soil layer is calculated by multiplying the percolation rate out of the soil layer by the concentration of nitrate in the soil layer in dssat and stics only a fraction of the no3 can be leached mimicking the adsorption of no3 to the soil and the prevention of this fraction from being transported to lower soil layers see also van der laan et al 2014 in rzwqm2 cropsyst and expert n and sub models the richard equation richards 1931 is used for simulating the movement of water the transport is driven by potential gradients that develop between soil layers due to gravity water extraction by roots and water that enters or leaves the profile which causes different soil moisture suctions in the different layers the soil moisture characteristics such as the hydraulic conductivity soil water content matric suction relationship and the porosity are key parameters for the calculation of the water movement the transport of n is described by the convection dispersion equation see also addiscott and wagenet 1985 this equation considers the solute displacement in the soil resulting from the physical process of convection or mass flow of water and the chemical process of diffusion in response to a concentration gradient this concept and the simulation of leaching in the capacity approach are described in detail in addiscott and wagenet 1985 key parameters for the equation are the volumetric water content volumetric water flux the solute concentration depth and a dispersion coefficient the main difference between models that combine the richard equation with the convection dispersion equation is that 1 some models differentiate between mobile and immobile water which mimics the presence of micro and macropores and 2 some models include adsorption of nh4 and no3 which reduces the amount of n lost through leaching a third option is a combination of the two approaches in which the capacity approach includes the hydraulic conductivity as parameter this reduces the water movements through the soils and allows the water content to be higher than field capacity as well as water to pond on the soil surface this option is currently used in dndc daisy epic dssat and lpj guess erosion erosion in models is either 1 not included or 2 modeled as a function of weather topography soil and management related factors erosion is not included in rzwqm2 daisy dssat stics expert n and lpj guess in century epic cropsyst and daycent it is modeled according to the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 in dndc the modified universal soil loss equation musle is used which is also optional in epic williams 1975 rusle includes factors such as rainfall erosivity soil erodibility topography land use and management rainfall erosivity depends on the rainfall intensity of a specific rainfall event risal et al 2016 the soil erodibility factor is a function or soil texture structure and om content the topographic factor is a function of slope length and slope steepness the management related factor includes soil cover which is influenced by tillage and erosion reduction measures such as grass markings panagos et al 2015 musle is the modified version of rusle in which the rainfall erosivity factor is calculated slightly different instead of rainfall intensity runoff and peak discharge is taken into account for which rainfall the soil water content and different retention parameters are used deng et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2014 tillage effects on drivers depending on frequency type and depth tillage can have major impacts on the physical properties of the soil and on the distribution of organic material as well as mineral n in the soil profile tillage affects the n processes either directly availability of substrate or indirectly via other soil properties most prominently soil moisture and soil temperature table 2 tillage is represented in different ways in the models which build upon each other table 6 1 tillage increases the mineralization rate temporary 2 tillage directly affects soil properties that drive soil n processes 3 tillage directly affects soil properties that drive soil n processes and have a temporal increase in mineralization rate and 4 tillage affects the soil properties directly and indirectly i e through the soil physical properties the first category in which the mineralization rate of selected pools is increased temporarily depending on the tillage activity the increased rate may either be predefined lpj guess and daycent or is calculated based on soil texture and a factor of soil disturbance cropsyst the increase in mineralization rate is temporary in the models in lpj guess and daycent the increase in mineralization occurs in the month of the tillage event and returns to its original rate after this month in cropsyst the rate decreases as a function of time and soil water content at a certain percentage per day for a soil at field capacity the second category in which tillage directly affects the soil properties can be found in the daisy and in the expert n models in these models tillage mixes or swaps the soil layers according to the tillage depth this means that the soil properties of all soil layers within the tillage depth are averaged additionally a defined fraction which has to be specified of the crop residues may be incorporated into the soil depending on the tillage type specified in the simulation the soil layers may also be swapped in the daisy model i e the soil layer properties are switched with each other mimicking the inversion of a soil profile through tillage the mixing and swapping of soil layers is permanent and only changes its state at a new tillage event the third category in which the soil properties are directly affected through mixing and additionally a temporal increase in the mineralization rate can be found in dndc and century also in dndc a defined fraction of residues may be incorporated into the soil as also described in the second category the mixing of soil layers is permanent and only changes its state at a new tillage event additionally to affecting the soil properties the mineralization rate of the different pools is increased depending on the depth of tillage practice in both models in century the increase in mineralization occurs in the month of the tillage event and returns to its original rate after this month in dndc the tillage effect on the rate is gradually reduced depending on the rainfall event the changes in properties caused by tillage gradually degrade due to natural reconsolidation during wetting and drying the direct effect on soil properties through the mixing of soil layers with or without residues can also be found in stics rzwqm2 epic and dssat in these models the soil moisture and soil temperature are also indirectly affected by tillage through the soil s physical properties the primary effect of tillage on soil physical properties is on bulk density mass to volume ratio which can either increase compaction or decrease aeriation the extent of the effects depends on the specific tillage event the change in bulk density affects the porosity or saturated water content in rzwqm2 dssat and stics a decrease in bulk density will result in an increase in porosity which means that more water could be stored in a certain soil layer the change in bulk density affects the mineralization rate in epic and the denitrification rate in stics directly another property that is affected by tillage in dssat and rzwqm2 is the hydraulic conductivity which describes the ease with which water can move through the soil column the hydraulic conductivity in dssat is changed by a certain percentage depending on the specific tillage event in rzwqm2 however the hydraulic conductivity is related to the porosity of the soil a change in the porosity therefore leads to a change in the hydraulic conductivity ahuja et al 2000 this affects the drainage and percolation rate and thus affects all soil water dependent n processes the bulk density porosity and hydraulic properties all have an effect on the soil moisture and therefore soil temperature in rzwqm2 the porosity is updated based on the rainfall amount and the kinetic rainfall energy the soil porosity is then converted into soil bulk density the rainfall energy is obtained from rainfall intensities and duration wischmeier and smith 1958 and is corrected for surface residues in epic the settling of the soil depends on the percolation infiltration rate into the layer and its sand content near the surface soils with high sand content will settle much faster than soils that are low in sand content especially in low rainfall areas in dssat the soil settles depending on the amount of rainfall and the kinetic rainfall energy which decreases per soil depth additionally there is a modification factor for the soil cover and aggregate stability the soil cover and stable aggregates will result in a relative slower settling of the soil than when there is no soil cover or instable aggregates tillage effects on n2o emissions in the models tillage has different effects on soil n dynamics and therefore n2o emissions in the models table 6 rzwqm2 is the only model that except for erosion simulates all n processes explicitly including n2o losses during nitrification and denitrification and the direct and indirect effects of tillage on its processes some other models simulate all n processes explicitly but are less detailed on tillage effects on the processes cropsyst expert n or are detailed in tillage effects but to a lesser extent in the n processes epic and dssat moreover not all models simulate n2o emissions specifically but simulate a combined flux with n2 and or no or do not simulate the fluxes at all in the models where the mineralization rate of different pools is directly increased for a certain time lpj guess daycent and cropsyst the inorganic n pool is increased as a consequence of tillage the inorganic n pool is then subject to losses in cropsyst and daycent the losses as n2o emissions are explicitly modelled in lpj guess the gaseous losses of n are not quantified therefore the effect of tillage on n2o emissions cannot be quantified in daisy and expert n tillage only has indirect effects on the n processes the incorporation of residues combined with the mixing of soil layers changes the amount of organic n in the layers and the c n ratio of different som pools additionally averaging the soil properties within the tillage depth resulting from tillage changes the rate of n processes due to a change in e g soil moisture and soil temperature which are important drivers of n processes in daisy a change in n processes will lead to a change in the combined losses of n2o n2 whereas in expert n the n2o emissions can be modelled explicitly the mixing of soil properties and residues also affects the rate of different n processes in dndc in this model and in century also a direct change in the mineralization rate of the different som pools is included as an effect of tillage the direct increase of the mineralization rate will increase the inorganic n pool which means that more n is subject to losses or further transformations including n2o emission by nitrification and denitrification since the model simulates n2o fluxes explicitly the change in n processes directly translates into changes in n2o emissions in century the increased inorganic n pool can be subject to losses however as in lpj guess the gaseous losses of n are not quantified therefore the effect of tillage on n2o emissions cannot be quantified in the models where the soil properties are directly and indirectly affected resulting from tillage a change in the soil moisture and soil temperature can be expected as well as the n content and c n ratios in the soil profile in stics and rzwqm2 these changes affect different n processes and therefore directly n2o emissions in these models the n2o emissions are modelled explicitly in epic and dssat these changes lead to a change in the combined losses of n2o n2 epic and n2o n2 no dssat the tillage effects on the n processes and thus n2o emissions decrease eventually due to soil reconsolidation 3 2 3 data requirements and availability tillage effects on n2o emissions at the global scale can only be evaluated when the data required to simulate the processes are available at the global scale in this step we analyze which data are required to drive the simulations of different processes and an example of which data are available at the global scale is provided table 7 data are required on environmental properties that affect the different n processes as well as management related data some data on properties and drivers can be supplied by endogenous computations while others have to be supplied from external sources the drivers and properties that are usually computed endogenously are those that are often dynamic such as soil water content and temperature but also other properties for which modelling capacities exist but only sparse measurements such as om pools or vegetation structure and productivity external datasets are typically needed for relatively static physical properties such as soil texture chemical properties that cannot be modelled well such as ph and cec and weather and management related data most of these data can be measured in the field however at the global scale we need to rely on external datasets the management related data that are required include data on fertilizer input of organic and inorganic n forms amount and timing residue input land use and soil management e g tillage most global ecosystem models work on a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of one day although finer spatial and temporal resolutions are also applied in global scale models ideally input data are available at the same spatial resolution as the model simulation but are often aggregated or interpolated to match the model simulation s spatial and temporal resolution interpolation can be as simplistic as assuming static conditions e g when only a single temporal snapshot is available employ inter and extrapolation methods or can be model assisted as e g in the case of weather reanalysis data aggregation and interpolation or any other scaling method is a potential source of uncertainty ewert et al 2011 this is especially the case for modelling erosion here information on slope steepness is needed for which static global datasets are available which would need to be aggregated to meet the spatial resolution of a 0 5 in this case aggregation can lead to an underestimation of slope steepness and therefore erosion in the absence of data simulations can be conducted for scenario assumptions e g for crop residue exports and intercrops see bondeau et al 2007 besides driving data models need to be parametrized and evaluated typically there are no good evaluation data sets available at the global scale so that global scale simulations need to be compared at reference sites where measurements for the comparison are available or indirectly for their effects on recorded properties such as national yield statistics müller et al 2017a b schaphoff et al 2018 model parameters typically need to be taken from smaller scales for which the models have been developed but can be calibrated if global effects do not match observational evidence 3 3 evaluation of modelling tillage and n2o emission at the global scale step 3 all primary as well as the important tillage affected secondary processes are described in most of the models reviewed here table 4 these processes are modelled in relative simplistic e g a ratio of another process or more detailed approaches in which different drivers of the processes are taken into account this provides a sufficiently diverse basis for selecting the most suitable approaches needed to resolve the most important processes in a consistent manner in existing models the most important caveat in the combination of different approaches from existing models is to avoid inconsistencies or redundancies in which simpler aggregated representations may already cover smaller processes in such cases a re parameterization of already implemented processes would be necessary if new processes would be added explicitly to the model in all models tillage has an effect on the n processes in which the mineralization rate is either directly affected or indirectly through the soil properties which have an effect on the soil moisture and soil temperature of the n processes only few models model the effect of tillage on n2o emissions explicitly table 6 the data that are required to model these processes can partly be met static datasets for some chemical properties e g soil ph and cec may be acceptable since tillage does not influence these properties in the analyzed models and these drivers are only taken into account for some of the n processes in some models however some of the physical properties e g porosity and bulk density may have to be endogenized by the models rather than treated as an external input because tillage directly affects these properties therefore the static values of the external databases can serve for model initialization or reference data the required data for modelling erosion cannot be met management and topography related data as well as data on rainfall intensity is lacking moreover modelling erosion requires a very high spatial and temporal resolution given that it is typically a quick and small scale process herzfeld et al in prep naipal et al 2015 improved the global applicability of the rusle model for modelling erosion by adjusting the topographical and rainfall erosivity factors the topographical factor was adjusted by scaling the slope according to the fractal method whereas the rainfall erosivity factor was adjusted by applying a linear multiple regression method for various climate zones panagos et al 2017 developed a global rainfall erosivity map at 30 arc seconds based on a gaussian process regression which can be used as the erosivity factor in the rusle model however for modelling erosion high resolution data on slope length and the other rusle factors is lacking the required management related data except for tillage and erosion are also partly available e g fertilizer input these datasets are available at sufficiently fine spatial resolution but often only as static datasets with no information on sub annual distributions however fertilizer inputs for example are mostly applied more often throughout a growing season therefore a dynamic dataset could give a better indication on when and how often fertilizers are being applied hutchings et al 2012 for tillage and crop residue incorporation there are currently no spatial and temporal explicit datasets available this means that tillage can be implemented in a global ecosystem model for the analysis of how different tillage options affect agricultural n2o emissions however since we lack spatial explicit datasets on tillage practices this analysis can only be conducted in a scenario based setting 3 4 discussion the models that have been analyzed vary in the amount of processes that are taken into account and the detail in representation of processes table 4 as mentioned previously some models include most processes explicitly but are less detailed on the tillage effects on those processes cropsyst expert n whereas some models are detailed in tillage effects but to a lesser extent on the n processes epic and dssat or cannot simulate n2o emissions specifically depending on the research question the availability of data for parameterization and model performance some models might be more suitable to apply than others models that simulate certain processes more detailed are often more suitable for questions related to scientific understanding as they can be used as tools to address research questions about control of processes magnitude of responses and interactions jones et al 2017 however an increase in detail typically requires a larger number of parameters which may be unknown or only known with relatively large uncertainties as there is a tradeoff between detailed process representation and model parametrization it is unclear what level of detail is the best for global scale application a general recommendation on which model process description to choose for the implementation of individual processes cannot be provided as this depends on the current implementation of other processes in the model that is to be extended the new implementation will have to be tested and evaluated in the model specific and research question specific context combining different processes described in models can yield inconsistencies and the individual processes of the models are typically not validated moreover although the data requirements are generally met the quality of the data is unknown or known to be poor see e g grassini et al 2015 model performance can only be tested against site measurements as global measurements are lacking and these should ideally span a broad range of environmental conditions i e jin et al 2017 lognoul et al 2017 mei et al 2018 van kessel et al 2013 this can be challenging as there is an enormous temporal and spatial variability in n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013a b given this variability model evaluation should be conducted at different scales which will be a learning process that we need to engage in most of the analyzed crop models have been developed for field scale application with processes usually simulated at daily resolution when models or modelling approaches are applied at larger spatial or temporal scales scaling to the new level of application is required this can include modifications of input data parameters and model simplifications ewert et al 2006 the degree of how much data parameters and models need to be modified also depends on the research objective the available data and what can be done regarding data and model uncertainties here we are interested in tillage effects on n2o emissions at the global spatial scale since we are interested in n2o mitigation and therefore rather a long term research study the temporal scale should be focused on the long term i e multiple years and decades with respect to the modification of data and parameters several methods can be distinguished depending on whether data manipulation refers to changes in extent coverage or resolution hatfield 2001 in ewert et al 2011 different scaling methods are proposed for data input and output and models e g model parameters and model structure in case input or output data are not matching the spatial resolution of the model simulation aggregation averaging or disaggregation can be considered model simplifications may be needed since large scale model application can be resource intensive computational time model simplifications can be done by considering only those processes that matter at the global scale as described before and selecting an appropriate level of detail for each n process adam et al 2011 ewert et al 2011 here we followed an evaluation scheme on assessing the feasibility of incorporating tillage in global ecosystem models this method opens opportunities of incorporating and analyzing other management aspects ghg emissions at the global scale instead of working with static ghg emission factors however the method is limited due to several reasons first of all it does not provide a standard procedure for the evaluation of the performance of the processes described in models individually as well as within the global ecosystem model into which management is incorporated although standard evaluation procedures are not provided evaluating the model performance can always be conducted against available data e g kelley et al 2013 müller et al 2017a b schaphoff et al 2018 only a selected set of models are analyzed that should both cover n processes and tillage effects this may have resulted in excluding models that can describe only one of the aspects well e g only tillage effects on soil properties but do not describe n processes additionally the analyzed models do not always provide a full model documentation which hampers the analysis the available documentation of individual models is mostly scattered over different articles full model documentations could better support information discovery and or prevent the use of outdated information about the described processes the analysis on data availability does not give insight on the quality of the data a sensitivity analysis can be conducted in order to assess the relative contribution of the inputs variables and parameters on the model outputs see also campolongo and braddock 1999 moreau et al 2013 inputs that make relatively high contribution to model outputs would require relatively higher quality data and constraints on input data quality should be considered in the interpretation of model results 4 conclusion we studied how tillage can be implemented in global ecosystem models for the analysis of n2o emissions from agricultural production existing field scale modeling approaches on soil nitrogen dynamics and on the effects of tillage facilitate this implementation in general however the suitability and validity of individual processes described in models is often not evaluated and will have to be tested within the new global framework scaling issues for processes and data availability will have to be addressed data scarcity especially on management related data will only allow for scenario based analyses we followed an evaluation scheme for assessing options for the inclusion of tillage related processes into global ecosystem models which could also be employed for other management aspects we find that there are ample options to implement tillage and soil nitrogen dynamics in sufficient detail in global scale ecosystem models a general recommendation on what modeling approach to use is not possible as this depends on what processes are already covered in the model that is to be extended and tradeoffs in data availability vs quality vs uncertainty in model parametrization need to be considered however agricultural management should be better represented in global scale ecosystem models mcdermid et al 2017 and the formal procedure described here can help in selecting suitable options such better model representation can open opportunities to evaluate agricultural based mitigation strategies such as climate smart agriculture lipper et al 2014 with global ecosystem models acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge the german ministry for

25151,strategies on agricultural management can help to reduce global greenhouse gas ghg emissions however the potential of agricultural management to reduce ghg emissions at the global scale is unclear global ecosystem models often lack sufficient detail in their representation of management such as tillage this paper explores whether and how tillage can be incorporated in global ecosystem models for the analysis of nitrous oxide n2o emissions we identify the most important nitrogen processes in soils and their response to tillage we review how these processes and tillage effects are described in field scale models and evaluate whether they can be incorporated in the global scale models while considering the data requirements for a global application the most important processes are described in field scale models and the basic data requirements can be met at the global scale we therefore conclude that there is potential to incorporate tillage in global ecosystem models for the analysis of n2o emissions there are several options for how the relevant processes can be incorporated into global ecosystem models so that generally there is potential to study the effects of tillage on n2o emissions globally given the many interactions with other processes modelers need to identify the modelling approaches that are consistent with their modelling framework and test these keywords ghg emissions global ecosystem models mitigation soil management agriculture 1 introduction agriculture is responsible for approximately 14 of the global greenhouse gas ghg emissions carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o carter et al 2007 del grosso et al 2009 smith et al 2009 agriculture based mitigation strategies such as climate smart agriculture and the 4 initiative include soil management strategies that can substantially affect ghg emissions lipper et al 2014 minasny et al 2017 these management strategies include the reduction of nitrogen n fertilizers cover crops rotations with legume crops and reduced or no tillage paustian et al 2016 the effect of management on ghg emissions has been investigated in many field and modelling studies e g jian she et al 2011 kessavalou et al 1998 koga et al 2004 lee et al 2009 loubet et al 2011 at the global scale ghg emissions and their effects are estimated by global ecosystem models müller et al 2017a b however these models typically lack the ability to evaluate the effect of management on ghg emissions in sufficient detail implying that the models cannot evaluate the proposed mitigation strategies a good example is that many of the global ecosystem models which are used to simulate the terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles do not deal with tillage practices whereas zero tillage is proposed as one of the main measures to reduce n2o emissions and increase carbon sequestration mcdermid et al 2017 despite the limitations of global ecosystem models in representing the effects of agricultural management these models are used to evaluate agricultural ghg emissions studies bypass these limitations through different procedures some assume a simple response effect of management on ghg emissions for example the tier 1 method of the intergovernmental panel on climate change suggests a single emission factor across all fertilizer applications to agricultural soils buckingham et al 2014 sozanska et al 2002 however a single emission factor ignores that the effects of management on ghg emissions depend on e g soil conditions and climate butterbach bahl et al 2013a b oertel et al 2016 other studies apply models originally developed for field level applications field scale models at the global scale del grosso et al 2009 this procedure has several limitations errors may be introduced when models are used at scales or climatic conditions for which they were not developed harrison et al 2000 moreover detailed information for model initialization calibration and input for field scale models is typically not available at the global scale as a third option processes related to soil management are incorporated in global ecosystem models considering the variables and data available within the model for example waha et al 2012 derived crop specific sowing dates from climatic variables only because a global dynamic dataset of this management information is not available despite uncertainties global ecosystem models are an important tool that can be used to analyze quantify and project relevant processes to study interaction between plant soil atmosphere under changing practices and conditions tillage practices can affect these interactions as a result by altering soil properties e g soil moisture by understanding and incorporating relevant processes related to tillage and n2o emissions into models changes in practices and conditions could be analyzed whereas simple response effects of management e g tier 1 cannot however global ecosystem models now assume a standard increase in mineralization due to tillage e g pugh et al 2015 or they ignore the effect of tillage e g bondeau et al 2007 we aim to identify processes related to tillage that could be incorporated in global ecosystem models by using the existing modelling approaches and evaluating their suitability for the analysis of n2o emissions this article aims to explore the options to better represent tillage impacts on n2o emissions in global ecosystem models in 3 consecutive steps 1 identification of relevant processes 2 reviewing how these processes are described in field scale models and 3 evaluating the options to incorporate the process in global scale models for this we analyze how tillage can be included in global scale models to better estimate options to reduce agricultural n2o emissions if tillage were included in global scale models it would allow for the selection and promotion of proper tillage systems e g no tillage or reduced tillage to decrease ghg emissions e g paustian et al 2016 the study strongly builds on reviews that study tillage effects on soil properties carbon sequestration and tillage models e g maharjan et al 2018 strudley et al 2008 west and post 2002 2 materials and methods at the global scale the impact of tillage on n2o emissions can only be represented with reduced complexity because detailed information for initialization parameterization and input as often measured for field scale applications is not available at the global scale e g deng et al 2016 grant and pattey 2003 molina herrera et al 2016 modelling the impact of tillage on n2o emissions in reduced complexity can be achieved by focusing on the most important processes the various processes that affect n2o emissions therefore need to be analyzed for relevancy complexity and data requirements this analysis contains three different steps fig 1 1 inventory of processes with all n processes relevant to n2o emissions 2 analysis of the collected processes with respect to 2 1 how important is a particular process what are the drivers of the processes and how are they affected by tillage 2 2 how are tillage and n processes being represented 2 3 what are the data requirements 3 evaluation of ability to model tillage effects on n2o emissions at the global scale 2 1 inventory of processes step 1 for the analysis of the n2o producing processes all n processes that are relevant were assembled and summarized as well as all information that is needed in the further analysis i e the contribution importance of an n process to n2o emissions as well as the role of tillage for these processes how processes are described in models as well as their data requirements 2 2 analysis of processes step 2 2 2 1 importance of n processes step 2 1 the importance of n processes was evaluated in the context of the particular research question of interest a true assessment to the importance requires the implementation and testing of the processes in a global ecosystem model here we carried out an ex ante assessment based on global estimates of n fluxes found in literature to assess the importance of each process a process was considered to be important if 1 the flux of the process was relatively large which is admittedly rather a subjective choice and 2 it was a primary process to determine how the effects of tillage on n2o emissions can be modeled we considered the processes in which n2o is actually formed nitrification and denitrification primary processes as well as the processes that affect the performance of these primary processes secondary processes these are for instance all processes that affect the availability of the primary material and the environmental conditions drivers that determine the dynamics of the primary processes in order to incorporate tillage effects into a global ecosystem model we thus ensured that the mechanisms by which tillage affects the process drivers were also included 2 2 2 processes described in models step 2 2 after having identified n processes information was collected on how models describe them we focused on models that have been cited often used in environmental studies and whose performance has been tested and evaluated moreover preference was given to models that include all relevant soil n dynamics and tillage in order to link the identified processes to how models describe them modeling approaches the models were analyzed on 1 which processes are included and how they are represented 2 which drivers are considered and 3 how tillage affects these processes 2 2 3 data requirements step 2 3 any process representation in a model implies additional data and parameter requirements for the application at the global scale the data can either be available from external sources or can be computed within the model in this step the data requirements to model a process were analyzed as well as management related data such as tillage type and timing here the spatial and temporal resolution to represent a process was considered as well as of the global ecosystem model into which the processes are to be incorporated most global ecosystem models run at a spatial resolution of 0 5 or finer and with a daily time step the data for the consideration of a process therefore had to be available at a minimum spatial resolution of 0 5 the required temporal resolution of the data depends on the variability of the data to drive a process described in a model tillage practices for example do not occur on a daily basis but rather once or twice a year therefore we did not necessarily require data on a daily resolution but at the appropriate time scale or with explicit timing information hutchings et al 2012 depending on the global ecosystem model some data are calculated endogenously whereas others have to be supplied externally 2 3 evaluation step 3 the structured analysis of the importance availability of processes described in models and data requirements of processes allowed for an evaluation if and how tillage can be incorporated in global ecosystem models it also enabled an assessment of possible caveats where e g individual processes had to be combined from different models this could yield inconsistencies in approaches and or parameterization or where quality of available data does not match the quality requirements of the process formulation the analysis of available options guided alternative implementation strategies and the design of sensitivity studies in the evaluation of the model implementation the analysis of the ability to model a particular aspect of agricultural management at the global scale can help to identify the suitable scope of model application and interpretation 3 results 3 1 inventory of processes step 1 the addition transformation through internal processes and losses of n are the main elements of soil n dynamics fageria and baligar 2005 the main processes of these elements are depicted in fig 2 nitrogen is added to the soil through n fertilization mineral and organic atmospheric deposition biological n fixation and residue input fertilization residue input and in part biological n fixation are management related processes n addition can be either in organic forms residue input organic fertilization or in inorganic forms mineral fertilization atmospheric deposition and biological n fixation after n additions n is transformed through mineralization immobilization and nitrification nitrogen can be lost from the soil to the atmosphere through volatilization denitrification and nitrification to the groundwater through leaching and to surface water by erosion and surface runoff from the soils perspective also the uptake by the plants is a form of n loss 3 2 analysis of processes step 2 3 2 1 importance of processes step 2 1 in table 1 and fig 2 the main addition and loss fluxes of n into and from agricultural soils are shown these numbers are based on global estimates from different literature sources the primary processes nitrification and denitrification are regarded as important processes since they result in the formation of n2o inorganic n fertilization is the largest flux and therefore the most important secondary process this is followed by biological n fixation and organic fertilizers plant uptake is the major loss flux of n from soils since these fluxes are relatively large these processes are essential to incorporate in any simulation of n2o emissions the sizes of fluxes can also be influenced by tillage practices see e g minoli et al 2015 tillage affects n processes and therefore n2o emissions mainly indirectly i e by affecting the drivers rather than the processes themselves table 2 provides an overview of the drivers of relevant processes that were identified in the steps above of the n addition processes n fertilization and residue input are both determined by management decisions the amount of n that is added to the soil depends on the amount of n fertilizer and or residue and its incorporation into the soil biological n fixation by plant symbioses is partly driven by management decisions crop choice and partly by soil conditions brady and weil 2008 high levels of available n or low levels of phosphorus in the soil tend to depress biological n fixation brady and weil 2008 smith 1992 the atmospheric deposition of n depends on the location and on the deposition of rain snow and dust brady and weil 2008 it is much higher in areas with high emissions as in concentrated animal farming areas through volatilization of mineral n transformation of n through mineralization immobilization and nitrification is controlled by microbes whose activity is driven by the amount of substrate in the soil organic and inorganic n soil temperature soil moisture soil oxygen and the soil ph brady and weil 2008 the activity of the microbes is also driven by the size and complexity of organic n often indicated as the ratio of carbon c or lignin to n lignin n or c n during mineralization and immobilization losses from the soil occur to the atmosphere through volatilization nitrification and denitrification to the groundwater through leaching to surface water or other locations through erosion or to the plant through plant uptake the most important drivers that influence volatilization include the soil acidity ph cation exchange capacity cec temperature moisture content weather conditions and the amount of nh4 at the soil surface sigunga et al 2002 denitrification is also regulated by microbial organisms and is therefore driven by the presence of no3 soil temperature soil moisture and additionally the presence of dissolved c n leaching depends on the no3 content of the soil and the percolation of water which again depends on the water influx from precipitation irrigation and snowmelt soil moisture texture and soil structure of the profile brady and weil 2008 the slope gradient management tillage type residue management and cover crop and the amount and intensity of precipitation are important drivers for erosion kinnell 2010 li et al 2004 n uptake by the plant depends on crop growth soil moisture root length root length density and available n in the soil james and richards 2006 tillage affects some of these drivers and therefore processes tillage has a direct impact on the physical properties of the soil such as bulk density and porosity abdalla et al 2007 strudley et al 2008 tillage driven changes in physical properties have pronounced effects on soil moisture and soil temperature soil moisture and temperature will affect several processes the incorporation of crop residues or fertilizers through tillage changes the distribution of the different n forms in the profile the soil moisture and soil temperature together with the amount of n in the soil profile will therefore affect different n processes in agricultural soils and therefore n2o emissions as shown in table 2 tillage affects almost all n processes 3 2 2 processes described in models step 2 2 the models selected for the literature review have often been cited applied and evaluated in agricultural studies additionally they include both n dynamics and tillage table 3 lists the models with their main reference and validation references some of these models like dssat and expert n make use of other models for the simulation of certain processes for example the n dynamics in dssat can be based on the approaches of either ceres or century the n dynamics in expert n can be based on the approaches of leachn ceres soiln daisy and hydrus the models differ slightly in the number of c and n pools table 4 but can be generally distinguished into organic and inorganic pools the organic pools consist of the fresh organic matter om and soil organic matter som pools e g labile stabil and active pool the pools are characterized by the c n or lignin n ratio and the turnover time the inorganic matter pools represent concentrations of nh4 and no3 typically all pools are represented in all soil layers e g one nh4 pool per layer but models differ in the number and thicknesses of layers represented fertilization the models describe fertilization in similar ways table 4 nitrogen is added to the soil surface and can be incorporated to deeper layers by tillage the timing of fertilization is either predefined or can be modelled based on plant n demand the depth to which the fertilizer is incorporated depends on the tillage type inorganic n is added to the actual nh4 and no3 pool organic n is added to the fresh om pools crop residue incorporation the models describe crop residues incorporation in a similar way table 4 a fraction of the crop residues is incorporated into the soil the size of the fraction as well as the depth of incorporation depends on the tillage type based on its c n ratio the n contained in crop residues is then allocated to one of the fresh om pools which is then subject to mineralization biological n fixation in the various models biological n fixation in models is 1 not described 2 modelled as a function of plant demand 3 as a function of evapotranspiration or 4 modelled explicitly table 4 biological n fixation is not described in dndc dssat and in expert n in century rzwqm daisy and daycent it is modelled as a function of plant demand thereby the biological n fixation is assumed to occur only when there is insufficient mineral n to satisfy the plant n requirement and if the crop is able to fix n in lpj guess biological n fixation is modelled as a function of evapotranspiration see also cleveland et al 1999 the process is modelled explicitly in epic and cropsyst by calculating the biological n fixation rate taking into account the growth stage of the plant the soil water content and the soil n content by considering the growth stage biological n fixation is inhibited in young plants prior to development of functional nodules and in old plants with senescent nodules patterson and larue 1983 when the soil water content is below a critical level and or the soil n level above a certain level the biological n fixation rate is also reduced in cropsyst the soil temperature is used to limit the biological n fixation both for too low and too high temperatures mineralization mineralization is described according to the same principles in the studied models table 4 but the drivers differ the mineralization rate of n depends on the mineralization rate of c and the c n ratio of the om the c and n contained in the om are split into different som pools the c contained in those pools is mineralized which is described by first order kinetics with high rate constants for the microbial pool and low rate constants for the passive pool although the rate constant can be calculated based on the c n ratio shaffer et al 2001 the rate constants are predefined in the considered models the mineralization rates of c are then reduced by non optimal soil conditions such as soil moisture and soil temperature in most of the models the soil texture also influences the turnover rate in those models e g century and daisy an increase in clay content in the soil decreases the mineralization rate mimicking physical protection against mineralization of om in cropsyst the mineralization rate of c is reduced only by soil texture as described before the ph and the population size of heterotrophic microbes are also included as explicit drivers of mineralization in rzwqm2 in epic the bulk density is included in the mineralization rate in epic the bulk density and therefore the mineralization rate is affected when tillage occurs the mineralization of n occurs when the om is respired or transferred from a donor pool to a receiving pool with a higher c n ratio as shown in table 5 mineralization increases the soil mineral n pool which can be both nh4 and no3 e g century and epic or nh4 specifically e g dndc and daisy immobilization the models describe n immobilization according to the same principles table 4 as the opposite to mineralization see also above immobilization of n occurs when the c n ratio of the receiving pool is lower than the c n ratio of the donor pool this will result in a reduction of the mineral n pool nitrification nitrification in models is 1 not included 2 a fixed fraction of mineralization 3 modelled explicitly but only simulating total gaseous losses to the atmosphere without further sub division or 4 modelled explicitly with explicit simulation of different gaseous loss fluxes including n2o tables 4 and 5 nitrification is not explicitly described in century in lpj guess a fixed fraction of mineralization one percent is lost towards the atmosphere without further specifying the actual chemical compound of that n flux in the other models reviewed here nitrification is modelled explicitly nitrification is mostly modelled by a given maximum nitrification rate which is then reduced by environmental factors the environmental factors considered are soil moisture soil oxygen and soil temperature in all models and sometimes soil ph except daisy and cropsyst rzwqm2 and daycent also model the growth and death of nitrifying bacteria and then calculate the rate of nitrification based on this population the cec is included for the simulation of nitrification in expert n and its sub model leachn in order to take adsorption of nh4 to clay particles into account in stics nitrification is only modelled in tropical regions whereas it assumes that nh4 is directly transformed into no3 in non tropical regions the stics implementation assumes that this is not always the case in tropical environments because the ph of the soils combined with high temperatures and low water contents in the topsoil slow nitrification down the dndc model uses a more chemistry based approach with an integrated nernst and michaelis menten equation to track microbial activities therefore first a redox potential is calculated based on concentrations of the dominant oxidants o2 and reductants existing in the soil liquid phase the redox potential is then integrated with the michaelis menten equation in which the reaction rate is calculated by including doc and the oxidant concentration the integrated equation can then track the interaction between redox potential dynamics and a microbe mediated redox reaction in the soil in most of the models the loss of n2o during the process is also modelled table 5 except for rzwqm2 and some sub models of expert n ceres and leachn these losses are modelled as a fixed proportion of nitrification the quantity of the proportion is not always the same in dndc the proportion is 0 24 whereas in daycent the proportion is 2 and in expert n 1 in rzwqm2 the n lost as n2o in the nitrification also depend on the soil moisture in epic and dssat the loss of n2o is not explicitly considered but included in an overall gaseous loss flux volatilization volatilization is described in most of the models ranging from relative simplistic to more detailed approaches table 4 in general the simulation of volatilization can be categorized into four categories 1 not included 2 estimated simultaneously with nitrification 3 estimated proportional to mineralization and 4 modelled explicitly volatilization is not modelled in century stics daycent or lpj guess in epic the process is estimated simultaneously with nitrification in daisy volatilization is modelled as a fixed proportion 20 of the applied mineral n fertilizer that is lost to the atmosphere in the other models the process is modelled explicitly the drivers of these processes are different per model in cropsyst dndc and dssat the soil ph and cec are the main drivers of volatilization in these models the langmuir isotherm equation is used to firstly quantify the concentration of the adsorbed nh4 distributed between its free ion phase and adsorbed phase based on the isotherm equilibrium see e g li et al 2006 the cec is used as an indicator to the soil s potential for adsorption see e g li et al 2006 in dndc and dssat the volatilization rate is also affected by soil temperature in dndc also the moisture and clay content of the soil determine the volatilization rate wind speed is only considered in rzwqm2 where the volatilization flux is proportional to the wind speed denitrification denitrification in the models is 1 not included 2 a function of mineral n remaining after plant uptake 3 modelled explicitly but only simulating total gaseous losses to the atmosphere without further sub division or 4 modelled explicitly with explicit simulation of different gaseous loss fluxes including n2o tables 4 and 5 denitrification is not described in lpj guess in century the process is a function of mineral n remaining after plant uptake in the other models denitrification is modelled explicitly some of these models specify the n2o emissions rzwqm2 dndc cropsyst stics daycent expert n whereas in other models the combined gaseous n n2 no n2o emissions are modelled daisy epic dssat sub models of expert n most of these models simulate denitrification based on soil temperature soil moisture and labile c labile c is not included in stics and in one of the sub models of expert n leachn the soil ph and microbial activity are included as drivers of denitrification in rzwqm2 and dndc the dndc model uses a more chemistry based approach in which both the redox potential and michaelis menten equation to track the microbial activity see also li 2007 in stics the soil bulk density is also taken into account in this model the n2o emissions are a fixed proportion of the denitrification flux whereas in the other models labile c and soil moisture also affect the simulation of the n2o flux rzwqm2 cropsyst and daycent use the same approach but here the ratios of n2 to n2o and no to n2o are estimated and modified based on soil moisture labile c and no3 concentration more details are provided by del grosso et al 2000 in rzwqm2 the n2o diffusion within the soil is also accounted for by adding the soil depth into their equation gillette et al 2017 in expert n n2o emissions can either be distinguished as a proportion of n2 or it can be distinguished as a function of soil moisture and so il temperature daisy epic dssat and some sub models of expert n soiln and ceres simulate denitrification explicitly in terms of the combined gaseous n n2 no n2o emissions based on soil moisture soil oxygen and labile c plant uptake the uptake of n from the inorganic n pools by a plant can be divided in four categories 1 not described 2 modelled as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n 3 modelled as a proportion of plant transpiration and as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n or 4 as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n and the movement of n from the soil to the root surface table 4 the uptake of n by plants is not explicitly described in the documentation of century and daycent in dndc epic dssat expert n and sub model leachn and lpj guess the uptake of n is modelled as a function of plant demand and the potential uptake of n the plant n demand depends thereby on the growth stage and its corresponding n content of the plant the potential uptake of n depends on the supply soil mineral n in the soil profile in all models and on the soil moisture in most of the models except for lpj guess additionally the soil temperature the root length density the water uptake rate and the transpiration of the plant are taken into account in some of the models see table 4 in rzwqm the n uptake of the plant is modelled in similar matters however the n uptake in this model is not the minimum of or the difference between potential uptake and plant demand but a michaelis menten equation is used which requires information on the maximum uptake rate of mineral n constant and soil mineral n content in the profile see also team et al 1998 additionally a passive n uptake is taken into account for this the n uptake is calculated proportionally to the transpiration rate of the plant in cropsyst daisy and stics also the transport of n from the soil to the root surfaces is calculated through convection and diffusion as shown by see also hansen et al 1990 the soil n supply in each soil layer is thereby determined by the transport of mineral n from a given soil location to the nearest root the actual uptake of n by the plant is then calculated by a michaelis menten equation which requires a maximum uptake rate of mineral n constants the root density and rooting depth cropsyst and daisy in stics the minimum of potential uptake and plant demand is considered as the actual uptake leaching the models describe leaching as the movement of dissolved inorganic n with the soil water movement the dissolved inorganic n is mostly described in the form of no3 and leaching constitutes a loss of no3 from the corresponding pool to lower layers or to the aquifer daisy and expert n including sub models consider nh4 explicitly table 5 the main difference between the models is how the soil water movement is computed table 4 the movement is modelled by using either the capacity soil water balance approach century epic stics daycent and lpj guess or the more detailed mechanistic richard equation rzwqm2 expert n and sub models or a combination of the two dndc daisy dssat epic and lpj guess in the capacity approach the water infiltrating into a soil layer fills the compartment to field capacity when the soil water exceeds field capacity the water percolates to the next soil layer and or goes to runoff epic and lpj guess the leaching flux is that n that percolates out of the lowest layer or goes to runoff del grosso et al 2008 the nitrate contained in the pool is assumed to be dissolved completely in the water of the soil layer the transport rate of n out of a soil layer is calculated by multiplying the percolation rate out of the soil layer by the concentration of nitrate in the soil layer in dssat and stics only a fraction of the no3 can be leached mimicking the adsorption of no3 to the soil and the prevention of this fraction from being transported to lower soil layers see also van der laan et al 2014 in rzwqm2 cropsyst and expert n and sub models the richard equation richards 1931 is used for simulating the movement of water the transport is driven by potential gradients that develop between soil layers due to gravity water extraction by roots and water that enters or leaves the profile which causes different soil moisture suctions in the different layers the soil moisture characteristics such as the hydraulic conductivity soil water content matric suction relationship and the porosity are key parameters for the calculation of the water movement the transport of n is described by the convection dispersion equation see also addiscott and wagenet 1985 this equation considers the solute displacement in the soil resulting from the physical process of convection or mass flow of water and the chemical process of diffusion in response to a concentration gradient this concept and the simulation of leaching in the capacity approach are described in detail in addiscott and wagenet 1985 key parameters for the equation are the volumetric water content volumetric water flux the solute concentration depth and a dispersion coefficient the main difference between models that combine the richard equation with the convection dispersion equation is that 1 some models differentiate between mobile and immobile water which mimics the presence of micro and macropores and 2 some models include adsorption of nh4 and no3 which reduces the amount of n lost through leaching a third option is a combination of the two approaches in which the capacity approach includes the hydraulic conductivity as parameter this reduces the water movements through the soils and allows the water content to be higher than field capacity as well as water to pond on the soil surface this option is currently used in dndc daisy epic dssat and lpj guess erosion erosion in models is either 1 not included or 2 modeled as a function of weather topography soil and management related factors erosion is not included in rzwqm2 daisy dssat stics expert n and lpj guess in century epic cropsyst and daycent it is modeled according to the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 in dndc the modified universal soil loss equation musle is used which is also optional in epic williams 1975 rusle includes factors such as rainfall erosivity soil erodibility topography land use and management rainfall erosivity depends on the rainfall intensity of a specific rainfall event risal et al 2016 the soil erodibility factor is a function or soil texture structure and om content the topographic factor is a function of slope length and slope steepness the management related factor includes soil cover which is influenced by tillage and erosion reduction measures such as grass markings panagos et al 2015 musle is the modified version of rusle in which the rainfall erosivity factor is calculated slightly different instead of rainfall intensity runoff and peak discharge is taken into account for which rainfall the soil water content and different retention parameters are used deng et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2014 tillage effects on drivers depending on frequency type and depth tillage can have major impacts on the physical properties of the soil and on the distribution of organic material as well as mineral n in the soil profile tillage affects the n processes either directly availability of substrate or indirectly via other soil properties most prominently soil moisture and soil temperature table 2 tillage is represented in different ways in the models which build upon each other table 6 1 tillage increases the mineralization rate temporary 2 tillage directly affects soil properties that drive soil n processes 3 tillage directly affects soil properties that drive soil n processes and have a temporal increase in mineralization rate and 4 tillage affects the soil properties directly and indirectly i e through the soil physical properties the first category in which the mineralization rate of selected pools is increased temporarily depending on the tillage activity the increased rate may either be predefined lpj guess and daycent or is calculated based on soil texture and a factor of soil disturbance cropsyst the increase in mineralization rate is temporary in the models in lpj guess and daycent the increase in mineralization occurs in the month of the tillage event and returns to its original rate after this month in cropsyst the rate decreases as a function of time and soil water content at a certain percentage per day for a soil at field capacity the second category in which tillage directly affects the soil properties can be found in the daisy and in the expert n models in these models tillage mixes or swaps the soil layers according to the tillage depth this means that the soil properties of all soil layers within the tillage depth are averaged additionally a defined fraction which has to be specified of the crop residues may be incorporated into the soil depending on the tillage type specified in the simulation the soil layers may also be swapped in the daisy model i e the soil layer properties are switched with each other mimicking the inversion of a soil profile through tillage the mixing and swapping of soil layers is permanent and only changes its state at a new tillage event the third category in which the soil properties are directly affected through mixing and additionally a temporal increase in the mineralization rate can be found in dndc and century also in dndc a defined fraction of residues may be incorporated into the soil as also described in the second category the mixing of soil layers is permanent and only changes its state at a new tillage event additionally to affecting the soil properties the mineralization rate of the different pools is increased depending on the depth of tillage practice in both models in century the increase in mineralization occurs in the month of the tillage event and returns to its original rate after this month in dndc the tillage effect on the rate is gradually reduced depending on the rainfall event the changes in properties caused by tillage gradually degrade due to natural reconsolidation during wetting and drying the direct effect on soil properties through the mixing of soil layers with or without residues can also be found in stics rzwqm2 epic and dssat in these models the soil moisture and soil temperature are also indirectly affected by tillage through the soil s physical properties the primary effect of tillage on soil physical properties is on bulk density mass to volume ratio which can either increase compaction or decrease aeriation the extent of the effects depends on the specific tillage event the change in bulk density affects the porosity or saturated water content in rzwqm2 dssat and stics a decrease in bulk density will result in an increase in porosity which means that more water could be stored in a certain soil layer the change in bulk density affects the mineralization rate in epic and the denitrification rate in stics directly another property that is affected by tillage in dssat and rzwqm2 is the hydraulic conductivity which describes the ease with which water can move through the soil column the hydraulic conductivity in dssat is changed by a certain percentage depending on the specific tillage event in rzwqm2 however the hydraulic conductivity is related to the porosity of the soil a change in the porosity therefore leads to a change in the hydraulic conductivity ahuja et al 2000 this affects the drainage and percolation rate and thus affects all soil water dependent n processes the bulk density porosity and hydraulic properties all have an effect on the soil moisture and therefore soil temperature in rzwqm2 the porosity is updated based on the rainfall amount and the kinetic rainfall energy the soil porosity is then converted into soil bulk density the rainfall energy is obtained from rainfall intensities and duration wischmeier and smith 1958 and is corrected for surface residues in epic the settling of the soil depends on the percolation infiltration rate into the layer and its sand content near the surface soils with high sand content will settle much faster than soils that are low in sand content especially in low rainfall areas in dssat the soil settles depending on the amount of rainfall and the kinetic rainfall energy which decreases per soil depth additionally there is a modification factor for the soil cover and aggregate stability the soil cover and stable aggregates will result in a relative slower settling of the soil than when there is no soil cover or instable aggregates tillage effects on n2o emissions in the models tillage has different effects on soil n dynamics and therefore n2o emissions in the models table 6 rzwqm2 is the only model that except for erosion simulates all n processes explicitly including n2o losses during nitrification and denitrification and the direct and indirect effects of tillage on its processes some other models simulate all n processes explicitly but are less detailed on tillage effects on the processes cropsyst expert n or are detailed in tillage effects but to a lesser extent in the n processes epic and dssat moreover not all models simulate n2o emissions specifically but simulate a combined flux with n2 and or no or do not simulate the fluxes at all in the models where the mineralization rate of different pools is directly increased for a certain time lpj guess daycent and cropsyst the inorganic n pool is increased as a consequence of tillage the inorganic n pool is then subject to losses in cropsyst and daycent the losses as n2o emissions are explicitly modelled in lpj guess the gaseous losses of n are not quantified therefore the effect of tillage on n2o emissions cannot be quantified in daisy and expert n tillage only has indirect effects on the n processes the incorporation of residues combined with the mixing of soil layers changes the amount of organic n in the layers and the c n ratio of different som pools additionally averaging the soil properties within the tillage depth resulting from tillage changes the rate of n processes due to a change in e g soil moisture and soil temperature which are important drivers of n processes in daisy a change in n processes will lead to a change in the combined losses of n2o n2 whereas in expert n the n2o emissions can be modelled explicitly the mixing of soil properties and residues also affects the rate of different n processes in dndc in this model and in century also a direct change in the mineralization rate of the different som pools is included as an effect of tillage the direct increase of the mineralization rate will increase the inorganic n pool which means that more n is subject to losses or further transformations including n2o emission by nitrification and denitrification since the model simulates n2o fluxes explicitly the change in n processes directly translates into changes in n2o emissions in century the increased inorganic n pool can be subject to losses however as in lpj guess the gaseous losses of n are not quantified therefore the effect of tillage on n2o emissions cannot be quantified in the models where the soil properties are directly and indirectly affected resulting from tillage a change in the soil moisture and soil temperature can be expected as well as the n content and c n ratios in the soil profile in stics and rzwqm2 these changes affect different n processes and therefore directly n2o emissions in these models the n2o emissions are modelled explicitly in epic and dssat these changes lead to a change in the combined losses of n2o n2 epic and n2o n2 no dssat the tillage effects on the n processes and thus n2o emissions decrease eventually due to soil reconsolidation 3 2 3 data requirements and availability tillage effects on n2o emissions at the global scale can only be evaluated when the data required to simulate the processes are available at the global scale in this step we analyze which data are required to drive the simulations of different processes and an example of which data are available at the global scale is provided table 7 data are required on environmental properties that affect the different n processes as well as management related data some data on properties and drivers can be supplied by endogenous computations while others have to be supplied from external sources the drivers and properties that are usually computed endogenously are those that are often dynamic such as soil water content and temperature but also other properties for which modelling capacities exist but only sparse measurements such as om pools or vegetation structure and productivity external datasets are typically needed for relatively static physical properties such as soil texture chemical properties that cannot be modelled well such as ph and cec and weather and management related data most of these data can be measured in the field however at the global scale we need to rely on external datasets the management related data that are required include data on fertilizer input of organic and inorganic n forms amount and timing residue input land use and soil management e g tillage most global ecosystem models work on a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of one day although finer spatial and temporal resolutions are also applied in global scale models ideally input data are available at the same spatial resolution as the model simulation but are often aggregated or interpolated to match the model simulation s spatial and temporal resolution interpolation can be as simplistic as assuming static conditions e g when only a single temporal snapshot is available employ inter and extrapolation methods or can be model assisted as e g in the case of weather reanalysis data aggregation and interpolation or any other scaling method is a potential source of uncertainty ewert et al 2011 this is especially the case for modelling erosion here information on slope steepness is needed for which static global datasets are available which would need to be aggregated to meet the spatial resolution of a 0 5 in this case aggregation can lead to an underestimation of slope steepness and therefore erosion in the absence of data simulations can be conducted for scenario assumptions e g for crop residue exports and intercrops see bondeau et al 2007 besides driving data models need to be parametrized and evaluated typically there are no good evaluation data sets available at the global scale so that global scale simulations need to be compared at reference sites where measurements for the comparison are available or indirectly for their effects on recorded properties such as national yield statistics müller et al 2017a b schaphoff et al 2018 model parameters typically need to be taken from smaller scales for which the models have been developed but can be calibrated if global effects do not match observational evidence 3 3 evaluation of modelling tillage and n2o emission at the global scale step 3 all primary as well as the important tillage affected secondary processes are described in most of the models reviewed here table 4 these processes are modelled in relative simplistic e g a ratio of another process or more detailed approaches in which different drivers of the processes are taken into account this provides a sufficiently diverse basis for selecting the most suitable approaches needed to resolve the most important processes in a consistent manner in existing models the most important caveat in the combination of different approaches from existing models is to avoid inconsistencies or redundancies in which simpler aggregated representations may already cover smaller processes in such cases a re parameterization of already implemented processes would be necessary if new processes would be added explicitly to the model in all models tillage has an effect on the n processes in which the mineralization rate is either directly affected or indirectly through the soil properties which have an effect on the soil moisture and soil temperature of the n processes only few models model the effect of tillage on n2o emissions explicitly table 6 the data that are required to model these processes can partly be met static datasets for some chemical properties e g soil ph and cec may be acceptable since tillage does not influence these properties in the analyzed models and these drivers are only taken into account for some of the n processes in some models however some of the physical properties e g porosity and bulk density may have to be endogenized by the models rather than treated as an external input because tillage directly affects these properties therefore the static values of the external databases can serve for model initialization or reference data the required data for modelling erosion cannot be met management and topography related data as well as data on rainfall intensity is lacking moreover modelling erosion requires a very high spatial and temporal resolution given that it is typically a quick and small scale process herzfeld et al in prep naipal et al 2015 improved the global applicability of the rusle model for modelling erosion by adjusting the topographical and rainfall erosivity factors the topographical factor was adjusted by scaling the slope according to the fractal method whereas the rainfall erosivity factor was adjusted by applying a linear multiple regression method for various climate zones panagos et al 2017 developed a global rainfall erosivity map at 30 arc seconds based on a gaussian process regression which can be used as the erosivity factor in the rusle model however for modelling erosion high resolution data on slope length and the other rusle factors is lacking the required management related data except for tillage and erosion are also partly available e g fertilizer input these datasets are available at sufficiently fine spatial resolution but often only as static datasets with no information on sub annual distributions however fertilizer inputs for example are mostly applied more often throughout a growing season therefore a dynamic dataset could give a better indication on when and how often fertilizers are being applied hutchings et al 2012 for tillage and crop residue incorporation there are currently no spatial and temporal explicit datasets available this means that tillage can be implemented in a global ecosystem model for the analysis of how different tillage options affect agricultural n2o emissions however since we lack spatial explicit datasets on tillage practices this analysis can only be conducted in a scenario based setting 3 4 discussion the models that have been analyzed vary in the amount of processes that are taken into account and the detail in representation of processes table 4 as mentioned previously some models include most processes explicitly but are less detailed on the tillage effects on those processes cropsyst expert n whereas some models are detailed in tillage effects but to a lesser extent on the n processes epic and dssat or cannot simulate n2o emissions specifically depending on the research question the availability of data for parameterization and model performance some models might be more suitable to apply than others models that simulate certain processes more detailed are often more suitable for questions related to scientific understanding as they can be used as tools to address research questions about control of processes magnitude of responses and interactions jones et al 2017 however an increase in detail typically requires a larger number of parameters which may be unknown or only known with relatively large uncertainties as there is a tradeoff between detailed process representation and model parametrization it is unclear what level of detail is the best for global scale application a general recommendation on which model process description to choose for the implementation of individual processes cannot be provided as this depends on the current implementation of other processes in the model that is to be extended the new implementation will have to be tested and evaluated in the model specific and research question specific context combining different processes described in models can yield inconsistencies and the individual processes of the models are typically not validated moreover although the data requirements are generally met the quality of the data is unknown or known to be poor see e g grassini et al 2015 model performance can only be tested against site measurements as global measurements are lacking and these should ideally span a broad range of environmental conditions i e jin et al 2017 lognoul et al 2017 mei et al 2018 van kessel et al 2013 this can be challenging as there is an enormous temporal and spatial variability in n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013a b given this variability model evaluation should be conducted at different scales which will be a learning process that we need to engage in most of the analyzed crop models have been developed for field scale application with processes usually simulated at daily resolution when models or modelling approaches are applied at larger spatial or temporal scales scaling to the new level of application is required this can include modifications of input data parameters and model simplifications ewert et al 2006 the degree of how much data parameters and models need to be modified also depends on the research objective the available data and what can be done regarding data and model uncertainties here we are interested in tillage effects on n2o emissions at the global spatial scale since we are interested in n2o mitigation and therefore rather a long term research study the temporal scale should be focused on the long term i e multiple years and decades with respect to the modification of data and parameters several methods can be distinguished depending on whether data manipulation refers to changes in extent coverage or resolution hatfield 2001 in ewert et al 2011 different scaling methods are proposed for data input and output and models e g model parameters and model structure in case input or output data are not matching the spatial resolution of the model simulation aggregation averaging or disaggregation can be considered model simplifications may be needed since large scale model application can be resource intensive computational time model simplifications can be done by considering only those processes that matter at the global scale as described before and selecting an appropriate level of detail for each n process adam et al 2011 ewert et al 2011 here we followed an evaluation scheme on assessing the feasibility of incorporating tillage in global ecosystem models this method opens opportunities of incorporating and analyzing other management aspects ghg emissions at the global scale instead of working with static ghg emission factors however the method is limited due to several reasons first of all it does not provide a standard procedure for the evaluation of the performance of the processes described in models individually as well as within the global ecosystem model into which management is incorporated although standard evaluation procedures are not provided evaluating the model performance can always be conducted against available data e g kelley et al 2013 müller et al 2017a b schaphoff et al 2018 only a selected set of models are analyzed that should both cover n processes and tillage effects this may have resulted in excluding models that can describe only one of the aspects well e g only tillage effects on soil properties but do not describe n processes additionally the analyzed models do not always provide a full model documentation which hampers the analysis the available documentation of individual models is mostly scattered over different articles full model documentations could better support information discovery and or prevent the use of outdated information about the described processes the analysis on data availability does not give insight on the quality of the data a sensitivity analysis can be conducted in order to assess the relative contribution of the inputs variables and parameters on the model outputs see also campolongo and braddock 1999 moreau et al 2013 inputs that make relatively high contribution to model outputs would require relatively higher quality data and constraints on input data quality should be considered in the interpretation of model results 4 conclusion we studied how tillage can be implemented in global ecosystem models for the analysis of n2o emissions from agricultural production existing field scale modeling approaches on soil nitrogen dynamics and on the effects of tillage facilitate this implementation in general however the suitability and validity of individual processes described in models is often not evaluated and will have to be tested within the new global framework scaling issues for processes and data availability will have to be addressed data scarcity especially on management related data will only allow for scenario based analyses we followed an evaluation scheme for assessing options for the inclusion of tillage related processes into global ecosystem models which could also be employed for other management aspects we find that there are ample options to implement tillage and soil nitrogen dynamics in sufficient detail in global scale ecosystem models a general recommendation on what modeling approach to use is not possible as this depends on what processes are already covered in the model that is to be extended and tradeoffs in data availability vs quality vs uncertainty in model parametrization need to be considered however agricultural management should be better represented in global scale ecosystem models mcdermid et al 2017 and the formal procedure described here can help in selecting suitable options such better model representation can open opportunities to evaluate agricultural based mitigation strategies such as climate smart agriculture lipper et al 2014 with global ecosystem models acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge the german ministry for

25152,there is a neglected old schism in ecosystem ecology ee the foundations of crucial concepts and principles of ee lie in thermodynamics but the current mainstream of ecological thought is significantly biased towards contingent mathematical models disconnected from physics frequently these models have weak theoretical support in ecology itself as well as a limited empirical validation this situation emerged when some ecologists became aware that seemingly thermodynamics devoted to study the dynamics of closed systems in equilibrium should be useless to understand ecosystems far from equilibrium open systems the solution was either developing a sort of new physics weakly linked to the principles and methods of conventional physics or a direction change towards an astonishing diversification of analytical ways in practice both things have happened simultaneously one of the many expressions of this controversial decision was a sort of rigmarole in the use of the concept of degrees of freedom this article based on a recent proposal organic biophysics of ecosystems obec i contributes to resolve the dilemma physics vs non physics in ee ii proposes a plausible and empirically backed approach to the meaning interaction and use of the concept of degrees of freedom in ee by reducing them to an inseparable triad of indicators species diversity dispersal intensity and fresh biomass or body weight per individual valid for any kind of ecosystem non contingency and backed by six essential traits simplicity universality evolvability empirical manageability inter model inclusivity and interdisciplinary scope and iii explores the aftermaths of the aforementioned approach to propose a complementary explanation to the metabolic theory of ecology as well as the cornerstone of an analytical framework commonly shared by economics and ee in order to develop a new way of getting reliable results in regard to the interaction between society and nature in summary the results included in these three analytical axes from i to iii are based on previous publications including empirical field data from 12 different kinds of taxocenes involving a total of 1649 plots and 8 874 107 individuals belonging to 1280 species besides this article includes in itself additional data from 638 species of mammals 97 samples of ruderal vegetation 26 samples of zooplankton as

holistic theoretical approach solidly supported by empirical field data c development of pure mathematical models with the help of software and computing devices d techno methodological issues e empirical applications in order to reduce our impact either on natural systems or on metastable man made systems including cities and their surroundings the concept of degrees of freedom df plays an essential although subtle role in all these domains in its less strict meaning the number of df is an indicator of complexity e g the atmosphere is a complex dynamical system with many degrees of freedom buizza 2015 from a statistical point of view mainly linked to domains b and c the number of df reflects the amount of observations which are free to vary after certain restrictions have been placed on the data for example if the data for 50 cases are classified into two categories then as soon as we know that say 35 cases fall into one category we also know that 15 must fall into the other for this example df 1 because with two categories and any fixed value of n as soon as the number of cases in one category is ascertained then the number of cases in the other category is determined siegel and castellan 1988 in classical mechanics a rigid physical body without ties deploys six degrees of freedom since it 1st moves up and down 2nd moves left and right 3th moves forward and backward 4th swivels left and right 5th tilts forward and backward and 6th pivots side to side tipler and mosca 2004 in physical chemistry the df of a system are the number of intensive state variables e g pressure temperature concentration of the components that can be arbitrarily and independently varied without altering the number of phases in the system fegley 2012 in statistical mechanics or thermostatistics the statistical understanding of classical thermodynamics the number of df is the number of ways in which a molecule retains aliquots from a total input of energy for example a linear diatomic molecule has six df halliday et al 2011 3 degrees of translational motion x y z axes 2 degrees of rotational motion y z axes 1 degree of vibrational motion of the atoms to each other x axis since molecules are not rigid physical bodies absolute temperature t only depends on translational motion and the kinetic energy e per each translational degree of freedom is e ½ kb t where kb is the boltzmann s constant m vx 2 t 1 38064852e 23 j k 1 per molecule being m molecular mass constant for a given kind of gas and vx mean molecular velocity on the x axis so since there are 3 degrees of freedom of translational motion x y z and by assuming the equipartition theorem i e that in thermal equilibrium energy is on the average shared equally among all of the degrees of freedom the total translational kinetic energy et of a mass of gas with n molecules is at the macroscopic scale et 3 ½ kb t n one of the main problems about this issue is that very frequently it is not explicitly stated which one of the previous concepts of df has been used in a given article although the interdisciplinary nature of ecology naiman 1999 allows the use of any of them depending on the context given the foundation of classical ecosystem ecology in thermodynamics lindeman 1942 patten 1959 margalef 1963 odum 1968 the concept of df linked to statistical mechanics should be the most relevant within the above explored spectrum of concepts however there is a shortcoming in this regard the foundational approach to ecosystem ecology based on conventional physics is outside the mainstream of current thinking in ecology because of the presumptive incapability of conventional statistical mechanics devoted to study closed equilibrium systems to study far from equilibrium open ecological systems margalef et al 1991a månsson and mcglade 1993 ulanowicz 2004 this conclusion has yield a situation of semi stagnation which despite the criticism by many authors e g simberloff 1981 belovsky et al 2004 rodríguez et al 2017a has kept its ruling epistemological influence for decades therefore the crucial analytical role of the concept of ecological df based on statistical mechanics is in danger this article is addressed to offer a brief synopsis about how the organic biophysics of ecosystems obec has been able to dodge the above mentioned paradox with the goal of establishing what is the minimum and most meaningful set of ecological df as well as its integration capability from the interdisciplinary point of view the minimum and most meaningful combination of ecological df proposed in this paper i contributes to the resolution of the dilemma physics vs non physics in ee ii proposes a plausible and empirically backed solution to the meaning interaction and use of the

extrapolation of obec to the analysis of society and its interaction with nature this example is a sprout of a non cosmological toe whose further development should stimulate our thought on a controversial topic at the same time that suggests new ideas for the research areas herein involved i e ecosystem ecology physics and economics 2 brief summary of obec 2 1 definition and main results the obec as a denomination to embrace a large set of non contingent models connected to each other has been defined rodríguez et al 2017b 2017c 2017d as a proposal based on the extrapolation of the principles of classical thermodynamics statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics to the analysis of the living fraction of ecosystems in accordance with well known principles of conventional ecology and evolutionary biology the conventional biophysics of ecosystems deals with the influence of several typical abiotic factors e g isotope movement in food webs light temperature ionizing radiation all of them of physical nature in their origin even though modified by their interaction with biotic factors in contrast the obec does not take into account any abiotic factor but analyzes the dynamics of living organic creatures assumed as if they were indivisible physical particles in movement and interacting with each other in a similar way to the case of statistical mechanical df all the essential traits of every organism depend on transforming solar energy into ecological parameters this explains the necessity of finding the ecological equivalents of statistical mechanical df in ecosystems fig 1 summarizes in a very simplified way the main results from obec so far a careful review of these achievements indicates that obec seems to be on the right way to rescue the classical paradigm of ecosystem ecology based on links between physics and biology in order to put it back in the mainstream of ecological thinking 2 2 the single root of all the models included in obec and its link with the minimum and most meaningful combination of ecological df there are two general ways to do science 1 starting from a broad set of details in order to achieve a single result 2 starting from a single essential detail in order to achieve a broad set of results obec is a typical example of the second way because the single foundation to sustain all the results summarized in fig 1 is the biomass dispersal trade off in function of the gradient of species diversity per plot rodríguez et al 2013a this statement requires to explain some details linked to the analytical equivalence between the concepts of static physical equilibrium and dynamic biological stationarity in ecology the increase of species diversity per plot hp shannon 1948 see also eq a 1 in the text box of spreadsheet rv1 in appendix a online has an anti kinetic influence odum 1972 pp 37 41 margalef et al 1991a and so an anti thermic effect at the ecosystem level see the positive association between kinetic energy and temperature in section 1 thus the relationship between hp and the ergodic statistical indicator of dispersal intensity ie expressed in dispersal units đ is of the form hp 1 ie where means proportional to for additional details about ie see rodríquez et al 2013a and or eq a 2 in the text box of spreadsheet rv1 in appendix a online there is a concurrency between r k selection theory and hp 1 ie that is to say k strategist large body organisms predominate under conditions of high species diversity and their ie values are low on the contrary r strategist small body organisms predominate under conditions of low species diversity and their ie values are high reznick et al 2002 thus there is a biomass dispersal mep ie 2 trade off in function of the gradient of species diversity per plot δhp with a pro stationary influence if and only if the system is under stationary ecological conditions sec in statistical terms there is a significant positive correlation hp vs mep concurrently with a significant negative correlation hp vs ie 2 as a result the dynamics of any ecosystem under sec can be roughly divided in three contiguous functional segments in which means high variable values and means low variable values i mep ie 2 hp ii m e p i e 2 h p iii mep ie 2 hp therefore mep ie 2 hp ke constant 1 38064852e φ ecojoule nat individual or je nat individual je kg đ2 see eq 1 below and φ 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 always an integer number typical of a given taxocene so ke i e the ecological equivalent of kb that is one of the most important universal constants in physics see section 1 assesses the magnitude of the exchange between eco kinetic energy eep a proxy for trophic energy see eq 1 and hp per individual under sec in a similar way in which kb assesses the rate of conversion between newtonian kinetic energy and absolute temperature per molecule under conditions of physical equilibrium 1 e e p 1 2 m e p i e 2 where mep mean fresh biomass or body weight per individual per plot p expressed in kg and ie a statistical index of dispersal activity per individual per plot with similar traits to those of v in order to replace v by ie without failures in the extrapolation of statistical mechanics to ecosystem ecology eq 1 mimics in ecology the same manner in which kinetic energy eq 2 is calculated in classical mechanics but by replacing physical variables by their ecological equivalents 2 e 1 2 m v 2 where m physical mass and v physical velocity the analytical equivalence between eqs 1 and 2 is grounded in the universal fulfillment of first law of thermodynamics i e that energy never disappears but only changes from one form to another thus obec assumes that eq 1 is the most appropriate proxy to empirically assess trophic energy in the simplest way possible the above described situation in combination with the physical necessity of either gain or loss energy to gain or loss information tribus and mcirvine 1971 in the form of species diversity hp indicates that an ecosystem under sec despite its open nature behaves like a strongbox without tangible walls ie 2 but mep when hp and mep but ie 2 when hp in contrast with the fact that mep and ie 2 must change in the same sense to promote a net variation of eep able to support a corresponding net variation of hp either forward or backward consequently there is no justification to hinder the application of conventional physics to ecology given that the single requirement for physical equilibrium is that state variable values do not change over time callen 1985 pp 6 13 since the values of state variables do not change over time in the large scale either under physical equilibrium or under open sec i e energy input energy output and intensity of competition relationships intensity of mutualistic relationships then the stationary state is for the analysis of ecological systems what equilibrium state is for the analysis of physical systems in equilibrium montero and morán 1992 pp 48 49 rodríguez et al 2012 1 1 human metabolism is a quite simple but very illustrative example in this regard any kind of living structure at any scale implies a far from physical equilibrium position but our body weight in the adult stage can remain in the average constant over time this means that the energy input to output ratio is near to 1 fulfilling in such a way the above mentioned premise stated by callen 1985 in spite of or thanks to our living nature 3 the minimum and most meaningful set of ecological df 3 1 theoretical and empirical reasons to assume the triad of fresh biomass per individual mep dispersal intensity ie and species diversity hp as a non contingent set of ecological df 3 1 1 simplicity on the one hand from the point of view of modelling we could suppose that a given ecosystem has hundreds or even thousands of df so we are unable to understand its functioning because it is too much complex on the other hand even assuming that this criterion is not valid and we would be able to introduce all these df in a computing device handled by a suitable software then we would get an analytical output so complex and unintelligible as the real system itself this means that any successful modelling needs to simplify the seemingly complex nature of a system until its most essential and less numerous traits instead of getting models which are more and more complex by exactly mimicking the complexity and incomprehensibility of the real system itself so a basic set of only three indicators accomplishes one of the main requirements for a good combination of ecological df simplicity either from the abstract or from the graphical point of view i e the most complex graphic that keeps a suitable level of comprehensibility for any reader has three dimensions x y z see empirical examples below section 3 1 3 3 1 2 universality any kind of organism either vegetal or animal either sessile or mobile either large or small either aquatic or terrestrial and either able of rational thinking or not needs to transform either physical or chemical energy into body weight biomass needs to deploy a given level of dispersal activity and needs to live in concurrency with other species diversity there is no exception to this combination therefore the triad mep ie and hp accomplishes a second requirement for a good combination of ecological df universality 3 1 3 empirical evaluability a third trait that deserves special attention is the possibility of empirically assessing the differential behavior of these df in regard to each other depending on if the ecological system is under sec or under non sec fig 2 shows the correlative behavior between hp ie 2 and mep in these alternative situations by means of examples based on empirical field data of ruderal vegetation rv see data and sampling method in spreadsheets rv1 and rv2 appendix a online and freshwater planktonic crustaceans crust see data and sampling method in spreadsheet crust appendix a online in agreement with the above commented biomass dispersal trade off under sec the 3d x hp y ie 2 z mep surface adjustment by means of distance weighted least squares fitting under sec fig 2a shows that the set of plots is associated to a basin shaped surface very similar to a horse riding saddle so this figure supports the idea that under sec the system is trapped into a pro stationary basin in spite of its open nature in summary the scatter plot in fig 2a avoids extreme values either very low or very high of any of the three df i e prevalence of functional segment ii in section 2 2 the correlative behavior of df under oligotrophic non sec see cells j3 j5 in spreadsheet rv5 appendix a online is shown in fig 2b in this case the main fraction of the scatter plot is associated to a dome like surface instead to a horse riding saddle surface like in fig 2a the dome surface is deflected by an ascending slope towards low hp values in a shape that suggests that the highest probability of plot presence is biased towards relatively low values of hp and mep and relatively high values of ie 2 this is an example of a system that follows an anti successional drift predominance of functional segment i in section 2 2 the correlative behavior of df under eutrophic non sec see cells j3 j5 in spreadsheet crust appendix a online is shown in fig 2c this situation is from the graphical point of view similar to the situation described in the previous paragraph i e there is also a dome like surface in fig 2c however the dome surface in fig 2c is deflected by an ascending slope towards high hp values and the highest probability of plot presence is biased towards a combination of high values of hp and mep and low values of ie 2 predominance of functional segment iii in section 2 2 3 1 4 evolvability a fourth desirable trait to support hp ie and mep as reliable df in ecology is their link to evolutionary processes in the deep time that is to say instead of a simultaneous emergence there have been a sequential emergence of ecological df i the evolutionary dawn of life on earth was presumably characterized by the initial emergence of a single and very small cell belonging to one initial unicellular species so only 1 df ie had a key role for life development in the earliest evolutionary stage because mep had a very low value and that founding species was spread by every nook capable of sustaining life all over the planet simultaneously since species number 1 then hp 0 ii later on a state in which hp 1 meant the emergence of a second df concurrently with the process of species diversification of primitive prokaryotic and eukaryotic unicellular organisms iii finally millions of years later the macroevolutionary transition of species toward new adaptive zones with a higher availability of external energy was able to support the emergence of multicellular organisms with a significant increase of body weight mep as a result this latter df biomass or body weight per individual per plot is responsible for evolution irreversibility this needs a brief explanation ie is an intensive variable because it does not depend on the system size for example it is possible to calculate a value of let us say ie 61 đ either from data of the microbiota in the oral cavity of a dog or from data of rainforest vegetation in a similar way in which a physical velocity of 110 m s can be measured either for a gas molecule or for a sport car hp is an intensive variable too and in practice h oscillates over a narrow range between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 5 nat individual on the contrary mep has an extensive nature in other words a given ornithocenosis bird community with hp 3 25 nat individual and ie 45 đ does not fit inside a dog s oral cavity inhabited by a given microbiota with exactly the same values of hp and ie therefore the eco evolutionary process is a biomass dependent expansive process addressed toward reaching greater mean body weights by every taxocene cope s rule see hone et al 2005 simultaneously the general trend is that within every taxocene those organisms that are the largest ones are also the smartest ones because of their ontogenetic capability of managing a greater amount of information h at the individual level due to their longer life expectancy margalef 1992 pp 221 223 this capability seems to be impossible to achieve without a reduction of biotic potential and dispersal ie the key issue is that in front of an always limited amount of sunlight energy a dilemma between energy investment in ie on the one hand and in mep hp on the other hand emerges natural selection in favor of ie is a choice in favor of very large populations with small individuals of short life cycles and few opportunities to acquire knowledge information about their environment the opposite combination in favor of mep hp is a choice in favor of individualism because a longer life cycle allows that each individual learns about its environment producing a scarcer but more capable offspring e g the capability of killer whales learned by means of a long lasting training between relatives belonging to small families for hunting seals just on or even beyond the seashore cannot have an equivalent behavior in mosquitoes and cockroaches nevertheless on the one hand it would be an error to forget that trillions of very small organisms with maximum ie values as planktonic creatures and soil bacteria sustain with their metabolism the rest of the assemblage of life on earth on the other hand the economic anthropomorphization of the above commented evolutionary drift should also be avoided i e that collectivism is a disadvantage in comparison with individualism a point established as a methodological paradigm by neoclassical economics even in plants and animals simply and plainly the second option means a drift of the ultimate goal of evolutionary process adaptability from the population level to the individual level and therefore a statistical acceleration of the process due to an overwhelming increase of the amount of selection units at the intra taxocene scale this sacrifice of the first df for the sake of achieving higher values of mep and hp seems to reach its paroxysm in the case of human beings in which a single biological species is able to perform thousands of productive functions in urban ecosystems occupations are the equivalents in society of ecological niches in nature margalef et al 1991a and r k selection theory is also valid in human populations chisholm 1993 this allows to accumulate an overwhelming information amount as well as the capability to manage huge volumes of energy and biomass at the exo somatic level after all it is quite possible that marshall 2013 p xxv was right when asserted that the mecca of the economist lies in economic biology rather than in economic dynamics rodríguez et al 2013b explain why ie can be regarded as an indicator of the talandic temperature kerner 1959 goodwin 1963 the term talandic derives from a word that in greek means oscillation ταλάντωση of ecosystems low ie values per plot indicate low average fluctuation levels of ecological niches so this condition allows that organisms deploy oscillations of lower amplitude and frequency around a center in space taken as a figurative point that grasps the dynamics of a given plot of non null area or volume meanwhile with high ie values just the opposite occurs oscillations of higher amplitude and frequency consequently the higher the values of ie the higher the intensity of ecological interference between species an unfavorable condition for coexistence as a result the above commented biomass dispersal trade off section 2 2 indicates that the increase of hp stimulates coexistence via ie reduction an ecosystem involved in a non sec pro successional process is equivalent to a refrigerator that increasingly cushions the amplitude and frequency of species oscillations in the ecological phase space see rodríguez et al 2013b this phenomenon is ecologically equivalent to the well known process of bremsstrahlung braking radiation radiation release produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle typically an electron by an atomic nucleus haug and nakel 2004 the particularity in the ecological context is that there is no observable net release of free radiation at all but a rapid assimilation of the new amount of available sunlight to be converted into eco kinetic energy eq 1 and information by new species added to the ecosystem by increasing in turn the average value of hp this is in agreement with the statement from margalef 1963 p 363 about the intrinsic capability of ecosystems to dampen the random oscillations of ecological factors a seemingly valid objection to this approach is that the original physical bremsstrahlung requires interaction between charged particles and species have no charge from the physical point of view but the fact that species coexistence trophic energy flows and functional exchanges between biological communities are possible if and only if there is an underlying gradient of species diversity margalef 1963 odum 1968 indicates that this gradient plays a resulting role in the ecosystem similar to that of the electromagnetic field in physics additionally interspecific relationships like mutualism and competition imply attraction and repulsion between species in a similar way in which attraction and repulsion between physical particles depend on the relationship between their respective electric charges 3 1 5 inter model inclusivity during the period under the influence of natural history rationalism in ecosystem ecology between 50 and 70 years ago mainstream ecology in a similar way to the case of evolutionary biology with darwinism had a large active central paradigm the foundation of ecosystem ecology based on physics specifically on thermodynamics able to unify a wide spectrum of empirical observations and theoretical proposals but this situation drastically changed in the last decades e g i think that traditional ecology is breaking down into a mosaic of hypotheses some interesting others less some contradictory and even frivolous while most of the sciences have tried to delve into their foundations ecology has been populated with concepts hypotheses rarely theories which tend to remain disconnected from each other an old fashioned ecologist regrets both the lack of common superstructure and the progressive devaluation of the naturalistic point of view margalef 1991b p 17margalef 1991bmargalef 1991b p 17 and the current mainstream ecology is a cluster of many micro paradigms in frequent contradiction with each other in such a way we could say that instead of a great ecology there are many small ecologies however it would be a flagrant mistake to deny that there must be a certain fraction of truth in every one of these micro paradigm if we aspire to achieve a large paradigm again then it must include instead of excluding these aliquots of truth for example it is plausible to assume that the metabolic theory of ecology mte see brown et al 2004 sibly et al 2012 hirst et al 2014 includes a fraction of the total landscape of ecological dynamics at the same time that obec also includes a fraction of this landscape therefore an inclusive attempt to achieve a more general image of ecosystem dynamics by using the degrees of freedom proposed in this paper should allow the reproduction of some results of mte by means of the central principle of obec explained in section 2 2 as it can be directly deduced from sections 2 2 and 3 1 4 body size mass m has a deep effect on ecological dynamics due to the regulatory linking relationship of metabolism in between the internal medium of organisms and their trophodynamic environment the most extended criterion about the quantitative relationship between m in kg and the consumption of energy at rest basal metabolic rate bmr in kj h is of the form 3 b m r a m b eq 3 is essentially an empirically inferred relationship several theoretical explanations have been proposed post hoc see below in which a is a dimensionless normalization constant independent of m and derived from the statistical treatment of data meanwhile b is an exponent whose magnitude generally impose an allometric greek allos other metron measure relationship i e b 1 between m and bmr and its observed value fluctuates between 0 565 and 1 179 white 2011 p 348 table 1 the relationship reflected in eq 3 is well known and many authors have devoted a lot of effort to its study from many years ago e g rubner 1883 krogh 1916 huxley 1932 brody and proctor 1932 kleiber 1932 1947 reynolds 1997 starting from the excellent review performed by white 2011 it is easy to be aware about the large number of authors interested in this subject and the variety of collateral traits connected to eq 3 in regard to methods of measurement statistical approaches to assess either the relationship between m and bmr or the degree of fitting between predicted and observed values of bmr inter taxocene variation of the spectrum of values of b and probable theoretical explanations the most frequent values of b are around two main figures ⅔ 0 66 and ¾ 0 75 besides it is possible to summarize the most frequent theoretical explanations about eq 3 in the following way i geometric hypothesis if we reduce the shape of a given organism to a warm solid sphere e of radius re its energy exchange surface area ae is proportional to re 2 because ae 4π re 2 meanwhile its volume and therefore its mass is proportional to re 3 because ve 4π re 3 3 so with the increase in body size there is an allometric increase of the surface of energy exchange with the environment in a relative way to the amount of mass proportional to b ⅔ 0 66 ii hypothesis of the branched design of the inner networks of distribution of energy and substances firstly reducing an organism to a simple sphere seems to push things too hard and secondly in practice the observed value of b for some species was found to be a little far away of 0 66 so the internal systems of distribution of energy and substance should significantly improve the surface volume ratio to a higher allometric scaling exponent of b ¾ 0 75 iii hypothesis of the influence of external ecological factors and the corresponding adaption of organisms for example mcnab 2008 starting from data of 638 species of mammals encompassing a rank of mass values between 0 0022 kg and 3221 kg obtained a correlation of r 0 989 r 2 0 979 p 0 0001 from a log10 vs log10 scaling of observed vs predicted values of bmr according to the regression equation 4 bmr kj h 0 062 m i s t c h e f g0 694 0 005 where non dimensional coefficients describe the response of bmr to various conditions including m for mountains or lowlands i for islands or continents s for substrate t for torpor c for climate h for habitat e for infraclasses and f for food habits even if we neglect the aforementioned hypotheses the resulting fact of ecological importance is that given the allometric relationship in eq 3 the larger the organism the lower the amount of energy to sustain every kg of standing biomass thus larger organisms k strategists despite the total amount of food they are able to eat is larger are ecologically more efficient than smaller organisms because they consume less energy per unit of biomass margalef s principle see matsuno 1978 barragán and sánchez 2012 for example the correlation between log10 bmr m vs log10 m starting from the very data of mcnab 2008 data in spreadsheet mammals bmr appendix a of this article online yields r 0 8812 p 0 000001 see also fig a1 spreadsheet mammals bmr in appendix a of this article online this eco evolutionary drift in favor of energy saving promotes coexistence under conditions of high values of total species diversity ht because more and more standing biomass can be sustained by a constant input of solar energy providing there is an opposite correlation between the amount of energy per kg and ht such a trend has been empirically tested before in a very large scale by rodríguez et al 2013a p 16 fig 3 b 24 samplings 1274 plots 1257 species and 87964545 individuals in regard to the value of a in eq 3 there is neither preferred values nor any theoretical framework capable to propose a reliable way of assessing them within the conventional analytical framework of mainstream ecology in which a is a simple statistical goop now we will propose a fourth hypothesis iv based on those issues commented in sections 2 2 and 3 1 4 in order to explore if the allometric relationship between bmr and m in eq 3 can be explained from the eco evolutionary point of view developed by obec and by using the three ecological df proposed in this article within the theoretical framework of obec it is possible to assume that given that all the placental mammals have a common ancestor a the bmr of the current evolutionary descendants from this primitive ancestor is a product of the primitive value of ke of the taxocene to which that ancestor belonged kea multiplied by the body weight per individual m of every current mammal species raised either to the power of 0 75 or he ev 0 662607004 je je nat individual 0 66 he ev is the evolutionary equivalent of planck constant see rodríguez et al 2015a 2015b 2015c he ev indicates the magnitude in which eco kinetic energy per individual see eq 1 above increases at the inter taxocene scale per each unit in which ke increases in the deep evolutionary time that is to say according to obec the theoretically expected exp value of bmr could be assessed either as 5 b m r exp k e a m 0 75 or as 6 b m r exp k e a m h e e v the only unknown parameter in eqs 5 and 6 is a plausible value of kea the intensive nature of hp and ie the extensive nature of mass mep and therefore the biomass dependent expansive nature of evolutionary process has been stablished in section 3 1 4 besides at the very beginning of adaptive radiations either in mammals or in any other kind of taxocene the evolutionary clocks of hp and ie 2 at the intra taxocene scale are set to zero i e species number 1 so hp 0 and ie 2 0 too because the few original organisms of the founding species have not had time to conquer a large area but the biomass dependent extensive nature of evolutionary process and its net cumulative effect across adaptive radiations starting from r strategist founding species to k strategist climaxing species means that the evolutionary clock of body mass mep in eq 1 and m in eq 3 can never be set to zero the hypothetical ancestor a of all the current placental mammals most of the species included in spreadsheet mammals bmr appendix a online weighed between 0 006 kg and 0 245 kg o leary et al 2013 therefore it had a body weight median of 0 006 0 245 2 0 1255 kg however according to obec this ancestor must have been a sort of giant species in a relative way to the rest of species of its taxocene because it must have belonged to a degenerate ecological state see rodríguez et al 2015d figs 6d 6e 6f 7 and 8 and comments about them with a level of eco kinetic energy per individual eq 1 of tenfold the energy level of the general ecological background occupied by the remaining species of its taxocene so a suitable assessment of the mean body weight per individual of the primitive taxocene to which a belonged is 0 006 0 245 2 1 10 0 01255 kg this body weight is approximated in between the mean body weight of tropical rocky shore snails mep 0 0011 kg with ke 1 38064852e 00 je nat individual and coral reef fishes mep 0 042044 kg with ke 1 38064852e 02 je nat individual explored by rodríguez et al 2013a as a result a plausible value of the ecological equivalent of boltszman s constant for the taxocene that was the evolutionary cradle of a could be kea 1 38064852e 01 je nat individual thus eqs 5 and 6 become respectively 7 b m r exp 13 8064852 j e nat individual m k g 0 75 8 b m r exp 13 8064852 j e nat individual m kg 0 662607004 j e j e nat individual there is a positive and highly significant correlation between the log10 basal rate of metabolism observed by mcnab 2008 and the log10 basal rate of metabolism expected either from eq 7 or from eq 8 see fig 3a and b respectively in addition there is no significant difference between the mean values of the aforementioned parameters fig 3c this result is very important due to its analytical meaning 1 it reinforces the usefulness of hp mep and ie as ecological df 2 the statistical equivalence of means in fig 3c indicates that the replacement of v expressed in m s in eq 2 by ie expressed in đ in eq 1 does not produce a significant change between the resulting derivate unit of expressions of energy in both equations in other words je and j are two units quite equivalent to each other in such a way that trophic energy and eco kinetic energy as well 3 it seems that by means of the theoretical framework of obec is possible to assess a non empirical and ante hoc value of a in eq 3 an unprecedented result so far 4 the noticeable similarity between the allometric exponent ⅔ and the evolutionary equivalent of planck constant 2 2 he ev was empirically assessed by means of a different methodology and it is based on a different theoretical framework in comparison with hypotheses i ii and iii exposed in the fourth paragraph of this section highlights the paradoxical possibility of the emergence of similar indicators despite they are seemingly disconnected from each other so this paradox could be explained either as a typical case of statistical spuriousness due to an implicitly omitted variable bias from the theoretical point of view demaris 2004 p 98 100 and or because the influence of he ev is so pervasive that it spontaneously arises even when the model under development see hypotheses i ii and iii above does not include any previous theoretical notion of its objective existence fig 3c indicates that an allometric exponent of 0 75 yields a better one but not significantly different adjustment between expected and observed data than he ev however he ev has several advantages in comparison with 0 75 that is to say it is very frequent in many other approaches to this issue even for non mammalian species see white 2011 p 348 table 1 it is supported by a theoretical framework obec it is also possible that the measurements of metabolic rate either at rest or under active conditions need to increase their accuracy level including other collateral indicators besides body mass values see white and seymour 2005 white 2011 and taking into account the result commented in item 3 of this paragraph 3 1 6 a sixth suitable trait of mep ie and h as df their potentiality to support approaches linking society and nature by means of a commonly shared analytical framework the lack of a theoretical and methodological framework commonly shared by social sciences and natural sciences is one of the most frequently neglected topics in the study of the human impact on nature despite commendable heterodox efforts in this field e g costanza 1996 jacobs 2000 economics and ecology remain conventionally seen as two immiscible substances from the analytical point of view the former of them is based on neoclassical theory meanwhile the latter one is based on a diffuse analytical cloud of ephemeral and or contingent approaches lawton 1999 p 178 scheiner 2013 included as a whole under the economic term externalities hence there is a lack of equivalence between impact indicators nature also impacts on society despite ecologists are in general more interested in the opposite direction of this interaction and a better correspondence of analytical tools between these two disciplines would be suitable the set of df analyzed in this paper can offer a plausible approach in order to get better the above mentioned condition by means of a connection between social science and ecology throughout physics as it has been previously commented there is an equivalence of meaning between occupations in society and species or ecological niches in ecosystems in fact the diversity of socioeconomic functions let us call it hs to differentiate it from the ecological context has been proposed as a reliable economic indicator e g marcuzzy and camuffo 1968 hackbart and anderson 1975 matutinovic 2001 frenken 2007 additionally the calculation of ie has no analytical or methodological restrictions to be applied to society let us call it is to distinguish it from the ecological context being in this context a good indicator of the talandic temperature see comments about this concept in section 3 1 of socioeconomic systems as it is expected according to our hypothetical premise in regard to the validity of ecological df also in economics the value of total socioeconomic diversity for the united states of america hst see fig 4 collapsed just after 2008 wall street meltdown and its subsequent expansion to the rest of the world mainly after october 2008 hst abruptly decline along 2009 and hits bottom in the period between 2010 and 2011 later on hst increased its value from 2011 to 2016 fig 4 also shows that according to the above mentioned anti kinetic and therefore anti thermic influence of h the value of is deploys just the opposite behavior in comparison with hst i e the internal talandic temperature of economic systems has an opposite behavior in comparison with socio diversity in fact the noticeable positive slope of is in the short stage between 2005 and 2007 supports the idea that the economy of u s a was in a process of overheating even before the economic crisis every dissipative system is able to keep a high level of order or low internal entropy high hst and low is in this case only by pumping entropy to its surroundings each technology always creates a temporary island of order at the expense of greater disorder in the surroundings rifkin 1980 p 123 the increase of atmospheric temperature is the main expected result of this process of pumping entropy to the outside negentropy for the sake of accumulating information inside society consequently the opposite association between the five year lowess smooth surface air temperature averaged over the contiguous 48 united states relative to the 1951 1980 mean t c and is in fig 4 is quite clear however even taking into account this evident association the suspicion of the underlying influence of a spurious correlation cannot be ruled out without the introduction of additional variables thus the suspicion of spurious correlation can be suppressed if we introduce a third anthropogenic indicator directly connected to climate warming the mean volume of greenhouse gas emissions due to transportation in the u s a between 2005 and 2016 was 26 748 of total emissions see appendix a spreadsheet economics cell g16 only surpassed by the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation 31 823 of total greenhouse gas emissions electricity generation is geographically concentrated in certain points but transportation activity is spread all over the country linked to every kind of human activity associated to a huge amount and variety of industrial waste as well as to the high capability of asphalt surfaces for transforming the incident solar radiation into heat in addition there is reliable evidence that aircraft produced contrail cirrus clouds contribute to anthropogenic climate change minnis et al 2004 burkhardt and kärcher 2011 kärcher 2018 even in a notoriously sudden way travis et al 2002 thus the impact of greenhouse gas emissions due to transportation could be regarded as more harmful than the impact of electricity production the cubic polynomial fitted values of greenhouse gas emissions by transportation expressed as a percentage of total emissions in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents gh t e total in fig 4 follow a trajectory that coincides quite well r 0 917 p 2 77e 05 with t c even the correlation between t c and the original non adjusted values of gh t e total is high and significant see appendix a spreadsheet economics cell e20 r 0 805 p 1 576e 3 this result supports the consistency of the above mentioned relationships between hst is and t c and vice versa so a very deep and long lasting economic crisis would be good news to reduce global warming the most important outcome from fig 4 is that the combination of df analyzed in this article can establish a fruitful analytical bridge based on a reliable equivalence of meaning between ecological df and economic df 3 3 the amount of exosomatic biomass handled by man has been omitted due to the methodological difficulties associated to its exact measurement per u s state the complete analytical landscape is that the current combination of i intense economic competition between countries ii high rates of technological development and economic growth i e hst 3 732 nat individual 4 4 the highest value of total socio diversity assessed for the u s in 2008 see cell b7 in spreadsheet economics appendix a at the world scale iii increasing scarcity of raw materials to sustain an ever increasing human population anyone who believes exponential economic growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist kenneth e boulding 1966 cited by cairns 2004 is not sustainable for a long time the key point is that meanwhile all the living systems on earth are open systems the global village in which we are living nowadays is not and has never been an open system from the socioeconomic point of view it develops under a paradoxical regime of enclosed degrees of freedom the main result is a conflict at a so large scale that it often overcomes the encompassing capability of our scientific view generally biased in favor of dissecting analysis rather than in favor of holistic synthesis the essentially far from equilibrium i e far from the walrasian balance between supply and demand and open nature i e different to the closed economic circuit between households and firms with the intermediation of the markets of goods and factors supported by neoclassical economics of economic systems has been recently stated as an inescapable requirement to keep a healthy functioning of economic dynamics according to the information theory of intrinsic value rodríguez and cáceres hernández 2018 this new theory of economic value unifies the two main previous theories so far in a reliable and self evident way based on the principles of thermodynamics thus in a similar way in which the european exploration expeditions from the second half of the 15th century until the beginning of the 17th century could be considered as a way to open a closed and declining medieval europe the future exoplanetary expeditions could be regarded as an emergency solution to open our global village from the socioeconomic point of view the most worrisome issue is that these kind of events although seemingly depend on our will are influenced by a so complex combination of circumstances that they seem to have their own objective internal dynamics they either will take place in the most suitable moment or they will not take place ever and then our species will vanish self consumed by its socioeconomic voracity 4 concluding remarks in summary the results of our analysis show either due to the easily understandable logic of its theoretical foundations or due to its empirical support that the dilemma physics vs non physics in ecosystem ecology is nonsense it is unavoidable to recover and develop the lost connection between the early stage of classical ecosystem ecology and several branches of physics astonishingly as it has been exposed in section 2 2 the lack of understanding in ecology of a so simple concept as that of physical equilibrium has delayed the development of this field over five decades in addition it is probable that any research work that either directly or indirectly neglects the analytical influence of the triad of ecological df here proposed will arrive to contingent conclusions finally these df and their alternative combinations can have a key role to establish a commonly shared language between ecology and economics a goal that is more and more imperative to reach in order to overcome the variety of urgent environmental challenges impinging on

25152,there is a neglected old schism in ecosystem ecology ee the foundations of crucial concepts and principles of ee lie in thermodynamics but the current mainstream of ecological thought is significantly biased towards contingent mathematical models disconnected from physics frequently these models have weak theoretical support in ecology itself as well as a limited empirical validation this situation emerged when some ecologists became aware that seemingly thermodynamics devoted to study the dynamics of closed systems in equilibrium should be useless to understand ecosystems far from equilibrium open systems the solution was either developing a sort of new physics weakly linked to the principles and methods of conventional physics or a direction change towards an astonishing diversification of analytical ways in practice both things have happened simultaneously one of the many expressions of this controversial decision was a sort of rigmarole in the use of the concept of degrees of freedom this article based on a recent proposal organic biophysics of ecosystems obec i contributes to resolve the dilemma physics vs non physics in ee ii proposes a plausible and empirically backed approach to the meaning interaction and use of the concept of degrees of freedom in ee by reducing them to an inseparable triad of indicators species diversity dispersal intensity and fresh biomass or body weight per individual valid for any kind of ecosystem non contingency and backed by six essential traits simplicity universality evolvability empirical manageability inter model inclusivity and interdisciplinary scope and iii explores the aftermaths of the aforementioned approach to propose a complementary explanation to the metabolic theory of ecology as well as the cornerstone of an analytical framework commonly shared by economics and ee in order to develop a new way of getting reliable results in regard to the interaction between society and nature in summary the results included in these three analytical axes from i to iii are based on previous publications including empirical field data from 12 different kinds of taxocenes involving a total of 1649 plots

holistic theoretical approach solidly supported by empirical field data c development of pure mathematical models with the help of software and computing devices d techno methodological issues e empirical applications in order to reduce our impact either on natural systems or on metastable man made systems including cities and their surroundings the concept of degrees of freedom df plays an essential although subtle role in all these domains in its less strict meaning the number of df is an indicator of complexity e g the atmosphere is a complex dynamical system with many degrees of freedom buizza 2015 from a statistical point of view mainly linked to domains b and c the number of df reflects the amount of observations which are free to vary after certain restrictions have been placed on the data for example if the data for 50 cases are classified into two categories then as soon as we know that say 35 cases fall into one category we also know that 15 must fall into the other for this example df 1 because with two categories and any fixed value of n as soon as the number of cases in one category is ascertained then the number of cases in the other category is determined siegel and castellan 1988 in classical mechanics a rigid physical body without ties deploys six degrees of freedom since it 1st moves up and down 2nd moves left and right 3th moves forward and backward 4th swivels left and right 5th tilts forward and backward and 6th pivots side to side tipler and mosca 2004 in physical chemistry the df of a system are the number of intensive state variables e g pressure temperature concentration of the components that can be arbitrarily and independently varied without altering the number of phases in the system fegley 2012 in statistical mechanics or thermostatistics the statistical understanding of classical thermodynamics the number of df is the number of ways in which a molecule retains aliquots from a total input of energy for example a linear diatomic molecule has six df halliday et al 2011 3 degrees of translational motion x y z axes 2 degrees of rotational motion y z axes 1 degree of vibrational motion of the atoms to each other x axis since molecules are not rigid physical bodies absolute temperature t only depends on translational motion and the kinetic energy e per each translational degree of freedom is e ½ kb t where kb is the boltzmann s constant m vx 2 t 1 38064852e 23 j k 1 per molecule being m molecular mass constant for a given kind of gas and vx mean molecular velocity on the x axis so since there are 3 degrees of freedom of translational motion x y z and by assuming the equipartition theorem i e that in thermal equilibrium energy is on the average shared equally among all of the degrees of freedom the total translational kinetic energy et of a mass of gas with n molecules is at the macroscopic scale et 3 ½ kb t n one of the main problems about this issue is that very frequently it is not explicitly stated which one of the previous concepts of df has been used in a given article although the interdisciplinary nature of ecology naiman 1999 allows the use of any of them depending on the context given the foundation of classical ecosystem ecology in thermodynamics lindeman 1942 patten 1959 margalef 1963 odum 1968 the concept of df linked to statistical mechanics should be the most relevant within the above explored spectrum of concepts however there is a shortcoming in this regard the foundational approach to ecosystem ecology based on conventional physics is outside the mainstream of current thinking in ecology because of the presumptive incapability of conventional statistical mechanics devoted to study closed equilibrium systems to study far from equilibrium open ecological systems margalef et al 1991a månsson and mcglade 1993 ulanowicz 2004 this conclusion has yield a situation of semi stagnation which despite the criticism by many authors e g simberloff 1981 belovsky et al 2004 rodríguez et al 2017a has kept its ruling epistemological influence for decades therefore the crucial analytical role of the concept of ecological df based on statistical mechanics is in danger this article is addressed to offer a brief synopsis about how the organic biophysics of ecosystems obec has been able to dodge the above mentioned paradox with the goal of establishing what is the minimum and most meaningful set of ecological df as well as its integration capability from the interdisciplinary point of view the minimum and most meaningful combination of ecological df proposed in this paper i contributes to the resolution of the dilemma physics vs non physics in ee ii proposes a plausible and empirically backed solution to the meaning interaction and use of the concept of df in ee by reducing them to an inseparable and all encompassing triad of indicators species diversity dispersal intensity and fresh biomass or body weight per individual valid for any kind of ecosystem non contingency and backed by six essential traits simplicity universality evolvability empirical manageability inter model inclusivity in the ecological realm and interdisciplinary scope beyond the ecological realm and iii explores the aftermaths of the above mentioned solution to establish the cornerstone of an analytical framework commonly shared by economics and ee in order to develop a new way of getting verifiable results in regard to the interaction between society and nature in summary the results included in the above mentioned items from i to iii are based on previous publications including empirical field data from 12 different kinds of taxocenes marine microalgae marine interstitial meiofauna of sandy beaches massive non branching corals litter invertebrates in laurisilva and pine forest tropical rocky shore snails coral reef fishes ruderal vegetation mediterranean shrub vegetation mixed shrub vegetation pine forest vegetation and coastal succulent shrub vegetation involving a total of 1649 plots and 8 874 107 individuals belonging to 1280 species besides this article includes in itself additional data from 638 species of mammals 97 samples of ruderal vegetation and 26 samples of zooplankton the proposal is completed by an example based on human population data retrieved from official institutions of the u s government x 2 973 108 8 657 106 s d individuals per year in combination with data of mean temperature and emission of greenhouse gases at the country level over 12 consecutive years that offers a preliminary assessment of the extrapolation of obec to the analysis of society and its interaction with nature this example is a sprout of a non cosmological toe whose further development should stimulate our thought on a controversial topic at the same time that suggests new ideas for the research areas herein involved i e ecosystem ecology physics and economics 2 brief summary of obec 2 1 definition and main results the obec as a denomination to embrace a large set of non contingent models connected to each other has been defined rodríguez et al 2017b 2017c 2017d as a proposal based on the extrapolation of the principles of classical thermodynamics statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics to the analysis of the living fraction of ecosystems in accordance with well known principles of conventional ecology and evolutionary biology the conventional biophysics of ecosystems deals with the influence of several typical abiotic factors e g isotope movement in food webs light temperature ionizing radiation all of them of physical nature in their origin even though modified by their interaction with biotic factors in contrast the obec does not take into account any abiotic factor but analyzes the dynamics of living organic creatures assumed as if they were indivisible physical particles in movement and interacting with each other in a similar way to the case of statistical mechanical df all the essential traits of every organism depend on transforming solar energy into ecological parameters this explains the necessity of finding the ecological equivalents of statistical mechanical df in ecosystems fig 1 summarizes in a very simplified way the main results from obec so far a careful review of these achievements indicates that obec seems to be on the right way to rescue the classical paradigm of ecosystem ecology based on links between physics and biology in order to put it back in the mainstream of ecological thinking 2 2 the single root of all the models included in obec and its link with the minimum and most meaningful combination of ecological df there are two general ways to do science 1 starting from a broad set of details in order to achieve a single result 2 starting from a single essential detail in order to achieve a broad set of results obec is a typical example of the second way because the single foundation to sustain all the results summarized in fig 1 is the biomass dispersal trade off in function of the gradient of species diversity per plot rodríguez et al 2013a this statement requires to explain some details linked to the analytical equivalence between the concepts of static physical equilibrium and dynamic biological stationarity in ecology the increase of species diversity per plot hp shannon 1948 see also eq a 1 in the text box of spreadsheet rv1 in appendix a online has an anti kinetic influence odum 1972 pp 37 41 margalef et al 1991a and so an anti thermic effect at the ecosystem level see the positive association between kinetic energy and temperature in section 1 thus the relationship between hp and the ergodic statistical indicator of dispersal intensity ie expressed in dispersal units đ is of the form hp 1 ie where means proportional to for additional details about ie see rodríquez et al 2013a and or eq a 2 in the text box of spreadsheet rv1 in appendix a online there is a concurrency between r k selection theory and hp 1 ie that is to say k strategist large body organisms predominate under conditions of high species diversity and their ie values are low on the contrary r strategist small body organisms predominate under conditions of low species diversity and their ie values are high reznick et al 2002 thus there is a biomass dispersal mep ie 2 trade off in function of the gradient of species diversity per plot δhp with a pro stationary influence if and only if the system is under stationary ecological conditions sec in statistical terms there is a significant positive correlation hp vs mep concurrently with a significant negative correlation hp vs ie 2 as a result the dynamics of any ecosystem under sec can be roughly divided in three contiguous functional segments in which means high variable values and means low variable values i mep ie 2 hp ii m e p i e 2 h p iii mep ie 2 hp therefore mep ie 2 hp ke constant 1 38064852e φ ecojoule nat individual or je nat individual je kg đ2 see eq 1 below and φ 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 always an integer number typical of a given taxocene so ke i e the ecological equivalent of kb that is one of the most important universal constants in physics see section 1 assesses the magnitude of the exchange between eco kinetic energy eep a proxy for trophic energy see eq 1 and hp per individual under sec in a similar way in which kb assesses the rate of conversion between newtonian kinetic energy and absolute temperature per molecule under conditions of physical equilibrium 1 e e p 1 2 m e p i e 2 where mep mean fresh biomass or body weight per individual per plot p expressed in kg and ie a statistical index of dispersal activity per individual per plot with similar traits to those of v in order to replace v by ie without failures in the extrapolation of statistical mechanics to ecosystem ecology eq 1 mimics in ecology the same manner in which kinetic energy eq 2 is calculated in classical mechanics but by replacing physical variables by their ecological equivalents 2 e 1 2 m v 2 where m physical mass and v physical velocity the analytical equivalence between eqs 1 and 2 is grounded in the universal fulfillment of first law of thermodynamics i e that energy never disappears but only changes from one form to another thus obec assumes that eq 1 is the most appropriate proxy to empirically assess trophic energy in the simplest way possible the above described situation in combination with the physical necessity of either gain or loss energy to gain or loss information tribus and mcirvine 1971 in the form of species diversity hp indicates that an ecosystem under sec despite its open nature behaves like a strongbox without tangible walls ie 2 but mep when hp and mep but ie 2 when hp in contrast with the fact that mep and ie 2 must change in the same sense to promote a net variation of eep able to support a corresponding net variation of hp either forward or backward consequently there is no justification to hinder the application of conventional physics to ecology given that the single requirement for physical equilibrium is that state variable values do not change over time callen 1985 pp 6 13 since the values of state variables do not change over time in the large scale either under physical equilibrium or under open sec i e energy input energy output and intensity of competition relationships intensity of mutualistic relationships then the stationary state is for the analysis of ecological systems what equilibrium state is for the analysis of physical systems in equilibrium montero and morán 1992 pp 48 49 rodríguez et al 2012 1 1 human metabolism is a quite simple but very illustrative example in this regard any kind of living structure at any scale implies a far from physical equilibrium position but our body weight in the adult stage can remain in the average constant over time this means that the energy input to output ratio is near to 1 fulfilling in such a way the above mentioned premise stated by callen 1985 in spite of or thanks to our living nature 3 the minimum and most meaningful set of ecological df 3 1 theoretical and empirical reasons to assume the triad of fresh biomass per individual mep dispersal intensity ie and species diversity hp as a non contingent set of ecological df 3 1 1 simplicity on the one hand from the point of view of modelling we could suppose that a given ecosystem has hundreds or even thousands of df so we are unable to understand its functioning because it is too much complex on the other hand even assuming that this criterion is not valid and we would be able to introduce all these df in a computing device handled by a suitable software then we would get an analytical output so complex and unintelligible as the real system itself this means that any successful modelling needs to simplify the seemingly complex nature of a system until its most essential and less numerous traits instead of getting models which are more and more complex by exactly mimicking the complexity and incomprehensibility of the real system itself so a basic set of only three indicators accomplishes one of the main requirements for a good combination of ecological df simplicity either from the abstract or from the graphical point of view i e the most complex graphic that keeps a suitable level of comprehensibility for any reader has three dimensions x y z see empirical examples below section 3 1 3 3 1 2 universality any kind of organism either vegetal or animal either sessile or mobile either large or small either aquatic or terrestrial and either able of rational thinking or not needs to transform either physical or chemical energy into body weight biomass needs to deploy a given level of dispersal activity and needs to live in concurrency with other species diversity there is no exception to this combination therefore the triad mep ie and hp accomplishes a second requirement for a good combination of ecological df universality 3 1 3 empirical evaluability a third trait that deserves special attention is the possibility of empirically assessing the differential behavior of these df in regard to each other depending on if the ecological system is under sec or under non sec fig 2 shows the correlative behavior between hp ie 2 and mep in these alternative situations by means of examples based on empirical field data of ruderal vegetation rv see data and sampling method in spreadsheets rv1 and rv2 appendix a online and freshwater planktonic crustaceans crust see data and sampling method in spreadsheet crust appendix a online in agreement with the above commented biomass dispersal trade off under sec the 3d x hp y ie 2 z mep surface adjustment by means of distance weighted least squares fitting under sec fig 2a shows that the set of plots is associated to a basin shaped surface very similar to a horse riding saddle so this figure supports the idea that under sec the system is trapped into a pro stationary basin in spite of its open nature in summary the scatter plot in fig 2a avoids extreme values either very low or very high of any of the three df i e prevalence of functional segment ii in section 2 2 the correlative behavior of df under oligotrophic non sec see cells j3 j5 in spreadsheet rv5 appendix a online is shown in fig 2b in this case the main fraction of the scatter plot is associated to a dome like surface instead to a horse riding saddle surface like in fig 2a the dome surface is deflected by an ascending slope towards low hp values in a shape that suggests that the highest probability of plot presence is biased towards relatively low values of hp and mep and relatively high values of ie 2 this is an example of a system that follows an anti successional drift predominance of functional segment i in section 2 2 the correlative behavior of df under eutrophic non sec see cells j3 j5 in spreadsheet crust appendix a online is shown in fig 2c this situation is from the graphical point of view similar to the situation described in the previous paragraph i e there is also a dome like surface in fig 2c however the dome surface in fig 2c is deflected by an ascending slope towards high hp values and the highest probability of plot presence is biased towards a combination of high values of hp and mep and low values of ie 2 predominance of functional segment iii in section 2 2 3 1 4 evolvability a fourth desirable trait to support hp ie and mep as reliable df in ecology is their link to evolutionary processes in the deep time that is to say instead of a simultaneous emergence there have been a sequential emergence of ecological df i the evolutionary dawn of life on earth was presumably characterized by the initial emergence of a single and very small cell belonging to one initial unicellular species so only 1 df ie had a key role for life development in the earliest evolutionary stage because mep had a very low value and that founding species was spread by every nook capable of sustaining life all over the planet simultaneously since species number 1 then hp 0 ii later on a state in which hp 1 meant the emergence of a second df concurrently with the process of species diversification of primitive prokaryotic and eukaryotic unicellular organisms iii finally millions of years later the macroevolutionary transition of species toward new adaptive zones with a higher availability of external energy was able to support the emergence of multicellular organisms with a significant increase of body weight mep as a result this latter df biomass or body weight per individual per plot is responsible for evolution irreversibility this needs a brief explanation ie is an intensive variable because it does not depend on the system size for example it is possible to calculate a value of let us say ie 61 đ either from data of the microbiota in the oral cavity of a dog or from data of rainforest vegetation in a similar way in which a physical velocity of 110 m s can be measured either for a gas molecule or for a sport car hp is an intensive variable too and in practice h oscillates over a narrow range between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 5 nat individual on the contrary mep has an extensive nature in other words a given ornithocenosis bird community with hp 3 25 nat individual and ie 45 đ does not fit inside a dog s oral cavity inhabited by a given microbiota with exactly the same values of hp and ie therefore the eco evolutionary process is a biomass dependent expansive process addressed toward reaching greater mean body weights by every taxocene cope s rule see hone et al 2005 simultaneously the general trend is that within every taxocene those organisms that are the largest ones are also the smartest ones because of their ontogenetic capability of managing a greater amount of information h at the individual level due to their longer life expectancy margalef 1992 pp 221 223 this capability seems to be impossible to achieve without a reduction of biotic potential and dispersal ie the key issue is that in front of an always limited amount of sunlight energy a dilemma between energy investment in ie on the one hand and in mep hp on the other hand emerges natural selection in favor of ie is a choice in favor of very large populations with small individuals of short life cycles and few opportunities to acquire knowledge information about their environment the opposite combination in favor of mep hp is a choice in favor of individualism because a longer life cycle allows that each individual learns about its environment producing a scarcer but more capable offspring e g the capability of killer whales learned by means of a long lasting training between relatives belonging to small families for hunting seals just on or even beyond the seashore cannot have an equivalent behavior in mosquitoes and cockroaches nevertheless on the one hand it would be an error to forget that trillions of very small organisms with maximum ie values as planktonic creatures and soil bacteria sustain with their metabolism the rest of the assemblage of life on earth on the other hand the economic anthropomorphization of the above commented evolutionary drift should also be avoided i e that collectivism is a disadvantage in comparison with individualism a point established as a methodological paradigm by neoclassical economics even in plants and animals simply and plainly the second option means a drift of the ultimate goal of evolutionary process adaptability from the population level to the individual level and therefore a statistical acceleration of the process due to an overwhelming increase of the amount of selection units at the intra taxocene scale this sacrifice of the first df for the sake of achieving higher values of mep and hp seems to reach its paroxysm in the case of human beings in which a single biological species is able to perform thousands of productive functions in urban ecosystems occupations are the equivalents in society of ecological niches in nature margalef et al 1991a and r k selection theory is also valid in human populations chisholm 1993 this allows to accumulate an overwhelming information amount as well as the capability to manage huge volumes of energy and biomass at the exo somatic level after all it is quite possible that marshall 2013 p xxv was right when asserted that the mecca of the economist lies in economic biology rather than in economic dynamics rodríguez et al 2013b explain why ie can be regarded as an indicator of the talandic temperature kerner 1959 goodwin 1963 the term talandic derives from a word that in greek means oscillation ταλάντωση of ecosystems low ie values per plot indicate low average fluctuation levels of ecological niches so this condition allows that organisms deploy oscillations of lower amplitude and frequency around a center in space taken as a figurative point that grasps the dynamics of a given plot of non null area or volume meanwhile with high ie values just the opposite occurs oscillations of higher amplitude and frequency consequently the higher the values of ie the higher the intensity of ecological interference between species an unfavorable condition for coexistence as a result the above commented biomass dispersal trade off section 2 2 indicates that the increase of hp stimulates coexistence via ie reduction an ecosystem involved in a non sec pro successional process is equivalent to a refrigerator that increasingly cushions the amplitude and frequency of species oscillations in the ecological phase space see rodríguez et al 2013b this phenomenon is ecologically equivalent to the well known process of bremsstrahlung braking radiation radiation release produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle typically an electron by an atomic nucleus haug and nakel 2004 the particularity in the ecological context is that there is no observable net release of free radiation at all but a rapid assimilation of the new amount of available sunlight to be converted into eco kinetic energy eq 1 and information by new species added to the ecosystem by increasing in turn the average value of hp this is in agreement with the statement from margalef 1963 p 363 about the intrinsic capability of ecosystems to dampen the random oscillations of ecological factors a seemingly valid objection to this approach is that the original physical bremsstrahlung requires interaction between charged particles and species have no charge from the physical point of view but the fact that species coexistence trophic energy flows and functional exchanges between biological communities are possible if and only if there is an underlying gradient of species diversity margalef 1963 odum 1968 indicates that this gradient plays a resulting role in the ecosystem similar to that of the electromagnetic field in physics additionally interspecific relationships like mutualism and competition imply attraction and repulsion between species in a similar way in which attraction and repulsion between physical particles depend on the relationship between their respective electric charges 3 1 5 inter model inclusivity during the period under the influence of natural history rationalism in ecosystem ecology between 50 and 70 years ago mainstream ecology in a similar way to the case of evolutionary biology with darwinism had a large active central paradigm the foundation of ecosystem ecology based on physics specifically on thermodynamics able to unify a wide spectrum of empirical observations and theoretical proposals but this situation drastically changed in the last decades e g i think that traditional ecology is breaking down into a mosaic of hypotheses some interesting others less some contradictory and even frivolous while most of the sciences have tried to delve into their foundations ecology has been populated with concepts hypotheses rarely theories which tend to remain disconnected from each other an old fashioned ecologist regrets both the lack of common superstructure and the progressive devaluation of the naturalistic point of view margalef 1991b p 17margalef 1991bmargalef 1991b p 17 and the current mainstream ecology is a cluster of many micro paradigms in frequent contradiction with each other in such a way we could say that instead of a great ecology there are many small ecologies however it would be a flagrant mistake to deny that there must be a certain fraction of truth in every one of these micro paradigm if we aspire to achieve a large paradigm again then it must include instead of excluding these aliquots of truth for example it is plausible to assume that the metabolic theory of ecology mte see brown et al 2004 sibly et al 2012 hirst et al 2014 includes a fraction of the total landscape of ecological dynamics at the same time that obec also includes a fraction of this landscape therefore an inclusive attempt to achieve a more general image of ecosystem dynamics by using the degrees of freedom proposed in this paper should allow the reproduction of some results of mte by means of the central principle of obec explained in section 2 2 as it can be directly deduced from sections 2 2 and 3 1 4 body size mass m has a deep effect on ecological dynamics due to the regulatory linking relationship of metabolism in between the internal medium of organisms and their trophodynamic environment the most extended criterion about the quantitative relationship between m in kg and the consumption of energy at rest basal metabolic rate bmr in kj h is of the form 3 b m r a m b eq 3 is essentially an empirically inferred relationship several theoretical explanations have been proposed post hoc see below in which a is a dimensionless normalization constant independent of m and derived from the statistical treatment of data meanwhile b is an exponent whose magnitude generally impose an allometric greek allos other metron measure relationship i e b 1 between m and bmr and its observed value fluctuates between 0 565 and 1 179 white 2011 p 348 table 1 the relationship reflected in eq 3 is well known and many authors have devoted a lot of effort to its study from many years ago e g rubner 1883 krogh 1916 huxley 1932 brody and proctor 1932 kleiber 1932 1947 reynolds 1997 starting from the excellent review performed by white 2011 it is easy to be aware about the large number of authors interested in this subject and the variety of collateral traits connected to eq 3 in regard to methods of measurement statistical approaches to assess either the relationship between m and bmr or the degree of fitting between predicted and observed values of bmr inter taxocene variation of the spectrum of values of b and probable theoretical explanations the most frequent values of b are around two main figures ⅔ 0 66 and ¾ 0 75 besides it is possible to summarize the most frequent theoretical explanations about eq 3 in the following way i geometric hypothesis if we reduce the shape of a given organism to a warm solid sphere e of radius re its energy exchange surface area ae is proportional to re 2 because ae 4π re 2 meanwhile its volume and therefore its mass is proportional to re 3 because ve 4π re 3 3 so with the increase in body size there is an allometric increase of the surface of energy exchange with the environment in a relative way to the amount of mass proportional to b ⅔ 0 66 ii hypothesis of the branched design of the inner networks of distribution of energy and substances firstly reducing an organism to a simple sphere seems to push things too hard and secondly in practice the observed value of b for some species was found to be a little far away of 0 66 so the internal systems of distribution of energy and substance should significantly improve the surface volume ratio to a higher allometric scaling exponent of b ¾ 0 75 iii hypothesis of the influence of external ecological factors and the corresponding adaption of organisms for example mcnab 2008 starting from data of 638 species of mammals encompassing a rank of mass values between 0 0022 kg and 3221 kg obtained a correlation of r 0 989 r 2 0 979 p 0 0001 from a log10 vs log10 scaling of observed vs predicted values of bmr according to the regression equation 4 bmr kj h 0 062 m i s t c h e f g0 694 0 005 where non dimensional coefficients describe the response of bmr to various conditions including m for mountains or lowlands i for islands or continents s for substrate t for torpor c for climate h for habitat e for infraclasses and f for food habits even if we neglect the aforementioned hypotheses the resulting fact of ecological importance is that given the allometric relationship in eq 3 the larger the organism the lower the amount of energy to sustain every kg of standing biomass thus larger organisms k strategists despite the total amount of food they are able to eat is larger are ecologically more efficient than smaller organisms because they consume less energy per unit of biomass margalef s principle see matsuno 1978 barragán and sánchez 2012 for example the correlation between log10 bmr m vs log10 m starting from the very data of mcnab 2008 data in spreadsheet mammals bmr appendix a of this article online yields r 0 8812 p 0 000001 see also fig a1 spreadsheet mammals bmr in appendix a of this article online this eco evolutionary drift in favor of energy saving promotes coexistence under conditions of high values of total species diversity ht because more and more standing biomass can be sustained by a constant input of solar energy providing there is an opposite correlation between the amount of energy per kg and ht such a trend has been empirically tested before in a very large scale by rodríguez et al 2013a p 16 fig 3 b 24 samplings 1274 plots 1257 species and 87964545 individuals in regard to the value of a in eq 3 there is neither preferred values nor any theoretical framework capable to propose a reliable way of assessing them within the conventional analytical framework of mainstream ecology in which a is a simple statistical goop now we will propose a fourth hypothesis iv based on those issues commented in sections 2 2 and 3 1 4 in order to explore if the allometric relationship between bmr and m in eq 3 can be explained from the eco evolutionary point of view developed by obec and by using the three ecological df proposed in this article within the theoretical framework of obec it is possible to assume that given that all the placental mammals have a common ancestor a the bmr of the current evolutionary descendants from this primitive ancestor is a product of the primitive value of ke of the taxocene to which that ancestor belonged kea multiplied by the body weight per individual m of every current mammal species raised either to the power of 0 75 or he ev 0 662607004 je je nat individual 0 66 he ev is the evolutionary equivalent of planck constant see rodríguez et al 2015a 2015b 2015c he ev indicates the magnitude in which eco kinetic energy per individual see eq 1 above increases at the inter taxocene scale per each unit in which ke increases in the deep evolutionary time that is to say according to obec the theoretically expected exp value of bmr could be assessed either as 5 b m r exp k e a m 0 75 or as 6 b m r exp k e a m h e e v the only unknown parameter in eqs 5 and 6 is a plausible value of kea the intensive nature of hp and ie the extensive nature of mass mep and therefore the biomass dependent expansive nature of evolutionary process has been stablished in section 3 1 4 besides at the very beginning of adaptive radiations either in mammals or in any other kind of taxocene the evolutionary clocks of hp and ie 2 at the intra taxocene scale are set to zero i e species number 1 so hp 0 and ie 2 0 too because the few original organisms of the founding species have not had time to conquer a large area but the biomass dependent extensive nature of evolutionary process and its net cumulative effect across adaptive radiations starting from r strategist founding species to k strategist climaxing species means that the evolutionary clock of body mass mep in eq 1 and m in eq 3 can never be set to zero the hypothetical ancestor a of all the current placental mammals most of the species included in spreadsheet mammals bmr appendix a online weighed between 0 006 kg and 0 245 kg o leary et al 2013 therefore it had a body weight median of 0 006 0 245 2 0 1255 kg however according to obec this ancestor must have been a sort of giant species in a relative way to the rest of species of its taxocene because it must have belonged to a degenerate ecological state see rodríguez et al 2015d figs 6d 6e 6f 7 and 8 and comments about them with a level of eco kinetic energy per individual eq 1 of tenfold the energy level of the general ecological background occupied by the remaining species of its taxocene so a suitable assessment of the mean body weight per individual of the primitive taxocene to which a belonged is 0 006 0 245 2 1 10 0 01255 kg this body weight is approximated in between the mean body weight of tropical rocky shore snails mep 0 0011 kg with ke 1 38064852e 00 je nat individual and coral reef fishes mep 0 042044 kg with ke 1 38064852e 02 je nat individual explored by rodríguez et al 2013a as a result a plausible value of the ecological equivalent of boltszman s constant for the taxocene that was the evolutionary cradle of a could be kea 1 38064852e 01 je nat individual thus eqs 5 and 6 become respectively 7 b m r exp 13 8064852 j e nat individual m k g 0 75 8 b m r exp 13 8064852 j e nat individual m kg 0 662607004 j e j e nat individual there is a positive and highly significant correlation between the log10 basal rate of metabolism observed by mcnab 2008 and the log10 basal rate of metabolism expected either from eq 7 or from eq 8 see fig 3a and b respectively in addition there is no significant difference between the mean values of the aforementioned parameters fig 3c this result is very important due to its analytical meaning 1 it reinforces the usefulness of hp mep and ie as ecological df 2 the statistical equivalence of means in fig 3c indicates that the replacement of v expressed in m s in eq 2 by ie expressed in đ in eq 1 does not produce a significant change between the resulting derivate unit of expressions of energy in both equations in other words je and j are two units quite equivalent to each other in such a way that trophic energy and eco kinetic energy as well 3 it seems that by means of the theoretical framework of obec is possible to assess a non empirical and ante hoc value of a in eq 3 an unprecedented result so far 4 the noticeable similarity between the allometric exponent ⅔ and the evolutionary equivalent of planck constant 2 2 he ev was empirically assessed by means of a different methodology and it is based on a different theoretical framework in comparison with hypotheses i ii and iii exposed in the fourth paragraph of this section highlights the paradoxical possibility of the emergence of similar indicators despite they are seemingly disconnected from each other so this paradox could be explained either as a typical case of statistical spuriousness due to an implicitly omitted variable bias from the theoretical point of view demaris 2004 p 98 100 and or because the influence of he ev is so pervasive that it spontaneously arises even when the model under development see hypotheses i ii and iii above does not include any previous theoretical notion of its objective existence fig 3c indicates that an allometric exponent of 0 75 yields a better one but not significantly different adjustment between expected and observed data than he ev however he ev has several advantages in comparison with 0 75 that is to say it is very frequent in many other approaches to this issue even for non mammalian species see white 2011 p 348 table 1 it is supported by a theoretical framework obec it is also possible that the measurements of metabolic rate either at rest or under active conditions need to increase their accuracy level including other collateral indicators besides body mass values see white and seymour 2005 white 2011 and taking into account the result commented in item 3 of this paragraph 3 1 6 a sixth suitable trait of mep ie and h as df their potentiality to support approaches linking society and nature by means of a commonly shared analytical framework the lack of a theoretical and methodological framework commonly shared by social sciences and natural sciences is one of the most frequently neglected topics in the study of the human impact on nature despite commendable heterodox efforts in this field e g costanza 1996 jacobs 2000 economics and ecology remain conventionally seen as two immiscible substances from the analytical point of view the former of them is based on neoclassical theory meanwhile the latter one is based on a diffuse analytical cloud of ephemeral and or contingent approaches lawton 1999 p 178 scheiner 2013 included as a whole under the economic term externalities hence there is a lack of equivalence between impact indicators nature also impacts on society despite ecologists are in general more interested in the opposite direction of this interaction and a better correspondence of analytical tools between these two disciplines would be suitable the set of df analyzed in this paper can offer a plausible approach in order to get better the above mentioned condition by means of a connection between social science and ecology throughout physics as it has been previously commented there is an equivalence of meaning between occupations in society and species or ecological niches in ecosystems in fact the diversity of socioeconomic functions let us call it hs to differentiate it from the ecological context has been proposed as a reliable economic indicator e g marcuzzy and camuffo 1968 hackbart and anderson 1975 matutinovic 2001 frenken 2007 additionally the calculation of ie has no analytical or methodological restrictions to be applied to society let us call it is to distinguish it from the ecological context being in this context a good indicator of the talandic temperature see comments about this concept in section 3 1 of socioeconomic systems as it is expected according to our hypothetical premise in regard to the validity of ecological df also in economics the value of total socioeconomic diversity for the united states of america hst see fig 4 collapsed just after 2008 wall street meltdown and its subsequent expansion to the rest of the world mainly after october 2008 hst abruptly decline along 2009 and hits bottom in the period between 2010 and 2011 later on hst increased its value from 2011 to 2016 fig 4 also shows that according to the above mentioned anti kinetic and therefore anti thermic influence of h the value of is deploys just the opposite behavior in comparison with hst i e the internal talandic temperature of economic systems has an opposite behavior in comparison with socio diversity in fact the noticeable positive slope of is in the short stage between 2005 and 2007 supports the idea that the economy of u s a was in a process of overheating even before the economic crisis every dissipative system is able to keep a high level of order or low internal entropy high hst and low is in this case only by pumping entropy to its surroundings each technology always creates a temporary island of order at the expense of greater disorder in the surroundings rifkin 1980 p 123 the increase of atmospheric temperature is the main expected result of this process of pumping entropy to the outside negentropy for the sake of accumulating information inside society consequently the opposite association between the five year lowess smooth surface air temperature averaged over the contiguous 48 united states relative to the 1951 1980 mean t c and is in fig 4 is quite clear however even taking into account this evident association the suspicion of the underlying influence of a spurious correlation cannot be ruled out without the introduction of additional variables thus the suspicion of spurious correlation can be suppressed if we introduce a third anthropogenic indicator directly connected to climate warming the mean volume of greenhouse gas emissions due to transportation in the u s a between 2005 and 2016 was 26 748 of total emissions see appendix a spreadsheet economics cell g16 only surpassed by the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation 31 823 of total greenhouse gas emissions electricity generation is geographically concentrated in certain points but transportation activity is spread all over the country linked to every kind of human activity associated to a huge amount and variety of industrial waste as well as to the high capability of asphalt surfaces for transforming the incident solar radiation into heat in addition there is reliable evidence that aircraft produced contrail cirrus clouds contribute to anthropogenic climate change minnis et al 2004 burkhardt and kärcher 2011 kärcher 2018 even in a notoriously sudden way travis et al 2002 thus the impact of greenhouse gas emissions due to transportation could be regarded as more harmful than the impact of electricity production the cubic polynomial fitted values of greenhouse gas emissions by transportation expressed as a percentage of total emissions in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents gh t e total in fig 4 follow a trajectory that coincides quite well r 0 917 p 2 77e 05 with t c even the correlation between t c and the original non adjusted values of gh t e total is high and significant see appendix a spreadsheet economics cell e20 r 0 805 p 1 576e 3 this result supports the consistency of the above mentioned relationships between hst is and t c and vice versa so a very deep and long lasting economic crisis would be good news to reduce global warming the most important outcome from fig 4 is that the combination of df analyzed in this article can establish a fruitful analytical bridge based on a reliable equivalence of meaning between ecological df and economic df 3 3 the amount of exosomatic biomass handled by man has been omitted due to the methodological difficulties associated to its exact measurement per u s state the complete analytical landscape is that the current combination of i intense economic competition between countries ii high rates of technological development and economic growth i e hst 3 732 nat individual 4 4 the highest value of total socio diversity assessed for the u s in 2008 see cell b7 in spreadsheet economics appendix a at the world scale iii increasing scarcity of raw materials to sustain an ever increasing human population anyone who believes exponential economic growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist kenneth e boulding 1966 cited by cairns 2004 is not sustainable for a long time the key point is that meanwhile all the living systems on earth are open systems the global village in which we are living nowadays is not and has never been an open system from the socioeconomic point of view it develops under a paradoxical regime of enclosed degrees of freedom the main result is a conflict at a so large scale that it often overcomes the encompassing capability of our scientific view generally biased in favor of dissecting analysis rather than in favor of holistic synthesis the essentially far from equilibrium i e far from the walrasian balance between supply and demand and open nature i e different to the closed economic circuit between households and firms with the intermediation of the markets of goods and factors supported by neoclassical economics of economic systems has been recently stated as an inescapable requirement to keep a healthy functioning of economic dynamics according to the information theory of intrinsic value rodríguez and cáceres hernández 2018 this new theory of economic value unifies the two main previous theories so far in a reliable and self evident way based on the principles of thermodynamics thus in a similar way in which the european exploration expeditions from the second half of the 15th century until the beginning of the 17th century could be considered as a way to open a closed and declining medieval europe the future exoplanetary expeditions could be regarded as an emergency solution to open our global village from the socioeconomic point of view the most worrisome issue is that these kind of events although seemingly depend on our will are influenced by a so complex combination of circumstances that they seem to have their own objective internal dynamics they either will take place in the most suitable moment or they will not take place ever and then our species will vanish self consumed by its socioeconomic voracity 4 concluding remarks in summary the results of our analysis show either due to the easily understandable logic of its theoretical foundations or due to its empirical support that the dilemma physics vs non physics in ecosystem ecology is nonsense it is unavoidable to recover and develop the lost connection between the early stage of classical ecosystem ecology and several branches of physics astonishingly as it has been exposed in section 2 2 the lack of understanding in ecology of a so simple concept as that of physical equilibrium has delayed the development of this field over five decades in addition it is probable that any research work that either directly or indirectly neglects the analytical influence of the triad of ecological df here proposed will arrive to contingent conclusions finally these df and their alternative combinations can have a key role to establish a commonly shared language between ecology and economics a goal that is more and more imperative to reach in order to overcome the variety of urgent environmental challenges impinging on

25153,algal blooms have been a serious problem in the tributary bays of the three gorges reservoir tgr and hydrodynamic changes have been widely accepted as targets to control these algal blooms to study the influence of the impounding process during the flood season on algal blooms in xiangxi bay xxb monitoring of xxb was conducted from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 based on a laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 of xxb this study analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in flow water temperature chlorophyll a chl a during the impounding process the results showed that during the impounding process the total chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb sa decreased obviously compared with that on july 1 the chl a concentration increased with the increase in water temperature stratification the variation in the depth of the plunge point of the density current was consistent with the variation in the sa the depth of the plunge point decreased gradually and the water temperature stratification was consequently weakened the ce qual w2 model is suitable for water quality forecasts in xxb and could play an important role in the ecological reservoir operation keywords chlorophyll a water temperature stratification density currents ce qual w2 xiangxi bay xxb 1 introduction since the initial filling of the three gorges reservoir tgr in june 2003 substantial changes have occurred to the hydrodynamics of the tributary bays under the influence of the backwater of the mainstream for example the flow velocity decreased the turbulent mixing weakened water pollution became much more severer and algal blooms began to occur every year liu et al 2016 the dominant species of algae gradually changed from river types dinoflagellate and diatom during the initial impoundment period to lake types cyanobacteria and green algae tian et al 2014 dinoflagellate blooms before 2007 tang et al 2006 and cyanobacteria blooms after 2007 posed a great danger to the environment the microcystis aeruginosa bloom in the gaolan river which is a tributary of the xiangxi river in 2008 was the most severest of these events wang et al 2009 this bloom lasted approximately one month and the maximum surface chlorophyll a chl a concentration reached 1267 2 mg m 3 yang et al 2010a meanwhile cyanobacteria blooms almost completely covered the xiangxi river and this was the first large scale cyanobacteria bloom in the xiangxi river after the first impoundment of the tgr yang et al 2014 cyanobacteria blooms can release algae toxins which can cause drinking water pollution threatening the health of people and thus have attracted wide attention dokulil and teubner 2000 in addition microcystins play an important role in the succession of algae hu et al 2008 and can inhibit the growth of some algae such as synechococcus elongatus hu and liu 2005 at present the seasonal succession of algal blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr is obvious and diatom and dinoflagellate are dominant in spring green algae and cyanobacteria are dominant in summer green algae diatom and dinoflagellate are dominant in autumn diatom and dinoflagellate are dominant in winter ministry of environmental protection of china 2012 in late june of 2017 there were severe green algae pandorina blooms downstream of the xiangxi river fig 1 a and dinoflagellate ceratium blooms upstream of the xiangxi river fig 1b the main sources of pollution in the tgr are the reservoir area and its upstream watershed ran et al 2009 the mainstream serves as the nutrient source for the tributary bays chen et al 2013 ji et al 2010b the control of the sources is considered a long term plan because of the large watershed areas and the contradiction between development and emissions fu et al 2010 some physical methods shen et al 2004 chemical methods lan et al 1992 and biological methods liu and xie 2002 are not able to effectively control algal blooms for long periods as a result of the narrow scopes of application high costs implementation difficulties and uncertainty of the negative effects field mesocosm experiments have also shown that biomanipulation was not suitable for algae control in the tgr zhou et al 2011 recent studies have shown that changes in hydrodynamics are the main reason for algal blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr li et al 2005 2007 wang et al 2012 yang 2014 the reservoir ecological operation which can change hydrodynamics via impounding and discharging processes can control algal blooms the reservoir ecological operation considers the traditional benefits of the tgr including flood control power generation navigation and water supply changes the hydrological conditions to influence the habitat factors by regulating the flow and finally controls algal blooms cai 2011 dong et al 2007 the reservoir ecological operation has a wide area of impact and a quick response and it is an in situ measurement with low ecological risk it is likely that the reservoir ecological operation would be an effective method for algae control in the tributary bays of the tgr yang et al 2015 yang et al 2010b analyzed the influence of the tgr impounding process on water eutrophication in xiangxi bay xxb based on monitoring data from 2008 and found that the impounding process enhanced the water exchange between the mainstream and xxb weakened water temperature stratification increased suspended silt and finally decreased the chl a concentration the plunge points of density currents moved upwards gradually during the impounding process finally the velocity of the surface flow was accelerated by density currents which may have transported algae out of the tributary bay and thus reduced the algae biomass ji et al 2010a xu et al 2010 compared the water flow and water quality under different operation schemes of the tgr by establishing a nonflood season ecological operation model based on the daily regulation process and verified the algae control effectiveness of the operation algal bloom occurrences are closely tied to the daily fluctuation of the water level zheng et al 2011 and peak load operations and water level fluctuations could improve the water quality in tributaries ma and lian 2011 in addition short term impoundment of the tgr could lift the plunge points of density currents interrupt water temperature stratification and increase the mixing depth finally causing a dramatic decrease in the chl a level liu et al 2012a li et al 2012 analyzed the monitoring indexes of the yangtze river and xxb during the impounding and discharging processes and found that the discharging process did not limit algal growth however during the impounding process the ratio of euphotic depth to mixing depth decreased to approximately 0 2 and played an important role in algae control continuously increasing the water level could cause the intruding density currents to shift reduce the surface water temperature and break the stable stratification of the tributary yang et al 2013 the fluctuation of the water level caused by flood regulation destroys the algae habitat inhibits and delays the formation of algal blooms peng et al 2014 xxb is a deep riverine backwater bay and the density currents caused by the water temperature and suspended silt differences between the mainstream and xxb exist for long periods moreover water temperature stratification is obvious in xxb yi et al 2009 the development of water temperature stratification directly influences the seasonal variation in algal blooms a sufficiently large water level fluctuation in the tgr can disrupt the seasonal water temperature stratification in xxb by changing the plunge points of density currents influence the vertical light and heat conditions cause the succession of the phytoplankton communities and finally control algal blooms liu et al 2012b tian et al 2014 yang et al 2012 analyzing the influence of water level fluctuations on algal blooms is key for the effective implementation of the reservoir ecological operation and is essential to algae control a conceptual diagram of this study is shown in fig 2 based on field data from xxb from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 this study analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in flow water temperature and chl a during the impounding process by establishing a laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 thus the objectives of this study are as follows 1 establish a reasonable model for simulating the hydrodynamic and water quality processes in xxb 2 reveal the influence of the impounding process during the flood season on algal blooms 3 provide technical support for solving the water eutrophication problem by using the ecological operation of the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the xiangxi river is the largest tributary of the tgr in hubei province and the closest tributary to the three gorges dam and the river has a watershed area of 3095 km2 a length of 94 km and an annual average flow of 47 4 m3 s 1 the xiangxi river is located between jingshan and wushan mountains 110 25 111 06 e 30 57 31 34 n and in the northwest of hubei province fig 3 the river has three major tributaries the nanyang river gufu river and gaolan river after the initial filling of the tgr in june 2003 to a water level of 135 m a backwater zone was formed in the xiangxi river which was called xxb when the tgr was filled to the normal water level of 175 m in october 2010 xxb extended to 40 km based on the xxb field station over the range of 32 km backwater area from the xxb estuary to the backwater terminus sampling sites are laid at 3 km intervals along the stream centerline for ecological monitoring the sites are named xx00 xx10 with numbering beginning at the estuary in addition there is a site called cjxx in the mainstream which is at the confluence of the mainstream and xxb thus there are a total of 12 sampling sites fig 3c xx10 is in the fluctuating backwater area and monitoring cannot be carried out when the water level is below 156 m the monitoring was carried out daily in xxb from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 2 2 hydrodynamic and water quality model 2 2 1 model description and application ce qual w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model that was codeveloped by the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station and portland state university cole and wells 2013 the model was constructed to simulate relatively long and narrow water bodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients the model is appropriate for stratified water systems and has been successfully applied to lakes reservoirs and estuaries afshar et al 2013 berger and wells 2008 bowen and hieronymus 2003 choi et al 2007 kuo et al 2006 lee and foster 2013 ma et al 2015 park et al 2014 shourian et al 2016 wells et al 2012 ce qual w2 was solved by the finite difference solution of laterally averaged equations of fluid motion including the x and z momentum equations the continuity equation the equation of state the free surface equation and the advective diffusion equation in this study ce qual w2 was used to simulate xxb because the lateral variations in velocity and water temperature are nonsignificant in xxb yang et al 2010b the computational grid was developed based on bathymetric and geometric data with 500 m in length and 1 m in thickness xxb was represented by 64 longitudinal segments and 99 vertical layers fig 4 the widths of the model ranged from 10 m to 1300 m good agreement between the observed and simulated storage water elevation curves confirmed the accuracy of the bathymetry data the simulation period for xxb was from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 the upstream inflows and three hourly meteorological data including air temperature dew point temperature wind speed and direction and cloud cover or total incident solar radiation were obtained from the hydrological station at xingshan fig 3c which is located approximately 36 km from the tgr mainstream field data on the elevation of the water surface were obtained from the china three gorges corporation http www ctg com cn water temperature profiles of the mainstream were measured daily using a multiprobe sensor hydrolab ds 5x the upstream boundary conditions for the model include the measured daily inflow discharge water temperature fig 5 and nutrients the downstream boundary conditions include daily water levels the measured water temperature and nutrients the water level wl and daily fluctuation of the water level dfwl from june 18 to july 18 2017 were considered in this study fig 6 before july 1 the wl was approximately 145 m and the impoundment began on july 2 and continued to july 10 when the wl was 157 05 m for a total of 9 days the dfwl on july 3 was 2 69 m which was the highest throughout the study period during the impounding process the average dfwl was 1 30 m after july 10 the wl decreased to 153 21 m 2 2 2 model calibration the choice of good parameters is the key to achieving the accuracy of a numerical model model calibration is the process of estimating model parameters by comparing the simulated data with the observed data many factors influence the characteristics of water flow and the structure of water temperature including meteorological conditions inflow outflow and the geometry of reservoirs among the main parameters of the ce qual w2 model the wind sheltering coefficient wsc is used to adjust the wind speeds taken at a given meteorological station to those at the reservoir surface longitudinal eddy viscosity ax manning s roughness coefficient mann and the wsc influence the hydrodynamics directly and then influence the transport of heat and contaminants solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta and extinction coefficient for pure water exh2o influence the water temperature directly and then influence the hydrodynamics water temperature is not sensitive to ax or longitudinal eddy diffusivity dx li et al 2011 therefore the default value of 1 m2 s 1 is used for both ax and dx wsc mann beta and exh2o have great influences on water temperature and velocity so these parameters need to be calibrated more parameters that influence water quality indexes than hydrodynamic indexes maximum algal growth ag maximum algal respiration rate ar maximum algal mortality rate am and algal settling rate as have great influences on chl a ag ar and am influence the propagation respiration consumption and metabolic rate respectively whereas as directly influences the vertical distribution of algae cui 2017 thus these four parameters are the main parameters for chl a calibration in addition the light saturation intensity at the maximum photosynthetic rate asat and algal temperature rate coefficients at1 lower temperature for algal growth at2 lower temperature for maximum algal growth at3 upper temperature for maximum algal growth at4 upper temperature for algal growth which determine the effects of water temperature on algal rates were calibrated during the monitoring period dinoflagellate and green algae were the dominant algae in xxb and water quality calibration mainly considers these two algae the goodness of fit and errors between the observed and simulated data were quantitatively evaluated using statistical indexes including the absolute mean error ame and the root mean square error rmse cole and wells 2013 deus et al 2013 lindim et al 2011 liu and chen 2013 the formulations are presented as follows 1 a m e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i n 2 r m s e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i 2 n where n is the number of observations xobs i is the value of the i th observation of index x and xmodel i is the predicted value of i th observation of index x the accuracy of the simulation is high when the values of ame and rmse are close to 0 the calibrated hydrodynamic parameters and water quality parameters are presented in appendix a tables a1 and a2 respectively this study selected xx01 downstream xx05 middle reach and xx08 upstream as the typical sampling sites for calibration and compared the simulated data with the observed data from july 2 july 5 and july 8 2017 for calibration of water temperature and flow field the simulated data accurately represented the observed vertical distribution of water temperature in xxb spatially xx01 and xx05 were simulated well however the results for xx01 were better than the results of xx05 as the ame and rmse of xx01were both less than 0 5 c there was a certain difference between the simulated data and the observed data for xx08 on july 2 and july 5 the ame values were 1 506 c and 0 705 c and the rmse values were 1 777 c and 0 842 c on july 2 and july 5 respectively however the variation trend was consistent fig 7 the calibration results for xx08 may be affected by the operation of the gudongkou cascade reservoirs and the large average daily changes in inflow water temperature overall the accuracy of the simulation increased upstream the calibration results of the flow field on july 2 july 5 and july 8 2017 are shown in fig 8 there was little difference between the simulated data and the observed data and the continuity of the spatial distribution of the simulated data was better than that of the observed data because there was an abundance of external disturbance in the actual conditions upstream underflow occurred upstream of xxb as a result of the low temperature inflow on july 2 the mainstream plunged into xxb from 10 m to 50 m on july 5 from 5 m to 55 m and on july 8 from 5 m to 60 m with the development of the impounding process the plunge point was uplifted and the thickness of the intrusion layer increased significantly whereas there was little change in the travel distance for the calibration of water quality this study compared the simulated data with the observed data from july 1 to july 6 2017 because the impoundment intensity was greater during this period the dfwls during this period were all greater than 1 m whereas the dfwls from july 7 to july 10 were always less than 1 m except for on july 8 the isograms of the chl a concentration in xxb from july 1 to july 6 fig 9 indicate that the simulation results accurately indicated the actual conditions and the variation in the simulated data was temporally similar to that in the observed data there was a sharp decrease in the chl a concentration from july 1 to july 2 and the chl a concentration in xxb gradually deceased xx05 was selected as a typical site to show the calibration results of the surface chl a concentration appendix a fig a1 and the variation trend in the simulated data was almost the same as that in the observed data moreover the simulated values were very close to the observed data overall the simulation results can spatially and temporally reflect the variation in the chl a concentration in xxb 2 2 3 data analysis based on the simulated chl a concentration a calculation method was developed to quantify the algae control effect the formulations are presented as follows 3 v i l h l w l l 4 a i c i v i 5 s a j 1 m i 1 n a i where i is the number of layers in the euphotic zone of the segment j is the number of segments vi is the water volume of the ith layer l h is the layer height l w is the layer width and l l is the layer length ai is the amount of chl a in the ith layer c i is the chl a concentration of the ith layer sa is the total amount of chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb 3 results 3 1 algae control effect in xxb during the impounding process compared with the sa on july 1 the sa decreased by different amount during the impounding process and sa was lowest on july 3 the sa on july 3 decreased by 73 57 compared with the sa on july 1 and the sa on july 6 decreased by 53 60 compared with the sa on july 1 table 1 the vertically maximum chl a concentration c max values of the different sites in xxb on july 1 july 3 and july 6 fig 10 were selected to show the algae control effect during the impounding process on july 1 c max was high especially in the upstream of xxb and reached 245 5 mg m 3 while on july 3 and july 6 c max was less than 50 mg m 3 in xxb during the impounding process c max varied obviously in xxb and was less than that on july 1 thus algal blooms were effectively controlled 3 2 characteristics of water temperature stratification and its influence on algal blooms the water temperature stratification in xxb was obvious on july 1 and strengthened further downstream fig 11 a however after the impoundment on july 3 the water temperature stratification in the downstream and middle reaches was weaker than that on july 1 fig 11b on july 6 water temperature stratification was shallower throughout almost the whole bay except in the area close to the estuary where the depth of water temperature stratification increased compared with that on july 3 fig 11c with the development of the impounding process the area where water temperature stratification existed gradually extended further downstream on july 1 there was no water temperature stratification around xx09 the upstream inflow reached xx09 and then flowed into xxb which was why the chl a concentration around xx09 on july 1 was lower than that in the other areas in xxb however on july 3 and july 6 the water temperature stratification area extended to xx09 and the upstream areas which made the location of upstream inflow into xxb move upstream moreover the plunge point of the upstream inflow was deepened finally the upstream inflow moved along the riverbed compared with that on july 1 the water temperature stratification in the upstream areas decreased gradually during the impounding process which was the reason why the chl a concentration in the upstream decreased obviously after the impoundment in addition the chl a concentration in the area close to the estuary increased slightly on july 6 compared with that on july 1 and july 3 fig 10 because the water temperature stratification in the area close to the estuary was strengthened on july 6 compared with that on july 1 and july 3 3 3 characteristics of density currents and their influence on water temperature stratification the parameters related to density currents during the impounding process are shown in table 2 with the development of the impounding process the density currents gradually traveled further the depth of the plunge point decreased to a minimum value of 2 67 m on july 3 increased gradually to 3 38 m on july 5 and then decreased sharply to 2 71 m on july 6 the water exchange between the mainstream and xxb appeared as interflow intrusion and overflow intrusion during the impounding process the variation in the depth of the plunge point was consistent with the variation in the sa table 1 on july 1 the density currents traveled 27 5 km which is exactly the distance between xx08 and xx09 thus the upstream inflow could flow into xxb around xx09 without the backwater effect in addition density currents flowed in the middle layer from the downstream to the upstream of xxb fig 12 a thus the water temperature stratification in the surface layer was not impacted fig 11a as the depth of the plunge point decreased on july 3 the water temperature stratification was greatly influenced by the density currents and was weakened fig 11b the density currents traveled further on july 3 than on july 1 fig 12b on july 6 the depth of the upper boundary of the density currents in the downstream was slightly lower than that on july 1 and july 3 fig 12c thus water temperature stratification in the downstream increased slightly and density currents flowed at the surface in the upstream where water temperature stratification greatly decreased fig 11c the variation in the upstream underflow was related to the intrusion flow from the mainstream as the depth of the plunge point of the density currents increased the plunge point of the upstream inflow deepened and the upstream inflow was forced to flow into xxb in the bottom layer meanwhile as the travel distance of density currents increased the location where the upstream inflow flowed into xxb moved upstream 4 discussion from july 1 2017 to july 6 2017 the total nitrogen concentration tn and the total phosphorus concentration tp in the mainstream and xxb were all greater than the eutrophication threshold tn 0 2 mg l 1 tp 0 02 mg l 1 thomann and mueller 1987 thus the outbreak and extinction of algal blooms had little to do with the nutrients during the impounding process after the initial filling of the tgr the mainstream still had a one dimensional flow pattern from the upstream to the downstream in front of the dam li et al 2002 ji et al 2012 the average flow velocity decreased from 2 m s 1 to 0 17 m s 1 zhang et al 2005 and the turbulent mixing was strong li et al 2002 water in some tributary bays flowed slowly and the flow velocity was mostly less than 0 05 m s 1 under the influence of the backwater li et al 2007 which promoted the deposition of suspended solids increased water transparency and gradually formed a stable environment under these conditions the high water temperature gradients fig 11a indicated stable water temperature stratification gao and wang 2016 water temperature stratification weakened the vertical mixing of water in different layers zhao and han 2005 thus the algae could remain suspended in the euphotic zone and grow rapidly meanwhile this water temperature stratification would make the bottom water anoxic and promote the release of nutrients from the sediment finally causing algal blooms jones and poplawski 1998 in addition water temperature stratification could promote the formation of cyanobacteria blooms cyanobacteria has a strong ability to resist high water temperatures and strong light and can adapt to the increase in water temperature in the upper layer which was caused by water temperature stratification moreover cyanobacteria can remain suspended to obtain nutrients from deep layers eloff et al 1976 pearl and huisman 2008 although cyanobacteria was not the dominant algae during the monitoring period there were cyanobacteria blooms in xxb in the last few years cui et al 2016 especially in summer tian et al 2012 which have received considerable attention the stronger the water temperature stratification was the greater the risk of algal blooms would be yang et al 2012 during the impounding process the flow velocity in xxb was approximately 0 1 m s 1 0 2 m s 1 which was greater than that in other periods moreover the density currents were obvious and the mainstream intruded into xxb from the middle and surface layers fig 12 on the one hand density currents could carry algae in the downstream to the backwater terminus which could supply chl a moreover the density currents gradually traveled further and surpassed xx09 during the impounding process fig 12 which was the reason why serious algal blooms existed in the upstream of the river at the end of the impounding process on the other hand the chl a concentration in cjxx was less than 5 mg m 3 and the mainstream was oligotrophic zheng et al 2006 the low chl a concentration water in the mainstream could dilute the high chl a concentration water in xxb and the dilution effect was greater closer to the estuary when the dilution effect was greater than algal growth the chl a concentration would decrease yang et al 2010b the impounding process could change the characteristics of density currents especially when the depth of the plunge point was changed and these changes could greatly influence the chl a concentration in xxb the intrusion of the mainstream could weaken water temperature stratification in xxb li et al 2012 and destroy the stable environment suitable for algal growth especially when the wl quickly increased then strengthen the vertical movement of algae thus reducing the time when algae were exposed to light decreasing the rate of photosynthesis and finally controlling algal growth xiong et al 2013 especially downstream the upstream underflow made the sinking algae flow out of xxb along the riverbed the algae control mechanism of the impounding process was of vital importance for the implementation of the ecological operation of the tgr the above analysis indicated that the key to this process was the destruction of water temperature stratification the response of the chl a concentration in xxb to the impounding process indicated good potential for controlling algal blooms by appropriately designing the dfwl of the tgr high dfwl scenarios during the impounding process might be effective and feasible the ecological operation rules for algae control through water management in the tgr could then be investigated by designing different dfwl scenarios not only during the flood season but also during other periods of the year 5 conclusions the laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model of xxb based on ce qual w2 was able to adequately simulate algal blooms during the impounding process in the flood season and the simulation results could accurately illustrate the spatial and temporal distributions of flow water temperature and chl a the ce qual w2 model performed well in water quality forecasts in xxb and could play an important role in the ecological reservoir operation during the impounding process the total chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb decreased and the chl a concentration was less than 50 mg m 3 in xxb finally the variation in the chl a concentration in xxb was closely related to water temperature stratification the stronger the water temperature stratification was the greater the chl a concentration would be the water exchange between the mainstream and xxb appeared as interflow intrusion and overflow intrusion the variation trend in the depth of the plunge point was consistent with the variation in the total chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb density currents greatly influenced water temperature stratification and could control algal blooms by weakening water temperature stratification the low chl a concentration water in the mainstream could dilute the high chl a concentration water in xxb and the dilution effect was greater closer to the estuary density currents could carry the algae in the downstream to the terminal of the backwater zone which supplied chl a concentration to the upstream areas thus the impounding process provided a possible means for algae control in the tgr furthermore ecological operation rules could be investigated by designing different dfwl scenarios according to the hydrodynamic and water quality conditions in different periods of the year acknowledgements this

25153,algal blooms have been a serious problem in the tributary bays of the three gorges reservoir tgr and hydrodynamic changes have been widely accepted as targets to control these algal blooms to study the influence of the impounding process during the flood season on algal blooms in xiangxi bay xxb monitoring of xxb was conducted from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 based on a laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 of xxb this study analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in flow water temperature chlorophyll a chl a during the impounding process the results showed that during the impounding process the total chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb sa decreased obviously compared with that on july 1 the chl a concentration increased with the increase in water temperature stratification the variation in the depth of the plunge point of the density current was consistent with the variation in the sa the depth of the plunge point decreased gradually and the water temperature stratification was consequently weakened the ce qual w2 model is suitable for water quality forecasts in xxb and could play an important role in the ecological reservoir operation keywords chlorophyll a water temperature stratification density currents ce qual w2 xiangxi bay xxb 1 introduction since the initial filling of the three gorges reservoir tgr in june 2003 substantial changes have occurred to the hydrodynamics of the tributary bays under the influence of the backwater of the mainstream for example the flow velocity decreased the turbulent mixing weakened water pollution became much more severer and algal blooms began to occur every year liu et al 2016 the dominant species of algae gradually changed from river types dinoflagellate and diatom during the initial impoundment period to lake types cyanobacteria and green algae tian et al 2014 dinoflagellate blooms before 2007 tang et al 2006 and cyanobacteria blooms after 2007 posed a great danger to the environment the microcystis aeruginosa bloom in the gaolan river which is a tributary of the xiangxi river in 2008 was the most severest of these events wang et al 2009 this bloom lasted approximately one month and the maximum surface chlorophyll a chl a concentration reached 1267 2 mg m 3 yang et al 2010a meanwhile cyanobacteria blooms almost completely covered the xiangxi river and this was the first large scale cyanobacteria bloom in the xiangxi river after the first impoundment of the tgr yang et al 2014 cyanobacteria blooms can release algae toxins which can cause drinking water pollution threatening the health of people and thus have attracted wide attention dokulil and teubner 2000 in addition microcystins play an important role in the succession of algae hu et al 2008 and can inhibit the growth of some algae such as synechococcus elongatus hu and liu 2005 at present the seasonal succession of algal blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr is obvious and diatom and dinoflagellate are dominant in spring green algae and cyanobacteria are dominant in summer green algae diatom and dinoflagellate are dominant in autumn diatom and dinoflagellate are dominant in winter ministry of environmental protection of china 2012 in late june of 2017 there were severe green algae pandorina blooms downstream of the xiangxi river fig 1 a and dinoflagellate ceratium blooms upstream of the xiangxi river fig 1b the main sources of pollution in the tgr are the reservoir area and its upstream watershed ran et al 2009 the mainstream serves as the nutrient source for the tributary bays chen et al 2013 ji et al 2010b the control of the sources is considered a long term plan because of the large watershed areas and the contradiction between development and emissions fu et al 2010 some physical methods shen et al 2004 chemical methods lan et al 1992 and biological methods liu and xie 2002 are not able to effectively control algal blooms for long periods as a result of the narrow scopes of application high costs implementation difficulties and uncertainty of the negative effects field mesocosm experiments have also shown that biomanipulation was not suitable for algae control in the tgr zhou et al 2011 recent studies have shown that changes in hydrodynamics are the main reason for algal blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr li et al 2005 2007 wang et al 2012 yang 2014 the reservoir ecological operation which can change hydrodynamics via impounding and discharging processes can control algal blooms the reservoir ecological operation considers the traditional benefits of the tgr including flood control power generation navigation and water supply changes the hydrological conditions to influence the habitat factors by regulating the flow and finally controls algal blooms cai 2011 dong et al 2007 the reservoir ecological operation has a wide area of impact and a quick response and it is an in situ measurement with low ecological risk it is likely that the reservoir ecological operation would be an effective method for algae control in the tributary bays of the tgr yang et al 2015 yang et al 2010b analyzed the influence of the tgr impounding process on water eutrophication in xiangxi bay xxb based on monitoring data from 2008 and found that the impounding process enhanced the water exchange between the mainstream and xxb weakened water temperature stratification increased suspended silt and finally decreased the chl a concentration the plunge points of density currents moved upwards gradually during the impounding process finally the velocity of the surface flow was accelerated by density currents which may have transported algae out of the tributary bay and thus reduced the algae biomass ji et al 2010a xu et al 2010 compared the water flow and water quality under different operation schemes of the tgr by establishing a nonflood season ecological operation model based on the daily regulation process and verified the algae control effectiveness of the operation algal bloom occurrences are closely tied to the daily fluctuation of the water level zheng et al 2011 and peak load operations and water level fluctuations could improve the water quality in tributaries ma and lian 2011 in addition short term impoundment of the tgr could lift the plunge points of density currents interrupt water temperature stratification and increase the mixing depth finally causing a dramatic decrease in the chl a level liu et al 2012a li et al 2012 analyzed the monitoring indexes of the yangtze river and xxb during the impounding and discharging processes and found that the discharging process did not limit algal growth however during the impounding process the ratio of euphotic depth to mixing depth decreased to approximately 0 2 and played an important role in algae control continuously increasing the water level could cause the intruding density currents to shift reduce the surface water temperature and break the stable stratification of the tributary yang et al 2013 the fluctuation of the water level caused by flood regulation destroys the algae habitat inhibits and delays the formation of algal blooms peng et al 2014 xxb is a deep riverine backwater bay and the density currents caused by the water temperature and suspended silt differences between the mainstream and xxb exist for long periods moreover water temperature stratification is obvious in xxb yi et al 2009 the development of water temperature stratification directly influences the seasonal variation in algal blooms a sufficiently large water level fluctuation in the tgr can disrupt the seasonal water temperature stratification in xxb by changing the plunge points of density currents influence the vertical light and heat conditions cause the succession of the phytoplankton communities and finally control algal blooms liu et al 2012b tian et al 2014 yang et al 2012 analyzing the influence of water level fluctuations on algal blooms is key for the effective implementation of the reservoir ecological operation and is essential to algae control a conceptual diagram of this study is shown in fig 2 based on field data from xxb from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 this study analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in flow water temperature and chl a during the impounding process by establishing a laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 thus the objectives of this study are as follows 1 establish a reasonable model for simulating the hydrodynamic and water quality processes in xxb 2 reveal the influence of the impounding process during the flood season on algal blooms 3 provide technical support for solving the water eutrophication problem by using the ecological operation of the tgr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the xiangxi river is the largest tributary of the tgr in hubei province and the closest tributary to the three gorges dam and the river has a watershed area of 3095 km2 a length of 94 km and an annual average flow of 47 4 m3 s 1 the xiangxi river is located between jingshan and wushan mountains 110 25 111 06 e 30 57 31 34 n and in the northwest of hubei province fig 3 the river has three major tributaries the nanyang river gufu river and gaolan river after the initial filling of the tgr in june 2003 to a water level of 135 m a backwater zone was formed in the xiangxi river which was called xxb when the tgr was filled to the normal water level of 175 m in october 2010 xxb extended to 40 km based on the xxb field station over the range of 32 km backwater area from the xxb estuary to the backwater terminus sampling sites are laid at 3 km intervals along the stream centerline for ecological monitoring the sites are named xx00 xx10 with numbering beginning at the estuary in addition there is a site called cjxx in the mainstream which is at the confluence of the mainstream and xxb thus there are a total of 12 sampling sites fig 3c xx10 is in the fluctuating backwater area and monitoring cannot be carried out when the water level is below 156 m the monitoring was carried out daily in xxb from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 2 2 hydrodynamic and water quality model 2 2 1 model description and application ce qual w2 is a two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model that was codeveloped by the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station and portland state university cole and wells 2013 the model was constructed to simulate relatively long and narrow water bodies exhibiting longitudinal and vertical water quality gradients the model is appropriate for stratified water systems and has been successfully applied to lakes reservoirs and estuaries afshar et al 2013 berger and wells 2008 bowen and hieronymus 2003 choi et al 2007 kuo et al 2006 lee and foster 2013 ma et al 2015 park et al 2014 shourian et al 2016 wells et al 2012 ce qual w2 was solved by the finite difference solution of laterally averaged equations of fluid motion including the x and z momentum equations the continuity equation the equation of state the free surface equation and the advective diffusion equation in this study ce qual w2 was used to simulate xxb because the lateral variations in velocity and water temperature are nonsignificant in xxb yang et al 2010b the computational grid was developed based on bathymetric and geometric data with 500 m in length and 1 m in thickness xxb was represented by 64 longitudinal segments and 99 vertical layers fig 4 the widths of the model ranged from 10 m to 1300 m good agreement between the observed and simulated storage water elevation curves confirmed the accuracy of the bathymetry data the simulation period for xxb was from june 18 2017 to july 18 2017 the upstream inflows and three hourly meteorological data including air temperature dew point temperature wind speed and direction and cloud cover or total incident solar radiation were obtained from the hydrological station at xingshan fig 3c which is located approximately 36 km from the tgr mainstream field data on the elevation of the water surface were obtained from the china three gorges corporation http www ctg com cn water temperature profiles of the mainstream were measured daily using a multiprobe sensor hydrolab ds 5x the upstream boundary conditions for the model include the measured daily inflow discharge water temperature fig 5 and nutrients the downstream boundary conditions include daily water levels the measured water temperature and nutrients the water level wl and daily fluctuation of the water level dfwl from june 18 to july 18 2017 were considered in this study fig 6 before july 1 the wl was approximately 145 m and the impoundment began on july 2 and continued to july 10 when the wl was 157 05 m for a total of 9 days the dfwl on july 3 was 2 69 m which was the highest throughout the study period during the impounding process the average dfwl was 1 30 m after july 10 the wl decreased to 153 21 m 2 2 2 model calibration the choice of good parameters is the key to achieving the accuracy of a numerical model model calibration is the process of estimating model parameters by comparing the simulated data with the observed data many factors influence the characteristics of water flow and the structure of water temperature including meteorological conditions inflow outflow and the geometry of reservoirs among the main parameters of the ce qual w2 model the wind sheltering coefficient wsc is used to adjust the wind speeds taken at a given meteorological station to those at the reservoir surface longitudinal eddy viscosity ax manning s roughness coefficient mann and the wsc influence the hydrodynamics directly and then influence the transport of heat and contaminants solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer beta and extinction coefficient for pure water exh2o influence the water temperature directly and then influence the hydrodynamics water temperature is not sensitive to ax or longitudinal eddy diffusivity dx li et al 2011 therefore the default value of 1 m2 s 1 is used for both ax and dx wsc mann beta and exh2o have great influences on water temperature and velocity so these parameters need to be calibrated more parameters that influence water quality indexes than hydrodynamic indexes maximum algal growth ag maximum algal respiration rate ar maximum algal mortality rate am and algal settling rate as have great influences on chl a ag ar and am influence the propagation respiration consumption and metabolic rate respectively whereas as directly influences the vertical distribution of algae cui 2017 thus these four parameters are the main parameters for chl a calibration in addition the light saturation intensity at the maximum photosynthetic rate asat and algal temperature rate coefficients at1 lower temperature for algal growth at2 lower temperature for maximum algal growth at3 upper temperature for maximum algal growth at4 upper temperature for algal growth which determine the effects of water temperature on algal rates were calibrated during the monitoring period dinoflagellate and green algae were the dominant algae in xxb and water quality calibration mainly considers these two algae the goodness of fit and errors between the observed and simulated data were quantitatively evaluated using statistical indexes including the absolute mean error ame and the root mean square error rmse cole and wells 2013 deus et al 2013 lindim et al 2011 liu and chen 2013 the formulations are presented as follows 1 a m e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i n 2 r m s e i 1 n x o b s i x m o d e l i 2 n where n is the number of observations xobs i is the value of the i th observation of index x and xmodel i is the predicted value of i th observation of index x the accuracy of the simulation is high when the values of ame and rmse are close to 0 the calibrated hydrodynamic parameters and water quality parameters are presented in appendix a tables a1 and a2 respectively this study selected xx01 downstream xx05 middle reach and xx08 upstream as the typical sampling sites for calibration and compared the simulated data with the observed data from july 2 july 5 and july 8 2017 for calibration of water temperature and flow field the simulated data accurately represented the observed vertical distribution of water temperature in xxb spatially xx01 and xx05 were simulated well however the results for xx01 were better than the results of xx05 as the ame and rmse of xx01were both less than 0 5 c there was a certain difference between the simulated data and the observed data for xx08 on july 2 and july 5 the ame values were 1 506 c and 0 705 c and the rmse values were 1 777 c and 0 842 c on july 2 and july 5 respectively however the variation trend was consistent fig 7 the calibration results for xx08 may be affected by the operation of the gudongkou cascade reservoirs and the large average daily changes in inflow water temperature overall the accuracy of the simulation increased upstream the calibration results of the flow field on july 2 july 5 and july 8 2017 are shown in fig 8 there was little difference between the simulated data and the observed data and the continuity of the spatial distribution of the simulated data was better than that of the observed data because there was an abundance of external disturbance in the actual conditions upstream underflow occurred upstream of xxb as a result of the low temperature inflow on july 2 the mainstream plunged into xxb from 10 m to 50 m on july 5 from 5 m to 55 m and on july 8 from 5 m to 60 m with the development of the impounding process the plunge point was uplifted and the thickness of the intrusion layer increased significantly whereas there was little change in the travel distance for the calibration of water quality this study compared the simulated data with the observed data from july 1 to july 6 2017 because the impoundment intensity was greater during this period the dfwls during this period were all greater than 1 m whereas the dfwls from july 7 to july 10 were always less than 1 m except for on july 8 the isograms of the chl a concentration in xxb from july 1 to july 6 fig 9 indicate that the simulation results accurately indicated the actual conditions and the variation in the simulated data was temporally similar to that in the observed data there was a sharp decrease in the chl a concentration from july 1 to july 2 and the chl a concentration in xxb gradually deceased xx05 was selected as a typical site to show the calibration results of the surface chl a concentration appendix a fig a1 and the variation trend in the simulated data was almost the same as that in the observed data moreover the simulated values were very close to the observed data overall the simulation results can spatially and temporally reflect the variation in the chl a concentration in xxb 2 2 3 data analysis based on the simulated chl a concentration a calculation method was developed to quantify the algae control effect the formulations are presented as follows 3 v i l h l w l l 4 a i c i v i 5 s a j 1 m i 1 n a i where i is the number of layers in the euphotic zone of the segment j is the number of segments vi is the water volume of the ith layer l h is the layer height l w is the layer width and l l is the layer length ai is the amount of chl a in the ith layer c i is the chl a concentration of the ith layer sa is the total amount of chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb 3 results 3 1 algae control effect in xxb during the impounding process compared with the sa on july 1 the sa decreased by different amount during the impounding process and sa was lowest on july 3 the sa on july 3 decreased by 73 57 compared with the sa on july 1 and the sa on july 6 decreased by 53 60 compared with the sa on july 1 table 1 the vertically maximum chl a concentration c max values of the different sites in xxb on july 1 july 3 and july 6 fig 10 were selected to show the algae control effect during the impounding process on july 1 c max was high especially in the upstream of xxb and reached 245 5 mg m 3 while on july 3 and july 6 c max was less than 50 mg m 3 in xxb during the impounding process c max varied obviously in xxb and was less than that on july 1 thus algal blooms were effectively controlled 3 2 characteristics of water temperature stratification and its influence on algal blooms the water temperature stratification in xxb was obvious on july 1 and strengthened further downstream fig 11 a however after the impoundment on july 3 the water temperature stratification in the downstream and middle reaches was weaker than that on july 1 fig 11b on july 6 water temperature stratification was shallower throughout almost the whole bay except in the area close to the estuary where the depth of water temperature stratification increased compared with that on july 3 fig 11c with the development of the impounding process the area where water temperature stratification existed gradually extended further downstream on july 1 there was no water temperature stratification around xx09 the upstream inflow reached xx09 and then flowed into xxb which was why the chl a concentration around xx09 on july 1 was lower than that in the other areas in xxb however on july 3 and july 6 the water temperature stratification area extended to xx09 and the upstream areas which made the location of upstream inflow into xxb move upstream moreover the plunge point of the upstream inflow was deepened finally the upstream inflow moved along the riverbed compared with that on july 1 the water temperature stratification in the upstream areas decreased gradually during the impounding process which was the reason why the chl a concentration in the upstream decreased obviously after the impoundment in addition the chl a concentration in the area close to the estuary increased slightly on july 6 compared with that on july 1 and july 3 fig 10 because the water temperature stratification in the area close to the estuary was strengthened on july 6 compared with that on july 1 and july 3 3 3 characteristics of density currents and their influence on water temperature stratification the parameters related to density currents during the impounding process are shown in table 2 with the development of the impounding process the density currents gradually traveled further the depth of the plunge point decreased to a minimum value of 2 67 m on july 3 increased gradually to 3 38 m on july 5 and then decreased sharply to 2 71 m on july 6 the water exchange between the mainstream and xxb appeared as interflow intrusion and overflow intrusion during the impounding process the variation in the depth of the plunge point was consistent with the variation in the sa table 1 on july 1 the density currents traveled 27 5 km which is exactly the distance between xx08 and xx09 thus the upstream inflow could flow into xxb around xx09 without the backwater effect in addition density currents flowed in the middle layer from the downstream to the upstream of xxb fig 12 a thus the water temperature stratification in the surface layer was not impacted fig 11a as the depth of the plunge point decreased on july 3 the water temperature stratification was greatly influenced by the density currents and was weakened fig 11b the density currents traveled further on july 3 than on july 1 fig 12b on july 6 the depth of the upper boundary of the density currents in the downstream was slightly lower than that on july 1 and july 3 fig 12c thus water temperature stratification in the downstream increased slightly and density currents flowed at the surface in the upstream where water temperature stratification greatly decreased fig 11c the variation in the upstream underflow was related to the intrusion flow from the mainstream as the depth of the plunge point of the density currents increased the plunge point of the upstream inflow deepened and the upstream inflow was forced to flow into xxb in the bottom layer meanwhile as the travel distance of density currents increased the location where the upstream inflow flowed into xxb moved upstream 4 discussion from july 1 2017 to july 6 2017 the total nitrogen concentration tn and the total phosphorus concentration tp in the mainstream and xxb were all greater than the eutrophication threshold tn 0 2 mg l 1 tp 0 02 mg l 1 thomann and mueller 1987 thus the outbreak and extinction of algal blooms had little to do with the nutrients during the impounding process after the initial filling of the tgr the mainstream still had a one dimensional flow pattern from the upstream to the downstream in front of the dam li et al 2002 ji et al 2012 the average flow velocity decreased from 2 m s 1 to 0 17 m s 1 zhang et al 2005 and the turbulent mixing was strong li et al 2002 water in some tributary bays flowed slowly and the flow velocity was mostly less than 0 05 m s 1 under the influence of the backwater li et al 2007 which promoted the deposition of suspended solids increased water transparency and gradually formed a stable environment under these conditions the high water temperature gradients fig 11a indicated stable water temperature stratification gao and wang 2016 water temperature stratification weakened the vertical mixing of water in different layers zhao and han 2005 thus the algae could remain suspended in the euphotic zone and grow rapidly meanwhile this water temperature stratification would make the bottom water anoxic and promote the release of nutrients from the sediment finally causing algal blooms jones and poplawski 1998 in addition water temperature stratification could promote the formation of cyanobacteria blooms cyanobacteria has a strong ability to resist high water temperatures and strong light and can adapt to the increase in water temperature in the upper layer which was caused by water temperature stratification moreover cyanobacteria can remain suspended to obtain nutrients from deep layers eloff et al 1976 pearl and huisman 2008 although cyanobacteria was not the dominant algae during the monitoring period there were cyanobacteria blooms in xxb in the last few years cui et al 2016 especially in summer tian et al 2012 which have received considerable attention the stronger the water temperature stratification was the greater the risk of algal blooms would be yang et al 2012 during the impounding process the flow velocity in xxb was approximately 0 1 m s 1 0 2 m s 1 which was greater than that in other periods moreover the density currents were obvious and the mainstream intruded into xxb from the middle and surface layers fig 12 on the one hand density currents could carry algae in the downstream to the backwater terminus which could supply chl a moreover the density currents gradually traveled further and surpassed xx09 during the impounding process fig 12 which was the reason why serious algal blooms existed in the upstream of the river at the end of the impounding process on the other hand the chl a concentration in cjxx was less than 5 mg m 3 and the mainstream was oligotrophic zheng et al 2006 the low chl a concentration water in the mainstream could dilute the high chl a concentration water in xxb and the dilution effect was greater closer to the estuary when the dilution effect was greater than algal growth the chl a concentration would decrease yang et al 2010b the impounding process could change the characteristics of density currents especially when the depth of the plunge point was changed and these changes could greatly influence the chl a concentration in xxb the intrusion of the mainstream could weaken water temperature stratification in xxb li et al 2012 and destroy the stable environment suitable for algal growth especially when the wl quickly increased then strengthen the vertical movement of algae thus reducing the time when algae were exposed to light decreasing the rate of photosynthesis and finally controlling algal growth xiong et al 2013 especially downstream the upstream underflow made the sinking algae flow out of xxb along the riverbed the algae control mechanism of the impounding process was of vital importance for the implementation of the ecological operation of the tgr the above analysis indicated that the key to this process was the destruction of water temperature stratification the response of the chl a concentration in xxb to the impounding process indicated good potential for controlling algal blooms by appropriately designing the dfwl of the tgr high dfwl scenarios during the impounding process might be effective and feasible the ecological operation rules for algae control through water management in the tgr could then be investigated by designing different dfwl scenarios not only during the flood season but also during other periods of the year 5 conclusions the laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model of xxb based on ce qual w2 was able to adequately simulate algal blooms during the impounding process in the flood season and the simulation results could accurately illustrate the spatial and temporal distributions of flow water temperature and chl a the ce qual w2 model performed well in water quality forecasts in xxb and could play an important role in the ecological reservoir operation during the impounding process the total chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb decreased and the chl a concentration was less than 50 mg m 3 in xxb finally the variation in the chl a concentration in xxb was closely related to water temperature stratification the stronger the water temperature stratification was the greater the chl a concentration would be the water exchange between the mainstream and xxb appeared as interflow intrusion and overflow intrusion the variation trend in the depth of the plunge point was consistent with the variation in the total chl a in the euphotic zone of xxb density currents greatly influenced water temperature stratification and could control algal blooms by weakening water temperature stratification the low chl a concentration water in the mainstream could dilute the high chl a concentration water in xxb and the dilution effect was greater closer to the estuary density currents could carry the algae in the downstream to the terminal of the backwater zone which supplied chl a concentration to the upstream areas thus the impounding process provided a possible means for algae control in the tgr furthermore ecological operation rules could be investigated by designing different dfwl scenarios according to the hydrodynamic and water quality conditions in different periods of the year acknowledgements this

25154,blooms of the karenia brevis dinoflagellate can create devastating effects on marine communities off the west coast of florida when they release a suite of neurotoxins known as brevetoxins pbtx these blooms informally referred to as red tides can cause massive fish kills necessitate closures of shellfish fisheries and can even leave lingering toxins that impact shelf communities long after the bloom has dissipated much effort has been put into studying k brevis bloom initiation and dynamics however predicting the impact of these blooms on florida s fish and fisheries is problematic because k brevis cell counts and fish mortality is not well correlated ecopath with ecosim ewe is an ecosystem modelling platform that is used in this study to simulate k brevis bloom effects on the west florida shelf ecosystem the model produced for this study which has been named the west florida shelf k brevis model is an application of the ewe modelling platform that employs a recently developed time series to index k brevis bloom severity this index was used to drive bloom related mortality as a fishing fleet in the model in a historical reconstruction scenario from 1980 to 2009 the study suggests that k brevis blooms can impose top down food web effects causing trophic cascades piscivores planktivores and detritivores experienced biomass increases when bloom related mortality was applied while invertebrate eaters and omnivores experienced biomass decreases changes in community structure and biodiversity are evidenced by effects on species evenness and richness the model indicated an overall improvement in fits to observational time series of biomass and catch when using the k brevis index these results provide evidence that k brevis mortality should be considered in population models particularly for species with low predation mortality such as gag keywords ecopath with ecosim gag brevetoxin red tide ecosystem modelling gulf of mexico 1 introduction 1 1 background the west florida shelf wfs is broad shallow and inundated seasonally with nutrient rich waters from rivers muller karger et al 1991 gilbes et al 1996 del castillo et al 2000 the harmful algal blooms habs which occur annually on the shelf are largely the result of a dinoflagellate karenia brevis it is the only planktonic algal species of over 30 in the gulf of mexico to cause fish kills consistently and to pose a threat to human health steidinger et al 1998 landsberg et al 2009 walsh et al 2011 rivers release high levels of dissolved inorganic phosphorus onto the wfs making nitrogen the limiting nutrient mcpherson and miller 1990 heil et al 2007 nitrogen on the shelf is supplied by the nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium trichodesmium spp which is active offshore when iron is made available by saharan dust lenes et al 2001 walsh et al 2006 other sources include land run off submarine groundwater discharge and sewage input hu et al 2006 decaying fish could also provide a significant nitrogen source wilson and collier 1955 walsh et al 2006 algal blooms mature and grow as more nitrogen becomes available they can be advected onshore by way of currents and upwelling walsh et al 2006 steidinger and haddad 1981 as the bloom reaches high density and dinoflagellate cells begin to lyse brevetoxins are released steidinger et al 1973 baden 1989 landsberg et al 2009 the neurotoxins primarily affect the neuromotor systems of fish by altering sodium potassium channels in the nerves and muscles and can lead to death kirkpatrick et al 2004 it is common for thousands of fish to be killed during a k brevis hab event particularly during severe events that move inshore landsberg et al 2009 flaherty and landsberg 2011 ingersoll describes evidence of hab effects as early as 1844 along the wfs ingersoll 1881 rounsefell and nelson 1966 steidinger et al 1998 and these blooms continue to occur annually primarily in the spring landsberg et al 2009 benthic species particularly slow moving species are the most commonly reported killed steidinger et al 1973 florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2012 this could be the result of blooms initiating at depth making benthic species the first to be exposed steidinger et al 1973 steidinger 1975 2009 walsh et al 2006 as the bloom matures and is advected inshore by currents it can affect plankton and nekton communities flaherty and landsberg 2011 this can produce bottom up effects and negatively affect higher trophic levels by either reducing prey abundance or through bioaccumulation of toxin landsberg et al 2009 mortality in these higher trophic level species may result in predation release and create top down effects such as a trophic cascade thus during severe k brevis blooms brevetoxins might pose both bottom up and top down effects on the ecosystem 1 2 objectives florida k brevis blooms have been intensely studied few studies however have attempted to address whole ecosystem effects and community structure shifts among macrofauna smith 1975 1979 studied hab response of offshore patch reef communities using visual scuba surveys while gannon et al 2009 performed fish surveys in sarasota bay and the adjacent gulf of mexico waters however neither of these surveys were able to frame the impacts of habs at the ecosystem level the k brevis dinoflagellate has the potential to influence a wide range of ecosystem processes if bottom up and top down effects act in concert the goal for this study is to show how ecosystem dynamics are influenced by mortality events created by habs blooms are simulated here in an ecosystem model by imposing mortality on both low and high trophic level finfish using a unique approach of applying the mortality through a fishing fleet the forcing pattern used to represent habs as a fishing fleet in the model is based on an index developed by walter et al unpublished which represents not toxin concentrations per se but the estimated effect on finfish and shellfish populations effects of habs are investigated on an ecosystem wide basis by comparing biomass and productivity in the ecosystem when blooms are present versus when they are absent we also consider changes in biodiversity which provides evidence of community structure changes if k brevis blooms have played a significant role in structuring the ecosystem then an improved fit to historical catch and biomass observations will be seen when habs are incorporated as a driver in a historical reconstruction of ecosystem dynamics in addition gag mycteroperca microlepis were considered specifically to determine the importance of including the impacts of k brevis blooms in stock assessments and management decisions gag was used a case study species because it is a socio economically important fish species in the u s gulf of mexico that has been seen in the fish kill database florida fish and wildlife conservation commission s fish and wildlife research institute s fwri 2012 gag also is a fish species with no known predators once maturity is reached therefore gag has few known sources of natural mortality outside of k brevis mortality making it the perfect species to investigate in this study the goal was to better define natural mortality of gag grouper for stock assessment and management documents 2 methods 2 1 ecopath with ecosim ecopath with

et al 2011 the model for this study was unique in its attempt to investigate the impact of k brevis blooms on florida s fish and fisheries 2 2 ecopath model construction an existing wfs model first developed by mahmoudi et al 2002 and later modified by okey and mahmoudi 2002 provided a foundation from which both a present day model and historical model could be constructed fig 1 the present day model was constructed using current biomass and landings data time series of biomass and landings that extended back to 1980 were then used to adjust the present day values to 1980 values to produce a historical model all simulations in this paper were conducted with the historical model using a retrospective reconstruction of ecosystem dynamics from 1980 2000 since the historical model was largely based on the present day model the development of both models is explained here all model inputs are included in an attached appendix see appendix table a1 additional model information is available from okey and mahmoudi 2002 the spatial domain was defined as the 200 m isobath of the wfs with a total area of 170 000 km2 fig 2 species were aggregated into 59 functional groups according to trophic life history and niche similarities to address the questions proposed in this paper the west florida shelf model was first modified into a present day model set to 2009 data to include additional exploited and non exploited species sensitive to k brevis blooms as seen in literature steidinger et al 1973 table a2 and in fwri fish kill database florida fish and wildlife conservation commission s fish and wildlife research institute s fwri 2012 these species which will further be referred to as hab impacted species include blue crab callinectes sapidus crevalle jack caranx hippos ladyfish elops saurus red grouper epinephelus morio mojarras gerreidae pinfish lagodon rhomboides gray snapper lutjanus griseus lane snapper lutjanus synagris striped mullet mugil cephalus gag mycteroperca microlepis red drum sciaenops ocellatus and spanish mackerel scomberomorus maculatus these hab impacted species were selected so that a range of commercially important species such as red grouper and spanish mackerel and important prey items such as pinfish and mojarras were included each hab impacted species was inserted into ewe as fully age structured multi stanza groups christensen et al 2005 2008 in each instance that a hab impacted species was already included in a pre existing aggregate functional group biomass of the hab impacted species was removed from the aggregated group and put in another dedicated functional group existing functional groups from which biomass was removed included pelagic coastal piscivores adult mackerels demersal coastal invertebrate feeders demersal coastal omnivores structure associated coastal piscivores large groupers nearshore associated piscivores and large crabs juvenile mackerel biomass was added into the juvenile spanish mackerel functional group and mullet biomass was added into the adult striped mullet functional group biomass data were collected at 2009 values for each of the newly added functional groups using federal and state information when available sedar 2006 2008 murphy et al 2007 mahmoudi 2005 gag sedar 2009a red drum sedar 2009b crevalle jack florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010a ladyfish florida fish and

wildlife research institute fwri 2010e table a2 in cases where only numbers at age of fish were available individual body length was estimated using the von bertalanffy vb equation eq 2 and then an allometric relationship eq 3 was used to convert length into weight 2 l t l 1 e k t 3 w a l b where l t is length at time linf is length at infinity k is the growth constant t is age w is weight l is length and a and b are allometric constants stock assessment reports or fishbase froese and pauly 2015 provided growth parameters k linf a and b consumption rates q b were calculated with an empirical method developed by palomares and pauly 1999 total mortality z was calculated by adding fishing mortality f and natural mortality m diet information was required for all newly added functional groups fwri reports provided general diet information for many of the species including crevalle jack ladyfish lane snapper pinfish red grouper and blue crab murphy et al 2007 crevalle jack florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010a ladyfish florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010b lane snapper florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010c pinfish florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010d red grouper florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010e fishbase was used to compare to the fwri reports and was used to define what proportions of the diet each prey item made up diets of gag spanish mackerel striped mullet red drum gray snapper and mojarras were gathered entirely from fishbase finally landings data were collected from stock assessments or from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa commercial and recreational fisheries statistics commercial national marine fisheries service s nmfs 2012a b recreational national marine fisheries service s nmfs 2012a b landings data for aggregate groups of species were summed fleets structure was preserved from the original model fleets include trawl recreation headboats gill trammel net spear gig hook line purse seine haul seine long line and traps landings data were removed from functional groups that were disaggregated to create the new functional groups adjustments made to construct the present day ewe model required that a mass balancing step be performed to reconcile mortality with available production across all functional groups because diet data are usually the least reliable of data diet composition input was reviewed for accuracy when adjustments to the diet were not required consumption rates and production rates were evaluated and modified as needed relative to the base model of mahmoudi 2002 groups that required reductions in consumption q b to reduce predation mortality on prey were mesozooplankton carnivorous zooplankton and microbial heterotrophs reductions made to the consumption rate did not exceed 15 of the original value some groups required increases in productivity productivity for dolphin seabird rays skates sardine adult mackerel demersal coastal piscivores and demersal coastal invertebrate eaters was increased by up to 15 2 3 historical model the present day model which has been described to this point was then converted into a historical model on which all model tests would be performed the historical model was dated at 1980 so that hab effects through time could be investigated time series of biomass and catch data for each functional group were constructed between the years 1980 and 2009 based on chagaris 2013 and chagaris et al 2015 these time series provided the values needed to convert the present day model values to the biomass and catch that would have been seen in 1980 for the historical model table a3 catch per unit effort cpue time series which can show relative biomass changes over time were used when biomass time series were unavailable biomass in 1980 was estimated based on the 2009 biomass by assuming the same proportional change as cpue in that time period 2 4 incorporating habs into the model bloom related mortality was incorporated into the model on a total of 38 fish and invertebrate functional groups using a pseudo fishing fleet that represented mortality due to habs other studies have successfully used pseudo fishing fleets in this way as a simple forcing method to influence natural mortality on functional groups busch et al 2013 ainsworth et al 2011 it is appropriate to manipulate the mortality of higher trophic level groups because this avoids the need to model bloom initiation dynamics which ewe is not well suited biomass caught by this pseudo hab fleet as we shall refer to it was immediately cycled into the detritus pool and thus made available to detritivores note that this method of mortality forcing using pseudo fishing fleets is not to be confused with ewe s separate forcing function routine christensen et al 2005 2008 which allows manipulation of vulnerability and production rates instead this method was employed by either including or removing walter s hab severity index as a driver for the hab fleet if the mortality imposed by the fleet is set to zero the hab fleet would not remove biomass and therefore would represent the system with no k brevis impacts a separate pseudo hab fleet was created specifically for gag so that bloom related mortality on gag could be manipulated more precisely thus we used two pseudo fishing fleets to represent hab effects one for gag and one for everything else the effect of habs was not entered directly as a mortality driver but as a relative effort driver acting on the pseudo hab fleet meanwhile effort data nmfs 2013 were used to force effort on all other fleets in the model this arrangement is a work around that allows all species including gag to be driven by multiple independent effort series without prescribing the amount of catch or red tide mortality allowing instead for ecosim to estimate these thus the resulting natural mortality series for gag may be influenced by fisheries habs and trophic dynamics the magnitude of mortality caused by the pseudo hab fleets was to be driven using a k brevis severity index from 1998 to 2010 walter et al 2013 table a4 this index provided a quantitative scale of how severe the k brevis blooms were year to year with more severe years having a higher value the index was developed by walter et al 2013 using a generalized additive model gam that predicts the probability of a k brevis bloom using a suite of satellite remote sensing products e g chlorophyll concentration chlorophyll anomalies morel backscatter rrs670 satellite data for the index were obtained from sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs daily or twice daily imagery the offshore index was used since it was less affected by bottom reflectance and because adult gag habitat is primarily offshore walter s severity index was looped to extend the trend back further from its original 1998 starting year so that the series could start at 1980 thus hab forcing prior to 1998 is hypothetical but realistic in terms of amplitude and frequency the absolute magnitude of effect for the pseudo hab fleets was scaled by use of an anchor point method which grounded one of the years in the severity index to an observed mortality rate for gag sedar 2009 estimated that there was an 18 decrease in the gag stock biomass during the severe 2005 bloom thus we scaled the effect of the pseudo hab fleet so that the 2005 mortality rate for gag amounted to 10 15 or 20 of total gag biomass table a5 the range was used to test the sensitivity of the model to bloom amplitude other years were set according to walter s severity index scaled proportionally to the fixed 2005 value the mortality effect was applied to adult stanzas and juvenile stanzas bloom related mortality was scaled to other groups using the fish kill database fwri 2012 the fish kill database is a record between 2001 and 2010 of all fish strandings seen along the gulf coast of florida during k brevis bloom events approximate numbers of dead fish and the species included are reported by the public to the fish kill hotline the database was used to create an index of vulnerability to blooms so that species more prevalent in the record would be affected more strongly by the blooms to determine bloom related mortality on other functional groups the prevalence of gag in the fish kill database was first determined as an average proportion of total fish kill the averaged proportion that each functional group made up of the fish kill database was compared to gag s proportion in the fish kill database the difference between each functional group s proportion and gag s proportion was then used as an index to scale each functional group s magnitude of mortality compared to gag s magnitude since total biomass lost to bloom related mortality was known for gag these calculations would then be used as biomass killed by habs in 1980 see appendix table a5 2 5 balancing and tuning the historical model time series were used to calibrate the historical model model outputs could be fit to time series by adjusting ecosim vulnerability parameters which control density dependent feeding rates walters et al 1997 an optimization routine changes vulnerabilities through an iterative process until model fit improves based on a sum of squared deviations ss criterion for each functional group lower ss values suggests an improvement in fit to time series initially vulnerabilities were optimized across predators all prey items were assumed equally vulnerable to a given predator subsequently a sensitivity test determined the top 30 predator prey interactions that influenced the residuals those 30 predator prey interactions were then optimized again with each interaction free to vary independently this two step process ensures that all vulnerabilities are improved to some degree and a core of influential vulnerabilities are near optimal these optimizations were done with the inclusion of k brevis bloom effects to compare how k brevis blooms affect the model s ability to recreate data bloom related mortality driving the hab fleet was removed and another optimization was performed with the top 30 predator species the ss was recorded again for each functional group the final version of the historical model that was used for this study can be accessed and downloaded at http scholarcommons usf edu msc facpub 219 2 6 application of the model model simulations first investigated if k brevis blooms improved the model s ability to recreate the observed time series of catch and biomass data between 1980 and 2009 as a second objective top down and bottom up food web effects were investigated by comparing biomass and productivity differences in the ecosystem when k brevis bloom effects were included and when they were not note that bottom up effects are not applied to planktonic functional groups but to low trophic level forage fish groups to simplify model output we look at bloom related effects within groups of taxa the groups we examine include all ewe functional groups only finfish functional groups only functional groups directly affected by blooms see appendix table a4 and several combinations of groups that have similar diets or similar habitat preferences total mortality was used as an index of productivity at model equilibrium mortality should equal production the potential for k brevis blooms to structure a community was also investigated as an index for community change the following biodiversity indices were calculated at each time step of the simulation shannon shannon 1948 kempton q kempton and taylor 1976 inverse simpson simpson 1949 and gini simpson simpson 1949 jost 2006 shannon calculates evenness in our application kempton q responds to both species richness and evenness inverse simpson calculates the probability that two species drawn at random will be the same an index of richness and finally gini simpson calculates the probability that two species drawn at random will be different an index of richness changes in biomass and productivity across trophic levels were examined 3 results 3 1 west florida shelf response bloom related mortality associated with k brevis improved the model s ability to recreate the time series sum of squares was reduced by 5 6 the fits for 70 of the functional groups to which k brevis bloom effects were directly applied saw improvement by an average of 5 using the ss criterion functional groups that show the greatest improvements when hab effects are included are demersal coastal invertebrate eaters adult gag and structure associated coastal piscivores table 1 in addition to these improvements many functional groups had model fits that agreed well with the biomass time series when bloom related mortality was included comprising of seabirds large oceanic piscivores coastal sharks adult and juvenile red grouper adult and juvenile gag adult and juvenile striped mullet lane snapper sardine and herring and shrimps see appendix fig a1 model fits to landings data agreed well with spanish mackerel adult and juvenile gag red drum pinfish sardine and herring shrimp and lobster functional groups see appendix fig a2 total system biomass was not strongly affected by blooms there was also no significant effect on overall finfish biomass however there was a small 1 15 increase in hab impacted species biomass when habs were present scenarios that grouped functional groups with similar diets suggested that piscivores planktivores and detritivores increased in biomass while invertebrate eaters and omnivores decreased fig 3 further when these feeding guilds are organized by trophic level there is evidence of a trophic cascade with an alternating pattern of biomass increases and decreases hab impacted species showed an increase in mortality rate relative to a no bloom scenario e g gag in fig 4 no significant diversity changes at the ecosystem level were found in either shannon or kempton q tests finfish and hab impacted species decreased in diversity with bloom effects as seen in both the shannon and kempton q indices to further investigate diversity changes in the ecosystem shannon indices were calculated to determine if differences could be found between pelagic functional groups fig 5 a and benthic functional groups fig 5b pelagic groups had a decreased shannon index value while benthic groups had an increased shannon index value these can be attributed to changes in species evenness this implies that high biomass dominant groups were impacted proportionately more than low biomass groups in the benthic environment this was not the case in the pelagic environment 3 2 gag case study gag decreased in biomass when bloom related mortality was included in the model fig 6 productivity on the other hand increased when bloom related mortality was included see fig 4 we assume that changes in p b reflect changes in m in a near equilibrium system natural mortality on gag see appendix table a5 ranges between 0 22 and 0 25 yr 1 with increasing variability towards the end of the simulation the k brevis bloom related mortality fig 7 ranges between 0 02 to 0 15 yr 1 and displays the same increase in variability towards the end of the simulation bloom related mortality represents 6 5 of gag total mortality which exceeds the sum of predation mortality from all predators combined fig 7 low predation on adult gag means that the total natural mortality trend closely reflects the k brevis bloom related mortality trend gag consumption of its prey was found to increase when bloom related mortality is present as compared to consumption with no bloom related mortality fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 west florida shelf responses broadly the west florida shelf k brevis model identified that k brevis blooms may have little impact on total system biomass productivity or diversity but these aggregate indices do not necessarily reflect changing species compositions differences were found when different sections of the food web were investigated more closely the most pronounced changes were seen in pelagic finfish and in benthic finfish and invertebrates mortality by blooms increased the biomass of many functional groups piscivores planktivores and detritivores experienced increases in biomass in the presence of blooms gannon et al 2009 performed fish surveys in sarasota bay and the adjacent gulf of mexico and found similar increases in filter feeders such as clupeids during k brevis hab events they hypothesized that clupeids were perhaps more tolerant of brevetoxin poisoning were better able to metabolize brevetoxin or were perhaps better able to detect and avoid patches of k brevis or brevetoxin such mechanisms would not be simulated in the ecopath model constructed for this study instead we hypothesize that bloom mortality applied to a range of species could result in reduced competition as a result of top down effects estes and palmisano 1974 pace et al 1999 paine 1980 certain groups may benefit if increases in productivity due to alleviation of competition outweigh any direct mortality imposed by k brevis in contrast to functional groups that increased in biomass omnivores and invertebrate eaters decreased in biomass these decreases may be attributable to direct mortality from k brevis and or increases in predation rate alternatively increases seen in biomass in the model could be attributed to the removal of older individuals for many species k brevis was modelled primarily as a top down driver due to the fact that bloom mortality was applied as a strong influence on adult age classes the placement of bloom mortality reduced the average age of the functional groups leaving younger more productive individuals this is modelled explicitly in the case of age structured groups and implicitly in the case of single stanza groups the younger fish also tend to feed lower in the food web ewe resolves diet into juvenile and adult predators and therefore have greater biomass of prey available compared to the adults the west florida shelf k brevis model was also able to show that bloom mortality acting on high trophic level adult fish caused a release of predation mortality on prey species leading to a trophic cascade a clear alternating pattern of biomass increasing and decreasing by trophic level suggests that indirect bloom effects extend far throughout the food web and have the potential to alter community structure substantially the trophic cascade demonstrates that k brevis imposes a top down effect on the organismal community shannon diversity comparisons of model outputs suggested a decrease in population evenness in pelagic finfish and an increase in population evenness of benthic finfish and invertebrates the most likely reason for these results was that mortality imposed by k brevis blooms was not proportional across functional groups the increased evenness in benthic finfish indicates that numerically dominant species tend to be impacted disproportionately to less abundant species this could be an artifact of modelling dominant species in the food web may be over represented in the fish kill database as these are the species that tend to be reported by imposing greater mortalities on dominant groups particularly for benthic groups which made up a larger portion of the fish kill database population evenness would increase pelagic finfish on the other hand were less affected by k brevis mortality these groups made up a smaller proportion of the fish kill reports as would be expected if these groups were more capable of avoiding areas experiencing a bloom event the episodic nature of k brevis blooms seems to be increasing in frequency and severity van dolah 2000 brand and compton 2007 and it is likely that the blooms will play an increasingly important community structuring role in the region smith 1975 1979 studied communities on patch reefs in the gulf of mexico by recording presence and absence of fish species smith estimated a 77 decline of resident fish species and attributed that to indirect hypoxia effects however density or abundance were not quantified gannon et al 2009 recorded a 37 decline in overall number of fish species during k brevis blooms during their fish surveys in sarasota bay but they determined that hypoxia did not appear to be a significant factor in explaining the decline both studies indicated that k brevis blooms greatly influence community structures in affected regions understanding how habs affect food webs in situ however would require long term independent monitoring approaches that would be costly and possibly prohibitively so which makes food web modelling exercises such as this study important many of the trophodynamically important species e g forage fish benthic pelagic invertebrates are not regularly monitored by existing programs therefore measuring food web effects in situ would necessitate wide coverage to investigate those species and their habitats although the west florida shelf k brevis model demonstrated that habs have the potential to affect the food web in fundamental ways the model was limited by the aggregated functional groups of the ewe model habs may potentially have a larger effect on community composition if episodic disturbances provide an advantage to pioneer species these tend to be hardy species and the first to colonize new habitats likewise episodic disturbance might be a disadvantage to climax species which are late colonizers well suited to high competition environments see intermediate disturbance hypothesis by paine and vadas 1969 grime 1973 and connell 1978 since succession dynamics are not modelled in ewe an increase in pioneer species can manifest as increases in biomass of high productivity groups and a decrease in climax species can manifest as decreases in biomass of low productivity groups despite this limitation both of these effects were seen in the presence of blooms the west florida shelf k brevis model is also limited by its diet matrix since this input has large impacts on the predictions that can be made it is common that there is high uncertainty in the diets assumed for fish and invertebrates in ecopath models e g walters et al 2008 heymans et al 2016 making the diet matrix typically the most uncertain aspect of the model in recent years several methods have been developed in the u s gulf of mexico to construct diet matrices for ecosystem models based on probabilistic approaches masi et al 2014 sagarese et al 2016 tarnecki et al 2016 such methods were not incorporated into this study and consequently the uncertainty in the results obtained from this modelling exercise are not explicitly modeled further though the west florida shelf k brevis model is still based largely on a pre existing and accepted model okey and mahmoudi 2002 diagnostics to evaluate and validate ecopath basic input parameters used in the model could be done using the methods developed by link 2010 and darwall et al 2010 to improve the model s performance to inform fisheries management heymans et al 2016 grüss et al 2017 modelling k brevis proves to be a difficult task which makes this study important particularly for its attempt to address k brevis impact on fish mortality predicting the impact of k brevis blooms on florida s fish and fisheries has been problematic because k brevis cell counts and fish mortality are not well correlated though there have been great efforts to study k brevis bloom initiation and dynamics despite all of the difficulties in accurately modelling k brevis tides these findings support the use of composite series like walter s severity index to impose bloom related mortality in ecosystem modelling studies or in stock assessments since the index was found to improve the model s ability to fit to the data these findings are particularly relevant given the k brevis bloom that began in october 2017 and continues to plague both the east and west coast of florida as of fall 2018 while the methods employed for this study cannot predict the severity and persistence of a k brevis bloom an analysis to estimate fish mortality resulting from the bloom could be performed by comparing the indices of historical blooms to recent blooms by updating walter s severity index for more recent years including the bloom of 2018 the index is especially helpful for species such as gag or red grouper which have low natural mortality otherwise e g gray et al 2013 sagarese et al 2017 and can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses or improve the fit of stock assessment models to time series data 4 2 gag case study gag is an apex predator with few natural predators mortality associated with k brevis blooms therefore made up a significant portion of their natural mortality the natural mortality trend for gag which includes predation and mortality resulting from k brevis blooms closely reflects the k brevis hab mortality trend suggesting that composite series like the severity index may be usable as a relative index of natural mortality in future assessments for species like gag natural mortality of gag that was estimated from this study which fell between 0 22 and 0 25 yr 1 was notably higher than the estimated 0 15 yr 1 natural mortality that was calculated using empirical approaches sedar 2009a the natural mortality used in the sedar stock assessment was estimated using age information from gag otoliths collected over a two year time span using ewe to estimate natural mortality is a potentially valuable method to supplement catch curve analysis and in particular to partition out predation mortality from other sources like habs gray et al 2013 gray 2014 further though gag biomass decreased when k brevis bloom mortality was included gag productivity and consumption increased these results can be rationalized as either reduced intraspecific competition or a reduced mean age of the group despite the fact that k brevis mortality tended to be applied to older age classes any sources of mortality would tend to skew the age distribution toward younger individuals since the probability of reaching adulthood is decreased therefore the finding that k brevis increases overall productivity of the stock is robust to structural uncertainty in the modelling approach however the decreased biodiversity within finfish and hab impacted species also points to the possibility that at higher levels of effect there may be a reduction in niche specialization with less efficient use of resources and lower stock productivity a difficulty with modelling k brevis is that the blooms begin offshore before being advected inshore impacting only those populations that overlap in time and space including a spatio temporal component to the model using ecospace could help improve the model s ability to inform fisheries management particularly for species such as gag which are sex changing and are spatially segregated most of the year available spatial data may be a limiting factor 4 3 conclusions the results obtained from the west florida shelf k brevis model ultimately supports the notion that entire ecosystems should be considered holistically particularly when addressing mortality events such as k brevis blooms if such responses can result from a relatively small source of mortality aimed at top predators perhaps there are implications that can be taken from this study for modelling exercises of other mortality events such as cold kills oil spills and climate change in the u s gulf of mexico and elsewhere the modelling efforts here show that an index of severity of these environmental functions can be generated as a time series to successfully improve model fits and realism of the model other population models such as those used in stock assessments could greatly benefit from building on the west florida shelf k brevis model or by representing other sources of natural mortality in a similar fashion

25154,blooms of the karenia brevis dinoflagellate can create devastating effects on marine communities off the west coast of florida when they release a suite of neurotoxins known as brevetoxins pbtx these blooms informally referred to as red tides can cause massive fish kills necessitate closures of shellfish fisheries and can even leave lingering toxins that impact shelf communities long after the bloom has dissipated much effort has been put into studying k brevis bloom initiation and dynamics however predicting the impact of these blooms on florida s fish and fisheries is problematic because k brevis cell counts and fish mortality is not well correlated ecopath with ecosim ewe is an ecosystem modelling platform that is used in this study to simulate k brevis bloom effects on the west florida shelf ecosystem the model produced for this study which has been named the west florida shelf k brevis model is an application of the ewe modelling platform that employs a recently developed time series to index k brevis bloom severity this index was used to drive bloom related mortality as a fishing fleet in the model in a historical reconstruction scenario from 1980 to 2009 the study suggests that k brevis blooms can impose top down food web effects causing trophic cascades piscivores planktivores and detritivores experienced biomass increases when bloom related mortality was applied while invertebrate eaters and omnivores experienced biomass decreases changes in community structure and biodiversity are evidenced by effects on species evenness and richness the model indicated an overall improvement in fits to observational time series of biomass and catch when using the k brevis index these results provide evidence that k brevis mortality should be considered in population models particularly for species with low predation mortality such as gag keywords ecopath with ecosim gag brevetoxin red tide ecosystem modelling gulf of mexico 1 introduction 1 1 background the west florida shelf wfs is broad shallow and inundated seasonally with nutrient rich waters from rivers muller karger et al 1991 gilbes et al 1996 del castillo et al 2000 the harmful algal blooms habs which occur annually on the shelf are largely the result of a dinoflagellate karenia brevis it is the only planktonic algal species of over 30 in the gulf of mexico to cause fish kills consistently and to pose a threat to human health steidinger et al 1998 landsberg et al 2009 walsh et al 2011 rivers release high levels of dissolved inorganic phosphorus onto the wfs making nitrogen the limiting nutrient mcpherson and miller 1990 heil et al 2007 nitrogen on the shelf is supplied by the nitrogen fixing cyanobacterium trichodesmium spp which is active offshore when iron is made available by saharan dust lenes et al 2001 walsh et al 2006 other sources include land run off submarine groundwater discharge and sewage input hu et al 2006 decaying fish could also provide a significant nitrogen source wilson and collier 1955 walsh et al 2006 algal blooms mature and grow as more nitrogen becomes available they can be advected onshore by way of currents and upwelling walsh et al 2006 steidinger and haddad 1981 as the bloom reaches high density and dinoflagellate cells begin to lyse brevetoxins are released steidinger et al 1973 baden 1989 landsberg et al 2009 the neurotoxins primarily affect the neuromotor systems of fish by altering sodium potassium channels in the nerves and muscles and can lead to death kirkpatrick et al 2004 it is common for thousands of fish to be killed during a k brevis hab event particularly during severe events that move inshore landsberg et al 2009 flaherty and landsberg 2011 ingersoll describes evidence of hab effects as early as 1844 along the wfs ingersoll 1881 rounsefell and nelson 1966 steidinger et al 1998 and these blooms continue to occur annually primarily in the spring landsberg et al 2009 benthic species particularly slow moving species are the most commonly reported killed steidinger et al 1973 florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2012 this could be the result of blooms initiating at depth making benthic species the first to be exposed steidinger et al 1973 steidinger 1975 2009 walsh et al 2006 as the bloom matures and is advected inshore by currents it can affect plankton and nekton communities flaherty and landsberg 2011 this can produce bottom up effects and negatively affect higher trophic levels by either reducing prey abundance or through bioaccumulation of toxin landsberg et al 2009 mortality in these higher trophic level species may result in predation release and create top down effects such as a trophic cascade thus during severe k brevis blooms brevetoxins might pose both bottom up and top down effects on the ecosystem 1 2 objectives florida k brevis blooms have been intensely studied few studies however have attempted to address whole ecosystem effects and community structure shifts among macrofauna smith 1975 1979 studied hab response of offshore patch reef communities using visual scuba surveys while gannon et al 2009 performed fish surveys in sarasota bay and the adjacent gulf of mexico waters however neither of these surveys were able to frame the impacts of habs at the ecosystem level the k brevis dinoflagellate has the potential to influence a wide range of ecosystem processes if bottom up and top down effects act in concert the goal for this study is to show how ecosystem dynamics are influenced by mortality events created by habs blooms are simulated here in an ecosystem model by imposing mortality on both low and high trophic level finfish using a unique approach of applying the mortality through a fishing fleet the forcing pattern used to represent habs as a fishing fleet in the model is based on an index developed by walter et al unpublished which represents not toxin concentrations per se but the estimated effect on finfish and shellfish populations effects of habs are investigated on an ecosystem wide basis by comparing biomass and productivity in the ecosystem when blooms are present versus when they are absent we also consider changes in biodiversity which provides evidence of community structure changes if k brevis blooms have played a significant role in structuring the ecosystem then an improved fit to historical catch and biomass observations will be seen when habs are incorporated as a driver in a historical reconstruction of ecosystem dynamics in addition gag mycteroperca microlepis were considered specifically to determine the importance of including the impacts of k brevis blooms in stock assessments and management decisions gag was used a case study species because it is a socio economically important fish species in the u s gulf of mexico that has been seen in the fish kill database florida fish and wildlife conservation commission s fish and wildlife research institute s fwri 2012 gag also is a fish species with no known predators once maturity is reached therefore gag has few known sources of natural mortality outside of k brevis mortality making it the perfect species to investigate in this study the goal was to better define natural mortality of gag grouper for stock assessment and management documents 2 methods 2 1 ecopath with ecosim ecopath with ecosim ewe polovina 1984 christensen and pauly 1992 walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 is an effective tool for modelling trophic relationships the ecopath component of the model is a

et al 2011 the model for this study was unique in its attempt to investigate the impact of k brevis blooms on florida s fish and fisheries 2 2 ecopath model construction an existing wfs model first developed by mahmoudi et al 2002 and later modified by okey and mahmoudi 2002 provided a foundation from which both a present day model and historical model could be constructed fig 1 the present day model was constructed using current biomass and landings data time series of biomass and landings that extended back to 1980 were then used to adjust the present day values to 1980 values to produce a historical model all simulations in this paper were conducted with the historical model using a retrospective reconstruction of ecosystem dynamics from 1980 2000 since the historical model was largely based on the present day model the development of both models is explained here all model inputs are included in an attached appendix see appendix table a1 additional model information is available from okey and mahmoudi 2002 the spatial domain was defined as the 200 m isobath of the wfs with a total area of 170 000 km2 fig 2 species were aggregated into 59 functional groups according to trophic life history and niche similarities to address the questions proposed in this paper the west florida shelf model was first modified into a present day model set to 2009 data to include additional exploited and non exploited species sensitive to k brevis blooms as seen in literature steidinger et al 1973 table a2 and in fwri fish kill database florida fish and wildlife conservation commission s fish and wildlife research institute s fwri 2012 these species which will further be referred to as hab impacted species include blue crab callinectes sapidus crevalle jack caranx hippos ladyfish elops saurus red grouper epinephelus morio mojarras gerreidae pinfish lagodon rhomboides gray snapper lutjanus griseus lane snapper lutjanus synagris striped mullet mugil cephalus gag mycteroperca microlepis red drum sciaenops ocellatus and spanish mackerel scomberomorus maculatus these hab impacted species were selected so that a range of commercially important species such as red grouper and spanish mackerel and important prey items such as pinfish and mojarras were included each hab impacted species was inserted into ewe as fully age structured multi stanza groups christensen et al 2005 2008 in each instance that a hab impacted species was already included in a pre existing aggregate functional group biomass of the hab impacted species was removed from the aggregated group and put in another dedicated functional group existing functional groups from which biomass was removed included pelagic coastal piscivores adult mackerels demersal coastal invertebrate feeders demersal coastal omnivores structure associated coastal piscivores large groupers nearshore associated piscivores and large crabs juvenile mackerel biomass was added into the juvenile spanish mackerel functional group and mullet biomass was added into the adult striped mullet functional group biomass data were collected at 2009 values for each of the newly added functional groups using federal and state information when available sedar 2006 2008 murphy et al 2007 mahmoudi 2005 gag sedar 2009a red drum sedar 2009b crevalle jack florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010a ladyfish florida fish and

wildlife research institute fwri 2010e table a2 in cases where only numbers at age of fish were available individual body length was estimated using the von bertalanffy vb equation eq 2 and then an allometric relationship eq 3 was used to convert length into weight 2 l t l 1 e k t 3 w a l b where l t is length at time linf is length at infinity k is the growth constant t is age w is weight l is length and a and b are allometric constants stock assessment reports or fishbase froese and pauly 2015 provided growth parameters k linf a and b consumption rates q b were calculated with an empirical method developed by palomares and pauly 1999 total mortality z was calculated by adding fishing mortality f and natural mortality m diet information was required for all newly added functional groups fwri reports provided general diet information for many of the species including crevalle jack ladyfish lane snapper pinfish red grouper and blue crab murphy et al 2007 crevalle jack florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010a ladyfish florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010b lane snapper florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010c pinfish florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010d red grouper florida fish and wildlife research institute fwri 2010e fishbase was used to compare to the fwri reports and was used to define what proportions of the diet each prey item made up diets of gag spanish mackerel striped mullet red drum gray snapper and mojarras were gathered entirely from fishbase finally landings data were collected from stock assessments or from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa commercial and recreational fisheries statistics commercial national marine fisheries service s nmfs 2012a b recreational national marine fisheries service s nmfs 2012a b landings data for aggregate groups of species were summed fleets structure was preserved from the original model fleets include trawl recreation headboats gill trammel net spear gig hook line purse seine haul seine long line and traps landings data were removed from functional groups that were disaggregated to create the new functional groups adjustments made to construct the present day ewe model required that a mass balancing step be performed to reconcile mortality with available production across all functional groups because diet data are usually the least reliable of data diet composition input was reviewed for accuracy when adjustments to the diet were not required consumption rates and production rates were evaluated and modified as needed relative to the base model of mahmoudi 2002 groups that required reductions in consumption q b to reduce predation mortality on prey were mesozooplankton carnivorous zooplankton and microbial heterotrophs reductions made to the consumption rate did not exceed 15 of the original value some groups required increases in productivity productivity for dolphin seabird rays skates sardine adult mackerel demersal coastal piscivores and demersal coastal invertebrate eaters was increased by up to 15 2 3 historical model the present day model which has been described to this point was then converted into a historical model on which all model tests would be performed the historical model was dated at 1980 so that hab effects through time could be investigated time series of biomass and catch data for each functional group were constructed between the years 1980 and 2009 based on chagaris 2013 and chagaris et al 2015 these time series provided the values needed to convert the present day model values to the biomass and catch that would have been seen in 1980 for the historical model table a3 catch per unit effort cpue time series which can show relative biomass changes over time were used when biomass time series were unavailable biomass in 1980 was estimated based on the 2009 biomass by assuming the same proportional change as cpue in that time period 2 4 incorporating habs into the model bloom related mortality was incorporated into the model on a total of 38 fish and invertebrate functional groups using a pseudo fishing fleet that represented mortality due to habs other studies have successfully used pseudo fishing fleets in this way as a simple forcing method to influence natural mortality on functional groups busch et al 2013 ainsworth et al 2011 it is appropriate to manipulate the mortality of higher trophic level groups because this avoids the need to model bloom initiation dynamics which ewe is not well suited biomass caught by this pseudo hab fleet as we shall refer to it was immediately cycled into the detritus pool and thus made available to detritivores note that this method of mortality forcing using pseudo fishing fleets is not to be confused with ewe s separate forcing function routine christensen et al 2005 2008 which allows manipulation of vulnerability and production rates instead this method was employed by either including or removing walter s hab severity index as a driver for the hab fleet if the mortality imposed by the fleet is set to zero the hab fleet would not remove biomass and therefore would represent the system with no k brevis impacts a separate pseudo hab fleet was created specifically for gag so that bloom related mortality on gag could be manipulated more precisely thus we used two pseudo fishing fleets to represent hab effects one for gag and one for everything else the effect of habs was not entered directly as a mortality driver but as a relative effort driver acting on the pseudo hab fleet meanwhile effort data nmfs 2013 were used to force effort on all other fleets in the model this arrangement is a work around that allows all species including gag to be driven by multiple independent effort series without prescribing the amount of catch or red tide mortality allowing instead for ecosim to estimate these thus the resulting natural mortality series for gag may be influenced by fisheries habs and trophic dynamics the magnitude of mortality caused by the pseudo hab fleets was to be driven using a k brevis severity index from 1998 to 2010 walter et al 2013 table a4 this index provided a quantitative scale of how severe the k brevis blooms were year to year with more severe years having a higher value the index was developed by walter et al 2013 using a generalized additive model gam that predicts the probability of a k brevis bloom using a suite of satellite remote sensing products e g chlorophyll concentration chlorophyll anomalies morel backscatter rrs670 satellite data for the index were obtained from sea viewing wide field of view sensor seawifs daily or twice daily imagery the offshore index was used since it was less affected by bottom reflectance and because adult gag habitat is primarily offshore walter s severity index was looped to extend the trend back further from its original 1998 starting year so that the series could start at 1980 thus hab forcing prior to 1998 is hypothetical but realistic in terms of amplitude and frequency the absolute magnitude of effect for the pseudo hab fleets was scaled by use of an anchor point method which grounded one of the years in the severity index to an observed mortality rate for gag sedar 2009 estimated that there was an 18 decrease in the gag stock biomass during the severe 2005 bloom thus we scaled the effect of the pseudo hab fleet so that the 2005 mortality rate for gag amounted to 10 15 or 20 of total gag biomass table a5 the range was used to test the sensitivity of the model to bloom amplitude other years were set according to walter s severity index scaled proportionally to the fixed 2005 value the mortality effect was applied to adult stanzas and juvenile stanzas bloom related mortality was scaled to other groups using the fish kill database fwri 2012 the fish kill database is a record between 2001 and 2010 of all fish strandings seen along the gulf coast of florida during k brevis bloom events approximate numbers of dead fish and the species included are reported by the public to the fish kill hotline the database was used to create an index of vulnerability to blooms so that species more prevalent in the record would be affected more strongly by the blooms to determine bloom related mortality on other functional groups the prevalence of gag in the fish kill database was first determined as an average proportion of total fish kill the averaged proportion that each functional group made up of the fish kill database was compared to gag s proportion in the fish kill database the difference between each functional group s proportion and gag s proportion was then used as an index to scale each functional group s magnitude of mortality compared to gag s magnitude since total biomass lost to bloom related mortality was known for gag these calculations would then be used as biomass killed by habs in 1980 see appendix table a5 2 5 balancing and tuning the historical model time series were used to calibrate the historical model model outputs could be fit to time series by adjusting ecosim vulnerability parameters which control density dependent feeding rates walters et al 1997 an optimization routine changes vulnerabilities through an iterative process until model fit improves based on a sum of squared deviations ss criterion for each functional group lower ss values suggests an improvement in fit to time series initially vulnerabilities were optimized across predators all prey items were assumed equally vulnerable to a given predator subsequently a sensitivity test determined the top 30 predator prey interactions that influenced the residuals those 30 predator prey interactions were then optimized again with each interaction free to vary independently this two step process ensures that all vulnerabilities are improved to some degree and a core of influential vulnerabilities are near optimal these optimizations were done with the inclusion of k brevis bloom effects to compare how k brevis blooms affect the model s ability to recreate data bloom related mortality driving the hab fleet was removed and another optimization was performed with the top 30 predator species the ss was recorded again for each functional group the final version of the historical model that was used for this study can be accessed and downloaded at http scholarcommons usf edu msc facpub 219 2 6 application of the model model simulations first investigated if k brevis blooms improved the model s ability to recreate the observed time series of catch and biomass data between 1980 and 2009 as a second objective top down and bottom up food web effects were investigated by comparing biomass and productivity differences in the ecosystem when k brevis bloom effects were included and when they were not note that bottom up effects are not applied to planktonic functional groups but to low trophic level forage fish groups to simplify model output we look at bloom related effects within groups of taxa the groups we examine include all ewe functional groups only finfish functional groups only functional groups directly affected by blooms see appendix table a4 and several combinations of groups that have similar diets or similar habitat preferences total mortality was used as an index of productivity at model equilibrium mortality should equal production the potential for k brevis blooms to structure a community was also investigated as an index for community change the following biodiversity indices were calculated at each time step of the simulation shannon shannon 1948 kempton q kempton and taylor 1976 inverse simpson simpson 1949 and gini simpson simpson 1949 jost 2006 shannon calculates evenness in our application kempton q responds to both species richness and evenness inverse simpson calculates the probability that two species drawn at random will be the same an index of richness and finally gini simpson calculates the probability that two species drawn at random will be different an index of richness changes in biomass and productivity across trophic levels were examined 3 results 3 1 west florida shelf response bloom related mortality associated with k brevis improved the model s ability to recreate the time series sum of squares was reduced by 5 6 the fits for 70 of the functional groups to which k brevis bloom effects were directly applied saw improvement by an average of 5 using the ss criterion functional groups that show the greatest improvements when hab effects are included are demersal coastal invertebrate eaters adult gag and structure associated coastal piscivores table 1 in addition to these improvements many functional groups had model fits that agreed well with the biomass time series when bloom related mortality was included comprising of seabirds large oceanic piscivores coastal sharks adult and juvenile red grouper adult and juvenile gag adult and juvenile striped mullet lane snapper sardine and herring and shrimps see appendix fig a1 model fits to landings data agreed well with spanish mackerel adult and juvenile gag red drum pinfish sardine and herring shrimp and lobster functional groups see appendix fig a2 total system biomass was not strongly affected by blooms there was also no significant effect on overall finfish biomass however there was a small 1 15 increase in hab impacted species biomass when habs were present scenarios that grouped functional groups with similar diets suggested that piscivores planktivores and detritivores increased in biomass while invertebrate eaters and omnivores decreased fig 3 further when these feeding guilds are organized by trophic level there is evidence of a trophic cascade with an alternating pattern of biomass increases and decreases hab impacted species showed an increase in mortality rate relative to a no bloom scenario e g gag in fig 4 no significant diversity changes at the ecosystem level were found in either shannon or kempton q tests finfish and hab impacted species decreased in diversity with bloom effects as seen in both the shannon and kempton q indices to further investigate diversity changes in the ecosystem shannon indices were calculated to determine if differences could be found between pelagic functional groups fig 5 a and benthic functional groups fig 5b pelagic groups had a decreased shannon index value while benthic groups had an increased shannon index value these can be attributed to changes in species evenness this implies that high biomass dominant groups were impacted proportionately more than low biomass groups in the benthic environment this was not the case in the pelagic environment 3 2 gag case study gag decreased in biomass when bloom related mortality was included in the model fig 6 productivity on the other hand increased when bloom related mortality was included see fig 4 we assume that changes in p b reflect changes in m in a near equilibrium system natural mortality on gag see appendix table a5 ranges between 0 22 and 0 25 yr 1 with increasing variability towards the end of the simulation the k brevis bloom related mortality fig 7 ranges between 0 02 to 0 15 yr 1 and displays the same increase in variability towards the end of the simulation bloom related mortality represents 6 5 of gag total mortality which exceeds the sum of predation mortality from all predators combined fig 7 low predation on adult gag means that the total natural mortality trend closely reflects the k brevis bloom related mortality trend gag consumption of its prey was found to increase when bloom related mortality is present as compared to consumption with no bloom related mortality fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 west florida shelf responses broadly the west florida shelf k brevis model identified that k brevis blooms may have little impact on total system biomass productivity or diversity but these aggregate indices do not necessarily reflect changing species compositions differences were found when different sections of the food web were investigated more closely the most pronounced changes were seen in pelagic finfish and in benthic finfish and invertebrates mortality by blooms increased the biomass of many functional groups piscivores planktivores and detritivores experienced increases in biomass in the presence of blooms gannon et al 2009 performed fish surveys in sarasota bay and the adjacent gulf of mexico and found similar increases in filter feeders such as clupeids during k brevis hab events they hypothesized that clupeids were perhaps more tolerant of brevetoxin poisoning were better able to metabolize brevetoxin or were perhaps better able to detect and avoid patches of k brevis or brevetoxin such mechanisms would not be simulated in the ecopath model constructed for this study instead we hypothesize that bloom mortality applied to a range of species could result in reduced competition as a result of top down effects estes and palmisano 1974 pace et al 1999 paine 1980 certain groups may benefit if increases in productivity due to alleviation of competition outweigh any direct mortality imposed by k brevis in contrast to functional groups that increased in biomass omnivores and invertebrate eaters decreased in biomass these decreases may be attributable to direct mortality from k brevis and or increases in predation rate alternatively increases seen in biomass in the model could be attributed to the removal of older individuals for many species k brevis was modelled primarily as a top down driver due to the fact that bloom mortality was applied as a strong influence on adult age classes the placement of bloom mortality reduced the average age of the functional groups leaving younger more productive individuals this is modelled explicitly in the case of age structured groups and implicitly in the case of single stanza groups the younger fish also tend to feed lower in the food web ewe resolves diet into juvenile and adult predators and therefore have greater biomass of prey available compared to the adults the west florida shelf k brevis model was also able to show that bloom mortality acting on high trophic level adult fish caused a release of predation mortality on prey species leading to a trophic cascade a clear alternating pattern of biomass increasing and decreasing by trophic level suggests that indirect bloom effects extend far throughout the food web and have the potential to alter community structure substantially the trophic cascade demonstrates that k brevis imposes a top down effect on the organismal community shannon diversity comparisons of model outputs suggested a decrease in population evenness in pelagic finfish and an increase in population evenness of benthic finfish and invertebrates the most likely reason for these results was that mortality imposed by k brevis blooms was not proportional across functional groups the increased evenness in benthic finfish indicates that numerically dominant species tend to be impacted disproportionately to less abundant species this could be an artifact of modelling dominant species in the food web may be over represented in the fish kill database as these are the species that tend to be reported by imposing greater mortalities on dominant groups particularly for benthic groups which made up a larger portion of the fish kill database population evenness would increase pelagic finfish on the other hand were less affected by k brevis mortality these groups made up a smaller proportion of the fish kill reports as would be expected if these groups were more capable of avoiding areas experiencing a bloom event the episodic nature of k brevis blooms seems to be increasing in frequency and severity van dolah 2000 brand and compton 2007 and it is likely that the blooms will play an increasingly important community structuring role in the region smith 1975 1979 studied communities on patch reefs in the gulf of mexico by recording presence and absence of fish species smith estimated a 77 decline of resident fish species and attributed that to indirect hypoxia effects however density or abundance were not quantified gannon et al 2009 recorded a 37 decline in overall number of fish species during k brevis blooms during their fish surveys in sarasota bay but they determined that hypoxia did not appear to be a significant factor in explaining the decline both studies indicated that k brevis blooms greatly influence community structures in affected regions understanding how habs affect food webs in situ however would require long term independent monitoring approaches that would be costly and possibly prohibitively so which makes food web modelling exercises such as this study important many of the trophodynamically important species e g forage fish benthic pelagic invertebrates are not regularly monitored by existing programs therefore measuring food web effects in situ would necessitate wide coverage to investigate those species and their habitats although the west florida shelf k brevis model demonstrated that habs have the potential to affect the food web in fundamental ways the model was limited by the aggregated functional groups of the ewe model habs may potentially have a larger effect on community composition if episodic disturbances provide an advantage to pioneer species these tend to be hardy species and the first to colonize new habitats likewise episodic disturbance might be a disadvantage to climax species which are late colonizers well suited to high competition environments see intermediate disturbance hypothesis by paine and vadas 1969 grime 1973 and connell 1978 since succession dynamics are not modelled in ewe an increase in pioneer species can manifest as increases in biomass of high productivity groups and a decrease in climax species can manifest as decreases in biomass of low productivity groups despite this limitation both of these effects were seen in the presence of blooms the west florida shelf k brevis model is also limited by its diet matrix since this input has large impacts on the predictions that can be made it is common that there is high uncertainty in the diets assumed for fish and invertebrates in ecopath models e g walters et al 2008 heymans et al 2016 making the diet matrix typically the most uncertain aspect of the model in recent years several methods have been developed in the u s gulf of mexico to construct diet matrices for ecosystem models based on probabilistic approaches masi et al 2014 sagarese et al 2016 tarnecki et al 2016 such methods were not incorporated into this study and consequently the uncertainty in the results obtained from this modelling exercise are not explicitly modeled further though the west florida shelf k brevis model is still based largely on a pre existing and accepted model okey and mahmoudi 2002 diagnostics to evaluate and validate ecopath basic input parameters used in the model could be done using the methods developed by link 2010 and darwall et al 2010 to improve the model s performance to inform fisheries management heymans et al 2016 grüss et al 2017 modelling k brevis proves to be a difficult task which makes this study important particularly for its attempt to address k brevis impact on fish mortality predicting the impact of k brevis blooms on florida s fish and fisheries has been problematic because k brevis cell counts and fish mortality are not well correlated though there have been great efforts to study k brevis bloom initiation and dynamics despite all of the difficulties in accurately modelling k brevis tides these findings support the use of composite series like walter s severity index to impose bloom related mortality in ecosystem modelling studies or in stock assessments since the index was found to improve the model s ability to fit to the data these findings are particularly relevant given the k brevis bloom that began in october 2017 and continues to plague both the east and west coast of florida as of fall 2018 while the methods employed for this study cannot predict the severity and persistence of a k brevis bloom an analysis to estimate fish mortality resulting from the bloom could be performed by comparing the indices of historical blooms to recent blooms by updating walter s severity index for more recent years including the bloom of 2018 the index is especially helpful for species such as gag or red grouper which have low natural mortality otherwise e g gray et al 2013 sagarese et al 2017 and can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses or improve the fit of stock assessment models to time series data 4 2 gag case study gag is an apex predator with few natural predators mortality associated with k brevis blooms therefore made up a significant portion of their natural mortality the natural mortality trend for gag which includes predation and mortality resulting from k brevis blooms closely reflects the k brevis hab mortality trend suggesting that composite series like the severity index may be usable as a relative index of natural mortality in future assessments for species like gag natural mortality of gag that was estimated from this study which fell between 0 22 and 0 25 yr 1 was notably higher than the estimated 0 15 yr 1 natural mortality that was calculated using empirical approaches sedar 2009a the natural mortality used in the sedar stock assessment was estimated using age information from gag otoliths collected over a two year time span using ewe to estimate natural mortality is a potentially valuable method to supplement catch curve analysis and in particular to partition out predation mortality from other sources like habs gray et al 2013 gray 2014 further though gag biomass decreased when k brevis bloom mortality was included gag productivity and consumption increased these results can be rationalized as either reduced intraspecific competition or a reduced mean age of the group despite the fact that k brevis mortality tended to be applied to older age classes any sources of mortality would tend to skew the age distribution toward younger individuals since the probability of reaching adulthood is decreased therefore the finding that k brevis increases overall productivity of the stock is robust to structural uncertainty in the modelling approach however the decreased biodiversity within finfish and hab impacted species also points to the possibility that at higher levels of effect there may be a reduction in niche specialization with less efficient use of resources and lower stock productivity a difficulty with modelling k brevis is that the blooms begin offshore before being advected inshore impacting only those populations that overlap in time and space including a spatio temporal component to the model using ecospace could help improve the model s ability to inform fisheries management particularly for species such as gag which are sex changing and are spatially segregated most of the year available spatial data may be a limiting factor 4 3 conclusions the results obtained from the west florida shelf k brevis model ultimately supports the notion that entire ecosystems should be considered holistically particularly when addressing mortality events such as k brevis blooms if such responses can result from a relatively small source of mortality aimed at top predators perhaps there are implications that can be taken from this study for modelling exercises of other mortality events such as cold kills oil spills and climate change in the u s gulf of mexico and elsewhere the modelling efforts here show that an index of severity of these environmental functions can be generated as a time series to successfully improve model fits and realism of the model other population models such as those used in stock assessments could greatly benefit from building on the west florida shelf k brevis model or by representing other sources of natural mortality in a similar fashion
