22700,in this study combined discrete wavelet transform fuzzy dwt fuzzy and combined continuous wavelet transform fuzzy cwt fuzzy models are developed for predicting the daily water levels at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus strait the observed daily water level data is decomposed into spectral bands sub series by using wavelet transformation as a pre processing tool in order to achieve more accurate daily water level predictions with extended lead times up to 7 days the time series of daily water level data is decomposed into spectral bands which are used as inputs into the fuzzy model and the daily water levels are predicted from the sum of the predicted components spectral bands a predictive model is developed using combined dwt fuzzy and combined cwt fuzzy models to predict water level fluctuations it is found that cwt fuzzy model performed better than dwt fuzzy and stand alone fuzzy models for prediction lead times up to 7 days at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus based on rmse and ce evaluation criteria it is concluded that cwt is a better pre processing technique as it yields more accurate daily water level predictions with improved prediction lead times than dwt keywords bosphorus strait wavelet fuzzy water level predictions 1 introduction determination of water level variation characteristics of bosphorus strait which joins the black sea and the sea of marmara is significant in terms of environmental pollution analysis of the district construction of hydraulic structures coastal management projects and transportation planning since only connection of the land blocked black sea to the open seas is bosphorus strait it also controlled the water budget of the black sea in many studies investigating the mediterranean and black sea hydraulics bosphorus currents that accommodate the water balance between these seas were the topic yuce 1996 maderich and konstantinov 2002 matthiesen and haines 2003 myers et al 2003 currents generated by the water level difference between the neighbouring water masses are the most important oceanographic factors affecting the water surface variations of the bosphorus where heavy maritime traffic exists short time prediction of water level fluctuations is becoming more important not only for the maritime traffic planning but also for the increasing under water tunnel construction phases oda et al 2009 unsteady state level fluctuation patterns at the northern and southern boundary of bosphorus their complicated relationships with each other and surrounding physical constraints complicate the physical and mathematical modelling of the strait in the past years interactions of water levels at northern and southern boundaries of bosphorus along with meteorological and hydrological variations were investigated by implementing short time measurements bogdanova 1965 gunnerson et al 1974 Ã§ecen et al 1981 de filippi et al 1986 buyukay 1989 yuce and alpar 1994 the water mass inflow from black sea where freshwater inflow is relatively high and evaporation is relatively low causes the water level of the northern boundary to be higher than the southern boundary during the year however local meteorologic conditions may force the surface slope exhibit non linear behaviour and with the effect of strong northern winds the slope may be zero or even reversed gunnerson et al 1974 de filippi et al 1986 periods of the components that cause fluctuations in the bosphorus water level vary in large scale these fluctuations which occur as a reaction to tides winds atmospheric conditions and freshwater runoffs of black sea are unsteady alpar and yuce 1998 even though one day or half day periodic tide waves are easily separable they have minor influence on the water level of semi closed black sea and sea of marmara gregg et al 1999 the components that are specified as long term variations and effect the water level in 13 14 day periods originate generally from meteorologic changes alpar et al 2000 seasonal water level variations are related with the annual discharge variations in danube river which is the most important freshwater source of black sea sur et al 1994 ozsoy et al 1996 harmonic analysis method is the most reliable model for long term sea water level prediction when long data records are available whereas wavelet network method is the most reliable model used for short term sea water level prediction when short data records are available el diasty et al 2018 developed a hybrid water level prediction method combining the traditional harmonic analysis and modern wavelet network method while harmonic analysis separates the tidal constituents wavelet network forecasts future water level from decomposed water level time series data by harmonic analysis wavelet network is supported by ann backpropagation tool parameter estimation phase the harmonic analysis method is employed to separate harmonic tidal level component nonlinear water level fluctuations caused by various meteorological factors such as water temperature wind speed wind direction and atmospheric pressure is modelled by a variable ann the final results are obtained by summation of harmonic and nonlinear series predictions these models which consist of a large number of input components were utilized in estimating the 1 h to 24 h water levels in a similar study yin et al 2018 have used dwt to separate residual term which involves the influences of meteorological factors other random fluctuations and random noises modelled by harmonic analysis and ann combination real time prediction model chen et al 2007 developed ann wavelet model to accurately predict and supply the missing tide data for a long period 1 5 years they used only a very short period data as a training data set in artificial neural network back propagate ann bp model in addition the results showed that the concept of tidal constituent phase lags can improve ann model of tidal forecasting and data supplement the addition of the wavelet analysis to ann method can prominently improve the prediction quality over the past decades generally 3d models were implemented to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the bosphorus sozer and ozsoy 2017 built a hydrodynamic model by using ideal and real strait geometry and observed that water elevation difference between northern and southern boundary of bosphorus increases due to the wind and flow currents from the black sea yuksel et al 2008 predicted the effects of long and short term variations in the level fluctuation patterns individually and found similarities with the total observed fluctuation data oda et al 2009 developed a predictive regression model to estimate the current flow of bosphorus by taking meterological data and short term water level fluctuations into account model results revealed that the dominant atmospheric pressure and wind speed effects the short term water level fluctuations for all the aforementioned studies every single forcing term obtained from the detailed measurement systems which were utilized to represent the complicated dynamic structure of the bosphorus were used as inputs to the models reliable water level characterization requires regular long term measurements obtained from the various parts of bosphorus unfortunately technical and economical resources limit the number and the service life time of stations for a long while a station web that regularly measures the water level in the bosphorus strait already exists in this study spectral analysis of the existing water level measurement data will be performed and future water levels predictions will be obtained water level fluctuations of bosporus are predicted by the combination of various complicated physical processes with different time varying frequencies fourier analysis is a classical approach for spectral decomposition of original time series data but most of the time fourier analysis which makes use of infinite sinusoids with constant frequencies is insufficient in representation of original time series data that exhibits unsteady fluctuations labat 2005 besides periods of the physical processes which determine the water level fluctuations vary in a wide range such as hours and decades alpar and yuce 1998 bastos et al 2013 the wavelet transformation wt extracts the time and frequency information with high resolution that is present in the original data in other words wt is able to analyze the time series which is a method to overcome the stationarity that other methods could face zhang et al 2017 in water level fluctuation analysis wavelet transformation has been used for decomposition of short time components such as tides jay and flinchem 1997 and subtides percival and mofjeld 1997 and long time components like seasonality effects kumar and foufoula georgiou 1993 flinchem and jay 2000 ozger et al 2012 altunkaynak 2014 mehr et al 2014 altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 2016 due to the dynamic and non linear characteristics of bosphorus water level fluctuations skillful models that can establish complicated relationships between different variables using time series of water level data are needed to improve prediction accuracy conventional modelling techniques may be insufficient in solving non linear systems in constrast hybrid models with data processing capabilities have plenty of advantages over conventional models for the phenomenon that involve many variables and the underlying physics can not be comprehended by all means el diasty et al 2018 water level fluctuations are composed of lots of irregular spectral components therefore accurate yet practical predictive models are required for determination of wave characteristics to the best of our knowledge wavelet fuzzy w fuzzy model has not been used for accurate prediction of water level at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus strait for this purpose the wavelet technique is utilized as a pre processing tool to decompose the observed daily water levels time series data into wavelets spectral bands which enables extracting valuable information such as trend periodicity noise etc therefore initiated with the main purpose of comparing the performance of the continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt obtained spectral bands then used as inputs into the fuzzy model to improve prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time up to 7 days the objectives of this present study are 1 to utilize the continuous wavelet transform cwt as a pre processing technique and compare its performance with the discrete wavelet transform dwt since it is the most widely used pre processing technique in recent ocean engineering researches 2 to improve the prediction accuracy and extend lead time prediction of daily water levels at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus strait 3 to develop hybrid discrete wavelet transform fuzzy dwt fuzzy and continuous wavelet transform fuzzy cwt fuzzy models for improving prediction accuracy of daily water levels and extending lead times up to 7 days 4 to investigate the performance of the stand alone fuzzy combined discrete wavelet transform fuzzy dwt fuzzy and combined continuous wavelet transform fuzzy cwt fuzzy models in addition the dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy models prediction results were compared with those of the stand alone fuzzy model by utilizing root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce nash and sutcliffe 1970 as performance evaluation criteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area bosphorus strait connecting the black sea and the sea of marmara plays a significant role in terms of maritime and submarine transportation as well as coastal and water resources management the only way out of black sea to the open seas is bosphorus therefore straits are heavily used for international maritime transportation in addition to local passenger cargo transportation and fishing purposes the strong relationship between the bosphorus water level and current speeds further enhances the importance of water level prediction considering the heavy maritime traffic aydogan et al 2010 altan and otay 2017 bosphorus also controls the pollution transportation as well as the water masses of the basins it connects a significant part of the population of istanbul one of the crowdest cities in the world live in the coastlines constantly increasing population of istanbul necessitates the underwater construction projects to provide new connections between asian and european parts of the city in the present study daily water level data obtained from the preliminary studies of marmaray project that links the two continents is used numerical modelling of the water motions of bosphorus is more complicated than the other straits in the world due to its complex bathymetry and rapidly varying physical parameters throughout bosphorus strait is 31 km long and has a varying width between 0 7 km and 3 5 km with an average of 1 3 km at the narrowing and shallowing parts current speed increases and eddies and swirlings form in the inlets ozsoy et al 2002 maximum and minimum water level elevations are 100 m and 30 m respectively sills present at the northern and southern boundaries also influence the currents of the straits most of the time a stratified current exists in the bosphorus where relatively low saline water of black sea flows over the sea of marmara from upper layer while more saline waters coming from the meditterenean sea flows from the sea of marmara to the black sea from lower layer unluata et al 1990 ozsoy et al 1996 irregular structure of the topography and the coastline with the prevailing wind system complicate the hydrodynamic analysis of the strait arisoy and akyarli 1990 ozsoy et al 1998 maderich and konstantinov 2002 modelled the black sea bosphorus seasonal water elevation variations and found a linear relationship between the discharges of upper and lower layers of bosphorus and the water elevation difference between the two ends of the strait 2 2 data collection and analysis in this study water elevation and pressure data is obtained from meteorologic and ctd conductivity temperature depth recorder stations which were established within the marmaray project measurement program was carried out by taisei corporation japan on behalf of turkish general directorate water elevation data is gathered from the meteorologic stations and wave gauge sensors located at northern and southern boundary of the straits location of the stations are shown in fig 1 wind speed direction and atmospheric pressure data is obtained from the stations termed as c and d where conductivity temperature and depth data was obtained from ctd stations termed as a and b fig 2 shows the original water level time series obtained from the measurements are collected at northern and southern the bosphorus as can be seen from fig 2 water level time series data of the sea of marmara is more oscillatory compared to those of black sea this implies that daily water level data of the sea of marmara involves more uncertainty rather as opposed to black sea water level data the mean median standard deviation and skewness parameters were of daily water level data were calculated for northern and southern boundary of bosphorus individually and presented in table 1 according data between the time period september 2004 and december 2005 water level variations occurred within the range of 0 14 m and 0 50 m at the northern entrance of bosphorus and 0 35 m and 0 62 m at the southern entrance of the bosphorus considering the 15 month data it is observed that in general water level at the black sea entrance is relatively higher than the entrance of the sea of marmara due to the strong north winds that blew throughout the day between the time period november and january high tides surging uprising formed and the sea of marmara level exceeded black sea level yuksel et al 2008 from the beginning of april the river runoffs of the black sea reach the bosporus increasing elevation difference between the two entrance of the strait in addition long amplitude water level fluctuations that were generated by short time transient variations are replaced by relatively low amplitude fluctuations sur et al 1994 ozsoy et al 1996 past studies investigated the relationship between the average monthly currents of the danube river which is the biggest freshwater source of black sea and the water level variations at the northern boundary of bosphorus it was found that the bosphorus water level is affected two months after the commencement of the danube river runoff under the assumption of 10 20 cm s average current speed sur et al 1994 yuksel et al 2008 in this study stand alone fuzzy combined dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy models are developed for accurate prediction of the daily water level fluctuations and extend prediction lead times up to 7 days the observed daily water levels at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus are decomposed into four sub series spectral bands by using dwt and cwt techniquies then the decomposed sub series are used as inputs into the fuzzy model to obtain a more accurate prediction water levels and improve prediction lead times up to 7 days 2 3 description of the preprocessing method 2 3 1 description of wavelet transforms wavelet transformations are mathematical functions to analyze time series data in both time and frequency domain its success in transforming unsteady and quickly fluctuating time series data increased the implementation of the wavelet transformations for investigation of hydrological phenomenon involving interrelations of different complicated natural processes whitcher et al 2000 terashima et al 2001 sang 2013 altunkaynak 2014 altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 dadu and deka 2016 hadi and tombul 2018 wavelet transformation foundations are based on fourier transforms where data time series are represented by sinusoids with constant frequency even tough infinite sinusoid waves can represent frequency information for some cases time information of spectral content cannot be captured to overcome the preceding drawback of fourier transform gabor 1946 introduced a constant width filtering window function throughout the data series and embedded into fourier kernel on the other hand wavelet transformation is a varying dimensional windowing technique which allows noise removal discontinuity identification and time frequency analysis two heavily implemented methods in wavelet transformation are continuous wavelet transformation cwt and discrete wavelet transformation dwt main differences between two methods can be summarized as analysis resolution and amount of processing cwt is advantageous for detecting local and transient variations in the time series by its detailed exemplification principle while dwt allows the representation of the main typical characteristics of the signal by sparse subbands therefore dwt is excessively used for data compression and signal transmission rioul and duhamel 1992 yoon et al 2010 cwt exhibits high signal analysis capabilities by utilizing excessive transformation parameters and thus requires relatively bigger computational resources compared to dwt altunkaynak and ozger 2016 hadi and tombul 2018 compared dwt cwt and combination of these two decomposition methods and showed that each preporcessing tool has different degree of sensitivity for different hydrological time series data 2 3 1 1 continuous wavelet transform continuous wavelet transform cwt is the convolution of the scaled wavelet functions and the signal following equation indicates the multiplication of time series x t which consists of n measurement data with the wavelet function for every translation step where b is the translation parameter a is the scale parameter and Ï is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function 1 c w t x t Ï a b t 1 a t 0 n 1 x t Ï t b a transformation coefficients that are calculated for every translated position of the wavelet function and selected scale represent the wavelet transformation time series consistency compliance relatively greater coefficients indicate relatively greater correlation between the wavelet and the signal all local wavelet spectra is transferred to the average wavelet spectrum by power distribution coefficient c 2 c 1 n i 1 n c w t a b 2 to be able to average wavelet energy spectrum for time and scale dimensions facilitate the evaluation of energy distribution for particular frequency bands torrence and compo 1998 the decomposed spectral bands by cwt tool are depicted in fig 3 pre processing tool is supposed to remove the trend and seasonality components from the original data and decompose the data into spectral bands to enhance the prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead times all local wavelet coefficients found in different scales are reduced into average wavelet spectrum by taking the time average of power distribution coefficient c for all scales the spectral bands sub series are constructed according to the power distribution in the average wavelet spectra the scales that have similar powers are grouped as one spectral band according to ozger 2010 the optimum number of spectral bands should be between 3 and 6 to represent the original time series data sufficiently spectral intervals of each band can be obtained by trial and error method 2 3 1 2 discrete wavelet transform in the discrete wavelet transform dwt method instead of continuous transformation parameters transformation process is performed for only certain scales and thus frequency scale information over all time is obtained with fewer coefficients scale and translation parameters are given as a 2 j and b k 2 j where j represents the filtering step and k represents the location then wavelet transformations for time series x n is defined by the formula 3 d w t x n Ï j k n 1 2 j n 0 n 1 x n Ï n 2 j k to reproduce the original time series following formula is used 4 x n a j 1 j k 0 2 j j 1 d w t x n Ï j k n 1 2 j Ï n 2 j k or 5 x t a j 1 j d j t in this manner signal is separated into its components approximation a and detail d which represent the trend cycle component and detailed informations respectively in application dwt facilitates low pass and high pass filtering technique widely which was developed by mallat 1989 signal is passed through the high pass and low pass filters which are derived from the mother wavelet function and scale function possessing quadrature mirror relationship to carry out the decomposition process at every decomposition step high pass output detail band is separated and low pass output approximation band is furthered processed by dwt tool thus at every dwt step it is further approached to obtaining general high frequency signal information dwt is performed for four filtering scales where general character of the series is represented by approximation a and details of the series are represented by band 1 d1 band 2 d2 band 3 d3 and band 4 d4 which corresponds to four different energy levels as shown in fig 4 details d1 d2 d3 and d4 and approximation a represent high frequency and low frequency of time series data respectively in other words d1 d2 d3 d4 and a are defined as noise and trend cycle respectively in this present study two types of wavelet transforms namely dwt and cwt are investigated as pre processing techniquies in terms of improving prediction accuracy and extending prediction lead times of fuzzy model predictive models are developed to forecast daily water level fluctuations at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus and also to enhance the performance of fuzzy model 2 4 description of the models 2 4 1 fuzzy based model zadeh 1965 who first introduced the fuzzy group theory in his study demonstrated that graded transition from membership to being a non member resembles the human thinking system and thus fuzzy logic is more successful than the traditional logic for representation of many real life natural phenomenon fuzzy systems comprise of fuzzy subsets and rules that provide a mathematical cause and effect function between inputs and outputs a fuzzy inference system consists of 3 main phases namely fuzzification inference and defuzzification fuzzification is a decomposition process of values assets which are described as certain in real life but vary continuously between 0 and 1 via membership functions in fuzzy sets fuzzification process provides speeding up the decision making mechanism by classifying the variables cause and effect relationships between fuzzy sets are determined by fuzzy if then rules defuzzification process is the transformation of fuzzy sets which are the inference phase results to obtain numerical values in this study mathematical relationships between two previous values wl t 1 and wl t and current wl t 1 and future values for lead time l wl t l are established in a sugeno type process which is a convenient method where numerical data exists and instead of fuzzy output sets a distinct linear equation or constant is used for every rule ri 6 r i i f w l t 1 i s a 1 a n d w l t i s b 2 t h e n w l t l a w l t 1 b w l t c hybrid models that utilize combination of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks anns to optimize the constants a b and c in the consequent part are called adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis prediction values are obtained by considering the contribution of membership degree to the rule outputs anfis calculation steps for water level determination are shown in fig 5 in sugone inference system the results yielded by defuzzification process for each rule affects the output value as much as corresponding weights obtained from their membership degrees takagi and sugeno 1985 7 w t 1 y i w i w i 2 4 2 the combined wavelet fuzzy based models in this present study wt is utilized to decompose the daily water level fluctuations data into a certain number of sub signals at different temporal scales to be used as inputs into the fuzzy model to improve the daily water level prediction accuracy and extend the prediction lead time up to 7 days the fuzzy model is used as a modelling tool to undertake predictions by using each sub signal as an individual input into the model in other words hybrid predictive models are developed by combining wavelet transformation as a pre processing tool with fuzzy model these hybrid models are termed as the combined dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy models and their performances are compared in terms of predicting the daily water level fluctuations at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus for prediction lead times of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 days pre processing and modelling steps are given in fig 6 2 5 performance evaluation criteria in this study the performance of stand alone fuzzy combined dwt fuzzy and ctw fuzzy models are investigated by utilizing the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coeffiecient of efficiency ce as performance evaluation criteria according to solomatine and dulal 2003 and altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 rmse and the ce are extensively used and most commonly accepted performance evaluation criteria rmse is described as 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y p i y o i 2 where n is the measurement number yoi and ypi is represents the measurement and prediction values respectively a model that yields relatively smaller rmse values is considered relatively more successful the coefficient of efficiency is implemented as a measure of the performance of the prediction model which is extensively used to evaluate the performance of the model ce is defined as 9 c e 1 i 1 n y p i y o i 2 i 1 n y m i y a 2 here n is the total number of observations y pi y mi and y a refer to the predicted observed and mean of the observed daily water level values respectively ce approximately close to 1 points out a very good agreement between the observed data and the results of models according to moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the models are unsatisfactory if ce values are smaller than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 categorized the performance of the models based on ce values accordingly ce corresponding to range between 0 65 and 0 75 0 75 and 0 85 and greater than 0 85 are classified as fair good and very good respectively based on the preceding performance evaluation criteria in this study the smallest rmse and biggest ce values are considered as the best model for prediction of daily water level data 3 results and discussion stand alone fuzzy and wavelet fuzzy models are developed to improve the prediction accuracy of daily water level fluctuations of northern and southern boundary of bosphorus for extended lead time predictions up to 7 days the predictive model results are validated quantitively by utilizing root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coeffiecient of efficiency ce values as indicator criteria original water surface level measurements are used as inputs for the fuzzy models while the water level time series that are separated into equivalent energy sub series spectral bands by cwt and dwt are used as inputs into the fuzzy model number of inputs that will be used for the models are decided based on desired prediction error level from 15 month daily water level measurement data 60 of the data is used to establish the framework of the model and the remaining data corresponding to 40 is utilized for validation purposes effects of the input sets on the prediction results of the stand alone fuzzy model are presented in table 2 for 1 day lead time wl t 1 at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus when the previous value past day is used as input wl t to predict the current value wl t 1 calculated ce values of stand alone fuzzy model were 0 70 and 0 71 for northern and southern boundary respectively it is observed that the using two previous values wl t 1 and wl t enhanced the model performance with ce values of 0 73 and 0 72 respectively while using the water levels of three subsequent previous days wl t 2 wl t 1 and wl t relatively reduced the performance of the stand alone fuzzy model therefore in this present study for all models two previous values were used as inputs wl t 1 and wl t into the model which yielded the highest performance as a result the best architecture of the fuzzy model in lead time 1 was used for modelling with the pre processing tools for all the lead times in this study among the wavelet functions the daubechies3 db3 and morlet were used to decompose the daily water level data of bosphorus into four sub series spectral bands in dwt and cwt respectively among the various tested spectral band decompositions separation in to four spectral bands by dwt and cwt provided the most accurate prediction results fig 3 shows the decomposed original daily water level data into four spectral bands which are obtained from average wavelet power spectrum by cwt namely band 1 band 2 band 3 and band 4 also fig 4 depicts the separation of water level data into four sub series spectral bands by dwt as band 1 d1 band 2 d2 band 3 d3 band 4 d4 and also a4 representing the high frequency and the low frequency components of the water level data respectively in other words approximation and detail components represent the trend cycle and noise components respectively approximation a component has a more significant effect in obtaining the most accurate prediction results compared to detail d1 d2 d3 and d4 components the separated sub series four spectral bands by dwt and cwt are used individually as inputs into the fuzzy model and the predicted values are summed for reconstruction to obtain the predicted daily water levels the same architecture of the fuzzy model is used for each band band 1 band 2 band 3 and band 4 to accurately predict the water level fluctuations for extended lead times these models were developed to predict daily water levels from two previous values of time steps t 1 and t for lead times of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 day the flowchart of cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models is demonstrated in fig 6 the code of modelling has been written in matlab stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models prediction results for northern and southern boundary of bosphorus are given at tables 2 and 3 respectively calculated rmse of the prediction values at the northern boundary for 1 day lead time are 0 0041 m 0 0020 m and 0 0025 m for stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models respectively considering these results positive effects of combining cwt and dwt with fuzzy method is revealed as the time difference between the input set and prediction values increases prediction performance of the models are reduced due to the decreasing correlation with lags time step and processed data become more stable with respect to increasing time step for example rmse value of the stand alone fuzzy model at northern boundary increased up to the value of 0 0056 m for 2 days lead time and 0 0069 m for 7 days lead time great performance of cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models for 1 day lead time declined at a relatively smaller rate with rmse of 0 0041 m and 0 0047 m respectively as it is understood dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy model performances reached the 1 day lead time prediction wl t 1 performance of the stand alone fuzzy model even for the wl t 3 lead time 3 and wl t 7 lead time 7 prediction comparison of wavelet models revealed that cwt outperformed dwt for every prediction lead time sparse resolution feature of dwt as a decomposition technique cannot extract some of the localized information in the time series so that they cannot be represented in the sub series in addition at the northern boundary table 3 ce values for 1 day lead time were calculated as 0 73 0 93 and 0 89 for stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models respectively considering the ce value all model results had acceptable accuracy but cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models performed very good for lead time 2 ce value of the stand alone fuzzy model was calculated 0 46 which was under the defined accuracy limit 0 5 in the literature where cwt fuzzy model preserved very good performance with ce value of 0 92 and dwt fuzzy model performed good with 0 83 ce as a performance indicator demonstrated that fuzzy model approach was insufficient for accurate prediction after lead time 2 when unpreprocessed data is used as inputs even tough fuzzy approach could capture the relationship between the original water level measurements for only 1 day lead time it was able to extract the information of the relationship between water level components very accurately within the same frequency up to 7 day lead time for prediction of wl t 1 at the southern boundary table 4 calculated rmse values 0 0055 m 0 0030 m and 0 0030 m of stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models respectively indicate the high contribution of the wavelet transform to the prediction accuracy as it was at the northern boundary despite the increase of the time step compared to original data bands with same frequencies were more stable for preserving relationship with past values eventhough the stand alone fuzzy approach offers an applicable performance for water level prediction with a ce value of 0 72 combined wavelet with fuzzy models are superior due to their prediction ability with calculated ce value of 0 92 as the time between input and output values becomes 2 days models using the original data as input could not make any acceptable prediction ce value 0 42 and prediction accuracy further reduces for longer time periods between input and output the model that combined with cwt performed very good with ce 0 88 for 2 day wl t 2 lead time good with ce value of 0 76 for 3 day wl t 3 fair with ce value of 0 70 and 0 65 for wl t 6 and wl t 7 lead time respectively indicating that prediction accuracy is acceptable even for 7 day lead time common evaluation of model performances for both boundaries imply that for fuzzy model the decomposition of the water level fluctuation data into spectral bands both increase the prediction performance and predictability period for northern and southern boundaries measured data exactly reflects all the forcing components on the water level variations however the time information that fuzzy model could obtain from the raw original data was not enough to analyze the complicated bosphorus flow system in detail on the contrary wavelet transformation was able to extract the frequency information in addition to time information and enabled uniform decomposition of the system within itself therefore wavelet transformation enhanced the performance by presenting more sorted out and pure input into the model the reason that cwt yielded the best accuracy for all lead times is data is scanned continuously and short time variations in the data was totally captured unlike the dwt in addition to the success criteria for a better visual investigation of the prediction compatibility 1 1 scatter plots are embedded in to figs 7 9 for lead times 1 4 and 7 respectively scattering of the dots on the 450 line signifies a very good fit whereas a relatively larger scatter indicates relatively poor prediction accuracy a remarkable fit between prediction results and corresponding observed water level data can be seen from scattering plots for 1 day lead time as well as how the wavelet combined model results accumulate around the 1 1 line as shown in fig 7 as can be observed from fig 7a and 7b the stand alone fuzzy model performed fair for northern and southern boundaries for 1 day lead time while cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models were found to be very good as depicted in fig 7c 7d 7e and 7f respectively fig 8a and 8b illustrate the poor accuracy of the stand alone fuzzy model for prediction of water level fluctuations at both boundaries of the bosporus for 4 day lead time respectively as depicted in fig 8c and 8d cwt fuzzy model was found to be good in both boundaries for 4 day lead time while dwt fuzzy model was found to be fair as shown in fig 8e and 8f respectively for 7 day lead time prediction the stand alone fuzzy model performed very poor for both boundaries as depicted in fig 9a and 9b the cwt fuzzy model found acceptable even for 7 day lead time at the two boundaries as demonstrated in fig 9c and 9d respectively whereas dwt fuzzy model was found to be satisfactory for northern boundary except southern boundary for lead time of 7 day with unacceptable results as shown in fig 9e and 9f in general implementation of wavelet transformation as a pre processing technique improves the results of the fuzzy model for all locations but in particular cwt and dwt predicted better at the northern entrance of the bosporus with a relatively higher scattering of the dwt model up to lead time of 7 days the cwt fuzzy model can be used for prediction of water level fluctuations for northern and southern boundaries but the dwt fuzzy model performance was under the cwt fuzzy model and the stand alone fuzzy model results did not exhibit a good consistency with measurements by any means to summarize for relatively longer lead times the stand alone fuzzy model yielded the poorest results among the developed predictive models cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models prediction performances were high especially in 1 day lead time however as a pre processing technique cwt performed best 4 conclusions in this present study daily water level of bosporus were predicted by fuzzy method and wavelet as a pre processing tool 15 months of data obtained from level measurement stations located at the northern and southern boundaries were utilized stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models were developed to perform water level predictions up to 7 days and their performances were compared by well known evaluation criteria rmse and ce wavelet models are utilized to decompose the raw original data into spectral bands by wavelet transform and instead of raw data the bands were used as inputs into the fuzzy model using wavelet transformation where generated bands possess uniform frequency information at every time step highly increased the performance of the fuzzy models the cwt fuzzy model accurately predicted the daily water levels up to 7 days while the stand alone fuzzy model was only accurate up to 1 day as regards the dwt fuzzy model performance was acceptable for all lead times at the northern boundary but southern boundary predictions were acceptable for only up to 5 days lead time since bosporus water level fluctuations are generated by wide range forcing components complex system analysis is required for accurate predictions and fuzzy approach has become insufficient for this purpose combination of the wavelet transformation as a preprocessing tool with fuzzy method improved the model performance and extended accurate lead time predictions a comparison within the wavelet techniques that were utilized in this study shows that with its possession of detailed information cwtis ahead of dwt which has sparse resolution dwt tool which is only capable of representing the data with particular scaled wavelets missed to capture some instantaneous variations during the decomposition process and this drawback of dwt affected the accuracy of the results as it can be understood from the results of this study for level forecasting models it is more appropriate to utilize cwt as a wavelet transformation process considering the size of the variables influencing the water level of bosporus to develop more efficient models big size of data obtained from regular coordinated measurements are required for further studies frequency based relationships that can be established between the wavelet bands and the components constituting the water level and effects of its variations can be evaluated to develop more accurate level prediction models acknowledgements

22700,in this study combined discrete wavelet transform fuzzy dwt fuzzy and combined continuous wavelet transform fuzzy cwt fuzzy models are developed for predicting the daily water levels at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus strait the observed daily water level data is decomposed into spectral bands sub series by using wavelet transformation as a pre processing tool in order to achieve more accurate daily water level predictions with extended lead times up to 7 days the time series of daily water level data is decomposed into spectral bands which are used as inputs into the fuzzy model and the daily water levels are predicted from the sum of the predicted components spectral bands a predictive model is developed using combined dwt fuzzy and combined cwt fuzzy models to predict water level fluctuations it is found that cwt fuzzy model performed better than dwt fuzzy and stand alone fuzzy models for prediction lead times up to 7 days at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus based on rmse and ce evaluation criteria it is concluded that cwt is a better pre processing technique as it yields more accurate daily water level predictions with improved prediction lead times than dwt keywords bosphorus strait wavelet fuzzy water level predictions 1 introduction determination of water level variation characteristics of bosphorus strait which joins the black sea and the sea of marmara is significant in terms of environmental pollution analysis of the district construction of hydraulic structures coastal management projects and transportation planning since only connection of the land blocked black sea to the open seas is bosphorus strait it also controlled the water budget of the black sea in many studies investigating the mediterranean and black sea hydraulics bosphorus currents that accommodate the water balance between these seas were the topic yuce 1996 maderich and konstantinov 2002 matthiesen and haines 2003 myers et al 2003 currents generated by the water level difference between the neighbouring water masses are the most important oceanographic factors affecting the water surface variations of the bosphorus where heavy maritime traffic exists short time prediction of water level fluctuations is becoming more important not only for the maritime traffic planning but also for the increasing under water tunnel construction phases oda et al 2009 unsteady state level fluctuation patterns at the northern and southern boundary of bosphorus their complicated relationships with each other and surrounding physical constraints complicate the physical and mathematical modelling of the strait in the past years interactions of water levels at northern and southern boundaries of bosphorus along with meteorological and hydrological variations were investigated by implementing short time measurements bogdanova 1965 gunnerson et al 1974 Ã§ecen et al 1981 de filippi et al 1986 buyukay 1989 yuce and alpar 1994 the water mass inflow from black sea where freshwater inflow is relatively high and evaporation is relatively low causes the water level of the northern boundary to be higher than the southern boundary during the year however local meteorologic conditions may force the surface slope exhibit non linear behaviour and with the effect of strong northern winds the slope may be zero or even reversed gunnerson et al 1974 de filippi et al 1986 periods of the components that cause fluctuations in the bosphorus water level vary in large scale these fluctuations which occur as a reaction to tides winds atmospheric conditions and freshwater runoffs of black sea are unsteady alpar and yuce 1998 even though one day or half day periodic tide waves are easily separable they have minor influence on the water level of semi closed black sea and sea of marmara gregg et al 1999 the components that are specified as long term variations and effect the water level in 13 14 day periods originate generally from meteorologic changes alpar et al 2000 seasonal water level variations are related with the annual discharge variations in danube river which is the most important freshwater source of black sea sur et al 1994 ozsoy et al 1996 harmonic analysis method is the most reliable model for long term sea water level prediction when long data records are available whereas wavelet network method is the most reliable model used for short term sea water level prediction when short data records are available el diasty et al 2018 developed a hybrid water level prediction method combining the traditional harmonic analysis and modern wavelet network method while harmonic analysis separates the tidal constituents wavelet network forecasts future water level from decomposed water level time series data by harmonic analysis wavelet network is supported by ann backpropagation tool parameter estimation phase the harmonic analysis method is employed to separate harmonic tidal level component nonlinear water level fluctuations caused by various meteorological factors such as water temperature wind speed wind direction and atmospheric pressure is modelled by a variable ann the final results are obtained by summation of harmonic and nonlinear series predictions these models which consist of a large number of input components were utilized in estimating the 1 h to 24 h water levels in a similar study yin et al 2018 have used dwt to separate residual term which involves the influences of meteorological factors other random fluctuations and random noises modelled by harmonic analysis and ann combination real time prediction model chen et al 2007 developed ann wavelet model to accurately predict and supply the missing tide data for a long period 1 5 years they used only a very short period data as a training data set in artificial neural network back propagate ann bp model in addition the results showed that the concept of tidal constituent phase lags can improve ann model of tidal forecasting and data supplement the addition of the wavelet analysis to ann method can prominently improve the prediction quality over the past decades generally 3d models were implemented to investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the bosphorus sozer and ozsoy 2017 built a hydrodynamic model by using ideal and real strait geometry and observed that water elevation difference between northern and southern boundary of bosphorus increases due to the wind and flow currents from the black sea yuksel et al 2008 predicted the effects of long and short term variations in the level fluctuation patterns individually and found similarities with the total observed fluctuation data oda et al 2009 developed a predictive regression model to estimate the current flow of bosphorus by taking meterological data and short term water level fluctuations into account model results revealed that the dominant atmospheric pressure and wind speed effects the short term water level fluctuations for all the aforementioned studies every single forcing term obtained from the detailed measurement systems which were utilized to represent the complicated dynamic structure of the bosphorus were used as inputs to the models reliable water level characterization requires regular long term measurements obtained from the various parts of bosphorus unfortunately technical and economical resources limit the number and the service life time of stations for a long while a station web that regularly measures the water level in the bosphorus strait already exists in this study spectral analysis of the existing water level measurement data will be performed and future water levels predictions will be obtained water level fluctuations of bosporus are predicted by the combination of various complicated physical processes with different time varying frequencies fourier analysis is a classical approach for spectral decomposition of original time series data but most of the time fourier analysis which makes use of infinite sinusoids with constant frequencies is insufficient in representation of original time series data that exhibits unsteady fluctuations labat 2005 besides periods of the physical processes which determine the water level fluctuations vary in a wide range such as hours and decades alpar and yuce 1998 bastos et al 2013 the wavelet transformation wt extracts the time and frequency information with high resolution that is present in the original data in other words wt is able to analyze the time series which is a method to overcome the stationarity that other methods could face zhang et al 2017 in water level fluctuation analysis wavelet transformation has been used for decomposition of short time components such as tides jay and flinchem 1997 and subtides percival and mofjeld 1997 and long time components like seasonality effects kumar and foufoula georgiou 1993 flinchem and jay 2000 ozger et al 2012 altunkaynak 2014 mehr et al 2014 altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 2016 due to the dynamic and non linear characteristics of bosphorus water level fluctuations skillful models that can establish complicated relationships between different variables using time series of water level data are needed to improve prediction accuracy conventional modelling techniques may be insufficient in solving non linear systems in constrast hybrid models with data processing capabilities have plenty of advantages over conventional models for the phenomenon that involve many variables and the underlying physics can not be comprehended by all means el diasty et al 2018 water level fluctuations are composed of lots of irregular spectral components therefore accurate yet practical predictive models are required for determination of wave characteristics to the best of our knowledge wavelet fuzzy w fuzzy model has not been used for accurate prediction of water level at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus strait for this purpose the wavelet technique is utilized as a pre processing tool to decompose the observed daily water levels time series data into wavelets spectral bands which enables extracting valuable information such as trend periodicity noise etc therefore initiated with the main purpose of comparing the performance of the continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt obtained spectral bands then used as inputs into the fuzzy model to improve prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time up to 7 days the objectives of this present study are 1 to utilize the continuous wavelet transform cwt as a pre processing technique and compare its performance with the discrete wavelet transform dwt since it is the most widely used pre processing technique in recent ocean engineering researches 2 to improve the prediction accuracy and extend lead time prediction of daily water levels at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus strait 3 to develop hybrid discrete wavelet transform fuzzy dwt fuzzy and continuous wavelet transform fuzzy cwt fuzzy models for improving prediction accuracy of daily water levels and extending lead times up to 7 days 4 to investigate the performance of the stand alone fuzzy combined discrete wavelet transform fuzzy dwt fuzzy and combined continuous wavelet transform fuzzy cwt fuzzy models in addition the dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy models prediction results were compared with those of the stand alone fuzzy model by utilizing root mean squared error rmse and the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ce nash and sutcliffe 1970 as performance evaluation criteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area bosphorus strait connecting the black sea and the sea of marmara plays a significant role in terms of maritime and submarine transportation as well as coastal and water resources management the only way out of black sea to the open seas is bosphorus therefore straits are heavily used for international maritime transportation in addition to local passenger cargo transportation and fishing purposes the strong relationship between the bosphorus water level and current speeds further enhances the importance of water level prediction considering the heavy maritime traffic aydogan et al 2010 altan and otay 2017 bosphorus also controls the pollution transportation as well as the water masses of the basins it connects a significant part of the population of istanbul one of the crowdest cities in the world live in the coastlines constantly increasing population of istanbul necessitates the underwater construction projects to provide new connections between asian and european parts of the city in the present study daily water level data obtained from the preliminary studies of marmaray project that links the two continents is used numerical modelling of the water motions of bosphorus is more complicated than the other straits in the world due to its complex bathymetry and rapidly varying physical parameters throughout bosphorus strait is 31 km long and has a varying width between 0 7 km and 3 5 km with an average of 1 3 km at the narrowing and shallowing parts current speed increases and eddies and swirlings form in the inlets ozsoy et al 2002 maximum and minimum water level elevations are 100 m and 30 m respectively sills present at the northern and southern boundaries also influence the currents of the straits most of the time a stratified current exists in the bosphorus where relatively low saline water of black sea flows over the sea of marmara from upper layer while more saline waters coming from the meditterenean sea flows from the sea of marmara to the black sea from lower layer unluata et al 1990 ozsoy et al 1996 irregular structure of the topography and the coastline with the prevailing wind system complicate the hydrodynamic analysis of the strait arisoy and akyarli 1990 ozsoy et al 1998 maderich and konstantinov 2002 modelled the black sea bosphorus seasonal water elevation variations and found a linear relationship between the discharges of upper and lower layers of bosphorus and the water elevation difference between the two ends of the strait 2 2 data collection and analysis in this study water elevation and pressure data is obtained from meteorologic and ctd conductivity temperature depth recorder stations which were established within the marmaray project measurement program was carried out by taisei corporation japan on behalf of turkish general directorate water elevation data is gathered from the meteorologic stations and wave gauge sensors located at northern and southern boundary of the straits location of the stations are shown in fig 1 wind speed direction and atmospheric pressure data is obtained from the stations termed as c and d where conductivity temperature and depth data was obtained from ctd stations termed as a and b fig 2 shows the original water level time series obtained from the measurements are collected at northern and southern the bosphorus as can be seen from fig 2 water level time series data of the sea of marmara is more oscillatory compared to those of black sea this implies that daily water level data of the sea of marmara involves more uncertainty rather as opposed to black sea water level data the mean median standard deviation and skewness parameters were of daily water level data were calculated for northern and southern boundary of bosphorus individually and presented in table 1 according data between the time period september 2004 and december 2005 water level variations occurred within the range of 0 14 m and 0 50 m at the northern entrance of bosphorus and 0 35 m and 0 62 m at the southern entrance of the bosphorus considering the 15 month data it is observed that in general water level at the black sea entrance is relatively higher than the entrance of the sea of marmara due to the strong north winds that blew throughout the day between the time period november and january high tides surging uprising formed and the sea of marmara level exceeded black sea level yuksel et al 2008 from the beginning of april the river runoffs of the black sea reach the bosporus increasing elevation difference between the two entrance of the strait in addition long amplitude water level fluctuations that were generated by short time transient variations are replaced by relatively low amplitude fluctuations sur et al 1994 ozsoy et al 1996 past studies investigated the relationship between the average monthly currents of the danube river which is the biggest freshwater source of black sea and the water level variations at the northern boundary of bosphorus it was found that the bosphorus water level is affected two months after the commencement of the danube river runoff under the assumption of 10 20 cm s average current speed sur et al 1994 yuksel et al 2008 in this study stand alone fuzzy combined dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy models are developed for accurate prediction of the daily water level fluctuations and extend prediction lead times up to 7 days the observed daily water levels at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus are decomposed into four sub series spectral bands by using dwt and cwt techniquies then the decomposed sub series are used as inputs into the fuzzy model to obtain a more accurate prediction water levels and improve prediction lead times up to 7 days 2 3 description of the preprocessing method 2 3 1 description of wavelet transforms wavelet transformations are mathematical functions to analyze time series data in both time and frequency domain its success in transforming unsteady and quickly fluctuating time series data increased the implementation of the wavelet transformations for investigation of hydrological phenomenon involving interrelations of different complicated natural processes whitcher et al 2000 terashima et al 2001 sang 2013 altunkaynak 2014 altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 dadu and deka 2016 hadi and tombul 2018 wavelet transformation foundations are based on fourier transforms where data time series are represented by sinusoids with constant frequency even tough infinite sinusoid waves can represent frequency information for some cases time information of spectral content cannot be captured to overcome the preceding drawback of fourier transform gabor 1946 introduced a constant width filtering window function throughout the data series and embedded into fourier kernel on the other hand wavelet transformation is a varying dimensional windowing technique which allows noise removal discontinuity identification and time frequency analysis two heavily implemented methods in wavelet transformation are continuous wavelet transformation cwt and discrete wavelet transformation dwt main differences between two methods can be summarized as analysis resolution and amount of processing cwt is advantageous for detecting local and transient variations in the time series by its detailed exemplification principle while dwt allows the representation of the main typical characteristics of the signal by sparse subbands therefore dwt is excessively used for data compression and signal transmission rioul and duhamel 1992 yoon et al 2010 cwt exhibits high signal analysis capabilities by utilizing excessive transformation parameters and thus requires relatively bigger computational resources compared to dwt altunkaynak and ozger 2016 hadi and tombul 2018 compared dwt cwt and combination of these two decomposition methods and showed that each preporcessing tool has different degree of sensitivity for different hydrological time series data 2 3 1 1 continuous wavelet transform continuous wavelet transform cwt is the convolution of the scaled wavelet functions and the signal following equation indicates the multiplication of time series x t which consists of n measurement data with the wavelet function for every translation step where b is the translation parameter a is the scale parameter and Ï is the complex conjugate of the wavelet function 1 c w t x t Ï a b t 1 a t 0 n 1 x t Ï t b a transformation coefficients that are calculated for every translated position of the wavelet function and selected scale represent the wavelet transformation time series consistency compliance relatively greater coefficients indicate relatively greater correlation between the wavelet and the signal all local wavelet spectra is transferred to the average wavelet spectrum by power distribution coefficient c 2 c 1 n i 1 n c w t a b 2 to be able to average wavelet energy spectrum for time and scale dimensions facilitate the evaluation of energy distribution for particular frequency bands torrence and compo 1998 the decomposed spectral bands by cwt tool are depicted in fig 3 pre processing tool is supposed to remove the trend and seasonality components from the original data and decompose the data into spectral bands to enhance the prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead times all local wavelet coefficients found in different scales are reduced into average wavelet spectrum by taking the time average of power distribution coefficient c for all scales the spectral bands sub series are constructed according to the power distribution in the average wavelet spectra the scales that have similar powers are grouped as one spectral band according to ozger 2010 the optimum number of spectral bands should be between 3 and 6 to represent the original time series data sufficiently spectral intervals of each band can be obtained by trial and error method 2 3 1 2 discrete wavelet transform in the discrete wavelet transform dwt method instead of continuous transformation parameters transformation process is performed for only certain scales and thus frequency scale information over all time is obtained with fewer coefficients scale and translation parameters are given as a 2 j and b k 2 j where j represents the filtering step and k represents the location then wavelet transformations for time series x n is defined by the formula 3 d w t x n Ï j k n 1 2 j n 0 n 1 x n Ï n 2 j k to reproduce the original time series following formula is used 4 x n a j 1 j k 0 2 j j 1 d w t x n Ï j k n 1 2 j Ï n 2 j k or 5 x t a j 1 j d j t in this manner signal is separated into its components approximation a and detail d which represent the trend cycle component and detailed informations respectively in application dwt facilitates low pass and high pass filtering technique widely which was developed by mallat 1989 signal is passed through the high pass and low pass filters which are derived from the mother wavelet function and scale function possessing quadrature mirror relationship to carry out the decomposition process at every decomposition step high pass output detail band is separated and low pass output approximation band is furthered processed by dwt tool thus at every dwt step it is further approached to obtaining general high frequency signal information dwt is performed for four filtering scales where general character of the series is represented by approximation a and details of the series are represented by band 1 d1 band 2 d2 band 3 d3 and band 4 d4 which corresponds to four different energy levels as shown in fig 4 details d1 d2 d3 and d4 and approximation a represent high frequency and low frequency of time series data respectively in other words d1 d2 d3 d4 and a are defined as noise and trend cycle respectively in this present study two types of wavelet transforms namely dwt and cwt are investigated as pre processing techniquies in terms of improving prediction accuracy and extending prediction lead times of fuzzy model predictive models are developed to forecast daily water level fluctuations at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus and also to enhance the performance of fuzzy model 2 4 description of the models 2 4 1 fuzzy based model zadeh 1965 who first introduced the fuzzy group theory in his study demonstrated that graded transition from membership to being a non member resembles the human thinking system and thus fuzzy logic is more successful than the traditional logic for representation of many real life natural phenomenon fuzzy systems comprise of fuzzy subsets and rules that provide a mathematical cause and effect function between inputs and outputs a fuzzy inference system consists of 3 main phases namely fuzzification inference and defuzzification fuzzification is a decomposition process of values assets which are described as certain in real life but vary continuously between 0 and 1 via membership functions in fuzzy sets fuzzification process provides speeding up the decision making mechanism by classifying the variables cause and effect relationships between fuzzy sets are determined by fuzzy if then rules defuzzification process is the transformation of fuzzy sets which are the inference phase results to obtain numerical values in this study mathematical relationships between two previous values wl t 1 and wl t and current wl t 1 and future values for lead time l wl t l are established in a sugeno type process which is a convenient method where numerical data exists and instead of fuzzy output sets a distinct linear equation or constant is used for every rule ri 6 r i i f w l t 1 i s a 1 a n d w l t i s b 2 t h e n w l t l a w l t 1 b w l t c hybrid models that utilize combination of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks anns to optimize the constants a b and c in the consequent part are called adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis prediction values are obtained by considering the contribution of membership degree to the rule outputs anfis calculation steps for water level determination are shown in fig 5 in sugone inference system the results yielded by defuzzification process for each rule affects the output value as much as corresponding weights obtained from their membership degrees takagi and sugeno 1985 7 w t 1 y i w i w i 2 4 2 the combined wavelet fuzzy based models in this present study wt is utilized to decompose the daily water level fluctuations data into a certain number of sub signals at different temporal scales to be used as inputs into the fuzzy model to improve the daily water level prediction accuracy and extend the prediction lead time up to 7 days the fuzzy model is used as a modelling tool to undertake predictions by using each sub signal as an individual input into the model in other words hybrid predictive models are developed by combining wavelet transformation as a pre processing tool with fuzzy model these hybrid models are termed as the combined dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy models and their performances are compared in terms of predicting the daily water level fluctuations at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus for prediction lead times of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 days pre processing and modelling steps are given in fig 6 2 5 performance evaluation criteria in this study the performance of stand alone fuzzy combined dwt fuzzy and ctw fuzzy models are investigated by utilizing the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coeffiecient of efficiency ce as performance evaluation criteria according to solomatine and dulal 2003 and altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 rmse and the ce are extensively used and most commonly accepted performance evaluation criteria rmse is described as 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y p i y o i 2 where n is the measurement number yoi and ypi is represents the measurement and prediction values respectively a model that yields relatively smaller rmse values is considered relatively more successful the coefficient of efficiency is implemented as a measure of the performance of the prediction model which is extensively used to evaluate the performance of the model ce is defined as 9 c e 1 i 1 n y p i y o i 2 i 1 n y m i y a 2 here n is the total number of observations y pi y mi and y a refer to the predicted observed and mean of the observed daily water level values respectively ce approximately close to 1 points out a very good agreement between the observed data and the results of models according to moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the models are unsatisfactory if ce values are smaller than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 categorized the performance of the models based on ce values accordingly ce corresponding to range between 0 65 and 0 75 0 75 and 0 85 and greater than 0 85 are classified as fair good and very good respectively based on the preceding performance evaluation criteria in this study the smallest rmse and biggest ce values are considered as the best model for prediction of daily water level data 3 results and discussion stand alone fuzzy and wavelet fuzzy models are developed to improve the prediction accuracy of daily water level fluctuations of northern and southern boundary of bosphorus for extended lead time predictions up to 7 days the predictive model results are validated quantitively by utilizing root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coeffiecient of efficiency ce values as indicator criteria original water surface level measurements are used as inputs for the fuzzy models while the water level time series that are separated into equivalent energy sub series spectral bands by cwt and dwt are used as inputs into the fuzzy model number of inputs that will be used for the models are decided based on desired prediction error level from 15 month daily water level measurement data 60 of the data is used to establish the framework of the model and the remaining data corresponding to 40 is utilized for validation purposes effects of the input sets on the prediction results of the stand alone fuzzy model are presented in table 2 for 1 day lead time wl t 1 at northern and southern boundary of bosphorus when the previous value past day is used as input wl t to predict the current value wl t 1 calculated ce values of stand alone fuzzy model were 0 70 and 0 71 for northern and southern boundary respectively it is observed that the using two previous values wl t 1 and wl t enhanced the model performance with ce values of 0 73 and 0 72 respectively while using the water levels of three subsequent previous days wl t 2 wl t 1 and wl t relatively reduced the performance of the stand alone fuzzy model therefore in this present study for all models two previous values were used as inputs wl t 1 and wl t into the model which yielded the highest performance as a result the best architecture of the fuzzy model in lead time 1 was used for modelling with the pre processing tools for all the lead times in this study among the wavelet functions the daubechies3 db3 and morlet were used to decompose the daily water level data of bosphorus into four sub series spectral bands in dwt and cwt respectively among the various tested spectral band decompositions separation in to four spectral bands by dwt and cwt provided the most accurate prediction results fig 3 shows the decomposed original daily water level data into four spectral bands which are obtained from average wavelet power spectrum by cwt namely band 1 band 2 band 3 and band 4 also fig 4 depicts the separation of water level data into four sub series spectral bands by dwt as band 1 d1 band 2 d2 band 3 d3 band 4 d4 and also a4 representing the high frequency and the low frequency components of the water level data respectively in other words approximation and detail components represent the trend cycle and noise components respectively approximation a component has a more significant effect in obtaining the most accurate prediction results compared to detail d1 d2 d3 and d4 components the separated sub series four spectral bands by dwt and cwt are used individually as inputs into the fuzzy model and the predicted values are summed for reconstruction to obtain the predicted daily water levels the same architecture of the fuzzy model is used for each band band 1 band 2 band 3 and band 4 to accurately predict the water level fluctuations for extended lead times these models were developed to predict daily water levels from two previous values of time steps t 1 and t for lead times of 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 day the flowchart of cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models is demonstrated in fig 6 the code of modelling has been written in matlab stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models prediction results for northern and southern boundary of bosphorus are given at tables 2 and 3 respectively calculated rmse of the prediction values at the northern boundary for 1 day lead time are 0 0041 m 0 0020 m and 0 0025 m for stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models respectively considering these results positive effects of combining cwt and dwt with fuzzy method is revealed as the time difference between the input set and prediction values increases prediction performance of the models are reduced due to the decreasing correlation with lags time step and processed data become more stable with respect to increasing time step for example rmse value of the stand alone fuzzy model at northern boundary increased up to the value of 0 0056 m for 2 days lead time and 0 0069 m for 7 days lead time great performance of cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models for 1 day lead time declined at a relatively smaller rate with rmse of 0 0041 m and 0 0047 m respectively as it is understood dwt fuzzy and cwt fuzzy model performances reached the 1 day lead time prediction wl t 1 performance of the stand alone fuzzy model even for the wl t 3 lead time 3 and wl t 7 lead time 7 prediction comparison of wavelet models revealed that cwt outperformed dwt for every prediction lead time sparse resolution feature of dwt as a decomposition technique cannot extract some of the localized information in the time series so that they cannot be represented in the sub series in addition at the northern boundary table 3 ce values for 1 day lead time were calculated as 0 73 0 93 and 0 89 for stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models respectively considering the ce value all model results had acceptable accuracy but cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models performed very good for lead time 2 ce value of the stand alone fuzzy model was calculated 0 46 which was under the defined accuracy limit 0 5 in the literature where cwt fuzzy model preserved very good performance with ce value of 0 92 and dwt fuzzy model performed good with 0 83 ce as a performance indicator demonstrated that fuzzy model approach was insufficient for accurate prediction after lead time 2 when unpreprocessed data is used as inputs even tough fuzzy approach could capture the relationship between the original water level measurements for only 1 day lead time it was able to extract the information of the relationship between water level components very accurately within the same frequency up to 7 day lead time for prediction of wl t 1 at the southern boundary table 4 calculated rmse values 0 0055 m 0 0030 m and 0 0030 m of stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models respectively indicate the high contribution of the wavelet transform to the prediction accuracy as it was at the northern boundary despite the increase of the time step compared to original data bands with same frequencies were more stable for preserving relationship with past values eventhough the stand alone fuzzy approach offers an applicable performance for water level prediction with a ce value of 0 72 combined wavelet with fuzzy models are superior due to their prediction ability with calculated ce value of 0 92 as the time between input and output values becomes 2 days models using the original data as input could not make any acceptable prediction ce value 0 42 and prediction accuracy further reduces for longer time periods between input and output the model that combined with cwt performed very good with ce 0 88 for 2 day wl t 2 lead time good with ce value of 0 76 for 3 day wl t 3 fair with ce value of 0 70 and 0 65 for wl t 6 and wl t 7 lead time respectively indicating that prediction accuracy is acceptable even for 7 day lead time common evaluation of model performances for both boundaries imply that for fuzzy model the decomposition of the water level fluctuation data into spectral bands both increase the prediction performance and predictability period for northern and southern boundaries measured data exactly reflects all the forcing components on the water level variations however the time information that fuzzy model could obtain from the raw original data was not enough to analyze the complicated bosphorus flow system in detail on the contrary wavelet transformation was able to extract the frequency information in addition to time information and enabled uniform decomposition of the system within itself therefore wavelet transformation enhanced the performance by presenting more sorted out and pure input into the model the reason that cwt yielded the best accuracy for all lead times is data is scanned continuously and short time variations in the data was totally captured unlike the dwt in addition to the success criteria for a better visual investigation of the prediction compatibility 1 1 scatter plots are embedded in to figs 7 9 for lead times 1 4 and 7 respectively scattering of the dots on the 450 line signifies a very good fit whereas a relatively larger scatter indicates relatively poor prediction accuracy a remarkable fit between prediction results and corresponding observed water level data can be seen from scattering plots for 1 day lead time as well as how the wavelet combined model results accumulate around the 1 1 line as shown in fig 7 as can be observed from fig 7a and 7b the stand alone fuzzy model performed fair for northern and southern boundaries for 1 day lead time while cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models were found to be very good as depicted in fig 7c 7d 7e and 7f respectively fig 8a and 8b illustrate the poor accuracy of the stand alone fuzzy model for prediction of water level fluctuations at both boundaries of the bosporus for 4 day lead time respectively as depicted in fig 8c and 8d cwt fuzzy model was found to be good in both boundaries for 4 day lead time while dwt fuzzy model was found to be fair as shown in fig 8e and 8f respectively for 7 day lead time prediction the stand alone fuzzy model performed very poor for both boundaries as depicted in fig 9a and 9b the cwt fuzzy model found acceptable even for 7 day lead time at the two boundaries as demonstrated in fig 9c and 9d respectively whereas dwt fuzzy model was found to be satisfactory for northern boundary except southern boundary for lead time of 7 day with unacceptable results as shown in fig 9e and 9f in general implementation of wavelet transformation as a pre processing technique improves the results of the fuzzy model for all locations but in particular cwt and dwt predicted better at the northern entrance of the bosporus with a relatively higher scattering of the dwt model up to lead time of 7 days the cwt fuzzy model can be used for prediction of water level fluctuations for northern and southern boundaries but the dwt fuzzy model performance was under the cwt fuzzy model and the stand alone fuzzy model results did not exhibit a good consistency with measurements by any means to summarize for relatively longer lead times the stand alone fuzzy model yielded the poorest results among the developed predictive models cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models prediction performances were high especially in 1 day lead time however as a pre processing technique cwt performed best 4 conclusions in this present study daily water level of bosporus were predicted by fuzzy method and wavelet as a pre processing tool 15 months of data obtained from level measurement stations located at the northern and southern boundaries were utilized stand alone fuzzy cwt fuzzy and dwt fuzzy models were developed to perform water level predictions up to 7 days and their performances were compared by well known evaluation criteria rmse and ce wavelet models are utilized to decompose the raw original data into spectral bands by wavelet transform and instead of raw data the bands were used as inputs into the fuzzy model using wavelet transformation where generated bands possess uniform frequency information at every time step highly increased the performance of the fuzzy models the cwt fuzzy model accurately predicted the daily water levels up to 7 days while the stand alone fuzzy model was only accurate up to 1 day as regards the dwt fuzzy model performance was acceptable for all lead times at the northern boundary but southern boundary predictions were acceptable for only up to 5 days lead time since bosporus water level fluctuations are generated by wide range forcing components complex system analysis is required for accurate predictions and fuzzy approach has become insufficient for this purpose combination of the wavelet transformation as a preprocessing tool with fuzzy method improved the model performance and extended accurate lead time predictions a comparison within the wavelet techniques that were utilized in this study shows that with its possession of detailed information cwtis ahead of dwt which has sparse resolution dwt tool which is only capable of representing the data with particular scaled wavelets missed to capture some instantaneous variations during the decomposition process and this drawback of dwt affected the accuracy of the results as it can be understood from the results of this study for level forecasting models it is more appropriate to utilize cwt as a wavelet transformation process considering the size of the variables influencing the water level of bosporus to develop more efficient models big size of data obtained from regular coordinated measurements are required for further studies frequency based relationships that can be established between the wavelet bands and the components constituting the water level and effects of its variations can be evaluated to develop more accurate level prediction models acknowledgements

22701,in this study experiments on rogue wave events under a background of random waves were conducted in the wave basin the improved method for generating rogue waves introduced by wang et al 2015 was applied the rogue wave event also satisfied the requirements of the specific spectrum and wave parameters such as hs tp and Î³ through the wave calibration process wave statistical distributions were also analyzed and compared with the analytical and semi analytical distributions widely used in practice providing possible guidance for the generation of rogue wave events in random sea within a 3 h duration moreover the study also shows the potential applications of this method in future seakeeping tests where the extreme wave structure interaction needs to be considered keywords rogue wave crest distribution wave statistics superfluous spectral fluctuation 1 introduction rogue waves are extraordinarily large waves in the ocean that contain powerful concentrated energy and are characterized by strong nonlinearities it is well recognized that rogue waves cause potential damage to ships and offshore structures several accidents due to such unexpected huge waves were reported recently kharif et al 2008 arne kvitrud 2018 a common definition of a rogue wave concerns its wave height which exceeds 2 2 times the significant wave height hs and or the maximum wave amplitude exceeds 1 25 h sand et al 1990 adcock and taylor 2014 various mechanisms were studied to explain the occurrence of rogue waves in the ocean such as spatial temporal focusing nonlinear self focusing current wave interaction and wind wave interaction kharif and pelinovsky 2003 onorato et al 2016 various studies on rogue waves have developed several deterministic methods based on spatial temporal focusing as their occurrence is predictable and relatively easy to reproduce in both numerical and experimental investigations the transient wave method is being analysed and investigated in detail for decades whitham 2011 ostrovsky and potapov 2002 many experiments on transient wave reproduction in flumes were performed baldock et al 1996 stansberg 2001 the spatial deviation in wave focusing due to nonlinearity was corrected using optimal procedures in both numerical and experimental wave tanks clauss 2002 bonnefoy et al 2005 the new wave method suggested by tromans et al 1991 accounts for the spectral composition of the sea a given wave crest of an extreme event can be modelled directly using the statistically most probable shape associated with its occurrence it should be noted that the above mentioned methodologies for wave focusing rely on phase coherence of spectral components of wave groups however it is more realistic to represent the occurrence of rogue waves in random fields as the superposition of fourier components with random phases the real statistical features of rogue waves may be revealed more clearly from investigations of random waves however rogue waves are known to occur much more frequently than prescribed by the statistics of the random gaussian process according to the rayleigh distribution more than 15000 individual waves may be required to observe the possible occurrence of rogue waves kharif et al 2008 this means that a 3 h simulation of random wave trains widely used for the seakeeping tests in the offshore industry will likely not result in the appearance of an extreme wave that satisfies the definition of rogue waves thus it is highly likely that most seakeeping model tests do not cover the possibility of accounting for rogue waves in extreme wave structure interactions considering that higher order nonlinearity may influence the probability of the occurrence of rogue waves experimental and numerical investigations based on the nonlinear schrdinger equation and its modified equation were conducted it was found that the probability of rogue wave occurrence is considerably higher than that predicted by conventional probability laws when considering higher order nonlinear interaction janssen 2003 onorato et al 2006 according to some recent analyses large values of the fourth statistical cumulant kurtosis are found to be related to a higher probability of extreme wave occurrence in random wave fields mori and janssen 2006 annenkov and shrira 2009 while the extreme wave event still hardly appears in 3 h random wave trains during the seakeeping test a more efficient and realistic method to reproduce rogue waves under a random background was suggested by taylor et al 1997 the method is called the constrained new wave method where the new wave with a predetermined height is incorporated into the random wave background and the statistical characteristics match those of purely random occurrences of rogue waves kriebel et al 2000 developed another approach to generate rogue waves in random seas a 120 s time series with an extreme wave was generated in the wave flume while the integrality of the wave spectrum due to wave breaking was not mentioned in the paper the approach allocated a small part of the spectral energy into the transient wave and the other part of the energy into the random waves and then combined these two wave trains after embedding a transient wave in random waves the wave surface elevation was obtained by summing a time series with random phases and a transient wave time series this split of the spectrum typically results in a significantly spurious fluctuation within it thus wang et al 2015 proposed an improved technique by introducing a correction term to avoid the spurious fluctuation problem it is important to note that most statistical theories are based on assumptions of stationarity and proximity i e gaussian type in which the phase of each wave component is distributed randomly nevertheless the application of the method mentioned above may segmentally constrain the randomness in phases additionally from the viewpoint of future industrial applications wave breaking can be completely avoided in seakeeping tests under survival conditions such as 100 yr typhoons or even more severe conditions therefore wave breaking should be taken into account when reproducing rogue waves in the wave basin for the survival condition the wave spectra of a 3 h simulation performed on a prototype scale at a predetermined location are always required to match perfectly with the target spectra during the wave simulation in the wave basin it is impossible to avoid wave breaking for most severe sea states thus the spectra at the predetermined location will no longer match the target owing to wave breaking and nonlinearity in wave propagation in this study rogue waves in the presence of random waves were generated for a 3 h duration at prototype scale in the deepwater wave basin of the shanghai jiao tong university the basic idea of rogue wave generation is based on the method devised by wang et al with the goal of avoiding superfluous spectral fluctuation by adjusting the driving signal of the wave generator the wave spectra at the predetermined position were calibrated to match the target perfectly three realizations were conducted to investigate the statistical characteristics and effect of the imperfect random phase the wave crest height distribution was compared with different distribution models to verify the feasibility of such extreme wave series for future industrial applications moreover fully irregular waves with two realizations were generated as a comparison 2 experimental set up a series of wave tests was conducted in the deepwater wave basin as shown in fig 1 at the shanghai jiao tong university with a scale of 1 60 the basin is 50 0 m in length 40 0 m in width and 10 0 m in maximum effective depth wave absorbing beaches are located opposite to each side of the wave generators the incident wave energy could be absorbed effectively and reflected waves could be suppressed fig 2 demonstrates the layout of the basin and the location of the resistive wave gauges for measuring the wave surface elevations location 4 was considered as the target position during the wave calibration process the modelling of random waves was carried out based on the specified significant wave height hs peak spectrum period tp and wave spectrum in this study a jonswap spectrum having parameters hs 13 4 m tp 14 7s and Î³ 2 4 at prototype scale was used to produce the incident waves the wave elevation of the unidirectional linear deepwater waves Î¶ x t can be represented as the fourier series of n wave components 1 Î¶ x t j 1 n a j cos k j x Ï j t Ï j where a j k j Ï j Ï j denote the wave amplitude wave number wave frequency and phase of the j th wave component respectively s represents the spectral density as a function of wave frequency Ï the wave amplitude of the j th wave component a j can be calculated as 2 s Ï j Î´ Ï j in which s Ï j is the specified wave spectrum and Î´ Ï j is the frequency interval to generate the rogue wave in a random wave field experimentally the procedure introduced by wang et al 2015 was applied in this study this approach introduces a correction term to avoid the spurious fluctuation problem encountered in kriebel et al 2000 both the approaches allocate a small part of the spectral energy to the transient wave and the remaining energy to the random waves and then combine these two wave trains in kriebel s approach the wave surface elevations are presented as the summation of a time series with random phases and a transient wave time series 2 Î¶ x t j 1 n a t j exp i k j x x c Ï j t t c a r j exp i k j x x c Ï j t t c Ï j where x c and t c represent the focusing position and focusing time respectively Ï j is the random phase and a t j and a r j represent the amplitudes of the transient wave component and random wave component respectively which can be written as 3 a t j 2 s Ï j Î´ Ï Î´ 4 a r j 2 s Ï j Î´ Ï 1 Î´ where s is the corresponding wave spectrum and Î´ is the percentage of the spectral energy allocated to the transient wave trains it is essential to consider some aspects when choosing the value for this parameter first the percentage Î´ should not be too small for generating a transient wave that matches with the definition of the rogue wave second early wave breaking may happen during the rogue wave evolution when an extremely large Î´ is selected according to eq 2 the actual wave spectrum based on kriebel s approach can be written as 5 s Ï j a r j 2 a t

investigations in the improved approach by wang et al 2015 the two terms in eq 2 were ensembled and a correction phase was applied to replace the original phase 6 Î¶ x t j 1 n a r j 2 a t j 2 cos k j

generator as given in table 1 three realizations of irregular waves with rogue waves were conducted and two irregular waves were also generated as comparisons during the wave tests the random wave was generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min on the laboratory scale corresponding to 3 h on the prototype scale the 3 h surface elevation series was recorded by the resistive wave gauges at 100 hz on the model scale corresponding to 12 9 hz on the prototype scale 3 wave spectra before describing the statistical properties of the wave trains that contain the extreme event the quality criteria for the wave spectra and spectral evolution along the basin must be discussed fig 3 shows the time series of the water surface elevation of an irregular wave with a rogue wave event measured at location 4 the extreme wave can be clearly observed at around t 6300 s normally the waves generated at the target location can be accepted only if the significant wave height spectral peak period and spectrum match the target values in such cases they can be used for further studies on rogue wave structure interactions in the seakeeping test as the significant wave height applied in the experimental study was relatively large considering the tp wave breaking was frequently observed wave energy dissipation cannot be avoided when the rogue wave propagates forwards thus the wave calibration process must be conducted for each wave test by modifying the wave spectral energy of each wave frequency component several times until the waves satisfy the requirements mentioned above table 2 compares the significant wave heights and spectral peak periods of the experiments with the target values the general requirement of the oil and gas industry is that the deviations should be within 2 the results show that the wave parameters of the experiments match perfectly with the target values fig 4 shows comparisons between the target wave spectrum and the wave spectra of three realizations of irregular waves with rogue wave events and two realizations of fully irregular random waves measured at location 4 x 26 m wave spectra from all the experimental simulations were observed to match with the presupposed spectrum fairly well the small oscillations in energy density around 0 8 hz in the measured spectra were considered as evidence of the 2nd order sum bound harmonic components the experiments thus proved to be of high quality and met the requirements of future seakeeping tests we then assessed the evolution of the wave spectra as the waves propagate forwards as an example the spectral evolution of the case rw1 is presented in fig 5 compared with the target spectrum an obvious deviation of the wave spectrum can be found near the wave generator location 1 unexpected wave energy at very low frequency components was observed as well which could have been caused by the evanescent modes as per the first order wavemaker theory schÃ¤ffer 1996 this phenomenon should decay with wave propagation the wave energy from the evanescent modes vanished at location 2 and further downstream the wave spectrum at location 2 was apparently smaller than that at location 1 however it still exceeded the presupposed spectrum the spectra at location 3 were found to be close to the target as the evanescent modes had vanished almost completely at such a distance from the wave maker location 5 is only 2 m downstream from location 4 the spectrum matches the target as well which is very advantageous for the seakeeping test owing to the observations of the wave spectra at different locations wave energy dissipations due to wave breaking are bound to happen under a specific wave height and period the wave spectra ought to be expected to shrink as waves propagate forwards from the wave generator if the completely same driven signals calculated using eq 6 and eq 7 were used the wave spectrum at the target location must be much smaller than the prescribed spectrum owing to wave breaking to obtain the given spectra at the target location based on the normal requirements in industrial practice the frequency components of the driven signals should be changed according to the last round of wave generation which was called the wave calibration process therefore the modified technique developed by wang et al 2015 is not as advantageous as that developed by kriebel and alsina for the cases where wave breaking happens as the wave calibration process must be applied to achieve the required spectrum responses of the wave impact green water and air gap for floating structures depend highly on local wave motions given that it is an extremely large local event the rogue wave generated from the wave basin under the random wave background within the 3 h duration could help verify the performance of offshore structures under unexpected weather conditions therefore it was important to check the statistical properties such as the wave height probability distribution wave crest probability distribution and kurtosis 4 wave height distribution once the wave trains that meet the spectral requirements are generated at the target location the distributions of the wave height should be checked according to the longuet higgins theory 1975 1980 the probability distributions of the wave heights wave crests and troughs should be subjected to the rayleigh distribution assuming a narrowbanded spectrum considering the presence of nonlinearities non stationary trends surface forces dissipation and other factors the rayleigh distribution tends to over predict the actual heights observed in some cases tayfun 2011 during the last few decades many efforts were made to study alternatives or refinements to the rayleigh distribution to improve its accuracy for large waves forristall 1978 zheng et al 2006 stansell et al 2004 dawson 2004 boccotti 1989 naess 1985 tayfun 1990 denoting the moments of s by m j j 0 1 the spectral average frequency spectral bandwidth and the mean zero up crossing frequency are given by Ï m m 1 m 0 Ï m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 and Ï 0 m 2 m 0 respectively three popular analytic wave height distribution models devised by tayfun 1990 naess 1985 and boccotti 1989 were applied in this study for comparisons with the distribution of the rogue waves series 8 e t Î¾ h 1 r m 2 r m 1 1 r m

tayfun 1990 naess 1985 and boccotti 1989 r m a and b are parameters that can be estimated either from the time series of wave elevation or just from the related spectrum tayfun 2011 for clarity in fig 6 a c the statistics measured at gauge 4 were compared with the predictions of the existing analytical wave height distributions introduced by naess boccotti and tayfun respectively the rayleigh distribution for linear waves was also included in the comparisons all these three analytical distributions were found to be very close with each other and be diverged from the rayleigh distribution to the lower level especially at the tail as shown in fig 6 a c the waves that satisfy the definition of rogue waves h 2 2 h s appear in all the three realizations large deviations away from the three analytical distributions can be clearly observed in the probability range h 1 8 h s it is also found that the wave height distribution for the cases rw1 rw3 seem to follow the rayleigh distribution at lower wave height ranges which are inconsistent with results obtained earlier tayfun and fedele 2007 claiming that the rayleigh distribution over predicts the wave heights the other predictions from naess boccotti and tayfun could describe the experimental wave data reasonably well the deviations were usually within about 2 or less therefore we developed two irregular wave trains cases irr1 irr2 and then plotted the wave height distributions and their comparisons with the analytical distributions as shown in fig 7 a and b the wave height distributions of the two irregular wave trains were found to agree with the analytical distributions in eq 8 eq 10 5 wave crest distribution a common approach to estimate the extreme wave crest used widely for the norwegian continental shelf is to perform a long term analysis utilizing the all sea state approach in combination with the short term second order distribution given by forristall 2000 the forristall distribution is based on second order wave simulations using approximately 1000 3 h realizations at each sea state which is recommended by dnv rp c205 for offshore design it is widely used for both short term and long term predictions lian and haver 2015a however some studies pointed out that the short term wave crest distributions predicted by forristall were underestimated compared to field measurements as well as model test measurements huang and zhang 2018 conducted thousands of computational fluid dynamics simulations and developed the semi empirical wave crest probability distribution for nonlinear waves involving both the probability distribution of single realization pdsr and probability distribution of ensemble realization pder for easy practical use it can be applied to check the crest distribution of prototype scale 3 h wave calibration tests and any other numerical simulations in this experimental study we checked the wave crest distributions of irregular waves under a rogue wave event within a 3 h duration on a prototype scale the comparisons between the crest distributions obtained from previous studies and the three realizations of the irregular waves under a rogue wave event from the experimental simulations are presented in fig 8 a c it is notable that the distribution of the irregular waves with the rogue wave event is relatively close to that based on the mean semi empirical formulas moreover the wave crest height with the rogue wave event could be greater than that obtained from the mean semi empirical formulas at the same low probability level huang and zhang 2018 defined the 99 upper and lower bounds for probability distributions in single realizations as 11 p r o b a b a l i t y x c r e s t h s 0 5 12 p r o b a b a l i t y x c r e s t h s 0 5 fig 8 a c also show that the distributions of the three realizations of irregular waves with the rogue wave event for the 3 h duration are included within the 99 upper and lower bounds of the semi empirical formulas this means that the irregular waves with the rogue wave event generated experimentally in this study could be treated as qualified waves for applications in model tests for comparison we also plotted the rayleigh distribution which is valid for linear waves and forristall distribution in fig 8 a c the result indicates that the rayleigh distribution may significantly underestimate the wave crest height at the same probability level a deviation is observed between the crest distributions of the 3 h time series from the tests and those predicted by forristall we considered the crest distributions from the time series of irregular waves for two realizations in fig 9 a and b the crest distributions of the irregular waves for case irr2 match the forristall distribution while the results for case irr1 show a relatively large deviation which more or less coincides with the viewpoint presented in the available literature petrova et al 2006 onorato et al 2006 lian and haver 2015b fig 10 demonstrates the crest distributions of the 3 h time series for case rw1 at different locations and its corresponding analytical distributions significant deviations from the mean semi empirical distribution can be observed at a higher probability for the distributions of the first two wave gauges which can be reflected from the spectra plotted in fig 5 the distribution at wave gauge 5 located 2 m behind the target measurement location shows protuberance within the probability range of 0 01 0 1 while the maximum crest is much smaller than that at wave gauge 4 the focused wave disperses again when moving past the presupposed focusing point location 4 6 conclusion we conducted an experimental study on the rogue wave event in random sea the idea for generating rogue waves in random sea which is presented in wang et al 2015 was applied in the wave tests the following conclusions were drawn the modified method to generate rogue waves in random sea is capable of generating rogue wave events at a target position in the wave basin at the same time the rogue wave event can also satisfy the requirements of the specific spectrum and wave parameters such as hs tp and Î³ showing potential for applications in future seakeeping tests where the extreme wave structure interaction needs to be considered the method developed by wang et al has advantages over those proposed by kriebel and alsina theoretically as mentioned in an earlier study wang et al 2015 however owing to the existence of wave breaking in some severe sea states wave calibration process was performed to meet the requirements of the spectrum and wave parameters as the result the method proposed by wang et al 2015 is not as advantageous as that developed by kriebel et al 2000 in model tests for practical applications obvious deviations of the wave height distribution from the analytical distributions appear at the tail end owing to the existence of the rogue wave event similar deviations of the wave crest distribution from the semi analytical distributions can be observed but within the boundaries introduced by huang and zhang 2018 showing the feasibility of the method for model testing design and assessment provided the issues related to extreme local wave motions acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china

phases and a transient wave time series 2 Î¶ x t j 1 n a t j exp i k j x x c Ï j t t c a r j exp i k j x x c Ï j t t c Ï j where x c and t c represent the focusing position and focusing time

Î´ 4 a r j 2 s Ï j Î´ Ï 1 Î´ where s is the corresponding wave spectrum and Î´ is the percentage of the spectral energy allocated to the transient wave trains it is essential to consider some

generator as given in table 1 three realizations of irregular waves with rogue waves were conducted and two irregular waves were also generated as comparisons during the wave tests the random wave was generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min on the laboratory scale corresponding to 3 h on the prototype scale the 3 h surface elevation series was recorded by the resistive wave gauges at 100 hz on the model scale corresponding to 12 9 hz on the prototype scale 3 wave spectra before describing the statistical properties of the wave trains that contain the extreme event the quality criteria for the wave spectra and spectral evolution along the basin must be discussed fig 3 shows the time series of the water surface elevation of an irregular wave with a rogue wave event measured at location 4 the extreme wave can be clearly observed at around t 6300 s normally the waves generated at the target location can be accepted only if the significant wave height spectral peak period and spectrum match the target values in such cases they can be used for further studies on rogue wave structure interactions in the seakeeping test as the significant wave height applied in the experimental study was relatively large considering the tp wave breaking was frequently observed wave energy dissipation cannot be avoided when the rogue wave propagates forwards thus the wave calibration process must be conducted for each wave test by modifying the wave spectral energy of each wave frequency component several times until the waves satisfy the requirements mentioned above table 2 compares the significant wave heights and spectral peak periods of the experiments with the target values the general requirement of the oil and gas industry is that the deviations should be within 2 the results show that the wave parameters of the experiments match perfectly with the target values fig 4 shows comparisons between the target wave spectrum and the wave spectra of three realizations of irregular waves with rogue wave events and two realizations of fully irregular random waves measured at location 4 x 26 m wave spectra from all the experimental simulations were observed to match with the presupposed spectrum fairly well the small oscillations in energy density around 0 8 hz in the measured spectra were considered as evidence of the 2nd order sum bound harmonic components the experiments thus proved to be of high quality and met the requirements of future seakeeping tests we then assessed the evolution of the wave spectra as the waves propagate forwards as an example the spectral evolution of the case rw1 is presented in fig 5 compared with the target spectrum an obvious deviation of the wave spectrum can be found near the wave generator location 1 unexpected wave energy at very low frequency components was observed as well which could have been caused by the evanescent modes as per the first order wavemaker theory schÃ¤ffer 1996 this phenomenon should decay with wave propagation the wave energy from the evanescent modes vanished at location 2 and further downstream the wave spectrum at location 2 was apparently smaller than that at location 1 however it still exceeded the presupposed spectrum the spectra at location 3 were found to be close to the target as the evanescent modes had vanished almost completely at such a distance from the wave maker location 5 is only 2 m downstream from location 4 the spectrum matches the target as well which is very advantageous for the seakeeping test owing to the observations of the wave spectra at different locations wave energy dissipations due to wave breaking are bound to happen under a specific wave height and period the wave spectra ought to be expected to shrink as waves propagate forwards from the wave generator if the completely same driven signals calculated using eq 6 and eq 7 were used the wave spectrum at the target location must be much smaller than the prescribed spectrum owing to wave breaking to obtain the given spectra at the target location based on the normal requirements in industrial practice the frequency components of the driven signals should be changed according to the last round of wave generation which was called the wave calibration process therefore the modified technique developed by wang et al 2015 is not as advantageous as that developed by kriebel and alsina for the cases where wave breaking happens as the wave calibration process must be applied to achieve the required spectrum responses of the wave impact green water and air gap for floating structures depend highly on local wave motions given that it is an extremely large local event the rogue wave generated from the wave basin under the random wave background within the 3 h duration could help verify the performance of offshore structures under unexpected weather conditions therefore it was important to check the statistical properties such as the wave height probability distribution wave crest probability distribution and kurtosis 4 wave height distribution once the wave trains that meet the spectral requirements are generated at the target location the distributions of the wave height should be checked according to the longuet higgins theory 1975 1980 the probability distributions of the wave heights wave crests and troughs should be subjected to the rayleigh distribution assuming a narrowbanded spectrum considering the presence of nonlinearities non stationary trends surface forces dissipation and other factors the rayleigh distribution tends to over predict the actual heights observed in some cases tayfun 2011 during the last few decades many efforts were made to study alternatives or refinements to the rayleigh distribution to improve its accuracy for large waves forristall 1978 zheng et al 2006 stansell et al 2004 dawson 2004 boccotti 1989 naess 1985 tayfun 1990 denoting the moments of s by m j j 0 1 the spectral average frequency spectral bandwidth and the mean zero up crossing frequency are given by Ï m m 1 m 0 Ï m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 and Ï 0 m 2 m 0 respectively three popular analytic wave height distribution models devised by tayfun 1990 naess 1985 and boccotti 1989 were applied in this study for comparisons with the distribution of the rogue waves series 8 e t Î¾ h 1 r m 2 r m 1 1 r m

tayfun 1990 naess 1985 and boccotti 1989 r m a and b are parameters that can be estimated either from the time series of wave elevation or just from the related spectrum tayfun 2011 for clarity in fig 6 a c the statistics measured at gauge 4 were compared with the predictions of the existing analytical wave height distributions introduced by naess boccotti and tayfun respectively the rayleigh distribution for linear waves was also included in the comparisons all these three analytical distributions were found to be very close with each other and be diverged from the rayleigh distribution to the lower level especially at the tail as shown in fig 6 a c the waves that satisfy the definition of rogue waves h 2 2 h s appear in all the three realizations large deviations away from the three analytical distributions can be clearly observed in the probability range h 1 8 h s it is also found that the wave height distribution for the cases rw1 rw3 seem to follow the rayleigh distribution at lower wave height ranges which are inconsistent with results obtained earlier tayfun and fedele 2007 claiming that the rayleigh distribution over predicts the wave heights the other predictions from naess boccotti and tayfun could describe the experimental wave data reasonably well the deviations were usually within about 2 or less therefore we developed two irregular wave trains cases irr1 irr2 and then plotted the wave height distributions and their comparisons with the analytical distributions as shown in fig 7 a and b the wave height distributions of the two irregular wave trains were found to agree with the analytical distributions in eq 8 eq 10 5 wave crest distribution a common approach to estimate the extreme wave crest used widely for the norwegian continental shelf is to perform a long term analysis utilizing the all sea state approach in combination with the short term second order distribution given by forristall 2000 the forristall distribution is based on second order wave simulations using approximately 1000 3 h realizations at each sea state which is recommended by dnv rp c205 for offshore design it is widely used for both short term and long term predictions lian and haver 2015a however some studies pointed out that the short term wave crest distributions predicted by forristall were underestimated compared to field measurements as well as model test measurements huang and zhang 2018 conducted thousands of computational fluid dynamics simulations and developed the semi empirical wave crest probability distribution for nonlinear waves involving both the probability distribution of single realization pdsr and probability distribution of ensemble realization pder for easy practical use it can be applied to check the crest distribution of prototype scale 3 h wave calibration tests and any other numerical simulations in this experimental study we checked the wave crest distributions of irregular waves under a rogue wave event within a 3 h duration on a prototype scale the comparisons between the crest distributions obtained from previous studies and the three realizations of the irregular waves under a rogue wave event from the experimental simulations are presented in fig 8 a c it is notable that the distribution of the irregular waves with the rogue wave event is relatively close to that based on the mean semi empirical formulas moreover the wave crest height with the rogue wave event could be greater than that obtained from the mean semi empirical formulas at the same low probability level huang and zhang 2018 defined the 99 upper and lower bounds for probability distributions in single realizations as 11 p r o b a b a l i t y x c r e s t h s 0 5 12 p r o b a b a l i t y x c r e s t h s 0 5 fig 8 a c also show that the distributions of the three realizations of irregular waves with the rogue wave event for the 3 h duration are included within the 99 upper and lower bounds of the semi empirical formulas this means that the irregular waves with the rogue wave event generated experimentally in this study could be treated as qualified waves for applications in model tests for comparison we also plotted the rayleigh distribution which is valid for linear waves and forristall distribution in fig 8 a c the result indicates that the rayleigh distribution may significantly underestimate the wave crest height at the same probability level a deviation is observed between the crest distributions of the 3 h time series from the tests and those predicted by forristall we considered the crest distributions from the time series of irregular waves for two realizations in fig 9 a and b the crest distributions of the irregular waves for case irr2 match the forristall distribution while the results for case irr1 show a relatively large deviation which more or less coincides with the viewpoint presented in the available literature petrova et al 2006 onorato et al 2006 lian and haver 2015b fig 10 demonstrates the crest distributions of the 3 h time series for case rw1 at different locations and its corresponding analytical distributions significant deviations from the mean semi empirical distribution can be observed at a higher probability for the distributions of the first two wave gauges which can be reflected from the spectra plotted in fig 5 the distribution at wave gauge 5 located 2 m behind the target measurement location shows protuberance within the probability range of 0 01 0 1 while the maximum crest is much smaller than that at wave gauge 4 the focused wave disperses again when moving past the presupposed focusing point location 4 6 conclusion we conducted an experimental study on the rogue wave event in random sea the idea for generating rogue waves in random sea which is presented in wang et al 2015 was applied in the wave tests the following conclusions were drawn the modified method to generate rogue waves in random sea is capable of generating rogue wave events at a target position in the wave basin at the same time the rogue wave event can also satisfy the requirements of the specific spectrum and wave parameters such as hs tp and Î³ showing potential for applications in future seakeeping tests where the extreme wave structure interaction needs to be considered the method developed by wang et al has advantages over those proposed by kriebel and alsina theoretically as mentioned in an earlier study wang et al 2015 however owing to the existence of wave breaking in some severe sea states wave calibration process was performed to meet the requirements of the spectrum and wave parameters as the result the method proposed by wang et al 2015 is not as advantageous as that developed by kriebel et al 2000 in model tests for practical applications obvious deviations of the wave height distribution from the analytical distributions appear at the tail end owing to the existence of the rogue wave event similar deviations of the wave crest distribution from the semi analytical distributions can be observed but within the boundaries introduced by huang and zhang 2018 showing the feasibility of the method for model testing design and assessment provided the issues related to extreme local wave motions acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china

22702,marine structures such as composite breakwaters may inevitably be located on loose sandy profiles so that the seismic induced liquefaction of the sub layers may significantly affect the performance of these breakwaters the less repairability of composite breakwaters makes it necessary to study their seismic induced residual deformations in this paper a series of 1 g shaking table model tests have been used to evaluate the seismic behavior of caisson rubble mound breakwaters due to the liquefaction of the seabed using the physical model tests all the deformation mechanisms of the seabed rubble mound foundation and the upper caissons were identified and summarized the ground profile of the models includes liquefiable and non liquefiable sub layers so the effect of the relative density as well as the depth of the liquefiable layer on the model responses has been examined as a result it was shown that although a thin upper resistant layer can restrict the lateral deformation of the rubble mound foundation the liquefaction in this condition may occur more severely and the excess pore water pressure may dissipate more slowly due to the limited possibility of the drainage the role of reduction in input motion frequency to increase the liquefaction severity has also been discussed keywords liquefaction composite breakwater shaking table tests seismic frequency caissons deformation mechanisms 1 introduction over the past half century liquefaction as one of the destructive consequences of earthquakes has been widely studied by geotechnical researchers nevertheless this complicated terrible and sudden phenomenon cannot be considered as a completely well known topic for researchers yet so the study on its features seems inevitable and still ongoing from the practical point of view coastal and near shore structures e g seawall breakwater groin and jetty constructed on a loose seabed are of particular importance in this regard because of their high potential to be exposed to liquefaction a large number of failures of such structures due to the seabed liquefaction have been reported in the literature de groot et al 2006 sumer et al 2007 one bunch of these structures are breakwaters so that sometimes there is no alternative for their designers to avoid placing them on loose liquefiable seabed obviously in such cases if an earthquake occurs regardless of deformation of breakwater self body its bed may lose their resistance and so the breakwater operation may be disrupted the research on this kind of damage mechanisms can becomes more essential when the studied breakwater is not a repairable rubble mound type but a composite type with less reparability during its operation period different studies have been done so far on the seismic response of breakwaters systems in order to study the seismic function of breakwater itself cihan et al 2012 and cihan and yuksel 2011 2013 modeled a homogenous rubble mound breakwater in a rigid bed shaking table and investigated the effect of different dynamic loadings on slumping and densification of the core material in addition memos 2000 memos et al 2001 and kiara et al 2001 experimentally examined the role of a loose foundation in the deformation of rubble mound breakwaters and concluded that the earthquake induced liquefaction of foundation will lead sinking of the mound as well as significant remaining subsidence of the breakwater crown previous laboratory researches in this field include using a wide range of equipment and methods for example sumer et al 2008 tried to generate excess pore water pressure in the loose soil underneath a breakwater only by means of a rocking caisson this is while wang et al 2013 and matsuda et al 2016 applied dynamic centrifuge tests to simulate the bearing capacity of dykes and breakwaters and the pattern of pore water pressure buildup during an input exiting motion very recent laboratory researches have also been done on composite breakwaters located on a liqufiable seabed chaudhary and hazarika 2018 miyamoto et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2018a 2018b settlement and tilt of the caissons and lateral flows of seabed soils have been disscussed in these researches and some countermeasure methods have been examined accordingly the study on the response of breakwaters due to the liquefaction of their seabed is never limited to the experimental researches using a coupled numerical analysis ye et al 2016 modeled liquefaction induced subsidence translation and rotation of a composite type breakwater they have also reported a partial liquefaction just beneath the composite breakwater see also ye 2012 ye and wang 2015 moreover as a result of an effective stress based numerical model bao et al 2016 have mentioned the deamplification of input acceleration due to the soil liquefaction beneath the breakwater different patterns of excess pore water pressure generation at the different points of model were another conclusion of their research the seabed liquefaction of breakwaters and slopes has also been studied in many other numerical researches ye and jeng 2013 najma and latifi 2018 gu et al 2018 zou et al 2018 he et al 2018 in this paper the effect of earthquake induced seabed liquefaction on the response of a composite type breakwater which is composed of rubble mound foundation and concrete caissons has been experimentally studied using 1 g shaking table model tests the seabed instability of modelled breakwater made it possible to evaluate and discuss the different deformation mechanisms and failure modes that can occur in such a structure some geotechnical and seismic specifications that affect the liquefaction severity and consequently the damage level of composite breakwater have also been investigated in this paper 2 model specifications a series of shaking table model tests were carried out in this study geometry and instrumentation of these models in compliance with the geotechnical parameters of materials as well as scaling laws are presented in the following sections 2 1 experimental setup shaking table model tests were conducted at soil mechanics and soil dynamics laboratory of the university of tehran iran this shaking table has a loading capacity of 5 ton g and allows one degree of freedom in 1 g gravitational field the dimensions of its steel deck are 1 80 1 20 m fig 1 schematically shows the loading and measuring units of this shaking table as will be mentioned in scaling factors section considering the stress dependent behavior of sands quantitative results of scaled down models obtained from 1 g tests should be used cautiously however 1 g shaking table models despite their limitations are still an appropriate tool for objective observation and investigation of deformation mechanisms failure modes and the seismic responses of structures several studies have been carried out so far on different types of structures using the above mentioned shaking table khanmohammadi et al 2017 zekri et al 2015 komak panah et al 2015 2 2 models geometry the prototype composite breakwater studied in this paper is shown in fig 2 this breakwater is supposed to be constructed in iran liquefied natural gas lng plant that is located near the tombak port in southern iran the water depth at the location of this breakwater is about 21 m and there is also a liquefiable soil layer of approximately 9 m thick which will affect the performance of the breakwater during an earthquake according to the dimensions of the container box and the designed configuration of prototype breakwater a geometrical scale factor of 60 was used to scale this breakwater down in the laboratory fig 3 shows the three dimensional view of the model in the laboratory scale 2 3 instrumentation in order to measure the parameters related to the response of models in tests different types of transducers were used the arrangement of transducers in most tests is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 pore water pressure pwp transducers and accelerometers acc are typically buried in the model while linear variable differential transducer lvdt s measure the external displacements and settlements due to the symmetry of the model geometry and applied loadings only one half of the model has been instrumented 2 4 material properties as mentioned in the previous section the composite breakwater is located on a liquefiable soil layer in this study firoozkuh no 161 sand was used to model this liquefiable layer in experiments the uniform grading of this sand fig 5 made it possible to prepare a loose soil layer with a high liquefaction potential moreover in order to achieve a homogeneous layer with low relative density the wet tamping method was used fig 6 a the liquefiable layer was prepared with different relative densities in different tests and if necessary this layer gently compacted using a manual hammer fig 6b the geotechnical specifications of firoozkuh no 161 sand are summarized in table 1 the detailed geotechnical properties of this sand are reported by farahmand et al 2016 firoozkuh sand with 15 weight percent clay was also used to model the non liquefiable layer as shown in fig 3 the foundation of the breakwater body consists of the rubble mound material this part of the composite breakwaters which is made of coarse grained porous gravel is responsible for dissipating the wave energy as well as transferring the load of caissons to the ground seabed according to the functions of rubble mound material its prototype grading curve was scaled down based on the permeability parameter the obtained grading curve was then created artificially in the laboratory fig 7 shows the prototype and modeled grading curves of rubble mound material the construction of rubble mound section using guide rods as well as placing the armor materials are shown in fig 8 the uppermost part of the test model is composed of two floors caissons the prototype concrete caissons were modeled in laboratory using plexiglass material all the dimensions were scaled down so that the weight induced stresses of the modeled caissons would be equivalent to prototype ones fig 9 2 5 scaling factors the results of the model tests are reliable only when the parameters involved in the phenomenon studied are properly scaled down in the models for this purpose the physical laws governing the specific phenomena of those experiments are identified and appropriate similitude laws are proposed accordingly in this study in order to scale the prototype parameters the well known similitude laws of the 1 g gravitational field suggested by iai 1989 have been used according to iai 1989 the basic equations which govern the behavior of saturated soil structure fluid system include the equilibrium and the mass balance of soil skeleton fluid phase and external structure as well as the stress strain relation of all the materials involved in the model iai 1989 also made a few assumptions to simplify the scale factors and make this process more applicable for example the saturated soil density of the model scale was assumed to be identical to that of the prototype scale finally the scale factors of all geotechnical physical and dynamic parameters of the model were derived based on the geometrical scale factor Î» based on the geometrical scale factor of this study Î» 60 the other scale factors are calculated and summarized in table 2 the factors presented in table 2 have been used to scale down the prototype parameters these factors can also be used to scale up the results of the model tests as well designing the dimensions and specifications of the test models based on the factors presented in table 2 makes it possible to achieve the deformation modes and the model response trends which are compatible to the prototype responses however considering the limitations of the 1 g shaking table model tests it is not expected in this process to predict the exact quantities of prototype responses and therefore this is beyond the scope of this study 3 experiments details 3 1 tests program the investigation of various deformation modes that occurs in composite breakwaters due to the liquefaction of seabed is the main objective of the present model tests in this regards six different tests were planned to evaluate the effect of relative density and depth of the liquefiable sand as well as the frequency of input motions details of these experiments are summarized in table 3 3 2 applied loadings the nominal input motion of all tests was of a harmonic type with constant amplitude moreover according to table 3 the frequency of these input motions was 4 hz in most tests and 3 hz in one of the tests fig 10 shows two measured time histories of the input motion recorded by base accelerometers acc1 in fig 4 4 results and discussion the response of the models to the applied loading and the data recorded by transducers will be presented and interpreted in this section moreover the effect of relative density and the depth of the liquefiable layer as well as the frequency of input acceleration on the model responses will be assessed in detail 4 1 deformation mechanisms due to the input loading applied on the models and subsequently the liquefaction of seabed soil several types of deformation mechanisms occurred in the test models the plexiglas walls of the model container made it possible to observe qualitative responses of the models during and after the experiments in addition a grid made of colored sands also facilitated tracking the deformation of seabed layers geotechnical and geometrical characteristics of the models caused different responses of them however the dominant deformation mechanisms which were due to the loss of shear strength and finally failure in bearing capacity were observed in almost all tests two views of the model crb 30 3 0 before and after test have been compared in fig 11 according to fig 11b the dominant deformation mechanisms are 1 settlement of the loose layer in the middle part 2 lateral spreading of the liquefied soil toward both sides 3 heaving of the seabed soil due to the failure occurrence 4 broadening of the rubble mound foundation 5 settlement and densification of the rubble mound and armor 6 tilt and horizontal displacement of caissons and 7 settlement of the caissons crest and submergence of the breakwater where the first three mechanisms are related to the liquefiable seabed and the next four to the breakwater body the relative density and the position of the liquefiable layer as well as the frequency of the input acceleration can affect the severity of the above deformations these effects are qualitatively summarized in table 4 decreasing deformations severity due to increasing the relative density of liquefiable layer can also be deduced from the displacements recorded by lvdts the settlement time history of caissons crests normalized by the breakwater height are illustrated in fig 12 for three values of liquefiable soil s relative density as shown in fig 12 the vertical displacement of the caissons crest decreases by increasing the relative density of liquefiable layer the rate of this reduction however is higher in lower relative densities in addition the settlement of the breakwaters has not continued after the end of the seismic loading the position of the liquefiable layer is another specification that can affect the deformation mechanisms of the composite breakwater according to table 3 the effect of the liquefiable layer is evaluated at three different depths in this study based on the thickness of the liquefiable layer h l and that of the upper non liquefiable layer h n l the thickness ratio Î² is defined as 1 Î² h n l h l the value of the ratio Î² is 0 00 0 33 and 0 67 for second fourth and fifth tests of table 3 respectively the relative density of the liquefiable layer is the same in these three tests so the difference between their responses is only due to the position of the liquefiable layer the deformed models of three mentioned tests are compared in fig 13 as can be seen in fig 13 the presence of a non liquefiable layer at the top of the loose layer can change the lateral deformation pattern of the rubble mound foundation as well as the breakwater seabed it should be noted that although the resistant upper layer can limit the lateral deformations of the model the settlement of the breakwater may increase due to the punching the foundation to the seabed as shown in fig 14 both the settlement of the breakwater crest and the heaving of the seabed increase when the liquefiable layer is moved to a greater depth it should be noted that the displacement time histories illustrated in fig 14 are normalized by breakwater height the characteristics of the input motion will also affect the deformation mechanisms of the breakwater models these characteristics include the amplitude of the motion the input frequency and the effective duration the frequency effect can be evaluated by comparing the response of the model in tests crb 30 4 0 and crb 30 3 0 see table 3 according to fig 15 the liquefaction severity and consequently the deformations of the models are significantly higher for the model that is excited with less frequency 4 2 excess pore water pressure as previously shown in fig 4 pore water pressures at different points of the model were recorded by 7 transducers pore water pressure time histories obtained from these sensors contain some important evidence about the occurrence of liquefaction its severity and the role of breakwater surcharge on this phenomenon the excess pore water pressure during seismic loading u ex can be found by subtracting the hydrostatic pore water pressure u 0 from total pre water pressure that is recorded during the test 2 u ex u u 0 since total pore water pressure for contractive materials is increasing during the shearing loading the value of u ex is usually positive and increasing during the seismic loading normalizing the excess pore water pressure to the initial effective stress Ï 0 yields the excess pore water pressure ratio r u in the form of 3 r u u ex Ï 0 the time histories of the excess pore water pressure ratio r u at four different locations of the model test crb 30 4 0 are compared in fig 16 according to the results recorded by the transducers of the lower layer fig 16a at the location of pwp3 where there is less vertical stress due to the breakwater surcharge the increasing of r u ratio is greater than pwp1 a similar pattern can also be seen for two points of liquefiable layer fig 16b therefore the presence of a structure such as composite breakwater can significantly affect the ground stress field so the patterns of pore water pressure generation at the lower sublayers may also change accordingly it can also be concluded from fig 16 that the generation of the pore water pressure at lower layer is more gradual than the upper layer in other words the r u ratio in the liquefiable layer rapidly reaches its maximum value but in the lower layer this increase continues until the end of the seismic loading this difference in behavior that is shown in fig 17 with more detail is obviously due to the fact that the lower layer has been made by clayey sand materials according to fig 17b only three cycles are enough for the point at the location of the pwp4 to reach its maximum amount of excess pore water pressure the position of the liquefiable sub layer at the ground profile also affects the generation as well as the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure since the presence of an upper layer with less permeability may restrict the drainage possibility of the water from the liquefiable layer the rate of the pore water pressure dissipation in such profiles is relatively lower than the profiles in which the liquefiable layer is directly deposited at the seabed the results of the excess pore water pressure ratio at the location of pwp6 for different positions of the liquefiable layer are compared in fig 18 as shown in this figure the rate of the r u ratio is lower for greater values of thickness ratio Î² in other words for models that contain a thick upper layer with less permeability not only the severity of the liquefaction is relatively higher but also the excess pore water pressure will be dissipated more slowly in these models the results recorded by other pore water pressure transducers are also similar and they confirm this conclusion as well in addition to the geometry and material properties of the soil layers the input motion characteristics also change the pore water pressures generated at soil layers as previously mentioned about fig 15 decreasing the input frequency of the seismic loading will significantly increase the liquefaction severity at the model the higher values of pore water pressure ratio shown in fig 19 are also due to the increase in the energy applied to the model due to the reduction of the input frequency 4 3 acceleration and amplification the accelerations recorded at different points of the ground profile during the seismic loading provide useful information about the effect of the sub layer liquefaction on the responses of the composite breakwater although it has been shown in previous sections that liquefaction induced deformations may disrupt the performance of the breakwater the evaluation of accelerations is also important because the liquefied sub layers may reduce the acceleration received by the breakwater the acceleration time histories recorded by acc2 acc3 and acc6 see fig 4 for two test models with different relative densities i e crb 10 4 0 and crb 50 4 0 are compared in fig 20 the input acceleration of these two tests is the same and was previously introduced in fig 10a as shown in fig 20a and b the accelerations recorded at the non liquefiable layer are the same in both models and there is no significant difference between these two time histories and the input bas acceleration therefore due to the characteristics of the non liquefiable lower layer as well as the proximity of the accelerometer to the model bed no considerable change has been recorded for the acceleration of this layer figs 20c and d show gradual decrease of acceleration amplitude during the seismic loading the accelerometer acc3 is located in the liquefiable layer so these amplitude reductions are due to the softening of the sandy layer as a result of liquefaction and reducing the ability of the soil to transfer the shear stress according to fig 20d since the sandy layer is more compacted and consequently the liquefaction severity in model crb 50 4 0 is less than model crb 10 4 0 the acceleration amplitudes are higher in this model test and the sandy layer has even experienced a slight amplification in the early cycles before the occurrence of liquefaction finally figs 20e and f show the acceleration received by the topmost points of the models according to these time histories the occurrence of liquefaction in the sub layers has led to a de amplification of the accelerations received by the upper caissons this de amplification is more visible in the model contains loose layer i e crb 10 4 0 the position of the liquefiable layer also affects the pattern of the acceleration de amplification the accelerations of the caissons topmost points for different values of the thickness ratio Î² are compared in fig 21 according to fig 21 the acceleration recorded in these three tests are almost the same before the occurrence of liquefaction however the acceleration amplitudes are significantly reduced due the liquefaction of the sandy sub layer in addition fig 21 shows that the highest value for de amplification ratio belongs to the model that contains the thickest non liquefiable layer at the top of the liquefiable sandy layer i e crb 30 4 10 as previously explained due to the less possibility of the drainage in the test model crb 30 4 10 its liquefiable layer has the highest increase in pore water pressure and consequently the greatest reduction in shear strength this liquefaction induced softening prevents the acceleration to transfer toward the upper layer and the breakwater the accelerations recorded within the rubble mound foundation of the composite breakwater for two different input frequencies are shown in fig 22 fig 22b shows the recorded values of acc5 plotted against the input acceleration this presentation form of the accelerations makes it possible to recognize the different response of the rubble mound foundation before and after liquefaction moreover the width to length ratio of the circumscribed rectangle drawn in figs 22b and d show the acceleration de amplification ratio after the occurrence of liquefaction as previously mentioned due the severity of the liquefaction in low input frequencies this width to length ratio is lower for the test crb 30 3 0 see fig 22d since the input motion should pass through the soil profile to reach the location of the rubble mound foundation depending on the shear wave velocity of the layers this transfer will result in a time delay between the base motion and the acceleration recorded by the transducers this time lag is somewhat detectable in figs 22a and c in the form of a phase difference between the acceleration time histories the elliptical shapes of the figs 22b and d after the occurrence of liquefaction are also due to this phase difference 5 conclusions the seismic behavior of a composite breakwater located on a liquefiable seabed were experimentally studied in this paper the possible deformations of the composite breakwaters were introduced and the effects of soil compaction liquefiable layer depth and input motion on their performance were discussed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the deformation mechanisms in the breakwater seabed include global or local failures the settlement and lateral spreading of the liquefiable layer and finally the heaving of the seabed broadening settlement and densification of the rubble mound foundation and tilt settlement and horizontal displacement of caissons are also the dominant deformations of the breakwater body since the composite breakwaters are less capable of repair the settlements and tilts of the caissons are most critical deformations of these structures so that the significant amounts of crest deformations will cause the submergence of caissons and so the composite breakwater became out of operation increasing the relative density of the liquefiable layer will lead to decrease in the liquefaction severity and all the deformations of the breakwater the rate of the reduction in deformations however is lower for high relative densities if the liquefiable layer is transferred from the surface to deeper levels the broadening of the rubble mound foundation may decrease the final settlement of the caissons however may even increase due to the potential of the breakwater to penetrate more into the seabed transfer the loose layer to deeper levels by embanking can be considered as a mitigation method only where the thickness of upper non liquefiable layer is high enough in such cases not only the resistance of loose layer against liquefaction increases but also the thick upper layer prevents the creation of a punching mechanism under the breakwater by decreasing the input frequency of the seismic loading the applied seismic energy increases and so the deformations of the breakwater will increase as well the pore water pressure time histories also indicate that the severity of the liquefaction is higher due to lower frequencies a significant drop in the acceleration amplitude of the breakwater body at the time of liquefaction occurrence confirms that the liquefied sub layers can de amplify the transmitted acceleration this de amplification is due to the softening of the liquefied layer and its inability to transfer shear stresses to the upper layers acknowledgments the shaking table tests were conducted at soil mechanics and soil dynamics laboratory of the university of tehran the authors

22702,marine structures such as composite breakwaters may inevitably be located on loose sandy profiles so that the seismic induced liquefaction of the sub layers may significantly affect the performance of these breakwaters the less repairability of composite breakwaters makes it necessary to study their seismic induced residual deformations in this paper a series of 1 g shaking table model tests have been used to evaluate the seismic behavior of caisson rubble mound breakwaters due to the liquefaction of the seabed using the physical model tests all the deformation mechanisms of the seabed rubble mound foundation and the upper caissons were identified and summarized the ground profile of the models includes liquefiable and non liquefiable sub layers so the effect of the relative density as well as the depth of the liquefiable layer on the model responses has been examined as a result it was shown that although a thin upper resistant layer can restrict the lateral deformation of the rubble mound foundation the liquefaction in this condition may occur more severely and the excess pore water pressure may dissipate more slowly due to the limited possibility of the drainage the role of reduction in input motion frequency to increase the liquefaction severity has also been discussed keywords liquefaction composite breakwater shaking table tests seismic frequency caissons deformation mechanisms 1 introduction over the past half century liquefaction as one of the destructive consequences of earthquakes has been widely studied by geotechnical researchers nevertheless this complicated terrible and sudden phenomenon cannot be considered as a completely well known topic for researchers yet so the study on its features seems inevitable and still ongoing from the practical point of view coastal and near shore structures e g seawall breakwater groin and jetty constructed on a loose seabed are of particular importance in this regard because of their high potential to be exposed to liquefaction a large number of failures of such structures due to the seabed liquefaction have been reported in the literature de groot et al 2006 sumer et al 2007 one bunch of these structures are breakwaters so that sometimes there is no alternative for their designers to avoid placing them on loose liquefiable seabed obviously in such cases if an earthquake occurs regardless of deformation of breakwater self body its bed may lose their resistance and so the breakwater operation may be disrupted the research on this kind of damage mechanisms can becomes more essential when the studied breakwater is not a repairable rubble mound type but a composite type with less reparability during its operation period different studies have been done so far on the seismic response of breakwaters systems in order to study the seismic function of breakwater itself cihan et al 2012 and cihan and yuksel 2011 2013 modeled a homogenous rubble mound breakwater in a rigid bed shaking table and investigated the effect of different dynamic loadings on slumping and densification of the core material in addition memos 2000 memos et al 2001 and kiara et al 2001 experimentally examined the role of a loose foundation in the deformation of rubble mound breakwaters and concluded that the earthquake induced liquefaction of foundation will lead sinking of the mound as well as significant remaining subsidence of the breakwater crown previous laboratory researches in this field include using a wide range of equipment and methods for example sumer et al 2008 tried to generate excess pore water pressure in the loose soil underneath a breakwater only by means of a rocking caisson this is while wang et al 2013 and matsuda et al 2016 applied dynamic centrifuge tests to simulate the bearing capacity of dykes and breakwaters and the pattern of pore water pressure buildup during an input exiting motion very recent laboratory researches have also been done on composite breakwaters located on a liqufiable seabed chaudhary and hazarika 2018 miyamoto et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2018a 2018b settlement and tilt of the caissons and lateral flows of seabed soils have been disscussed in these researches and some countermeasure methods have been examined accordingly the study on the response of breakwaters due to the liquefaction of their seabed is never limited to the experimental researches using a coupled numerical analysis ye et al 2016 modeled liquefaction induced subsidence translation and rotation of a composite type breakwater they have also reported a partial liquefaction just beneath the composite breakwater see also ye 2012 ye and wang 2015 moreover as a result of an effective stress based numerical model bao et al 2016 have mentioned the deamplification of input acceleration due to the soil liquefaction beneath the breakwater different patterns of excess pore water pressure generation at the different points of model were another conclusion of their research the seabed liquefaction of breakwaters and slopes has also been studied in many other numerical researches ye and jeng 2013 najma and latifi 2018 gu et al 2018 zou et al 2018 he et al 2018 in this paper the effect of earthquake induced seabed liquefaction on the response of a composite type breakwater which is composed of rubble mound foundation and concrete caissons has been experimentally studied using 1 g shaking table model tests the seabed instability of modelled breakwater made it possible to evaluate and discuss the different deformation mechanisms and failure modes that can occur in such a structure some geotechnical and seismic specifications that affect the liquefaction severity and consequently the damage level of composite breakwater have also been investigated in this paper 2 model specifications a series of shaking table model tests were carried out in this study geometry and instrumentation of these models in compliance with the geotechnical parameters of materials as well as scaling laws are presented in the following sections 2 1 experimental setup shaking table model tests were conducted at soil mechanics and soil dynamics laboratory of the university of tehran iran this shaking table has a loading capacity of 5 ton g and allows one degree of freedom in 1 g gravitational field the dimensions of its steel deck are 1 80 1 20 m fig 1 schematically shows the loading and measuring units of this shaking table as will be mentioned in scaling factors section considering the stress dependent behavior of sands quantitative results of scaled down models obtained from 1 g tests should be used cautiously however 1 g shaking table models despite their limitations are still an appropriate tool for objective observation and investigation of deformation mechanisms failure modes and the seismic responses of structures several studies have been carried out so far on different types of structures using the above mentioned shaking table khanmohammadi et al 2017 zekri et al 2015 komak panah et al 2015 2 2 models geometry the prototype composite breakwater studied in this paper is shown in fig 2 this breakwater is supposed to be constructed in iran liquefied natural gas lng plant that is located near the tombak port in southern iran the water depth at the location of this breakwater is about 21 m and there is also a liquefiable soil layer of approximately 9 m thick which will affect the performance of the breakwater during an earthquake according to the dimensions of the container box and the designed configuration of prototype breakwater a geometrical scale factor of 60 was used to scale this breakwater down in the laboratory fig 3 shows the three dimensional view of the model in the laboratory scale 2 3 instrumentation in order to measure the parameters related to the response of models in tests different types of transducers were used the arrangement of transducers in most tests is shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 pore water pressure pwp transducers and accelerometers acc are typically buried in the model while linear variable differential transducer lvdt s measure the external displacements and settlements due to the symmetry of the model geometry and applied loadings only one half of the model has been instrumented 2 4 material properties as mentioned in the previous section the composite breakwater is located on a liquefiable soil layer in this study firoozkuh no 161 sand was used to model this liquefiable layer in experiments the uniform grading of this sand fig 5 made it possible to prepare a loose soil layer with a high liquefaction potential moreover in order to achieve a homogeneous layer with low relative density the wet tamping method was used fig 6 a the liquefiable layer was prepared with different relative densities in different tests and if necessary this layer gently compacted using a manual hammer fig 6b the geotechnical specifications of firoozkuh no 161 sand are summarized in table 1 the detailed geotechnical properties of this sand are reported by farahmand et al 2016 firoozkuh sand with 15 weight percent clay was also used to model the non liquefiable layer as shown in fig 3 the foundation of the breakwater body consists of the rubble mound material this part of the composite breakwaters which is made of coarse grained porous gravel is responsible for dissipating the wave energy as well as transferring the load of caissons to the ground seabed according to the functions of rubble mound material its prototype grading curve was scaled down based on the permeability parameter the obtained grading curve was then created artificially in the laboratory fig 7 shows the prototype and modeled grading curves of rubble mound material the construction of rubble mound section using guide rods as well as placing the armor materials are shown in fig 8 the uppermost part of the test model is composed of two floors caissons the prototype concrete caissons were modeled in laboratory using plexiglass material all the dimensions were scaled down so that the weight induced stresses of the modeled caissons would be equivalent to prototype ones fig 9 2 5 scaling factors the results of the model tests are reliable only when the parameters involved in the phenomenon studied are properly scaled down in the models for this purpose the physical laws governing the specific phenomena of those experiments are identified and appropriate similitude laws are proposed accordingly in this study in order to scale the prototype parameters the well known similitude laws of the 1 g gravitational field suggested by iai 1989 have been used according to iai 1989 the basic equations which govern the behavior of saturated soil structure fluid system include the equilibrium and the mass balance of soil skeleton fluid phase and external structure as well as the stress strain relation of all the materials involved in the model iai 1989 also made a few assumptions to simplify the scale factors and make this process more applicable for example the saturated soil density of the model scale was assumed to be identical to that of the prototype scale finally the scale factors of all geotechnical physical and dynamic parameters of the model were derived based on the geometrical scale factor Î» based on the geometrical scale factor of this study Î» 60 the other scale factors are calculated and summarized in table 2 the factors presented in table 2 have been used to scale down the prototype parameters these factors can also be used to scale up the results of the model tests as well designing the dimensions and specifications of the test models based on the factors presented in table 2 makes it possible to achieve the deformation modes and the model response trends which are compatible to the prototype responses however considering the limitations of the 1 g shaking table model tests it is not expected in this process to predict the exact quantities of prototype responses and therefore this is beyond the scope of this study 3 experiments details 3 1 tests program the investigation of various deformation modes that occurs in composite breakwaters due to the liquefaction of seabed is the main objective of the present model tests in this regards six different tests were planned to evaluate the effect of relative density and depth of the liquefiable sand as well as the frequency of input motions details of these experiments are summarized in table 3 3 2 applied loadings the nominal input motion of all tests was of a harmonic type with constant amplitude moreover according to table 3 the frequency of these input motions was 4 hz in most tests and 3 hz in one of the tests fig 10 shows two measured time histories of the input motion recorded by base accelerometers acc1 in fig 4 4 results and discussion the response of the models to the applied loading and the data recorded by transducers will be presented and interpreted in this section moreover the effect of relative density and the depth of the liquefiable layer as well as the frequency of input acceleration on the model responses will be assessed in detail 4 1 deformation mechanisms due to the input loading applied on the models and subsequently the liquefaction of seabed soil several types of deformation mechanisms occurred in the test models the plexiglas walls of the model container made it possible to observe qualitative responses of the models during and after the experiments in addition a grid made of colored sands also facilitated tracking the deformation of seabed layers geotechnical and geometrical characteristics of the models caused different responses of them however the dominant deformation mechanisms which were due to the loss of shear strength and finally failure in bearing capacity were observed in almost all tests two views of the model crb 30 3 0 before and after test have been compared in fig 11 according to fig 11b the dominant deformation mechanisms are 1 settlement of the loose layer in the middle part 2 lateral spreading of the liquefied soil toward both sides 3 heaving of the seabed soil due to the failure occurrence 4 broadening of the rubble mound foundation 5 settlement and densification of the rubble mound and armor 6 tilt and horizontal displacement of caissons and 7 settlement of the caissons crest and submergence of the breakwater where the first three mechanisms are related to the liquefiable seabed and the next four to the breakwater body the relative density and the position of the liquefiable layer as well as the frequency of the input acceleration can affect the severity of the above deformations these effects are qualitatively summarized in table 4 decreasing deformations severity due to increasing the relative density of liquefiable layer can also be deduced from the displacements recorded by lvdts the settlement time history of caissons crests normalized by the breakwater height are illustrated in fig 12 for three values of liquefiable soil s relative density as shown in fig 12 the vertical displacement of the caissons crest decreases by increasing the relative density of liquefiable layer the rate of this reduction however is higher in lower relative densities in addition the settlement of the breakwaters has not continued after the end of the seismic loading the position of the liquefiable layer is another specification that can affect the deformation mechanisms of the composite breakwater according to table 3 the effect of the liquefiable layer is evaluated at three different depths in this study based on the thickness of the liquefiable layer h l and that of the upper non liquefiable layer h n l the thickness ratio Î² is defined as 1 Î² h n l h l the value of the ratio Î² is 0 00 0 33 and 0 67 for second fourth and fifth tests of table 3 respectively the relative density of the liquefiable layer is the same in these three tests so the difference between their responses is only due to the position of the liquefiable layer the deformed models of three mentioned tests are compared in fig 13 as can be seen in fig 13 the presence of a non liquefiable layer at the top of the loose layer can change the lateral deformation pattern of the rubble mound foundation as well as the breakwater seabed it should be noted that although the resistant upper layer can limit the lateral deformations of the model the settlement of the breakwater may increase due to the punching the foundation to the seabed as shown in fig 14 both the settlement of the breakwater crest and the heaving of the seabed increase when the liquefiable layer is moved to a greater depth it should be noted that the displacement time histories illustrated in fig 14 are normalized by breakwater height the characteristics of the input motion will also affect the deformation mechanisms of the breakwater models these characteristics include the amplitude of the motion the input frequency and the effective duration the frequency effect can be evaluated by comparing the response of the model in tests crb 30 4 0 and crb 30 3 0 see table 3 according to fig 15 the liquefaction severity and consequently the deformations of the models are significantly higher for the model that is excited with less frequency 4 2 excess pore water pressure as previously shown in fig 4 pore water pressures at different points of the model were recorded by 7 transducers pore water pressure time histories obtained from these sensors contain some important evidence about the occurrence of liquefaction its severity and the role of breakwater surcharge on this phenomenon the excess pore water pressure during seismic loading u ex can be found by subtracting the hydrostatic pore water pressure u 0 from total pre water pressure that is recorded during the test 2 u ex u u 0 since total pore water pressure for contractive materials is increasing during the shearing loading the value of u ex is usually positive and increasing during the seismic loading normalizing the excess pore water pressure to the initial effective stress Ï 0 yields the excess pore water pressure ratio r u in the form of 3 r u u ex Ï 0 the time histories of the excess pore water pressure ratio r u at four different locations of the model test crb 30 4 0 are compared in fig 16 according to the results recorded by the transducers of the lower layer fig 16a at the location of pwp3 where there is less vertical stress due to the breakwater surcharge the increasing of r u ratio is greater than pwp1 a similar pattern can also be seen for two points of liquefiable layer fig 16b therefore the presence of a structure such as composite breakwater can significantly affect the ground stress field so the patterns of pore water pressure generation at the lower sublayers may also change accordingly it can also be concluded from fig 16 that the generation of the pore water pressure at lower layer is more gradual than the upper layer in other words the r u ratio in the liquefiable layer rapidly reaches its maximum value but in the lower layer this increase continues until the end of the seismic loading this difference in behavior that is shown in fig 17 with more detail is obviously due to the fact that the lower layer has been made by clayey sand materials according to fig 17b only three cycles are enough for the point at the location of the pwp4 to reach its maximum amount of excess pore water pressure the position of the liquefiable sub layer at the ground profile also affects the generation as well as the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure since the presence of an upper layer with less permeability may restrict the drainage possibility of the water from the liquefiable layer the rate of the pore water pressure dissipation in such profiles is relatively lower than the profiles in which the liquefiable layer is directly deposited at the seabed the results of the excess pore water pressure ratio at the location of pwp6 for different positions of the liquefiable layer are compared in fig 18 as shown in this figure the rate of the r u ratio is lower for greater values of thickness ratio Î² in other words for models that contain a thick upper layer with less permeability not only the severity of the liquefaction is relatively higher but also the excess pore water pressure will be dissipated more slowly in these models the results recorded by other pore water pressure transducers are also similar and they confirm this conclusion as well in addition to the geometry and material properties of the soil layers the input motion characteristics also change the pore water pressures generated at soil layers as previously mentioned about fig 15 decreasing the input frequency of the seismic loading will significantly increase the liquefaction severity at the model the higher values of pore water pressure ratio shown in fig 19 are also due to the increase in the energy applied to the model due to the reduction of the input frequency 4 3 acceleration and amplification the accelerations recorded at different points of the ground profile during the seismic loading provide useful information about the effect of the sub layer liquefaction on the responses of the composite breakwater although it has been shown in previous sections that liquefaction induced deformations may disrupt the performance of the breakwater the evaluation of accelerations is also important because the liquefied sub layers may reduce the acceleration received by the breakwater the acceleration time histories recorded by acc2 acc3 and acc6 see fig 4 for two test models with different relative densities i e crb 10 4 0 and crb 50 4 0 are compared in fig 20 the input acceleration of these two tests is the same and was previously introduced in fig 10a as shown in fig 20a and b the accelerations recorded at the non liquefiable layer are the same in both models and there is no significant difference between these two time histories and the input bas acceleration therefore due to the characteristics of the non liquefiable lower layer as well as the proximity of the accelerometer to the model bed no considerable change has been recorded for the acceleration of this layer figs 20c and d show gradual decrease of acceleration amplitude during the seismic loading the accelerometer acc3 is located in the liquefiable layer so these amplitude reductions are due to the softening of the sandy layer as a result of liquefaction and reducing the ability of the soil to transfer the shear stress according to fig 20d since the sandy layer is more compacted and consequently the liquefaction severity in model crb 50 4 0 is less than model crb 10 4 0 the acceleration amplitudes are higher in this model test and the sandy layer has even experienced a slight amplification in the early cycles before the occurrence of liquefaction finally figs 20e and f show the acceleration received by the topmost points of the models according to these time histories the occurrence of liquefaction in the sub layers has led to a de amplification of the accelerations received by the upper caissons this de amplification is more visible in the model contains loose layer i e crb 10 4 0 the position of the liquefiable layer also affects the pattern of the acceleration de amplification the accelerations of the caissons topmost points for different values of the thickness ratio Î² are compared in fig 21 according to fig 21 the acceleration recorded in these three tests are almost the same before the occurrence of liquefaction however the acceleration amplitudes are significantly reduced due the liquefaction of the sandy sub layer in addition fig 21 shows that the highest value for de amplification ratio belongs to the model that contains the thickest non liquefiable layer at the top of the liquefiable sandy layer i e crb 30 4 10 as previously explained due to the less possibility of the drainage in the test model crb 30 4 10 its liquefiable layer has the highest increase in pore water pressure and consequently the greatest reduction in shear strength this liquefaction induced softening prevents the acceleration to transfer toward the upper layer and the breakwater the accelerations recorded within the rubble mound foundation of the composite breakwater for two different input frequencies are shown in fig 22 fig 22b shows the recorded values of acc5 plotted against the input acceleration this presentation form of the accelerations makes it possible to recognize the different response of the rubble mound foundation before and after liquefaction moreover the width to length ratio of the circumscribed rectangle drawn in figs 22b and d show the acceleration de amplification ratio after the occurrence of liquefaction as previously mentioned due the severity of the liquefaction in low input frequencies this width to length ratio is lower for the test crb 30 3 0 see fig 22d since the input motion should pass through the soil profile to reach the location of the rubble mound foundation depending on the shear wave velocity of the layers this transfer will result in a time delay between the base motion and the acceleration recorded by the transducers this time lag is somewhat detectable in figs 22a and c in the form of a phase difference between the acceleration time histories the elliptical shapes of the figs 22b and d after the occurrence of liquefaction are also due to this phase difference 5 conclusions the seismic behavior of a composite breakwater located on a liquefiable seabed were experimentally studied in this paper the possible deformations of the composite breakwaters were introduced and the effects of soil compaction liquefiable layer depth and input motion on their performance were discussed the following conclusions can be drawn from this study the deformation mechanisms in the breakwater seabed include global or local failures the settlement and lateral spreading of the liquefiable layer and finally the heaving of the seabed broadening settlement and densification of the rubble mound foundation and tilt settlement and horizontal displacement of caissons are also the dominant deformations of the breakwater body since the composite breakwaters are less capable of repair the settlements and tilts of the caissons are most critical deformations

22703,in relation to development of ship manoeuvrability standards in particular those accounting for adverse weather conditions there is a need for relatively simple but reliable prediction methods a number of popular published empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring properties of surface displacement ships have been briefly described and analysed an extension of the pershitz method to low speed manoeuvres has been implemented sixteen empiric methods and hybridizing combinations of hull and rudder sub models were tested numerically through simulation of standard manoeuvres for the kvlcc2 benchmark ship the obtained numerical results have demonstrated that very few methods or combinations give reasonably accurate results for this vessel and some simulated responses even look unacceptable the primary conclusion drawn from the study is that in general application of universal empiric methods can lead to unacceptably large prediction uncertainties and such methods must be used with great care and preferably tuned on prototype ships keywords ship manoeuvrability mathematical models empiric methods numerical simulation comparative study 1 introduction the problem of predicting manoeuvring performance of ships and other marine craft has always been of considerable theoretical and practical interest as long as manoeuvring qualities are important for the overall performance of a vessel it is important for a ship designer to be able to predict them at different stages of the design process similarly to how it has always been the case with the ship resistance and propulsion however the difference with the latter is that while the very design process is unthinkable without the ability of predicting the ship design speed and the required engine power the manoeuvring performance has been treated as secondary and typically was only verified and adjusted on the later design stages when the shape of the hull was fixed and its scaled model was available then the manoeuvring performance was in most cases tested in the free running mode directly demonstrating compliance with certain manoeuvring criteria mostly the turning ability and satisfactory degree of the directional stability however even a superficial comparison with the methods of handling the powering issues in course of the design process reveals that the common approach is multi step realized at each design phase and at each phase methods of different and increasing degree of complexity and accuracy are applied for instance at a conceptual design stage the ultimately simple admiralty coefficient formula has been very popular during many decades and still can be very useful nowadays barras 2004 on the preliminary design stage the classic approach is to rely on the methods associated with various model series which have been developed manufactured and tested during many decades and typically represent certain databases for the resistance and sometimes also for the propeller hull interaction coefficients accompanied by simple interpolation procedures to account for the form variations bertram and schneekluth 1998 within each series the hull shape is varying within restricted limits and is defined with relatively few parameters in practice it means that most of these empiric methods can only provide reliable estimates when the hull form fits some tested series well enough which explains why so many various series have been tested although some of the empiric methods like the well known holtrop method betram and schneekluth 1998 were based on several model series and are claimed to be universal if a proposed ship form has some revolutionary elements or unusual particulars the prediction error may grow considerably and become inacceptable while in the past this situation often stimulated development and testing of new series an alternative later appeared to recourse to the computational fluid dynamics cfd the cfd codes are already matured enough to provide estimates that in general can be viewed as being even more credible than the series database method it is expected that the cfd modelling can even become sufficient for the final design stage although the dedicated model tests are still considered desirable it would be natural to expect a similar hierarchy of approaches when it goes about manoeuvrability however in this case hydrodynamics is much more complicated and in the same time long term investments into the experimental studies in the field of manoeuvring of surface ships were much inferior to those allocated for resistance and propulsion to a large extent it is explained by the fact that the design process has always been much more focused on the contractual speed and propulsion characteristics which are of considerable importance for the commercial or tactical efficiency of the future ship this situation seems to be slowly changing after first sets of manoeuvring standards were introduced first by the russian register of shipping in 1979 these standards were further integrated into the rules rs 2018 and somewhat later by the international maritime organization imo 1993 2002a b in the first case an empiric method for predicting manoeuvrability was de facto embedded into the implicit standards and in the second case any approved empiric method was recognized as a legitimate way to demonstrate compliance with the standards however an increased interest in the empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring performance still has not resulted in really adequate investments into their development moreover any attempt to develop a versatile and reliable method of this kind would apparently face unsurmountable difficulties even if much more significant resources are provided the reasons for these difficulties are 1 while the overall number of scaled models tested for the purpose of estimating manoeuvring performance is considerable rarely those results were published and very few of them constituted even small systematic series the number of which is no match to that of the resistance and propulsion series 2 the situation exposed above can hardly be overcome even if the number of available specialized experimental facilities is increased considerably the reasons for this are much more complex kinematics and hydrodynamics of manoeuvring motion while in the straight run regime considered in the resistance and propulsion studies the ship speed is the only variable defining parameter when the hull form and the attitude are fixed at least 3 kinematic parameters are required to specify the manoeuvring motion in the horizontal plane which results in a tremendous increase of the number of required test runs this is true not only for the hull forces but also for the propeller hull and also for the rudder hull and rudder propeller interaction the latter two kinds of interaction are almost completely ignored in the propulsion studies but are of primary importance in manoeuvrability 3 the rudder deflection angle represents an additional parameter further increasing the complexity of the problem 4 the number of scalar dynamic responses forces and moments is also superior to that in the straight run which further complicates the resulting ship mathematical model regarding all the circumstances outlined above it is clear that it would be practically impossible to develop a reliable empiric method for predicting manoeuvring performance of ships which would be valid for a more or less wide range of hull forms and steering arrangement configurations however in spite of these evident deficiencies some empiric methods continue to be used in practice partly this is driven by certain favourable circumstances in particular the accuracy requirements in manoeuvrability are traditionally less strict than in the resistance and propulsion for instance if some manoeuvring measure is predicted with an error not exceeding 15 the result is viewed as quite satisfactory and even good while the tolerance in predicting the design speed must not exceed 5 this explains why e g the scale effect is treated and studied as a factor of major importance in resistance while in manoeuvrability it is given much less attention and mostly neglected except for the care about the shift of the propulsion point also most of empiric methods predict correctly at least qualitatively the influence of certain changes in the hull attitude and form parameters and in the effectiveness of the steering device finally sometimes obvious successes in application of empiric methods are faced for instance prediction of the manoeuvring motion of a shuttle tanker performed by sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b with the help of a modified empiric method showed a rather good agreement with the available full scale results without any special tuning the latter is especially important as in fact such tuning can be practised relatively easily is a common practice in development of ship handling simulators and can be applied in some published comparisons involving empiric methods without notice a retrospective analysis of the literature on ship mathematical models and empiric methods reveals a definite increase of interest to this topic in connection with the adoption of the imo manoeuvring standards as long as these standards declared a possibility of using recognized empiric methods during the ship design process for checking compliance with the mentioned standards of special interest are several contributions focused on general analysis and comparison of different prediction methods and approaches ogawa and kasai 1978 have formulated certain principles that must be laid in the foundation of any viable empiric method in particular the importance of the modular principle as opposed to the holistic approach was emphasized some of the formulated principles as for instance necessity to account for the scale effect still remain unrealized even after 40 years of progress barr 1993 discussed a number of general problems related to the simulation of the manoeuvring motion but he also presented results of comparison of mathematical models developed at various hydrodynamic centres for the then principle benchmark ship esso osaka the comparison was mainly performed on two levels 1 values of the parameters of regression models all of polynomial or quasi polynomial type and 2 dependencies of the hull sway force and yaw moment coefficients on the dimensionless velocities of sway and yaw the revealed scatter turned out quite significant however very few comparisons of practically more relevant kinematical output were present ishiguro et al 1996 focussed on an early version of the kijima method and its value is assessed through comparisons with results of full scale trials and by the sensitivity analysis which demonstrated relative influence of various regression parameters burnay and ankudinov 2003 analysed simulation results for 2 benchmark ships esso osaka and golden princess obtained with several mathematical models used by various hydrodynamic centres the unique feature of this publication was the idea of averaging the responses provided by various models under the assumption that inevitable biases of various method will be mutually cancelled at least partly and the averaged response will be more accurate this approach is de facto a kind of assimilation method applied to the manoeuvring simulation problem however this technique has never gained popularity partly due to its complexity but also because in the cited publication the averaged responses did not show any definite gain in the prediction accuracy independent and blind testing of various methods for manoeuvring performance prediction has been undertaken by two workshops simman2008 stern and agdrup 2009 and simman2014 quadvlieg et al 2015 simman 2018 where in particular empiric methods implemented by different institutions did not permit to work out any conclusive statements regarding all empiric methods in general or their comparative quality and practical value in particular the responses submitted by the authors sutulo and guedes soares 2018a were successful in some respects but not acceptable in others it seems that it makes sense to further continue comparisons in order to accumulate more information about performance and limitations of various methods and to acquire better understanding concerning relative importance of their elements and components it can be recognized that lately the interest directed towards empiric methods was also re animated in connection with the development of additional manoeuvring criteria in adverse conditions in particular within the framework of the project shopera papanikolaou et al 2016 as some suggested standards are based on prediction of manoeuvring qualities of ships with methods of reasonable and even reduced complexity all practical empiric methods are indeed of the modular type which means that the ship hull the steering device rudder in most cases and the propellers are handled separately and the corresponding forces and moments are summed to produce the total force and moment acting upon the ship of course the hydrodynamic interaction between the components is not completely neglected but is accounted for by means of relatively few empiric coefficients such approach makes possible hybridization i e a model for the hull forces and moments from one method can be combined with the rudder forces model from another method sometimes such hybridization can be successful but in general this must be performed with great care as some empirical methods were pre tuned in such a way that they are capable to provide reasonable prediction of the manoeuvring motion in spite of much worse estimation of the hydrodynamic loads on each of the constituting elements apparently the mathematical models for the rudders or other similar steering devices may suffer considerably from prediction uncertainties this should not be surprising as because on one hand the rudder forces are of primary importance and on the other hand the rudder is working inside a complex flow whose parameters are not well determined as they depend on the hull boundary layer and wake and on the propeller slipstream and all that in curvilinear motion the mentioned parameters are not constant but depend on the actual motion of the ship it is evident that only a detailed cfd modelling can provide more or less reliable description of the flow and prediction of the loads but obviously this does not match the philosophy of empiric methods where only simple and fast approaches are welcome hence the influence of the hull is taken into account through a certain generalization of the wake fraction model traditionally and successfully used in ship propulsion the peculiarity of its manoeuvrability oriented extension is that instead of a single and constant wake fraction coefficient also the flow straightening factors must be considered and some of the parameters may be not constant but dependent on the local sidewash in practice it is necessary to consider at least 3 4 parameters which are not well supported by estimation methods or databases influence of the propeller slipstream is accounted for either empirically or on the basis of the actuator disk theory which is used either explicitly or implicitly when that theory is used for creating some approximating structure whose coefficients are to be estimated from some model tests which are inevitably of a rather limited scale possible uncertainties associated with the explicit actuator disk model are caused by such secondary phenomena as the contraction and turbulent expansion of the slipstream variation of the axial induced velocity along the jet its deflection under influence of the sidewash and the influence of its boundaries the latter is de facto ignored in virtually all practical methods which are based on the so called load separation method presuming that the forces on the parts of the rudder blade working inside and outside the slipstream are handled separately as if the corresponding parts worked in unbounded streams with different velocities in the present study a review of several empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring performance of surface displacement ships is presented and these methods are applied to a popular modern benchmark ship design kvlcc2 the methods are described with varying degree of elaboration as most of them were more than once described in available english language literature in those cases the authors preferred to focus on conceptual issues rather than on specific approximations an exception is made for two methods developed in russia at the krylov ship research institute and associated with the names of robert pershitz and alexander tumashik the first method since many years ago its first version appeared in 50s has been known as the pershitz method and was developed for predicting the turning ability first of all of naval combatants but later was extended to cover a wider range of ship types and configurations the second method called here the pershitz tumashik method is an extension of the former permitting to model arbitrary manoeuvres including hard low speed ones the extension was not trivial and required a number of additional sets of model tests although the method is not familiar to the majority of specialists it served as basis for the tunable core mathematical model for at least 2 commercial bridge simulators the authors implemented the both mentioned methods using their last official description in the reference book voytkunsky 1985 but some uncertainties were resolved with the books pershitz 1983 and vassilyev 1989 the description of the both methods given in the present article besides partial replacement of nomenclature is believed to be freed of several discovered printing errors in general the possibility of presence of errors and ambiguities in published descriptions is one of major problems when this or that method is implemented from its published description as mentioned in the discussion to barr 1993 presentation of results of simulation of standard manoeuvres by a number of empiric methods and their combinations is concluded by a brief discussion of observed uncertainties and their possible causes a preliminary study of similar nature where the pershitz model was tested has already been carried out by sutulo and guedes soares 2018b but some implementation flaws were discovered later and fewer methods were there compared on the other hand some historic details related to the development and evolution of the pershitz method discussed in the cited publication will be omitted here 2 ship mathematical model 2 1 general remarks and equations of motion all ship mathematical models for simulating manoeuvring motion of a surface displacement ship must include equations of the surge sway and yaw motions and the minimum consistent number of degrees of freedom is 3 however if a ship is characterized by low transverse hydrostatic stability and or it is relatively fast the fourth degree of freedom in roll is added for instance the equation of dynamic roll constitutes part of the well known inoue model inoue et al 1981a b and one of the latest investigations of the effect of coupling with the dynamic roll was undertaken by fukui et al 2015 the trim and to a lesser extent sinkage are also changing in manoeuvring but these changes are mainly caused by speed changes in course of manoeuvring which is happening rather slowly and there is no need to consider dynamic equations of pitch and heave in fact a parametric account for the dynamic trim is quite sufficient and is so implemented in the pershitz model finally 6dof models are only necessary when manoeuvring simulation in sea waves is considered as every 4dof manoeuvring model reduces to its 3dof version when the roll angle is fixed at zero value all models can be treated as 3dof and so will be assumed in the present study to facilitate comparisons two standard frames of reference are sufficient for the description of the 3dof manoeuvring motion the right handed earth fixed cartesian frame o Î¾ Î· Î¶ with the origin on the undisturbed free surface and the Î¶ axis directed vertically downwards and the body axes c x y z coinciding with the earth axes at the initial time moment t 0 the origin c lies in the centerplane of the ship most often also in the midship plane and if the body frame is not central the position of the centre of mass of the ship is characterized by its abscissa x g the standard and absolutely accurate in 3dof kinematical equations are 1 Î¾ c u cos Ï v sin Ï Î· c u sin Ï v cos Ï Ï r where Î¾ c t and Î· c t are the instantaneous advance and transfer of the point c Ï t is the heading angle u t v t are the velocities of surge and sway and r t is the angular velocity of yaw the most convenient form of dynamic equations valid for all empiric methods is 2 m Î¼ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 x h x p x r m Î¼ 22 v m x g Î¼ 26 r m u r y h y r m x g Î¼ 26 v i z z Î¼ 66 r m x g u r n h n r where m is the mass of the ship Î¼ i j are the added mass coefficients i z z is the moment of inertia in yaw x y n are the forces and moment of surge sway and yaw respectively and the subscripts h p and r stand for the hull propeller and rudder respectively the equation 2 are in fact used by all empiric methods although they can be written in different forms sutulo and guedes soares 2011 alternative forms are either equivalent to 2 or are not quite correct in some methods central body axes are assumed and in that case x g 0 but typically the position of the centre of mass is accounted for albeit in a different way at the right hand side of the equations the exception is the pershitz method where the influence of the position of the centre of mass is completely ignored except for its influence on the dynamic trim at high froude numbers 2 2 hull forces the hull hydrodynamic forces are represented as 3 x h x v r Ï 2 v 2 l t y h y v r Ï 2 v 2 l t n h n v r Ï 2 v 2 l 2 t or as 4 x h x Î² r Ï 2 v g 2 l t y h y Î² r Ï 2 v g 2 l t n h n Î² r Ï 2 v g 2 l 2 t where x n are the force moment coefficients Ï is the water density v u 2 v 2 is the ship speed l is the ship s length t its draught v v v r r l v are the dimensionless velocities of sway and yaw Î² Ï Ï is the drift angle defined in such a way that v sin Î² v g v 2 l 2 r 2 r r 1 r 2 most empiric methods apply the formulae 3 which are only valid for moderate manoeuvres but the methods applicable for arbitrary manoeuvres use the generalized formulae 4 specifics of any particular method is conditioned by the definition of the non dimensional functions at the right hand sides of equations 3 and 4 there is some difference in representation of the surge force coefficient and of the sway force and yaw moment coefficients for instance in the inoue inoue et al 1981a and kijima kijima and nakiri 2003 methods 5 x x 0 u x v r v r where 6 x 0 2 r t u Ï v 2 l t x v r 2 c m Î¼ 22 Ï l 2 t and where r t v is the drag curve of the ship and c m is the so called viscous correction coefficient originally it was recommended to assume c m 0 5 0 75 but the formula c m 1 5 1 66 c b with c b being the hull block coefficient was recommended in ishiguro et al 1996 in the pershitz model it is assumed c m 1 sway force and yaw moment coefficients in moderate manoeuvring are described by the following quasi polynomial regression models 7 y h y v v y r r y v v v v y v r v r y r r r r n h n v v n r r n r r r r n v v r v 2 r n v r r v r 2 in the inoue model 8 y h y v v y

pershitz model each of the regression models above can be represented in the alternative form where v is substituted by Î² as the absolute value of the drift angle in moderate manoeuvres is limited by 30 practically no corrections of the coefficients are required the coefficients y v n v r r which are often traditionally called hydrodynamic derivatives depend on various geometric parameters of the ship hull and are typically defined by rather simple formulae or by plots in the latter case it is always possible to build a suitable analytic approximation as was repeated more than once by various researchers with respect to all nonlinear coefficients of the inoue method the approximations for some coefficients of the inoue method developed by the authors and used in this study are given in appendix a all the remaining necessary information for estimation of the coefficients in 7 and 8 can be found in the publications inoue et al 1981b matsunaga 1993 kijima and nakiri 2003 and kijima 2003 unfortunately in the latter paper used by the authors in sutulo and guedes soares 2018a b one of the coefficients was erroneously printed with the misplaced decimal point the problem of such kind of misprints is rather common and a cross check must be performed whenever possible in all japanese methods the hydrodynamic derivatives depend on the following main non dimensional hull form parameters the aspect ratio of the doubled hull k h 2 t l the hull block coefficient c b and the ratios b l and t b in kijima s method kijima and nakiri 2003 two additional parameters were introduced the aft prismatic coefficient c p a and the aft waterplane area coefficient c w a both parameters are defined similarly to the standard prismatic coefficient c p and the waterplane area coefficient c w but are based on the aft quarter of the hull the coefficients in the pershitz model can be represented in the following form 10 y v c 1 c l y v v c 2 c l n v 2 m 1 m 2 c l n r 0 739 8 7 t l 1 611 c l 2 2 873 c l 1 33 c l where c 1 c 2 m 1 m 2 c l are the parameters defined in appendix b in particular c l is the effective centerplane area coefficient which enters as a factor into all the formulae 10 because the effective centerplane area is used as the reference area in the pershitz method instead of the more common l t it is evident that the degree of complexity of the three sets of approximating formulae is different and the pershitz model looks oversimplified however this simple structure is sufficient to capture all qualitative specifics of manoeuvring models at the same time at present there is no sufficient evidence of whether this of that degree of complexity of a polynomial or quasi polynomial model is necessary and sufficient for adequate description of the hull forces the 4 quadrant generalized coefficients used in the pershitz tumashik model are defined as follows 11 x 0 075 c l sin Ï arcsin x 0 0 075 1 Î² Î² x 1 r 2 y c l 1 2 c 1 sin 2 Î² cos Î² c 2 sin

cos 2 Ï 4 0 Î² cos Î² 0 1 sin Î² sin Ï r 1 r 2 where Î² x x Î² x 0 n r r 0 059 c 2 and the remaining coefficients are given in appendix another 4 quadrant trigonometric model for hull forces had been developed by the authors as an extension of the inoue model that model is asymptotically close to the original inoue model and is described in detail in sutulo 1994 and sutulo and guedes soares 2005 in the following exposure this model is designated as inoue extended or inoueex 2 3 rudder forces the rudder surge and sway forces can be expressed either through the rudder lift and drag crane et al 1989 or through the rudder normal force n and its tangential force the latter approach is preferred in most empiric methods as the tangential force can always be neglected then 12 x r n 1 a h x sin Î´ r y r n 1 a h y cos Î´ r n r y r x r h where a h x y are the hull influence coefficients Î´ r is the rudder deflection angle positive to the starboard and the rudder normal force x r h x r a h y x h is the effective rudder abscissa which can be not identical to its geometric abscissa x r and x h x h l is the abscissa of the rudder induced sway force on the hull 13 n c n Î± Ï v r 2 2 a r sin Î± r where c n Î± is the effective normal force coefficient gradient v r is the effective rudder velocity with respect to water a r is the rudder lateral area Î± r Î´ r Î² r is the rudder attack angle where Î² r is the sidewash angle at the rudder the normal force gradient in 13 can be and normally is assumed to be identical to the lift gradient which is typically estimated with the prandtl formula obtained in the lifting line theory or some equivalent one the thus defined c n Î± is not the true gradient but gives a reasonable approximation which is commented in more detail by sutulo and guedes soares 2011 the sine function in 13 is often replaced by its argument making the equation fully linear the variables v r and Î² r depend on the ship kinematical parameters u v r but also on the influence of the hull and of the propeller slipstream in all practical methods the hull influence is described by a small number of constant empiric parameters like the wake fraction and straightening coefficients while the influence of the propeller is typically based on the actuator disk theory with some empiric corrections which vary from one specific method to another in the original inoue model inoue et al 1981a b hirano 1980 used in many methods 14 a h x 0 a h y 0 635 c b 0 153 Î² r Îº Î² Î² Îº r x r r Îº r 2 Îº Î² Îº Î² Îº h Îº p Îº h min 1 2 0 45 Î² 2 x r r Îº p 1 3 5 d p h r 2 1 4

propeller advance ratio see below and j 0 is the zero thrust advance ratio it must be noted that in the slip ratio definition often the propeller pitch ratio is used instead of j 0 which however is not desirable as can result in too small values of the slip ratio d p is the propeller diameter and h r is the rudder height the effective rudder velocity in the same method is defined by the formula 15 v r v 1 w r 1 1 0 065 sign Î´ r d p h r k p r s 2 s 2 k p r 1 s 2 1 2 where 16 k p r 3 1 w p 5 1 w r and where w p w r are the propeller and rudder wake fraction respectively both of them depend on the geometric propeller sidewash angle Î² p Î² x p r as 17 w p r w p 0 r 0 exp 4 Î² p 2 where the wake fraction in the straight run for the propeller w p 0 is estimated using methods developed in the ship propulsion while the corresponding parameter for the rudder is approximately defined as w r 0 0 4 this recommendation used in the present study looks rather rough and in earlier publications it was recommended to assume w r 0 0 25 while ishiguro et al 1996 suggest also the approximations 18 1 w r 0 1 w p 0 156 2 c b b l 41 6 c b b l 1 76 and 19 w r 0 0 35 1 w p 0 0 78 1 w p 0 0 6525 the same authors recommend to use instead of a h x 0 the approximation 20 a h x 0 28 c b 0 45 the following approximations were obtained by the authors using plots from ishiguro et al 1996 21 a h y 2 909 c b 1

the approximations 18 21 and 23 were declared as standard making part of an early version of the kijima method the approximations 19 22 24 and 25 based on the data published by yoshimura kose and yumoto in japanese were proposed by ishiguro et al 1996 as an attempt to improve the kijima method they all are supposed to be applicable for c b 0 5 0 85 a somewhat different model for the rudder inflow was suggested by ogawa et al 1980 in that model the hull and propeller corrections apply not to the total speed of the ship but to the velocity of surge which results in the formula 26 u r u 1 w r s 1 1 2 s 1 k p r d p h r s 2 1 k p r d p h r 2 k p r the total rudder velocity is then restored using the obvious formula 27 v r u r cos Î² r although the formulae 15 and 26 look rather different in many cases the simulation results obtained with the original inoue and ogawa models are very close at least for constant rotation frequency of the propeller however the ogawa model is preferable when the rotation frequency drops following the diesel engine limiting characteristic in this case the effect of the ship speed reduction can be overestimated by the inoue rudder model causing fast increase of the propeller torque which even sometimes may result in the modelled engine s failure the rudder in the slipstream model proposed by sÃ¶ding 1982 is based directly on the actuator disk theory and the main parameter defining the action of the propeller is the loading coefficient c t a 8 t Ï Ï u 2 1 w p 2 d p 2 this model was used in this study in an advanced form suitable for any combination of the propeller rotation and for a ship advancing or backing the model is described in detail in sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b and the original description of the sÃ¶ding model can also be found in sÃ¶ding 1982 and brix 1993 the pershitz model for the rudder forces is much more schematic and looks much less consistent than all models outlined above it makes sense to give its description in a comparative style 1 instead of using 12 the action of the rudder is described directly in terms of the rudder surge and sway forces and yaw moment 28 x r c x r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r e y r c y r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r e n r x r y r where c x r c y r are the rudder surge and sway force coefficients a r e is the effective rudder area it is clear that the forward displacement of the sway force due to rudder induction on the hull is here ignored it is also clear that instead of the local rudder speed v r the speed of the ship v is applied 2 the rudder surge and sway forces are implicitly assumed to be identical to the rudder drag and lift respectively and the latter is defined as 29 c y r k c y r 0 Î± Î± r where k 1 0 for all movable spade rudders and k 0 9 for a steering nozzle the base lift gradient c y r 0 Î± is estimated using the prandtl formula taken in the form 30 c y r 0 Î± 2 Ï c r k r 2 k r where k r is the aspect ratio of the rudder and the correction factor c r 1 for all movable rudders and c r 7 6 k r 3 for horn rudders the pershitz method does not provide any standardized estimation of the rudder surge drag force advising use of specific experimental data so in the present study the formula recommended by crane et al 1989 was used 31 c x r Î± r 0 0065 c y r 2 0 9 Ï k r 3 the rudder attack angle Î± r is defined almost in the same way as in the inoue model by the formula 32 Î± r Î´ r Îº h Îº p Î² x r r where the slipstream straightening factor is defined as 33 Îº p a r 0 a r p 1 c t a 0 a r 0 a r p 1 c t a 0 where a r p is the part of the rudder area inside the slipstream under conditions that the rudder is not deflected and the slipstream is horizontal and a r 0 a r a r p c t a 0 is the propeller loading coefficient as defined above but corresponding to the approach straight run phase the latter condition is another factor apparently reducing the consistency of the method the hull straightening factor Îº h is assumed following the recommendations voytkunsky 1985 Îº h 0 3 when the gap between the rudder and the stern skeg does not exceed half of the rudder mean chord or in the case of twin rudders when each rudder has a nonzero transverse projection on the skeg Îº h 0 5 if the rudder s are placed at a longitudinal distance from the skeg exceeding half of the mean chord or for a rudder behind a rudder post or for a steering nozzle in the centerplane behind the skeg Îº h 0 7 for steering nozzles located at the sides while the stern skeg is small or absent Îº h 0 9 in the case of a cruiser type stern with a small or no skeg Îº h 1 0 in the case of a transom stern with no skeg or with a skeg ending at most at a 17th theoretical section this configuration is typical for most naval combatants 4 while the rudder inflow velocity is assumed the same as the ship speed a correction for the influence of the slipstream is introduced through the effective rudder area defined as 34 a r e a m 0 a m p 1 c t a 0 where m in the subscripts stands for the movable part of a rudder i e the horn area should be excluded of course a r e a m 0 if the rudder is working outside the slipstream in the case of a steering nozzle the effective lift gradient is estimated using the empiric formula 35 c y r 0 Î± 1 1 4 1 c t a 0 1 2 0 55 0 35 l d 1 2 c t a 0 2 k d where k d l d d d is the aspect ratio of the nozzle with l d being the nozzle s length chord and d d the minimum inner diameter of the nozzle the effective area of the nozzle is defined as 36 a r e l d d d the pershitz method presumes also a special treatment of the rudder behind the rudder post however this configuration is rather rare nowadays and the corresponding description is dropped here although it can be found in sutulo and guedes soares 2016 a different rudder model was developed as part of the pershitz tumashik method according to this model 37 x r c x r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r c t y r c y r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r c t n r y r x r where t is the actual propeller thrust c x r is the rudder drag curve defined for arbitrary attack angles the rudder lift coefficient is defined by 38 c y r c y r Î± sin Î± r at Î± r Î± s s 1 0 at Î± r Î± s s where Î± s s is the rudder stall angle and 39 c y r Î± c y r b Î± c y r b Î± c y r 0 Î± Îº p 2 Îº p where c y r b Î± is the lift gradient in bollard pull regime which can be estimated as c y r b Î± 0 82 unless more specific data are available the parameters c y r 0 Î± and Îº p are defined as before but the straightening coefficient in the definition of the attack angle is defined differently 40 Îº 1 2 1 Îº h 1 Îº h cos 2 Î² r Îº p 0 65 x r Îº p 1 Îº p where Î² r Î² x r r is the geometric rudder inflow angle x r x r l b r d p x r l is the distance from the propeller to the leading edge of the rudder and b r is the rudder chord finally the coefficient c in eq 37 is defined as 41 c min 4 a r p Ï d p 2 1 0 however analysis of the structure of the pershitz tumashik model for the rudder showed that apparently it was designed exclusively for the low speed manoeuvring and may be not uniformly valid that is why in the computations whose results are given in the next section the pershitz tumashik model for the hull forces was combined with the original pershitz rudder model 2 4 propeller model in all existing practical empiric mathematical models the sway force and the yaw moment generated by the propeller are neglected which is justified for most merchant ships unless there is a necessity to model the so called hovgaard force appearing in active stopping the propeller surge force is de facto the same as the effective thrust t e and can be represented as 42 x p t e Ï k t j n 2 d p 4 1 t p where k t is the open water thrust coefficient depending on the advance ratio j u 1 w p n d p w p is the propeller wake fraction n is the propeller rotation frequency d p is the propeller diameter and t p is the thrust deduction coefficient the equation 42 has the same form as used in ship propulsion and specifics related to the manoeuvring motion are limited to using the surge velocity u instead of the ship speed v and to the wake fraction w p being dependent on the propeller sidewash angle Î² p the representation 42 is only applicable for simulating moderate manoeuvres without covering e g the stopping manoeuvre more general 4 quadrant models and also methods for appropriate balancing the propeller and hull surge forces in straight run are discussed by sutulo and guedes soares 2011 2015a b it must be realized that no one of existing empiric methods for manoeuvrability predictions is specifying some particular approximation for the propeller open water characteristic k t j which could be considered as standard for the method in concern this may lead to additional scatter of the results obtained with different implementations of one and the same empiric method in the present study one and the same propeller model based on the well known approximations by oosterveld and van oossanen 1975 and adjusted following the procedure described in sutulo and guedes soares 2011 was used with all methods 2 5 additional elements of ship mathematical models the full ship mathematical model must also include the equation of the propeller shaft torque accompanied by some model for engine dynamics however the torque submodel is dropped in the present study as it was assumed that the propeller rotation frequency remains constant in all simulations performed another secondary submodel is that of the steering gear although it is not absolutely necessary its presence is always desirable as it is the most convenient way to account for the constraints on the rudder angle and the rudder deflection rate a rather simple but adequate model of the gear is described in sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b however in most cases application of the ideal gear is also possible provided that the maximum rudder angle and the maximum deflection rate are modelled correctly finally any model must be complemented by control programmes and laws to simulate standard manoeuvres but this part is more or less obvious and does not create any additional uncertainty as long as implemented correctly 2 6 on applicability limitations of empiric methods of course one cannot expect from any empiric method that it would be equally applicable for all types of surface ships but strangely in no one of the known publications the limitations are formulated explicitly however inspection of these publications reveals that implicit information on these limitations can be traced in particular all empiric methods contain some plots nomograms or approximations based on them where the range of input geometric parameters is defined in the natural way see appendices a and b also an indirect indication on the limits can be extracted from the publications as long as there particulars of the database ship models or of tested configurations are mentioned for instance regarding the kijima method the database limits ishiguro et al 1996 are from 0 48 to 0 84 for the block coefficient l b 4 5 7 0 and b t 2 4 6 3 the same ship in full load and ballast condition is treated as two different configurations the corresponding limits for the inoue or matsunaga methods based on the tested configurations are c b 0 5 0 825 l b 5 0 7 15 and b t 2 7 5 8 it is also clear from the publications that all mmg methods are focused on single screw merchant ships with a single rudder working in the slipstream the rudder is supposed to be all movable suspended or simplex type although a horn rudder correction which is non significant for typical horns can be introduced on the other hand the pershitz method is positioned as fully all purpose i e applicable to any monohull surface displacement ship equipped with any main control device except for azipods which still were not in use when the last version of the method was published 3 numerical results 3 1 ship data the description and body plan of the benchmarking virtual vessel kvlcc2 can be found in a number of publications sea e g quadvlieg et al 2015 yasukawa et al 2015 simman 2018 the main parameters of the ship are given in table 1 where emphasis is given on dimensionless parameters used in the tested empiric methods it is clear that no one of the geometric parameters of this vessel violates the limits which can be established for all empiric methods considered here 3 2 turning manoeuvre the turning manoeuvre with the 35 helm to starboard was simulated with the initial speed 15 5 knots corresponding to the value 0 142 of the approach froude number the same value of the approach speed was also kept for the spiral and zigzag manoeuvres the standard numerical measures of the turning manoeuvre are shown in table 2 where are also added data from 2 published sources obtained with free running model tests and cfd computations and the free running model test data frmt submitted by marin to simman 2014 see simman 2018 and recognized as quite reliable it makes sense to assume that these values lying within the intervals d t l 3 0 3 32 for the relative tactical diameter and a d l 2 5 3 4 for the relative advance are credible enough even more so that they correspond to what could be intuitively expected from a ship with the characteristics as in table 1 then it can be established that only the following combinations predict reasonably well the mentioned parameters 1 kijima ogawa 2 pershitz pershitz 3 pershitz soeding and 4 inoue soeding in the third case the advance is somewhat overpredicted and in the last case the discrepancy is somewhat larger in general mmg japanese models tend to underpredict the turning ability while the pershitz family models rather overpredict it predicted trajectories in the turning manoeuvre are presented in fig 1 with the frmt added to each plot there inspection confirms good behaviour of the kijima ogawa model while the three remaining combinations listed above exhibit a somewhat exaggerated steady turning rate the pershitz group of models tends to produce turning trajectories with self intersections as this effect does not depend substantially on the rudder model it is most likely caused by peculiarities of the hull model although there are no proves that this kind of trajectories is impossible they do not look natural and are only registered in full scale trials due to effect of wind somewhat unexpected was the effect of moving from the original inoue to the ogawa rudder model while the trajectory alteration is very small when the rudder is combined with the inoue hull model this is not the case when the kijima hull model is used so far it was not possible to obtain a definite explanation of this fact but apparently it is connected to possible violation of domains of validity of this or that submodel for no one of the models such domains are defined explicitly but there are no doubts they exist in the future this issue should be subject to a special study the time histories for the dimensionless yaw rate r t drift angle Î² t and for the current ship speed v t related to the same turning manoeuvre are given in figs 2 4 on these and some further plots the abbreviation pershtum is used instead of pershitz tumashik analysis of time histories for the yaw rate reveals that in most cases these transients do not show any overshoot the exceptions are 1 pershitz sÃ¶ding 2 pershitz pershitz and 3 pershitz tumashik sÃ¶ding the first of these three cases is also characterized by unrealistically high values of r reached in steady turn further all the models can be grouped into three rather distinct clusters 1 combinations underpredicting r which include inoue inoue ogawa kijima inoue and matsunaga inoue 2 combinations apparently overpredicting r pershitz sÃ¶ding and all combinations based on the pershitz tumashik hull model and 3 the remaining combinations which look acceptable from this viewpoint on these plots the frmt data may show some additional scatter and even some biases conditioned by the quality of primary plots from simman 2018 processed with the screen digitizer grafula time histories for the drift angle show more cases with overshoot which include all models of the pershitz group and the kijima ogawa model also an almost insignificant overshoot can be spotted on the kijima ogawa combination all models under predicting r do also under predict Î² except for the combination kijima ogawa the drift angle is definitely overpredicted by all combinations including the pershitz tumashik hull model and by the combination pershitz sÃ¶ding the speed reduction curves fig 4 look somewhat less informative with 5 of them i e 1 pershitz pershitz 2 pershitz tumashik pershitz 3 pershitz sÃ¶ding 4 pershitz tumashik sÃ¶ding and 5 pershitz tumashik pershitz tumashik showing overshoots and the last 3 of the listed combinations also apparently predict speed drops which look too excessive for constant propeller rotation frequency 3 3 spiral manoeuvre the dieudonnÃ© spiral manoeuvre was simulated for the same model combinations and all results are assembled in fig 5 it is clearly seen that the combinations kijima ogawa pershitz tumashik pershitz and pershitz tumashik sÃ¶ding show extremely wide hysteresis loops corresponding to highly unstable and even practically uncontrollable ships these cases are excluded from further analysis of the remaining mmg models fig 6 those based on the kijima hull model are directionally unstable with a degree of instability which is definitely too high inoue and matsunaga based models are directionally stable and the combinations inoue sÃ¶ding and inoue extended sÃ¶ding also show decent level of turning ability at large helms see fig 7 the spirals based on the pershitz hull model all correspond to an unstable ship but only the combination pershitz pershitz can be viewed as acceptable albeit with insufficient turning ability 3 4 zigzag manoeuvres the standard 10 10 and 20 20 zigzag manoeuvres were modelled the typical numerical measures of these zigzags are the first overshoot i e the absolute value of the exceedance of the first maximum yaw angle deviation from the second zigzag parameter and the second overshoot defined similarly the values of the overshoots obtained as results of simulations and independent values from the literature are all assembled in table 3 the comparative analysis for the 10 10 zigzag indicates that only the kijima hull model based combinations and most of the pershitz family resulted in unrealistically high overshoots at the same time the original pershitz pershitz combination only relatively slightly underpredicts the first overshoot and the second overshoot can be even treated as quite acceptable however inspection of the plotted heading angle histories in figs 8 11 shows also a somewhat delayed reaction of the pershitz family models very peculiar is the behaviour of the pershitz tumashik pershitz tumashik model in the 10 10 zigzag a quite normal value of the first overshoot is combined with a pathologically large value of the second one in the 20 20 zigzag however the same model on the contrary combines an anomalously large first overshoot with a more or less normal second one although all the following overshoots are too large all empiric model combinations overpredict the zizag periods and in some cases to a very large degree 3 5 hull force coefficients plots of the hull force coefficients computed according to various empiric models are presented in figs 12 14 where the graphs for the sway force and yaw moment coefficients are augmented with tank experimental data obtained in oblique towing and estimated from oscillatory pmm tests sung et al 2018 these data correspond to the values of r varying from 0 5 to 0 5 for Î² 3 with the step 0 1 this range reduces to 0 0 5 sign Î² for Î² 6 9 qualitatively all responses for the surge force are very similar but except for the pair inoue matsunaga are rather different quantitatively in particular they are much smaller by the absolute value for the kijima model in all models the linear dependence on the rate of yaw and drift angle is accounted for through the reduced sway sway added mass and the reduction coefficient recommended by the kijima model is much smaller than the average value 0 625 used here for the inoue model the plots for the sway force coefficient show a somewhat greater variety in behaviour the matsunaga model is the only one where the sign of the influence of yaw does not change while for the inoue and kijima models it may change for the unnatural drift angles i e for those which do not correspond to the direction of turn it can be suspected and is confirmed by the data from sung et al 2018 that these combinations were given less attention in planning and execution of the underlying tests as long as such regimes though not impossible are much less likely in normal manoeuvring the plots for both persitz models are in compliance with their structure neglecting any dependence on the rate of yaw considering the plots for the yaw moment coefficient it is easy to notice that extension of the inoue model lead to amplification of the yaw damping role while similar effect for the sway force was opposite it can be said that the extension procedure is closing the inoue model to the kijima one at least for the considered range of the kinematic parameters the classic pershitz model is characterized by full structural linearity while the responses of its extended version looks quite unusual which apparently confirms our suspicion that this model had been developed for simulating hard low speed manoeuvres and its uniform validity is not guaranteed finally in table 4 presented are values of the regression coefficients for the main models explored the inoue extended and pershitz tumashik have rather different trigonometric structures and it was not found reasonable to present all those specific coefficients however the values of the linear derivatives in these two methods are the same as in the inoue and tumashik methods respectively which is caused by asymptotic equivalence of each pair comparison of nonlinear derivatives makes in general little sense for non orthogonal regressions of different structure but values of the linear derivatives may give some insight although they are also dependent on the remaining parts of the models the differences for the mmg group of models are moderate except for y r which is especially difficult to estimate in physical modelling at the same time the coefficient n v shows relatively small variations for all models 3 6 rudder forces responses of the rudder in all empiric models depend on a considerable number of parameters and it was not possible to perform their exhaustive investigation within the framework of the present contribution so the rudder surge and sway forces were computed and plotted for two cases 1 straight run at the approach speed and the corresponding propeller rotation frequency and 2 motion with the drift angle 20 r 0 5 and at 70 of the approach speed the plots for the surge force are presented in fig 15 the inoue ogawa and soeding models show zero surge force for the undeflected rudder as their responses are based entirely on the rudder normal force this is not the case for the both pershitz models accounting for the profile resistance of the rudder but apparently the tumashik model underpredicts the absolute value of surge force the inoue and ogawa models give very close results in straight run but diverge more in turn where they also show a positive surge force within some range of the deflection angle where the rudder attack angle becomes negative this does not happen with other models presuming stronger straightening effects from the hull and slipstream regarding the sway force all models excluding the pershitz tumashik model show rather close responses in straight run but the differences increase significantly in a more general case of curvilinear motion 3 7 discussion of observed uncertainties inspection of the whole set of obtained numerical results presented in the previous subsections confirms the well known fact that reliable prediction of responses and standard manoeuvring measures with existing un tuned empirical methods may present a prohibitively difficult task at least for full bodied vessels let alone using such methods for construction of fully adequate manoeuvring mathematical models the latter remark is essential as even when some two different ship mathematical models produce within reasonable tolerance identical estimates of such manoeuvring measures as the tactical diameter and advance in a turn at 35 helm and all zigzag overshoots this still does not imply closeness of responses to arbitrary control programmes and under action of exogenous factors e g in wind although the mentioned set of numerical measures has a long history and is generally recognized as consistent for defining manoeuvring performance there is no proof either analytical or numerical that this or even some more extended set is sufficient for defining unambiguously and fully the mathematical model of some particular ship often however empiric methods do not pretend to form adequate mathematical models but are only aiming at prediction of the manoeuvring parameters required by imo standards imo 2002a b although even this task may be problematic discussing the observed uncertainties the following comments can be formulated 1 in this particular study the frmt or cmt pmm data can be treated as true ones although they are also prone to some uncertainties primarily of random nature these uncertainties however are reasonably small when the data are obtained on high quality facilities in reputed hydrodynamic centres all existing empiric methods are based on some previously conducted serial model tests and as long as the underlying experimental data are not free from random errors the empiric methods could have been designed in a more flexible way embedding uncertainty estimates and intervals for the hull regression coefficients hull rudder interaction coefficients among others however this either was never realized or is not documented in published descriptions of the methods the only known exception is definition of the parameter c m in 6 for which in inoue et al 1981a it was proposed to select any value between 0 5 and 0 75 however comparative simulations performed by the authors had shown that the ship responses are weakly sensitive with respect to this coefficient and the mean value c m 0 625 was used ever since however variations of values of many other coefficients may influence the responses of the models much stronger these variations can be approximately estimated using the plots given in inoue et al 1981b bulian et al 2006 used this graphical scatter to demonstrate by means of statistical modelling that the scatter of the turning and zigzag measures mentioned above can be quite considerable and even very large when each of the coefficient varies inside the interval 10 of the base value in particular this means that through appropriate adjustment an empiric method can be tuned to produce a desired output however in reality all empiric methods were positioned as deterministic by their developers and their responses are supposed to be free of random errors for any defined hull shape and rudder arrangement so any disagreement with the true responses should be interpreted as a method bias systematic error this makes any statistical analysis of the responses very limited as unlike random errors the biases are hardly gauss distributed especially when the number of various methods is small however such statistics as the mean and median value and the mean square error can be found anyway 2 analysis of data on the relative tactical diameter from table 2 obtained with empiric methods first confirmed that distribution of residuals is close to uniform within the observed range from 1 764 to 5 11 the average value is 3 6 and the approximate median value is 3 75 both values being somewhat distant from the frmt value 3 32 the mean square error mse was obtained to be equal to 1 223 which is comparable to maximum deviations from the average value equal to 1 51 and 1 84 of course it is impossible to establish a confidence interval using the standard procedure based on the student distribution which can only be applied if the true data distribution is gaussian at least approximately 3 it seemed however reasonable to exclude from the analysis artificial model combinations and extended versions not envisaged by the developers of the methods this leaves with only 6 legitimate combinations all mmg mmg and pershitz pershitz in this case the average relative tactical diameter is 4 44 and the median is 4 95 the both numbers are even farther away from the true value although the estimated mse error was reduced to 0 923 4 data for the relative advance and for the first overshoot showed similar properties so it can be concluded that averaging over various methods may improve the required estimate only occasionally while this conclusion is in no way unexpected it also indicates that the assimilation approach suggested by burnay and ankudinov 2003 is in no way a panacea 5 although some methods can provide good estimates for some parameters one is able to estimate well all of them for instance the tactical diameter is estimated with error 1 6 by the kijima ogawa method 2 7 by the pershitz pershitz method and 0 8 by the pershitz inoue combination however the errors in estimating the advance for the same methods are 13 2 17 6 and 40 7 respectively where the last error is absolutely unacceptable however the first combination as already commented produces an absolutely inacceptable spiral curve and is not able to simulate the 10 10 zigzag further the pershitz method underpredicts the first overshoot in 10 10 zigzag by 38 and the first overshoot in 20 20 zigzag by 22 this makes this method also unreliable in predicting standard manoeuvring measures let alone doubtful shapes of produced trajectories it makes sense to discuss in some detail possible causes of the observed poor performance of the tested empiric methods and to outline ways to their improvement 1 as long as the basic equations of motion 1 2 can be viewed as practically exact at least for low speed ships and the values of the involved added masses affect the manoeuvring motion relatively weekly all possible inaccuracies are related to the prediction of the quasi steady hull and rudder forces and moments also it goes mainly about the sway force and the yaw moment because the surge force mainly affects the speed drop this also indicates at a relatively weak influence of the propeller model as in all tested methods the propeller sway force was neglected because previous estimates showed that this force may become significant and the propellers can act as additional stabilizers only on large diameter high thrust twin screw propellers typical for naval combatants 2 observations of the plots for the hull sway force fig 13 show that in all main methods except that of pershitz the sway force is somewhat overestimated in pure drift as compared to the tank data influence of the rate of yaw is captured more or less accurately by the inoue method and slightly overestimated by the kijima method however as was mentioned earlier this dependence is of minor importance and even its complete neglection by the pershitz method should not be fatal 3 for the hull yaw moment fig 14 the inoue method shows the best agreement with the available experimental data although it remains satisfactory for the matsunaga and kijima methods which show slight overestimation overestimation for the pershitz method is more significant at small drift angles due to full neglection of nonlinearity in that model 4 although it was not possible to trace large divergences with the available tank data the latter are of limited range and apparently much more substantial divergences could have been observed for combinations of large drift angles and large yaw rate which are rather common for full bodied ships it is remarkable that the disagreement between various empiric methods is larger in those domains regarding large differences observed for kinematic parameters in simulations performed with the same rudder model but different hull models it can be concluded that even moderate inaccuracies in prediction of the hull sway force and yaw moment can ruin final kinematical predictions at least for unstable or marginally stable ships for which the balance of various force components is rather vulnerable 5 one of the main reasons for possible errors in prediction of the hull forces by empiric methods is beyond any doubts insufficient set of form parameters in particular when the inoue method was published many experts were surprised by absence of accounting for the specifics of the shape of the afterbody while it was already known that those specifics may affect seriously the hull forces and the earliest versions of the pershitz method were using the i parameter described in appendix b finally this deficiency was overcome in the kijima method where two afterbody shape parameters were introduced see c p a and c w a in table 1 unlike the i parameter these two as the whole kijima method were aimed primarily at full bodied vessels regarding this a somewhat poorer performance of the kijima method for the kvlcc2 ship form discussed above is surprising although it is maybe caused by a limited range of comparison it is likely however that much more afterbody form parameters than 1 or 2 are required to satisfactorily predict sway forces and yaw moments as these depend strongly on many local effects which include flow separation and formation of free vortices in curvilinear motion number of physical scaled models and tests required for working out those parameters and describing their influence may become prohibitively large and it may happen that future empiric methods will be rather based on systematic cfd computations 6 an additional source of uncertainties related to the prediction of hull forces with empiric methods which is typically overlooked is related to methods used for establishing regression models finally constituting part of this or that method details of these methods are typically not published but it can be understood e g from inoue et al 1981b that the regression analysis is performed in two stages first the manoeuvring derivatives are estimated for each of the tested hull forms and second each of those derivatives is approximated with some regression over the selected form parameters as the primary regression models are polynomial non orthogonal and not always minimized through analysis of variances and rejection of less significant regressors they may be prone to multicollinearity and to excessive sensitivity to the values of higher order coefficients if the latter are estimated by means of secondary regressions the final response with such interpolated derivatives may deviate far away from expected and will not provide fair prediction an indication to a possibility of such unstable behaviour of a polynomial model can be found in woodward 2014 where a paradoxically high uncertainty linked with the coefficient n r r r was discovered while the nonlinearity of the response surface for the yaw moment with respect to the rate of yaw was evidently very weak of course extremely simple polynomial models like those defined by 9 are much less likely to suffer from those effects it is clear that when the primary array of captive model tests results laid in foundation of this or that method is available it is always possible to reduce the regression related uncertainty performing a regular one stage analysis using compound linear regression models for both kinematical and form parameters after this analysis is completed it will be possible to represent approximations in the same form as before but with different values of numerical coefficients 7 reliable estimates of the rudder sway force and yaw moment are also very important for successful prediction of the manoeuvring performance of the ship the plots in fig 16 are very alarming while in straight run different rudder models agree fairly well one with another this is much less so in more general situations regarding that most tests involving the rudder were performed mainly in straight run and often without the hull it can be concluded that the existing empiric or semi empiric rudder models involving a number or rather roughly defined coefficients accounting for the sidewash in curvilinear motion are another serious source of uncertainties in manoeuvring predictions it is not clear whether a really dependable and simple rudder model is possible but necessity of further extensive work in that direction is evident 4 conclusion during the last 5 6 decades a number of universal empiric methods have been published in such form that they could be coded and used by any researcher although sometimes necessary information was spread over various publications most published applied studies based on these methods were however limited in the sense that only one somehow favourite chosen or preferred method was used outputs of various empiric methods were assembled at simman workshops but there typically different methods were implemented within different computer codes by different institutions which could introduce additional uncertainties let alone possibilities for tuning the methods an attempt to evaluate inter laboratory uncertainties on the basis of simman 2008 data was undertaken by woodward 2014 whose analysis included two empiric methods but also free running model test computational fluid dynamics and captive model test data and was based on an old methodology proposed by youden 1959 one of the first attempts to compare various empiric methods implemented within the same code was undertaken in sutulo and guedes soares 2018a b where however the comparison was carried out in a very limited scale and some implementation inaccuracies were later discovered for the first time comparisons included the pershitz method very popular during many decades in russian ship hydrodynamics but so far inaccessible to most researchers in the remaining world however no full description of the method was given in the cited publication due to space limitations full description of this method in its original and extended forms is provided in the present article in the present study the multi model object oriented offline manoeuvring simulation code manist was revised and augmented with the implementation of the extended version of the pershitz method associated also with tumashik as all universal empiric methods are modular it was possible to test not only pure methods but also hybridized combinations when the hull model belongs to one method and the rudder model to another altogether 16 combinations were tested through simulation of the 35 helm turning manoeuvre the dieudonnÃ© spiral manoeuvre and the standard zigzag manoeuvres inspection of the obtained results permits to draw the following conclusions 1 most combinations fail to predict more or less accurately the main measures of the turning manoeuvre i e the tactical diameter and the transfer of all 4 cases which were evaluated as successful in this respect only one was pure the pershitz pershitz combination two combinations kijima ogawa and pershitz sÃ¶ding must be however rejected according to other criteria first of them showed an absolutely unacceptable spiral curve corresponding to an uncontrollable ship while the second one gave unacceptable values of the dimensionless yaw rate and drift angle in steady turn the second acceptable combination was a hybridized one inoue soeding additional consideration of the zigzag overshoots did not alter this conclusion 2 all combinations based on the inoue type hull model correspond to directionally stable ship models which is clearly seen from the spiral curves on the contrary all combinations based on the pershitz hull model lead to unstable simulated vessels however the degree of instability is insignificant in the case of the original pershitz pershitz combination 3 although extensions of the polynomial models to the case of arbitrary low speed manoeuvres in theory must provide results similar to their base models the deviations may become substantial this is true for both the transition from the pershitz to pershitz tumashik and from the inoue to extended inoue hull models in the latter case the causes of such effects are clear the extension was performed by using trigonometric polynomials asymptotically equivalent to the original algebraic ones but the interval of asymptotic equivalence turned out to be smaller than is desirable for full equivalence in the standard turning manoeuvre 4 some very unexpected phenomena related to hybridization of various models were discovered in particular while two rather similar rudder models inoue and ogawa gave very close results when combined with the inoue hull model while the results turned very different even qualitatively when the same two ruder models were coupled with the kijima hull model exact causes of such differences are still not quite clear but apparently some shine will be dropped after the latest mmg variant of the rudder model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 is implemented and tested this is planned as future work but so far has not been realized because the structure of the new model is somewhat different from that of earlier versions and immediate embedding turned out impossible 5 the plotted responses of the hull forces moment coefficients provide some additional insight into the peculiarities of various models but still cannot give immediate explanation of their impact on ship dynamics likely such explanation could be obtained through introducing some artificial partial variations inspired by the presented plots into each specific manoeuvring model 6 the performed comparison of the rudder outputs according to various models showed that while most models provide relatively close estimates of the forces in straight run this is much less so when the sway and yaw are present this means that the often practised comparison and validation for the straight run only is in no way sufficient 7 it can be dangerous to assess the validity of a certain method only on the basis of the turning manoeuvre and especially when only the standard measures i e the tactical diameter and the advance are considered probably the set of manoeuvres used in this study is the reasonable minimum for comparisons of this kind in particular the spiral manoeuvre though the most time consuming is very informative and likely should be made mandatory for all comparative studies like those performed in simman workshops in general the present research has demonstrated that the existing empiric methods normally require some tuning using available results of free running model tests and of full scale trials to be useable as effective simulation tool for existing ships this however makes somewhat doubtful their application in early design stages when no independent information about the ship manoeuvring qualities is available it is even difficult to indicate some method that would be more dependable than the others at least for full bodied merchant ships although one could make some judgements analysing the results presented above and any attempts to improve this or that method by substitution of hull and rudder modules may become very risky apparently any improvements should be undertaken by the original developers of the methods who are better familiar with implicit assumptions and limitations of initial databases special attention should be probably given to all aspects of hull rudder and propeller rudder interaction at the same time empirical methods of modular type are relatively physically consistent and can serve as a good platform for developing more accurate tuned models when it goes about early design stages it could be suggested to select any modular method and to calibrate it against some existing prototype ship which is close by its characteristics to the ship under design but for which reliable and rather detailed data on manoeuvring performance are available after such calibration the method can be applied to the newly designed configuration with much higher certainty as small changes with respect to the prototype can be modelled reliably enough regarding the choice of the method to be calibrated apparently any one is suitable but the authors would avoid using the perszitz method for full bodied ships as there the used mathematical model is schematized more heavily limiting tuning options at the same time it must not be forgotten that the present study was only performed for one ship characterized by the hull shape which is not beneficial for accurate manoeuvrability predictions carrying out similar studies for other ship forms is highly desirable from this viewpoint naval combatants may be of special interest as e g the pershitz method had been primarily developed for this kind of ships and its better performance could be then expected acknowledgements this work was performed within the project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation which was partially funded by the eu 7th framework programme under contract 605221 appendix a approximations of the nonlinear derivatives of inoue method the authors of the inoue method have published data on the nonlinear manoeuvring derivatives in the form of plots where besides experimental points approximating curves were traced inoue et al 1981b the following formulae rather accurately approximate those traced curves so they cannot be treated as regressions at the same time inspection of the mentioned plots demonstrates that some particular experimental values can deviate substantially from the approximated ones the approximations are a1 y v v 6 65 c b t 1 0 0735 y v r 1 73 c b t 1 0 443 y r r 1 2 c b t 1 n r r 0 675 c b l 0 1015 at c b l 0 113 6 9 c b l 0 156 2 0 012

definition of parameters of the pershitz and pershitz tumashik models the approximations described below are rather bulky and look very different from those used in other empiric methods this is explained by the fact that all those approximations constructed by dr melkozerova are secondary i e approximating certain plots and nomograms no details about development of the latter have ever been published and all comments available in the literature are of general nature apparently it is now impossible to recover the tricks and assumptions lying behind those data the authors have verified the approximations against the original nomograms which permitted to trace and correct some misprints present in voytkunski 1985 all the constants in the present appendix were extracted directly from the used computer code which minimized probability of new misprints coefficients related to hull forces in the pershitz model the description of the forces contains many auxiliary coefficients in order to

22703,in relation to development of ship manoeuvrability standards in particular those accounting for adverse weather conditions there is a need for relatively simple but reliable prediction methods a number of popular published empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring properties of surface displacement ships have been briefly described and analysed an extension of the pershitz method to low speed manoeuvres has been implemented sixteen empiric methods and hybridizing combinations of hull and rudder sub models were tested numerically through simulation of standard manoeuvres for the kvlcc2 benchmark ship the obtained numerical results have demonstrated that very few methods or combinations give reasonably accurate results for this vessel and some simulated responses even look unacceptable the primary conclusion drawn from the study is that in general application of universal empiric methods can lead to unacceptably large prediction uncertainties and such methods must be used with great care and preferably tuned on prototype ships keywords ship manoeuvrability mathematical models empiric methods numerical simulation comparative study 1 introduction the problem of predicting manoeuvring performance of ships and other marine craft has always been of considerable theoretical and practical interest as long as manoeuvring qualities are important for the overall performance of a vessel it is important for a ship designer to be able to predict them at different stages of the design process similarly to how it has always been the case with the ship resistance and propulsion however the difference with the latter is that while the very design process is unthinkable without the ability of predicting the ship design speed and the required engine power the manoeuvring performance has been treated as secondary and typically was only verified and adjusted on the later design stages when the shape of the hull was fixed and its scaled model was available then the manoeuvring performance was in most cases tested in the free running mode directly demonstrating compliance with certain manoeuvring criteria mostly the turning ability and satisfactory degree of the directional stability however even a superficial comparison with the methods of handling the powering issues in course of the design process reveals that the common approach is multi step realized at each design phase and at each phase methods of different and increasing degree of complexity and accuracy are applied for instance at a conceptual design stage the ultimately simple admiralty coefficient formula has been very popular during many decades and still can be very useful nowadays barras 2004 on the preliminary design stage the classic approach is to rely on the methods associated with various model series which have been developed manufactured and tested during many decades and typically represent certain databases for the resistance and sometimes also for the propeller hull interaction coefficients accompanied by simple interpolation procedures to account for the form variations bertram and schneekluth 1998 within each series the hull shape is varying within restricted limits and is defined with relatively few parameters in practice it means that most of these empiric methods can only provide reliable estimates when the hull form fits some tested series well enough which explains why so many various series have been tested although some of the empiric methods like the well known holtrop method betram and schneekluth 1998 were based on several model series and are claimed to be universal if a proposed ship form has some revolutionary elements or unusual particulars the prediction error may grow considerably and become inacceptable while in the past this situation often stimulated development and testing of new series an alternative later appeared to recourse to the computational fluid dynamics cfd the cfd codes are already matured enough to provide estimates that in general can be viewed as being even more credible than the series database method it is expected that the cfd modelling can even become sufficient for the final design stage although the dedicated model tests are still considered desirable it would be natural to expect a similar hierarchy of approaches when it goes about manoeuvrability however in this case hydrodynamics is much more complicated and in the same time long term investments into the experimental studies in the field of manoeuvring of surface ships were much inferior to those allocated for resistance and propulsion to a large extent it is explained by the fact that the design process has always been much more focused on the contractual speed and propulsion characteristics which are of considerable importance for the commercial or tactical efficiency of the future ship this situation seems to be slowly changing after first sets of manoeuvring standards were introduced first by the russian register of shipping in 1979 these standards were further integrated into the rules rs 2018 and somewhat later by the international maritime organization imo 1993 2002a b in the first case an empiric method for predicting manoeuvrability was de facto embedded into the implicit standards and in the second case any approved empiric method was recognized as a legitimate way to demonstrate compliance with the standards however an increased interest in the empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring performance still has not resulted in really adequate investments into their development moreover any attempt to develop a versatile and reliable method of this kind would apparently face unsurmountable difficulties even if much more significant resources are provided the reasons for these difficulties are 1 while the overall number of scaled models tested for the purpose of estimating manoeuvring performance is considerable rarely those results were published and very few of them constituted even small systematic series the number of which is no match to that of the resistance and propulsion series 2 the situation exposed above can hardly be overcome even if the number of available specialized experimental facilities is increased considerably the reasons for this are much more complex kinematics and hydrodynamics of manoeuvring motion while in the straight run regime considered in the resistance and propulsion studies the ship speed is the only variable defining parameter when the hull form and the attitude are fixed at least 3 kinematic parameters are required to specify the manoeuvring motion in the horizontal plane which results in a tremendous increase of the number of required test runs this is true not only for the hull forces but also for the propeller hull and also for the rudder hull and rudder propeller interaction the latter two kinds of interaction are almost completely ignored in the propulsion studies but are of primary importance in manoeuvrability 3 the rudder deflection angle represents an additional parameter further increasing the complexity of the problem 4 the number of scalar dynamic responses forces and moments is also superior to that in the straight run which further complicates the resulting ship mathematical model regarding all the circumstances outlined above it is clear that it would be practically impossible to develop a reliable empiric method for predicting manoeuvring performance of ships which would be valid for a more or less wide range of hull forms and steering arrangement configurations however in spite of these evident deficiencies some empiric methods continue to be used in practice partly this is driven by certain favourable circumstances in particular the accuracy requirements in manoeuvrability are traditionally less strict than in the resistance and propulsion for instance if some manoeuvring measure is predicted with an error not exceeding 15 the result is viewed as quite satisfactory and even good while the tolerance in predicting the design speed must not exceed 5 this explains why e g the scale effect is treated and studied as a factor of major importance in resistance while in manoeuvrability it is given much less attention and mostly neglected except for the care about the shift of the propulsion point also most of empiric methods predict correctly at least qualitatively the influence of certain changes in the hull attitude and form parameters and in the effectiveness of the steering device finally sometimes obvious successes in application of empiric methods are faced for instance prediction of the manoeuvring motion of a shuttle tanker performed by sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b with the help of a modified empiric method showed a rather good agreement with the available full scale results without any special tuning the latter is especially important as in fact such tuning can be practised relatively easily is a common practice in development of ship handling simulators and can be applied in some published comparisons involving empiric methods without notice a retrospective analysis of the literature on ship mathematical models and empiric methods reveals a definite increase of interest to this topic in connection with the adoption of the imo manoeuvring standards as long as these standards declared a possibility of using recognized empiric methods during the ship design process for checking compliance with the mentioned standards of special interest are several contributions focused on general analysis and comparison of different prediction methods and approaches ogawa and kasai 1978 have formulated certain principles that must be laid in the foundation of any viable empiric method in particular the importance of the modular principle as opposed to the holistic approach was emphasized some of the formulated principles as for instance necessity to account for the scale effect still remain unrealized even after 40 years of progress barr 1993 discussed a number of general problems related to the simulation of the manoeuvring motion but he also presented results of comparison of mathematical models developed at various hydrodynamic centres for the then principle benchmark ship esso osaka the comparison was mainly performed on two levels 1 values of the parameters of regression models all of polynomial or quasi polynomial type and 2 dependencies of the hull sway force and yaw moment coefficients on the dimensionless velocities of sway and yaw the revealed scatter turned out quite significant however very few comparisons of practically more relevant kinematical output were present ishiguro et al 1996 focussed on an early version of the kijima method and its value is assessed through comparisons with results of full scale trials and by the sensitivity analysis which demonstrated relative influence of various regression parameters burnay and ankudinov 2003 analysed simulation results for 2 benchmark ships esso osaka and golden princess obtained with several mathematical models used by various hydrodynamic centres the unique feature of this publication was the idea of averaging the responses provided by various models under the assumption that inevitable biases of various method will be mutually cancelled at least partly and the averaged response will be more accurate this approach is de facto a kind of assimilation method applied to the manoeuvring simulation problem however this technique has never gained popularity partly due to its complexity but also because in the cited publication the averaged responses did not show any definite gain in the prediction accuracy independent and blind testing of various methods for manoeuvring performance prediction has been undertaken by two workshops simman2008 stern and agdrup 2009 and simman2014 quadvlieg et al 2015 simman 2018 where in particular empiric methods implemented by different institutions did not permit to work out any conclusive statements regarding all empiric methods in general or their comparative quality and practical value in particular the responses submitted by the authors sutulo and guedes soares 2018a were successful in some respects but not acceptable in others it seems that it makes sense to further continue comparisons in order to accumulate more information about performance and limitations of various methods and to acquire better understanding concerning relative importance of their elements and components it can be recognized that lately the interest directed towards empiric methods was also re animated in connection with the development of additional manoeuvring criteria in adverse conditions in particular within the framework of the project shopera papanikolaou et al 2016 as some suggested standards are based on prediction of manoeuvring qualities of ships with methods of reasonable and even reduced complexity all practical empiric methods are indeed of the modular type which means that the ship hull the steering device rudder in most cases and the propellers are handled separately and the corresponding forces and moments are summed to produce the total force and moment acting upon the ship of course the hydrodynamic interaction between the components is not completely neglected but is accounted for by means of relatively few empiric coefficients such approach makes possible hybridization i e a model for the hull forces and moments from one method can be combined with the rudder forces model from another method sometimes such hybridization can be successful but in general this must be performed with great care as some empirical methods were pre tuned in such a way that they are capable to provide reasonable prediction of the manoeuvring motion in spite of much worse estimation of the hydrodynamic loads on each of the constituting elements apparently the mathematical models for the rudders or other similar steering devices may suffer considerably from prediction uncertainties this should not be surprising as because on one hand the rudder forces are of primary importance and on the other hand the rudder is working inside a complex flow whose parameters are not well determined as they depend on the hull boundary layer and wake and on the propeller slipstream and all that in curvilinear motion the mentioned parameters are not constant but depend on the actual motion of the ship it is evident that only a detailed cfd modelling can provide more or less reliable description of the flow and prediction of the loads but obviously this does not match the philosophy of empiric methods where only simple and fast approaches are welcome hence the influence of the hull is taken into account through a certain generalization of the wake fraction model traditionally and successfully used in ship propulsion the peculiarity of its manoeuvrability oriented extension is that instead of a single and constant wake fraction coefficient also the flow straightening factors must be considered and some of the parameters may be not constant but dependent on the local sidewash in practice it is necessary to consider at least 3 4 parameters which are not well supported by estimation methods or databases influence of the propeller slipstream is accounted for either empirically or on the basis of the actuator disk theory which is used either explicitly or implicitly when that theory is used for creating some approximating structure whose coefficients are to be estimated from some model tests which are inevitably of a rather limited scale possible uncertainties associated with the explicit actuator disk model are caused by such secondary phenomena as the contraction and turbulent expansion of the slipstream variation of the axial induced velocity along the jet its deflection under influence of the sidewash and the influence of its boundaries the latter is de facto ignored in virtually all practical methods which are based on the so called load separation method presuming that the forces on the parts of the rudder blade working inside and outside the slipstream are handled separately as if the corresponding parts worked in unbounded streams with different velocities in the present study a review of several empiric methods for predicting manoeuvring performance of surface displacement ships is presented and these methods are applied to a popular modern benchmark ship design kvlcc2 the methods are described with varying degree of elaboration as most of them were more than once described in available english language literature in those cases the authors preferred to focus on conceptual issues rather than on specific approximations an exception is made for two methods developed in russia at the krylov ship research institute and associated with the names of robert pershitz and alexander tumashik the first method since many years ago its first version appeared in 50s has been known as the pershitz method and was developed for predicting the turning ability first of all of naval combatants but later was extended to cover a wider range of ship types and configurations the second method called here the pershitz tumashik method is an extension of the former permitting to model arbitrary manoeuvres including hard low speed ones the extension was not trivial and required a number of additional sets of model tests although the method is not familiar to the majority of specialists it served as basis for the tunable core mathematical model for at least 2 commercial bridge simulators the authors implemented the both mentioned methods using their last official description in the reference book voytkunsky 1985 but some uncertainties were resolved with the books pershitz 1983 and vassilyev 1989 the description of the both methods given in the present article besides partial replacement of nomenclature is believed to be freed of several discovered printing errors in general the possibility of presence of errors and ambiguities in published descriptions is one of major problems when this or that method is implemented from its published description as mentioned in the discussion to barr 1993 presentation of results of simulation of standard manoeuvres by a number of empiric methods and their combinations is concluded by a brief discussion of observed uncertainties and their possible causes a preliminary study of similar nature where the pershitz model was tested has already been carried out by sutulo and guedes soares 2018b but some implementation flaws were discovered later and fewer methods were there compared on the other hand some historic details related to the development and evolution of the pershitz method discussed in the cited publication will be omitted here 2 ship mathematical model 2 1 general remarks and equations of motion all ship mathematical models for simulating manoeuvring motion of a surface displacement ship must include equations of the surge sway and yaw motions and the minimum consistent number of degrees of freedom is 3 however if a ship is characterized by low transverse hydrostatic stability and or it is relatively fast the fourth degree of freedom in roll is added for instance the equation of dynamic roll constitutes part of the well known inoue model inoue et al 1981a b and one of the latest investigations of the effect of coupling with the dynamic roll was undertaken by fukui et al 2015 the trim and to a lesser extent sinkage are also changing in manoeuvring but these changes are mainly caused by speed changes in course of manoeuvring which is happening rather slowly and there is no need to consider dynamic equations of pitch and heave in fact a parametric account for the dynamic trim is quite sufficient and is so implemented in the pershitz model finally 6dof models are only necessary when manoeuvring simulation in sea waves is considered as every 4dof manoeuvring model reduces to its 3dof version when the roll angle is fixed at zero value all models can be treated as 3dof and so will be assumed in the present study to facilitate comparisons two standard frames of reference are sufficient for the description of the 3dof manoeuvring motion the right handed earth fixed cartesian frame o Î¾ Î· Î¶ with the origin on the undisturbed free surface and the Î¶ axis directed vertically downwards and the body axes c x y z coinciding with the earth axes at the initial time moment t 0 the origin c lies in the centerplane of the ship most often also in the midship plane and if the body frame is not central the position of the centre of mass of the ship is characterized by its abscissa x g the standard and absolutely accurate in 3dof kinematical equations are 1 Î¾ c u cos Ï v sin Ï Î· c u sin Ï v cos Ï Ï r where Î¾ c t and Î· c t are the instantaneous advance and transfer of the point c Ï t is the heading angle u t v t are the velocities of surge and sway and r t is the angular velocity of yaw the most convenient form of dynamic equations valid for all empiric methods is 2 m Î¼ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 x h x p x r m Î¼ 22 v m x g Î¼ 26 r m u r y h y r

and yaw respectively and the subscripts h p and r stand for the hull propeller and rudder respectively the equation 2 are in fact used by all empiric methods although they can be written in different forms sutulo and guedes soares 2011 alternative forms are either equivalent to 2 or are not quite correct in some methods central body axes are assumed and in that case x g 0 but typically the position of the centre of mass is accounted for albeit in a different way at the right hand side of the equations the exception is the pershitz method where the influence of the position of the centre of mass is completely ignored except for its influence on the dynamic trim at high froude numbers 2 2 hull forces the hull hydrodynamic forces are represented as 3 x h x v r Ï 2 v 2 l t y h y v r Ï

coefficient and of the sway force and yaw moment coefficients for instance in the inoue inoue et al 1981a and kijima kijima and nakiri 2003 methods 5 x x 0 u x v r v r where 6 x 0 2 r t u Ï v 2 l t x v r 2 c m Î¼ 22 Ï l 2 t and where r t v is the drag curve of the ship and c m is the so called viscous correction coefficient originally it was recommended to assume c m 0 5 0 75 but the formula c m 1 5 1 66 c b with c b being the hull block coefficient was recommended in ishiguro et al 1996 in the pershitz model it is assumed c m 1 sway force and yaw moment coefficients in moderate manoeuvring are described by the following quasi polynomial regression models 7 y h y v v y r r y v v v v y v r v r y r r r r n h n v v n r r n r r r r n v v r v 2 r n v r r v r 2 in the inoue model 8 y h y v v y

pershitz model each of the regression models above can be represented in the alternative form where v is substituted by Î² as the absolute value of the drift angle in moderate manoeuvres is limited by 30 practically no corrections of the coefficients are required the coefficients y v n v r r which are often traditionally called hydrodynamic derivatives depend on various geometric parameters of the ship hull and are typically defined by rather simple formulae or by plots in the latter case it is always possible to build a suitable analytic approximation as was repeated more than once by various researchers with respect to all nonlinear coefficients of the inoue method the approximations for some coefficients of the inoue method developed by the authors and used in this study are given in appendix a all the remaining necessary information for estimation of the coefficients in 7 and 8 can be found in the publications inoue et al 1981b matsunaga 1993 kijima and nakiri 2003 and kijima 2003 unfortunately in the latter paper used by the authors in sutulo and guedes soares 2018a b one of the coefficients was erroneously printed with the misplaced decimal point the problem of such kind of misprints is rather common and a cross check must be performed whenever possible in all japanese methods the hydrodynamic derivatives depend on the following main non dimensional hull form parameters the aspect ratio of the doubled hull k h 2 t l the hull block coefficient c b and the ratios b l and t b in kijima s method kijima and nakiri 2003 two additional parameters were introduced the aft prismatic coefficient c p a and the aft waterplane area coefficient c w a both parameters are defined similarly to the standard prismatic coefficient c p and the waterplane area coefficient c w but are based on the aft quarter of the hull the coefficients in the pershitz model can be represented in the following form 10 y v c 1 c l y v v c 2 c l n v 2 m 1 m 2 c l n r 0 739 8 7 t l 1 611 c l 2 2 873 c l 1 33 c l where c 1 c 2 m 1 m 2 c l are the parameters defined in appendix b in particular c l is the effective centerplane area coefficient which enters as a factor into all the formulae 10 because the effective centerplane area is used as the reference area in the pershitz method instead of the more common l t it is evident that the degree of complexity of the three sets of approximating formulae is different and the pershitz model looks oversimplified however this simple structure is sufficient to capture all qualitative specifics of manoeuvring models at the same time at present there is no sufficient evidence of whether this of that degree of complexity of a polynomial or quasi polynomial model is necessary and sufficient for adequate description of the hull forces the 4 quadrant generalized coefficients used in the pershitz tumashik model are defined as follows 11 x 0 075 c l sin Ï arcsin x 0 0 075 1 Î² Î² x 1 r 2 y c l 1 2 c 1 sin 2 Î² cos Î² c 2 sin

been developed by the authors as an extension of the inoue model that model is asymptotically close to the original inoue model and is described in detail in sutulo 1994 and sutulo and guedes soares 2005 in the following exposure this model is designated as inoue extended or inoueex 2 3 rudder forces the rudder surge and sway forces can be expressed either through the rudder lift and drag crane et al 1989 or through the rudder normal force n and its tangential force the latter approach is preferred in most empiric methods as the tangential force can always be neglected then 12 x r n 1 a h x sin Î´ r y r n 1 a h y cos Î´ r n r y r x r h where a h x y are the hull influence coefficients Î´ r is the rudder deflection angle positive to the starboard and the rudder normal force x r h x r a h y x h is the effective rudder abscissa which can be not identical to its geometric abscissa x r and x h x h l is the abscissa of the rudder induced sway force on the hull 13 n c n Î± Ï v r 2 2 a r sin Î± r where c n Î± is the effective normal force coefficient gradient v r is the effective rudder velocity with respect to water a r is the rudder lateral area Î± r Î´ r Î² r is the rudder attack angle where Î² r is the sidewash angle at the rudder the normal force gradient in 13 can be and normally is assumed to be identical to the lift gradient which is typically estimated with the prandtl formula obtained in the lifting line theory or some equivalent one the thus defined c n Î± is not the true gradient but gives a reasonable approximation which is commented in more detail by sutulo and guedes soares 2011 the sine function in 13 is often replaced by its argument making the equation fully linear the variables v r and Î² r depend on the ship kinematical parameters u v r but also on the influence of the hull and of the propeller slipstream in all practical methods the hull influence is described by a small number of constant empiric parameters like the wake fraction and straightening coefficients while the influence of the propeller is typically based on the actuator disk theory with some empiric corrections which vary from one specific method to another in the original inoue model inoue et al 1981a b hirano 1980 used in many methods 14 a h x 0 a h y 0 635 c b 0 153 Î² r Îº Î² Î² Îº r x r r Îº r 2 Îº Î² Îº Î² Îº h Îº p Îº h min 1 2 0 45 Î² 2 x r r Îº p 1 3 5 d p h r 2 1 4

propeller advance ratio see below and j 0 is the zero thrust advance ratio it must be noted that in the slip ratio definition often the propeller pitch ratio is used instead of j 0 which however is not desirable as can result in too small values of the slip ratio d p is the propeller diameter and h r is the rudder height the effective rudder velocity in the same method is defined by the formula 15 v r v 1 w r 1 1 0 065 sign Î´ r d p h r k p r s 2 s 2 k p r 1 s 2 1 2 where 16 k p r 3 1 w p 5 1 w r and where w p w r are the propeller and rudder wake fraction respectively both of them depend on the geometric propeller sidewash angle Î² p Î² x p r as 17 w p r w p 0 r 0 exp 4 Î² p 2 where the wake fraction in the straight run for the propeller w p 0 is estimated using methods developed in the ship propulsion while the corresponding parameter for the rudder is approximately defined as w r 0 0 4 this recommendation used in the present study looks rather rough and in earlier publications it was recommended to assume w r 0 0 25 while ishiguro et al 1996 suggest also the approximations 18 1 w r 0 1 w p 0 156 2 c b b l 41 6 c b b l 1 76 and 19 w r 0 0 35 1 w p 0 0 78 1 w p 0 0 6525 the same

the approximations 18 21 and 23 were declared as standard making part of an early version of the kijima method the approximations 19 22 24 and 25 based on the data published by yoshimura kose and yumoto in japanese were proposed by ishiguro et al 1996 as an attempt to improve the kijima method they all are supposed to be applicable for c b 0 5 0 85 a somewhat different model for the rudder inflow was suggested by ogawa et al 1980 in that model the hull and propeller corrections apply not to the total speed of the ship but to the velocity of surge which results in the formula 26 u r u 1 w r s 1 1 2 s 1 k p r d p h r s 2 1 k p r d p h r 2 k p r the total rudder velocity is then restored using the obvious formula 27 v r u r cos Î² r although the formulae 15 and 26 look rather different in many cases the simulation results obtained with the original inoue and ogawa models are very close at least for constant rotation frequency of the propeller however the ogawa model is preferable when the rotation frequency drops following the diesel engine limiting characteristic in this case the effect of the ship speed reduction can be overestimated by the inoue rudder model causing fast increase of the propeller torque which even sometimes may result in the modelled engine s failure the rudder in the slipstream model proposed by sÃ¶ding 1982 is based directly on the actuator disk theory and the main parameter defining the action of the propeller is the loading coefficient c t a 8 t Ï Ï u 2 1 w p 2 d p 2 this model was used in this study in an advanced form suitable for any combination of the propeller rotation and for a ship advancing or backing the model is described in detail in sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b and the original description of the sÃ¶ding model can also be found in sÃ¶ding 1982 and brix 1993 the pershitz model for the rudder forces is much more schematic and looks much less consistent than all models outlined above it makes sense to give its description in a comparative style 1 instead of using 12 the action of the rudder is described directly in terms of the rudder surge and sway forces and yaw moment 28 x r c x r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r e y r c y r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r e n r x r y r where c x r c y r are the rudder surge and sway force coefficients a r e is the effective rudder area it is clear that the forward displacement of the sway force due to rudder induction on the hull is here ignored it is also clear that instead of the local rudder speed v r the speed of the ship v is applied 2 the rudder surge and sway forces are implicitly assumed to be identical to the rudder drag and lift respectively and the latter is defined as 29 c y r k c y r 0 Î± Î± r where k 1 0 for all movable spade rudders and k 0 9 for a steering nozzle the base lift gradient c y r 0 Î± is estimated using the prandtl formula taken in the form 30 c y r 0 Î± 2 Ï c r k r 2 k r where k r is the aspect ratio of the rudder and the correction factor c r 1 for all movable rudders and c r 7 6 k r 3 for horn rudders the pershitz method does not provide any standardized estimation of the rudder surge drag force advising use of specific experimental data so in the present study the formula recommended by crane et al 1989 was used 31 c x r Î± r 0 0065 c y r 2 0 9 Ï k r 3 the rudder attack angle Î± r is defined almost in the same way as in the inoue model by the formula 32 Î± r Î´ r Îº h Îº p Î² x r r where the slipstream straightening factor is defined as 33 Îº p a r 0 a r p 1 c t a 0 a r 0 a r p 1 c t a 0 where a r p is the part of the rudder area inside the slipstream under conditions that the rudder is not deflected and the slipstream is horizontal and a r 0 a r a r p c t a 0 is the propeller loading coefficient as defined above but corresponding to the approach straight run phase the latter condition is another factor apparently reducing the consistency of the method the hull straightening factor Îº h is assumed following the recommendations voytkunsky 1985 Îº h 0 3 when the gap between the rudder and the stern skeg does not exceed half of the rudder mean chord or in the case of twin rudders when each rudder has a nonzero transverse projection on the skeg Îº h 0 5 if the rudder s are placed at a longitudinal distance from the skeg exceeding half of the mean chord or for a rudder behind a rudder post or for a steering nozzle in the centerplane behind the skeg Îº h 0 7 for steering nozzles located at the sides while the stern skeg is small or absent Îº h 0 9 in the case of a cruiser type stern with a small or no skeg Îº h 1 0 in the case of a transom stern with no skeg or with a skeg ending at most at a 17th theoretical section this configuration is typical for most naval combatants 4 while the rudder inflow velocity is assumed the same as the ship speed a correction for the influence of the slipstream is introduced through the effective rudder area defined as 34 a r e a m 0 a m p 1 c t a 0 where m in the subscripts stands for the movable part of a rudder i e the horn area should be excluded of course a r e a m 0 if the rudder is working outside the slipstream in the case of a steering nozzle the effective lift gradient is estimated using the empiric formula 35 c y r 0 Î± 1 1 4 1 c t a 0 1 2 0 55 0 35 l d 1 2 c t a 0 2 k d where k d l d d d is the aspect ratio of the nozzle with l d being the nozzle s length chord and d d the minimum inner diameter of the nozzle the effective area of the nozzle is defined as 36 a r e l d d d the pershitz method presumes also a special treatment of the rudder behind the rudder post however this configuration is rather rare nowadays and the corresponding description is dropped here although it can be found in sutulo and guedes soares 2016 a different rudder model was developed as part of the pershitz tumashik method according to this model 37 x r c x r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r c t y r c y r Î± r Ï v 2 2 a r c t n r y r x r where t is the actual propeller thrust c x r is the rudder drag curve defined for arbitrary attack angles the rudder lift coefficient is defined by 38 c y r c y r Î± sin Î± r at Î± r Î± s s 1 0 at Î± r Î± s s where Î± s s is the rudder stall angle and 39 c y r Î± c y r b Î± c y r b Î± c y r 0 Î± Îº p 2 Îº p where c y r b Î± is the lift gradient in bollard pull regime which can be estimated as c y r b Î± 0 82 unless more specific data are available the parameters c y r 0 Î± and Îº p are defined as before but the straightening coefficient in the definition of the attack angle is defined differently 40 Îº 1 2 1 Îº h 1 Îº h cos 2 Î² r Îº p 0 65 x r Îº p 1 Îº p where Î² r Î² x r r is the geometric rudder inflow angle x r x r l b r d p x r l is the distance from the propeller to the leading edge of the rudder and b r is the rudder chord finally the coefficient c in eq 37 is defined as 41 c min 4 a r p Ï d p 2 1 0 however analysis of the structure of the pershitz tumashik model for the rudder showed that apparently it was designed exclusively for the low speed manoeuvring and may be not uniformly valid that is why in the computations whose results are given in the next section the pershitz tumashik model for the hull forces was combined with the original pershitz rudder model 2 4 propeller model in all existing practical empiric mathematical models the sway force and the yaw moment generated by the propeller are neglected which is justified for most merchant ships unless there is a necessity to model the so called hovgaard force appearing in active stopping the propeller surge force is de facto the same as the effective thrust t e and can be represented as 42 x p t e Ï k t j n 2 d p 4 1 t p where k t is the open water thrust coefficient depending on the advance ratio j u 1 w p n d p w p is the propeller wake fraction n is the propeller rotation frequency d p is the propeller diameter and t p is the thrust deduction coefficient the equation 42 has the same form as used in ship propulsion and specifics related to the manoeuvring motion are limited to using the surge velocity u instead of the ship speed v and to the wake fraction w p being dependent on the propeller sidewash angle Î² p the representation 42 is only applicable for simulating moderate manoeuvres without covering e g the stopping manoeuvre more general 4 quadrant models and also methods for appropriate balancing the propeller and hull surge forces in straight run are discussed by sutulo and guedes soares 2011 2015a b it must be realized that no one of existing empiric methods for manoeuvrability predictions is specifying some particular approximation for the propeller open water characteristic k t j which could be considered as standard for the method in concern this may lead to additional scatter of the results obtained with different implementations of one and the same empiric method in the present study one and the same propeller model based on the well known approximations by oosterveld and van oossanen 1975 and adjusted following the procedure described in sutulo and guedes soares 2011 was used with all methods 2 5 additional elements of ship mathematical models the full ship mathematical model must also include the equation of the propeller shaft torque accompanied by some model for engine dynamics however the torque submodel is dropped in the present study as it was assumed that the propeller rotation frequency remains constant in all simulations performed another secondary submodel is that of the steering gear although it is not absolutely necessary its presence is always desirable as it is the most convenient way to account for the constraints on the rudder angle and the rudder deflection rate a rather simple but adequate model of the gear is described in sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b however in most cases application of the ideal gear is also possible provided that the maximum rudder angle and the maximum deflection rate are modelled correctly finally any model must be complemented by control programmes and laws to simulate standard manoeuvres but this part is more or less obvious and does not create any additional uncertainty as long as implemented correctly 2 6 on applicability limitations of empiric methods of course one cannot expect from any empiric method that it would be equally applicable for all types of surface ships but strangely in no one of the known publications the limitations are formulated explicitly however inspection of these publications reveals that implicit information on these limitations can be traced in particular all empiric methods contain some plots nomograms or approximations based on them where the range of input geometric parameters is defined in the natural way see appendices a and b also an indirect indication on the limits can be extracted from the publications as long as there particulars of the database ship models or of tested configurations are mentioned for instance regarding the kijima method the database limits ishiguro et al 1996 are from 0 48 to 0 84 for the block coefficient l b 4 5 7 0 and b t 2 4 6 3 the same ship in full load and ballast condition is treated as two different configurations the corresponding limits for the inoue or matsunaga methods based on the tested configurations are c b 0 5 0 825 l b 5 0 7 15 and b t 2 7 5 8 it is also clear from the publications that all mmg methods are focused on single screw merchant ships with a single rudder working in the slipstream the rudder is supposed to be all movable suspended or simplex type although a horn rudder correction which is non significant for typical horns can be introduced on the other hand the pershitz method is positioned as fully all purpose i e applicable to any monohull surface displacement ship equipped with any main control device except for azipods which still were not in use when the last version of the method was published 3 numerical results 3 1 ship data the description and body plan of the benchmarking virtual vessel kvlcc2 can be found in a number of publications sea e g quadvlieg et al 2015 yasukawa et al 2015 simman 2018 the main parameters of the ship are given in table 1 where emphasis is given on dimensionless parameters used in the tested empiric methods it is clear that no one of the geometric parameters of this vessel violates the limits which can be established for all empiric methods considered here 3 2 turning manoeuvre the turning manoeuvre with the 35 helm to starboard was simulated with the initial speed 15 5 knots corresponding to the value 0 142 of the approach froude number the same value of the approach speed was also kept for the spiral and zigzag manoeuvres the standard numerical measures of the turning manoeuvre are shown in table 2 where are also added data from 2 published sources obtained with free running model tests and cfd computations and the free running model test data frmt submitted by marin to simman 2014 see simman 2018 and recognized as quite reliable it makes sense to assume that these values lying within the intervals d t l 3 0 3 32 for the relative tactical diameter and a d l 2 5 3 4 for the relative advance are credible enough even more so that they correspond to what could be intuitively expected from a ship with the characteristics as in table 1 then it can be established that only the following combinations predict reasonably well the mentioned parameters 1 kijima ogawa 2 pershitz pershitz 3 pershitz soeding and 4 inoue soeding in the third case the advance is somewhat overpredicted and in the last case the discrepancy is somewhat larger in general mmg japanese models tend to underpredict the turning ability while the pershitz family models rather overpredict it predicted trajectories in the turning manoeuvre are presented in fig 1 with the frmt added to each plot there inspection confirms good behaviour of the kijima ogawa model while the three remaining combinations listed above exhibit a somewhat exaggerated steady turning rate the pershitz group of models tends to produce turning trajectories with self intersections as this effect does not depend substantially on the rudder model it is most likely caused by peculiarities of the hull model although there are no proves that this kind of trajectories is impossible they do not look natural and are only registered in full scale trials due to effect of wind somewhat unexpected was the effect of moving from the original inoue to the ogawa rudder model while the trajectory alteration is very small when the rudder is combined with the inoue hull model this is not the case when the kijima hull model is used so far it was not possible to obtain a definite explanation of this fact but apparently it is connected to possible violation of domains of validity of this or that submodel for no one of the models such domains are defined explicitly but there are no doubts they exist in the future this issue should be subject to a special study the time histories for the dimensionless yaw rate r t drift angle Î² t and for the current ship speed v t related to the same turning manoeuvre are given in figs 2 4 on these and some further plots the abbreviation pershtum is used instead of pershitz tumashik analysis of time histories for the yaw rate reveals that in most cases these transients do not show any overshoot the exceptions are 1 pershitz sÃ¶ding 2 pershitz pershitz and 3 pershitz tumashik sÃ¶ding the first of these three cases is also characterized by unrealistically high values of r reached in steady turn further all the models can be grouped into three rather distinct clusters 1 combinations underpredicting r which include inoue inoue ogawa kijima inoue and matsunaga inoue 2 combinations apparently overpredicting r pershitz sÃ¶ding and all combinations based on the pershitz tumashik hull model and 3 the remaining combinations which look acceptable from this viewpoint on these plots the frmt data may show some additional scatter and even some biases conditioned by the quality of primary plots from simman 2018 processed with the screen digitizer grafula time histories for the drift angle show more cases with overshoot which include all models of the pershitz group and the kijima ogawa model also an almost insignificant overshoot can be spotted on the kijima ogawa combination all models under predicting r do also under predict Î² except for the combination kijima ogawa the drift angle is definitely overpredicted by all combinations including the pershitz tumashik hull model and by the combination pershitz sÃ¶ding the speed reduction curves fig 4 look somewhat less informative with 5 of them i e 1 pershitz pershitz 2 pershitz tumashik pershitz 3 pershitz sÃ¶ding 4 pershitz tumashik sÃ¶ding and 5 pershitz tumashik pershitz tumashik showing overshoots and the last 3 of the listed combinations also apparently predict speed drops which look too excessive for constant propeller rotation frequency 3 3 spiral manoeuvre the dieudonnÃ© spiral manoeuvre was simulated for the same model combinations and all results are assembled in fig 5 it is clearly seen that the combinations kijima ogawa pershitz tumashik pershitz and pershitz tumashik sÃ¶ding show extremely wide hysteresis loops corresponding to highly unstable and even practically uncontrollable ships these cases are excluded from further analysis of the remaining mmg models fig 6 those based on the kijima hull model are directionally unstable with a degree of instability which is definitely too high inoue and matsunaga based models are directionally stable and the combinations inoue sÃ¶ding and inoue extended sÃ¶ding also show decent level of turning ability at large helms see fig 7 the spirals based on the pershitz hull model all correspond to an unstable ship but only the combination pershitz pershitz can be viewed as acceptable albeit with insufficient turning ability 3 4 zigzag manoeuvres the standard 10 10 and 20 20 zigzag manoeuvres were modelled the typical numerical measures of these zigzags are the first overshoot i e the absolute value of the exceedance of the first maximum yaw angle deviation from the second zigzag parameter and the second overshoot defined similarly the values of the overshoots obtained as results of simulations and independent values from the literature are all assembled in table 3 the comparative analysis for the 10 10 zigzag indicates that only the kijima hull model based combinations and most of the pershitz family resulted in unrealistically high overshoots at the same time the original pershitz pershitz combination only relatively slightly underpredicts the first overshoot and the second overshoot can be even treated as quite acceptable however inspection of the plotted heading angle histories in figs 8 11 shows also a somewhat delayed reaction of the pershitz family models very peculiar is the behaviour of the pershitz tumashik pershitz tumashik model in the 10 10 zigzag a quite normal value of the first overshoot is combined with a pathologically large value of the second one in the 20 20 zigzag however the same model on the contrary combines an anomalously large first overshoot with a more or less normal second one although all the following overshoots are too large all empiric model combinations overpredict the zizag periods and in some cases to a very large degree 3 5 hull force coefficients plots of the hull force coefficients computed according to various empiric models are presented in figs 12 14 where the graphs for the sway force and yaw moment coefficients are augmented with tank experimental data obtained in oblique towing and estimated from oscillatory pmm tests sung et al 2018 these data correspond to the values of r varying from 0 5 to 0 5 for Î² 3 with the step 0 1 this range reduces to 0 0 5 sign Î² for Î² 6 9 qualitatively all responses for the surge force are very similar but except for the pair inoue matsunaga are rather different quantitatively in particular they are much smaller by the absolute value for the kijima model in all models the linear dependence on the rate of yaw and drift angle is accounted for through the reduced sway sway added mass and the reduction coefficient recommended by the kijima model is much smaller than the average value 0 625 used here for the inoue model the plots for the sway force coefficient show a somewhat greater variety in behaviour the matsunaga model is the only one where the sign of the influence of yaw does not change while for the inoue and kijima models it may change for the unnatural drift angles i e for those which do not correspond to the direction of turn it can be suspected and is confirmed by the data from sung et al 2018 that these combinations were given less attention in planning and execution of the underlying tests as long as such regimes though not impossible are much less likely in normal manoeuvring the plots for both persitz models are in compliance with their structure neglecting any dependence on the rate of yaw considering the plots for the yaw moment coefficient it is easy to notice that extension of the inoue model lead to amplification of the yaw damping role while similar effect for the sway force was opposite it can be said that the extension procedure is closing the inoue model to the kijima one at least for the considered range of the kinematic parameters the classic pershitz model is characterized by full structural linearity while the responses of its extended version looks quite unusual which apparently confirms our suspicion that this model had been developed for simulating hard low speed manoeuvres and its uniform validity is not guaranteed finally in table 4 presented are values of the regression coefficients for the main models explored the inoue extended and pershitz tumashik have rather different trigonometric structures and it was not found reasonable to present all those specific coefficients however the values of the linear derivatives in these two methods are the same as in the inoue and tumashik methods respectively which is caused by asymptotic equivalence of each pair comparison of nonlinear derivatives makes in general little sense for non orthogonal regressions of different structure but values of the linear derivatives may give some insight although they are also dependent on the remaining parts of the models the differences for the mmg group of models are moderate except for y r which is especially difficult to estimate in physical modelling at the same time the coefficient n v shows relatively small variations for all models 3 6 rudder forces responses of the rudder in all empiric models depend on a considerable number of parameters and it was not possible to perform their exhaustive investigation within the framework of the present contribution so the rudder surge and sway forces were computed and plotted for two cases 1 straight run at the approach speed and the corresponding propeller rotation frequency and 2 motion with the drift angle 20 r 0 5 and at 70 of the approach speed the plots for the surge force are presented in fig 15 the inoue ogawa and soeding models show zero surge force for the undeflected rudder as their responses are based entirely on the rudder normal force this is not the case for the both pershitz models accounting for the profile resistance of the rudder but apparently the tumashik model underpredicts the absolute value of surge force the inoue and ogawa models give very close results in straight run but diverge more in turn where they also show a positive surge force within some range of the deflection angle where the rudder attack angle becomes negative this does not happen with other models presuming stronger straightening effects from the hull and slipstream regarding the sway force all models excluding the pershitz tumashik model show rather close responses in straight run but the differences increase significantly in a more general case of curvilinear motion 3 7 discussion of observed uncertainties inspection of the whole set of obtained numerical results presented in the previous subsections confirms the well known fact that reliable prediction of responses and standard manoeuvring measures with existing un tuned empirical methods may present a prohibitively difficult task at least for full bodied vessels let alone using such methods for construction of fully adequate manoeuvring mathematical models the latter remark is essential as even when some two different ship mathematical models produce within reasonable tolerance identical estimates of such manoeuvring measures as the tactical diameter and advance in a turn at 35 helm and all zigzag overshoots this still does not imply closeness of responses to arbitrary control programmes and under action of exogenous factors e g in wind although the mentioned set of numerical measures has a long history and is generally recognized as consistent for defining manoeuvring performance there is no proof either analytical or numerical that this or even some more extended set is sufficient for defining unambiguously and fully the mathematical model of some particular ship often however empiric methods do not pretend to form adequate mathematical models but are only aiming at prediction of the manoeuvring parameters required by imo standards imo 2002a b although even this task may be problematic discussing the observed uncertainties the following comments can be formulated 1 in this particular study the frmt or cmt pmm data can be treated as true ones although they are also prone to some uncertainties primarily of random nature these uncertainties however are reasonably small when the data are obtained on high quality facilities in reputed hydrodynamic centres all existing empiric methods are based on some previously conducted serial model tests and as long as the underlying experimental data are not free from random errors the empiric methods could have been designed in a more flexible way embedding uncertainty estimates and intervals for the hull regression coefficients hull rudder interaction coefficients among others however this either was never realized or is not documented in published descriptions of the methods the only known exception is definition of the parameter c m in 6 for which in inoue et al 1981a it was proposed to select any value between 0 5 and 0 75 however comparative simulations performed by the authors had shown that the ship responses are weakly sensitive with respect to this coefficient and the mean value c m 0 625 was used ever since however variations of values of many other coefficients may influence the responses of the models much stronger these variations can be approximately estimated using the plots given in inoue et al 1981b bulian et al 2006 used this graphical scatter to demonstrate by means of statistical modelling that the scatter of the turning and zigzag measures mentioned above can be quite considerable and even very large when each of the coefficient varies inside the interval 10 of the base value in particular this means that through appropriate adjustment an empiric method can be tuned to produce a desired output however in reality all empiric methods were positioned as deterministic by their developers and their responses are supposed to be free of random errors for any defined hull shape and rudder arrangement so any disagreement with the true responses should be interpreted as a method bias systematic error this makes any statistical analysis of the responses very limited as unlike random errors the biases are hardly gauss distributed especially when the number of various methods is small however such statistics as the mean and median value and the mean square error can be found anyway 2 analysis of data on the relative tactical diameter from table 2 obtained with empiric methods first confirmed that distribution of residuals is close to uniform within the observed range from 1 764 to 5 11 the average value is 3 6 and the approximate median value is 3 75 both values being somewhat distant from the frmt value 3 32 the mean square error mse was obtained to be equal to 1 223 which is comparable to maximum deviations from the average value equal to 1 51 and 1 84 of course it is impossible to establish a confidence interval using the standard procedure based on the student distribution which can only be applied if the true data distribution is gaussian at least approximately 3 it seemed however reasonable to exclude from the analysis artificial model combinations and extended versions not envisaged by the developers of the methods this leaves with only 6 legitimate combinations all mmg mmg and pershitz pershitz in this case the average relative tactical diameter is 4 44 and the median is 4 95 the both numbers are even farther away from the true value although the estimated mse error was reduced to 0 923 4 data for the relative advance and for the first overshoot showed similar properties so it can be concluded that averaging over various methods may improve the required estimate only occasionally while this conclusion is in no way unexpected it also indicates that the assimilation approach suggested by burnay and ankudinov 2003 is in no way a panacea 5 although some methods can provide good estimates for some parameters one is able to estimate well all of them for instance the tactical diameter is estimated with error 1 6 by the kijima ogawa method 2 7 by the pershitz pershitz method and 0 8 by the pershitz inoue combination however the errors in estimating the advance for the same methods are 13 2 17 6 and 40 7 respectively where the last error is absolutely unacceptable however the first combination as already commented produces an absolutely inacceptable spiral curve and is not able to simulate the 10 10 zigzag further the pershitz method underpredicts the first overshoot in 10 10 zigzag by 38 and the first overshoot in 20 20 zigzag by 22 this makes this method also unreliable in predicting standard manoeuvring measures let alone doubtful shapes of produced trajectories it makes sense to discuss in some detail possible causes of the observed poor performance of the tested empiric methods and to outline ways to their improvement 1 as long as the basic equations of motion 1 2 can be viewed as practically exact at least for low speed ships and the values of the involved added masses affect the manoeuvring motion relatively weekly all possible inaccuracies are related to the prediction of the quasi steady hull and rudder forces and moments also it goes mainly about the sway force and the yaw moment because the surge force mainly affects the speed drop this also indicates at a relatively weak influence of the propeller model as in all tested methods the propeller sway force was neglected because previous estimates showed that this force may become significant and the propellers can act as additional stabilizers only on large diameter high thrust twin screw propellers typical for naval combatants 2 observations of the plots for the hull sway force fig 13 show that in all main methods except that of pershitz the sway force is somewhat overestimated in pure drift as compared to the tank data influence of the rate of yaw is captured more or less accurately by the inoue method and slightly overestimated by the kijima method however as was mentioned earlier this dependence is of minor importance and even its complete neglection by the pershitz method should not be fatal 3 for the hull yaw moment fig 14 the inoue method shows the best agreement with the available experimental data although it remains satisfactory for the matsunaga and kijima methods which show slight overestimation overestimation for the pershitz method is more significant at small drift angles due to full neglection of nonlinearity in that model 4 although it was not possible to trace large divergences with the available tank data the latter are of limited range and apparently much more substantial divergences could have been observed for combinations of large drift angles and large yaw rate which are rather common for full bodied ships it is remarkable that the disagreement between various empiric methods is larger in those domains regarding large differences observed for kinematic parameters in simulations performed with the same rudder model but different hull models it can be concluded that even moderate inaccuracies in prediction of the hull sway force and yaw moment can ruin final kinematical predictions at least for unstable or marginally stable ships for which the balance of various force components is rather vulnerable 5 one of the main reasons for possible errors in prediction of the hull forces by empiric methods is beyond any doubts insufficient set of form parameters in particular when the inoue method was published many experts were surprised by absence of accounting for the specifics of the shape of the afterbody while it was already known that those specifics may affect seriously the hull forces and the earliest versions of the pershitz method were using the i parameter described in appendix b finally this deficiency was overcome in the kijima method where two afterbody shape parameters were introduced see c p a and c w a in table 1 unlike the i parameter these two as the whole kijima method were aimed primarily at full bodied vessels regarding this a somewhat poorer performance of the kijima method for the kvlcc2 ship form discussed above is surprising although it is maybe caused by a limited range of comparison it is likely however that much more afterbody form parameters than 1 or 2 are required to satisfactorily predict sway forces and yaw moments as these depend strongly on many local effects which include flow separation and formation of free vortices in curvilinear motion number of physical scaled models and tests required for working out those parameters and describing their influence may become prohibitively large and it may happen that future empiric methods will be rather based on systematic cfd computations 6 an additional source of uncertainties related to the prediction of hull forces with empiric methods which is typically overlooked is related to methods used for establishing regression models finally constituting part of this or that method details of these methods are typically not published but it can be understood e g from inoue et al 1981b that the regression analysis is performed in two stages first the manoeuvring derivatives are estimated for each of the tested hull forms and second each of those derivatives is approximated with some regression over the selected form parameters as the primary regression models are polynomial non orthogonal and not always minimized through analysis of variances and rejection of less significant regressors they may be prone to multicollinearity and to excessive sensitivity to the values of higher order coefficients if the latter are estimated by means of secondary regressions the final response with such interpolated derivatives may deviate far away from expected and will not provide fair prediction an indication to a possibility of such unstable behaviour of a polynomial model can be found in woodward 2014 where a paradoxically high uncertainty linked with the coefficient n r r r was discovered while the nonlinearity of the response surface for the yaw moment with respect to the rate of yaw was evidently very weak of course extremely simple polynomial models like those defined by 9 are much less likely to suffer from those effects it is clear that when the primary array of captive model tests results laid in foundation of this or that method is available it is always possible to reduce the regression related uncertainty performing a regular one stage analysis using compound linear regression models for both kinematical and form parameters after this analysis is completed it will be possible to represent approximations in the same form as before but with different values of numerical coefficients 7 reliable estimates of the rudder sway force and yaw moment are also very important for successful prediction of the manoeuvring performance of the ship the plots in fig 16 are very alarming while in straight run different rudder models agree fairly well one with another this is much less so in more general situations regarding that most tests involving the rudder were performed mainly in straight run and often without the hull it can be concluded that the existing empiric or semi empiric rudder models involving a number or rather roughly defined coefficients accounting for the sidewash in curvilinear motion are another serious source of uncertainties in manoeuvring predictions it is not clear whether a really dependable and simple rudder model is possible but necessity of further extensive work in that direction is evident 4 conclusion during the last 5 6 decades a number of universal empiric methods have been published in such form that they could be coded and used by any researcher although sometimes necessary information was spread over various publications most published applied studies based on these methods were however limited in the sense that only one somehow favourite chosen or preferred method was used outputs of various empiric methods were assembled at simman workshops but there typically different methods were implemented within different computer codes by different institutions which could introduce additional uncertainties let alone possibilities for tuning the methods an attempt to evaluate inter laboratory uncertainties on the basis of simman 2008 data was undertaken by woodward 2014 whose analysis included two empiric methods but also free running model test computational fluid dynamics and captive model test data and was based on an old methodology proposed by youden 1959 one of the first attempts to compare various empiric methods implemented within the same code was undertaken in sutulo and guedes soares 2018a b where however the comparison was carried out in a very limited scale and some implementation inaccuracies were later discovered for the first time comparisons included the pershitz method very popular during many decades in russian ship hydrodynamics but so far inaccessible to most researchers in the remaining world however no full description of the method was given in the cited publication due to space limitations full description of this method in its original and extended forms is provided in the present article in the present study the multi model object oriented offline manoeuvring simulation code manist was revised and augmented with the implementation of the extended version of the pershitz method associated also with tumashik as all universal empiric methods are modular it was possible to test not only pure methods but also hybridized combinations when the hull model belongs to one method and the rudder model to another altogether 16 combinations were tested through simulation of the 35 helm turning manoeuvre the dieudonnÃ© spiral manoeuvre and the standard zigzag manoeuvres inspection of the obtained results permits to draw the following conclusions 1 most combinations fail to predict more or less accurately the main measures of the turning manoeuvre i e the tactical diameter and the transfer of all 4 cases which were evaluated as successful in this respect only one was pure the pershitz pershitz combination two combinations kijima ogawa and pershitz sÃ¶ding must be however rejected according to other criteria first of them showed an absolutely unacceptable spiral curve corresponding to an uncontrollable ship while the second one gave unacceptable values of the dimensionless yaw rate and drift angle in steady turn the second acceptable combination was a hybridized one inoue soeding additional consideration of the zigzag overshoots did not alter this conclusion 2 all combinations based on the inoue type hull model correspond to directionally stable ship models which is clearly seen from the spiral curves on the contrary all combinations based on the pershitz hull model lead to unstable simulated vessels however the degree of instability is insignificant in the case of the original pershitz pershitz combination 3 although extensions of the polynomial models to the case of arbitrary low speed manoeuvres in theory must provide results similar to their base models the deviations may become substantial this is true for both the transition from the pershitz to pershitz tumashik and from the inoue to extended inoue hull models in the latter case the causes of such effects are clear the extension was performed by using trigonometric polynomials asymptotically equivalent to the original algebraic ones but the interval of asymptotic equivalence turned out to be smaller than is desirable for full equivalence in the standard turning manoeuvre 4 some very unexpected phenomena related to hybridization of various models were discovered in particular while two rather similar rudder models inoue and ogawa gave very close results when combined with the inoue hull model while the results turned very different even qualitatively when the same two ruder models were coupled with the kijima hull model exact causes of such differences are still not quite clear but apparently some shine will be dropped after the latest mmg variant of the rudder model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 is implemented and tested this is planned as future work but so far has not been realized because the structure of the new model is somewhat different from that of earlier versions and immediate embedding turned out impossible 5 the plotted responses of the hull forces moment coefficients provide some additional insight into the peculiarities of various models but still cannot give immediate explanation of their impact on ship dynamics likely such explanation could be obtained through introducing some artificial partial variations inspired by the presented plots into each specific manoeuvring model 6 the performed comparison of the rudder outputs according to various models showed that while most models provide relatively close estimates of the forces in straight run this is much less so when the sway and yaw are present this means that the often practised comparison and validation for the straight run only is in no way sufficient 7 it can be dangerous to assess the validity of a certain method only on the basis of the turning manoeuvre and especially when only the standard measures i e the tactical diameter and the advance are considered probably the set of manoeuvres used in this study is the reasonable minimum for comparisons of this kind in particular the spiral manoeuvre though the most time consuming is very informative and likely should be made mandatory for all comparative studies like those performed in simman workshops in general the present research has demonstrated that the existing empiric methods normally require some tuning using available results of free running model tests and of full scale trials to be useable as effective simulation tool for existing ships this however makes somewhat doubtful their application in early design stages when no independent information about the ship manoeuvring qualities is available it is even difficult to indicate some method that would be more dependable than the others at least for full bodied merchant ships although one could make some judgements analysing the results presented above and any attempts to improve this or that method by substitution of hull and rudder modules may become very risky apparently any improvements should be undertaken by the original developers of the methods who are better familiar with implicit assumptions and limitations of initial databases special attention should be probably given to all aspects of hull rudder and propeller rudder interaction at the same time empirical methods of modular type are relatively physically consistent and can serve as a good platform for developing more accurate tuned models when it goes about early design stages it could be suggested to select any modular method and to calibrate it against some existing prototype ship which is close by its characteristics to the ship under design but for which reliable and rather detailed data on manoeuvring performance are available after such calibration the method can be applied to the newly designed configuration with much higher certainty as small changes with respect to the prototype can be modelled reliably enough regarding the choice of the method to be calibrated apparently any one is suitable but the authors would avoid using the perszitz method for full bodied ships as there the used mathematical model is schematized more heavily limiting tuning options at the same time it must not be forgotten that the present study was only performed for one ship characterized by the hull shape which is not beneficial for accurate manoeuvrability predictions carrying out similar studies for other ship forms is highly desirable from this viewpoint naval combatants may be of special interest as e g the pershitz method had been primarily developed for this kind of ships and its better performance could be then expected acknowledgements this work was performed within the project shopera energy efficient safe ship operation which was partially funded by the eu 7th framework programme under contract 605221 appendix a approximations of the nonlinear derivatives of inoue method the authors of the inoue method have published data on the nonlinear manoeuvring derivatives in the form of plots where besides experimental points approximating curves were traced inoue et al 1981b the following formulae rather accurately approximate those traced curves so they cannot be treated as regressions at the same time inspection of the mentioned plots demonstrates that some particular experimental values can deviate substantially from the approximated ones the approximations are a1 y v v 6 65 c b t 1 0 0735 y v r 1 73 c b t 1 0 443 y r r 1 2 c b t 1 n r r 0 675 c b l 0 1015 at c b l 0 113 6 9 c b l 0 156 2 0 012

definition of parameters of the pershitz and pershitz tumashik models the approximations described below are rather bulky and look very different from those used in other empiric methods this is explained by the fact that all those approximations constructed by dr melkozerova are secondary i e approximating certain plots and nomograms no details about development of the latter have ever been published and all comments available in the literature are of general nature apparently it is now impossible to recover the tricks and assumptions lying behind those data the authors have verified the approximations against the original nomograms which permitted to trace and correct some misprints present in voytkunski 1985 all the constants in the present appendix were extracted directly from the used computer code which minimized probability of new misprints coefficients related to hull forces in the pershitz model the description of the forces contains many auxiliary coefficients in order to

22704,accurate prediction of ship resistance in ice covered waters is important for ice going ships in this paper the resistance of a ship moving in waters covered with small ice floes is investigated a simplified collision process is applied to model the ship ice collision process such that the ship resistance can be theoretically determined with hydrodynamic interaction taken into consideration thin ship approximation leads to simple formula predicting that ship resistance coefficient is proportional to squared ship velocity beam to length ratio ice thickness to length ratio and sea ice concentration these conclusions are in perfect agreement with experimental test results this in turn confirms the validity of the theory proposed in this paper keywords ship resistance ice floe ship ice collision added mass 1 introduction ship resistance in open water has been well studied in theory since 1898 michell 1898 starting from mitchell s integral for thin ship theoretical ship resistance has contributed a lot to the mechanism understanding of wave making resistance shape optimization of ship hull forms newman 1977 and introduction of resistance reduction devices salveson et al 1985 among them are bulbous bow salveson et al 1985 stern wedge and trimaran hull form jia et al 2010 to cite a few ship resistance in water covered with ice is much more complicated than in open water due to a variety of 1 possible geometric properties of sea ice 2 possible physical properties of sea ice 3 complicated ice fracture mechanism and 4 of possible ship ice collision scenarios therefore this is a slowly progressing field if compared with other disciplines most studies of ship resistance in ice have been focused on continuous sheet ice for their direct correlation to design of icebreakers aboulazm 1989 tsarau et al 2014 there are comparatively much less efforts on studies of ship resistance in broken ice floes tsarau et al 2014 the latter problem becomes important in recent years due to increasing numbers of ships navigating cold waters covered with ice floes they are also frequently encountered for a ship to follow icebreakers through sheet ice aboulazm 1989 study of ship resistance in broken ice in turn supports the understanding of non breaking components of continuous sheet ice resistance nogid 1959 bronnikov 1959 reported earliest model testing of ship resistance in pack ice in late 1940s and 1950s they proposed empirical formulas to predict ship resistance in broken ice based on their model tests nogid s formula predicts dependence of ship resistance on squared velocity nogid 1959 these formulas were further improved or generalized by other authors in subsequent decades among them are levin levine et al 1974 kostilainen hanhirova kostilainen and hanhirova 1971 kitazawa ettema kitazawa and ettema 1986 sawamura 2015 and uto et al 2015 a comprehensive theory to predict ship resistance in thick brash ice was proposed by mellor 1980 the theory is powerful enough to consider the interactions among thick brash ice in the theory brash ice layer is assumed to be continuous so that granular hydrodynamics is applied in the present paper however ice floes are not closely packed so that a continuum assumption is invalid therefore we need to find an alternative model to predict ship resistance in waters covered with ice floes computational technology helps a lot to clarify the fundamental mechanism of ice breaking process interesting results obtained from numerical simulations greatly increase our confidence to solve this complicated and difficult problem a challenge with the numerical methods remains that is how to include the hydrodynamic influence into these numerical models hydrodynamic influence might not be very important in predicting ship resistance in continuous sheet ice but must be influential in predicting ship resistance in broken ice tsarau et al 2014 tsarau at al tsarau et al 2014 considered in fact only the interactions of one structure and one ice piece in the presence of water therefore it remains a difficult problem to predict ship resistance considering interaction with a lot of ice floes in water in this paper we attempt to solve the problem in a highly theoretical way so that approximate yet closed form solutions may be obtained for the problem as shown in fig 1 tsarau et al 2014 meanwhile theoretical models are thus in demand to find out the fundamentally important factors so that we have a deep insight into the problem 2 mathematical description of the problem 2 1 assumptions consider the problem that a ship moves at constant speed u in waters covered with small ice floes this is equivalent to say that the ship does not move while all ice floes float towards the ship hull a ship fixed coordinate system oxyz is introduced as shown in fig 1 with z axis not shown in the figure perpendicular to the paper an ice floe is any contiguous piece of sea ice floes may roughly be subdivided into several types giant vast big medium small ice floe and small ice floe to say according to horizontal extent weeks 2010 the present paper is focused on ice floes which typical horizontal dimension l i is roughly smaller than 20 m across including small ice floes to make the present theory applicable to ice floes used in model tests we request the typical length of an ice floe and the ship length satisfy the following relation 1 Îµ l i l s 1 where l i is the typical length of an ice floe and l s is the ship length a rule of thumb is Îµ 0 1 the smaller Îµ is the more accurate the theory is ice floes are so small that they would not produce ship structural deformation so the ship structure is assumed rigid because ice floes may take a variety of shapes the problem is random in essence an ice floe collision with ship is rigid rigid collision to be detailed in the following section 2 3 moreover ice ice collision that of a pair of ice floes a and b to say changes their local flow and induces an additional flow speed field Î´ u a b this additional flied is random in direction and the sum of all such perturbed velocities Î´ u a b in the whole field is expected to be small so ice ice collisions do not have large influences on ice resistance in the average sense and are ignored here one more assumption is that ice floes float on the water surface their thickness effects are ignored so that we are dealing with a two dimensional problem on the surface of water 2 2 statistical properties of sea ice floes the densities shapes thicknesses and masses of sea ice floes are all random variables because we are dealing with an assembly of ice floes we use averaged quantities average density Ï i m average mass of ice floe average size s and h average ice thickness in the following derivations with the understanding that fluctuations of each random variable around its mean can be smeared out it should be pointed out the difficulty to use average sizes and masses of ice floes the typical size of an ice floe may vary in between a big range from centimeters to 10 km or even longer to describe the statistical properties of their sizes sea ice floe size distribution fsd of the power law form q s s s Î± is often employed where s is the scaled area of an ice floe and Î± is an empirical parameter approximately equal to 1 8 it is then easy to see that the average size may be unrealistically large this problem is avoided in the present study because only small ice floes which typical size is smaller than 20 m are considered therefore it is noted that fsd q s s is different from what we use elsewhere the mass of an ice floe is not an independent variable but can be obtained zong 2006 from the following form 2 q m m i 1 Ï i h q s m i Ï i h where Ï i is average ice density m i ice floe mass and h average ice thickness 2 3 collision of ship and ice floes suppose an ice floe of mass m collides with the ship in normal direction at speed v n if the collision is rigid without loss of energy then the normal velocity of the ice floe after collision is v n in other words the normal components of the ice floe must be opposite in direction and equal in value before and after collision for non penetrating restraint in the normal direction see fig 2 here eq 1 is implicitly used by assuming the collision is point contact between the hull and the ice floe otherwise rotations of the ice floe should be considered during the collision process in unit time there may be Î´ n ice floes colliding with the ship their total effect is the pressure and shear stress acting on the hull consider an inclining cylinder with bottom width Î´a as shown in fig 3 a its axis coincides with the direction of u and the height is v n Î´ t the area is from fig 3 b 3 Î´ v v n Î´ t Î´ a suppose ice concentration function in the passage is Ï in time interval Î´ t the area the ship travels is v n Î´ a Î´ t while the ice area is Ï x y z v n Î´ a Î´ t then the average number of the ice floes in this area is 4 Î´ n Ï s v n Î´ a Î´ t Î» v n Î´ a Î´ t Î» Ï s sea ice floes change their velocities during the ship ice collision process and thus they induce surrounding water to move if such movement is accelerating or decelerating added mass effect is introduced lamb 1995 even if an ice floe moves at constant speed added mass effect is also present as it moves towards away the ship hull for the water flow is unsteady the latter behaves as a wall and added mass is dependent on the distance between the ice floe and the ship hull lamb 1995 there exist three added masses one being Î¼ n n in the normal direction induced by the motion in the normal direction one being Î¼ n t Î¼ t n in the normal direction induced by the motion in the tangential direction or vice versa and the third being Î¼ t t in the tangential direction due to the motion in the tangential direction they are all functions of the distance to the hull then the momenta in normal and tangential directions are 5 i n m i Î¼ n n v n Î¼ n t v t i t Î¼ t n v n m i Î¼ t t v t the momentum changes in both directions are equal to impulses in each direction which turn out to be 6 Î´ i n Î´ m i Î¼ n n v n Î¼ n t v t Î´ m i Î¼ n n v n Î´ Î¼ n t v t Î´ i t Î´ Î¼ t n v n m i Î¼ t t v t Î´ Î¼ t n v n we simplify the process for possible theoretical treatment to do so we assume that the collision process is very short such that velocity changes before and after the collision are modeled as a jump therefore the normal velocity changes its sign before and after collision with all mass values unchanged that is 7 Î´ v n v n v n 2 v n Î´ v t v t v t 0 then we obtain 8 Î´ i n 2 m i Î¼ n n v n Î´ i t 2 Î¼ t n v n note that added mass values are dependent on the distance between the ice floe and the hull hydrodynamic theory predicts that the added mass in the normal direction close to a wall is about twice the value of that faraway from wall at infinity the added mass value in the previous equations is those close to the hull which may be approximated by its value at infinity in the following approximate equations irrespective of shapes landweber et al 1991 9a Î¼ n n Î¼ n n 0 2 Î¼ n n add mass in normal tangential direction induced by the motion in other direction is related to add mass at infinity in the following way lamb 1995 9b Î¼ n t Î¼ n t 0 2 29 Î¼ n n substituting them into eq 8 yields 10a Î´ i n 2 m i 2 Î¼ n n v n 10b Î´ i t 2 Î¼ n n v n 2 2 29 Î¼ n n v n 4 58 Î¼ n n v n the impulse of all ice floes acting on Î´a is Î´ i Î´ n the normal and tangential forces acting on Î´ a are therefore 11a Î´ f n Î´ i n Î´ n Î´ t 2 Î» m i 2 Î¼ n n v n Î´ a 11b Î´ f t Î´ i t Î´ n Î´ t 4 58 Î» Î¼ n n v n Î´ a the corresponding pressure and shear

therefore the pressure and shear stress acting on the hull are obtained from integrating eq 12 over all possible mass or size distribution that is 13a p 0 Î´ p q m m i d m i 2 Î» m 2 Î¼ n n v n 2 13b Ï 0 Î´ Ï q m m i d m i 4 58 Î» Î¼ n n v n 2 where m 0 m i q m m i d m i is the mean mass of ice floes and Î¼ n n 0 Î¼ n n q s s d s is the mean added mass at infinity 3 thin ship resistance we consider the simple example that a thin ship moves in pack ice flow the ship has hull form described by 14 y g x z where x is positive in the bow direction y is positive starboard and z is positive upwards the hull surface condition is a non penetrating one in the form of v n u n x the pressure and shear stress are obtained from eq 13 by letting the area tend to zero 15a p 2 Î» m i 2 Î¼ n n u 2

assumption is applied that is the order of beam derivatives with respect to x and z are all small that is 17 o g x z x g x z z 1 n x g x z x g x using the thin ship approximation we note that the boundary condition on the hull surface is v n u n x u g x then the resistance is given by 18 r 4 Î» m i 2 Î¼ n n u 2 x s x b n x 3 d x 2 4 58 Î» Î¼ n n u 2 x s x b n x 2 d x as an example we consider the wigley hull of the form 19 g x z b 2 1 x l 2 2 1 z t 2 l 2 x l 2 t z 0 where b is ship beam t is draught and l is ship length integral in eq 18 is evaluated on the surface of water it means that the vertical coordinate z in eq 19 is approximately zero the integral in eq 18 is 20 x s x b n x 3 d x l 2 l 2 g x 3 d x 0 x s x b n x 2 d x l 2 l 2 g x 2 d x 4 b 2 3 l 21 r 8 4 58 3 u 2 Ï Î¼ n n s b

integrating eq 18 note that Î¼ n n s c a Ï s h s c a Ï h where c a is added mass coefficient dependent on shapes c a 1 for a circle and c a 1 189 for a square lamb 1995 we then obtain surprisingly simple formula 22 r 8 4 58 3 u 2 Ï Ï h c a b 2 l 12 21 u 2 Ï Ï h c a b 2 l which is proportional to squared velocity and averaged added mass on the water surface it is clearly true that the resistance is proportional to the mean number of ice floes per unit time encountered implied by ice concentration function Ï the resistance coefficient is evaluated from 23 c r r 1 2 Ï u 2 b l 24 42 Ï h b l 2 it is a function of ice concentration function beam to length ratio and ice thickness to length ratio it is interesting to compare eq 22 with the widely used colbourne s empirical formula aboulazm 1989 24 r 4 4 f 0 8627 Ï i b h u 2 Ï 2 f u g h Ï besides added mass eq 22 and eq 24 contain the same parameters this increases our confidence that eq 22 does not miss any influences considered by our traditional formula more than that is that the new equation introduces water influences through added mass and reveals the relationships among all parameters in a theoretical way 4 comparison with experimental tests it is lucky that sawamura 2015 presented very good and clearly recorded model tests to measure ship resistance in ice floe covered water the ship model length is l 1 5 m width b 0 3 m and ice thickness h 0 01 m all ice floes are circular with radius r 0 05 m they are closely packed so that the ice concentration function is estimated be around 0 9 using such information we estimate the ship resistance in ice floe covered water using eq 22 which are plotted using solid lines in fig 4 in the figure model tests are marked by diamond points from the figure it is observed that ship resistance in ice water is proportional to squared velocity as eq 22 predicts such relationship is thus well be validated in our second example we consider the model tests of uto et al 2015 in their tests ice floes are all square shaped with size being 0 5 m so that added mass coefficient c a 1 189 in eq 22 the ship model under consideration is 4 5 m long 0 78 m wide towed in 0 03 m thick ice flows the ice concentration function is 0 8 based on such information we estimate the ship model resistance in ice floe covered water using eq 22 they are plotted using solid lines in fig 5 while model tests are marked by diamond points the correlation between theoretical and experimental results are not as good as the previous example the ratio of typical ice floe length over ship length in the previous example is 1 30 0 033 much smaller than 1 while the present ratio is 1 7 0 143 much greater than the ratio in the previous example therefore the basic assumption that ice floes are small is not well met for the present example even so the theoretical predictions still lie in between experimental test results aboulazm 1989 predicted full scale resistance of a r class ice going vessel scaled up from model tests the ship length was l 93 m ship width b 19 34 m in the tests triangular ice floes were employed ice thickness was h 1 m and ice concentration function was Ï 0 5 the up scaled results are given in fig 6 using diamond points the added mass coefficient for a triangle is nearly equal to c a 1 2 lamb 1995 landweber et al 1991 if the ratios among the three sides of a triangle are not disproportionate one side is not too long over the rest two using this value the theoretically predicted resistance is plotted in the same figure with solid black line figs 4 6 show that the theoretical formula 22 is in pleasant agreement with model tests we have introduced simplified assumptions but the agreements are still satisfactorily good this is somewhat surprising showing that this problem is very complicated but the dominant effects are approximately included in eq 22 eq 22 also indicates that hydrodynamic influence added mass and distance with ship hull plays very important role this reminds us that numerical models to handle the problem should carefully include hydrodynamic effects 5 conclusions ship resistance in waters covered with broken ice floes is theoretically investigated closed formula is obtained to reveal the influences of some parameters on ship resistance three conclusions obtained from the theoretical formula and experimental results are 1 ship resistance is proportional to squared velocity 2 ship resistance is proportional to ice concentration function and 3 added mass effects are very important the reason for conclusion 3 is emphasized here ice resistance is proportional to added mass coefficient as in eq 22 so hydrodynamic influence is fundamentally important when ship resistance is estimated in ice floe covered waters this factor has not been explicitly mentioned often in practice when empirical formulas are used it is also useful for numerical modelling when a numerical method is employed to handle ship ice interaction water as an in compressible fluid is necessary keeping in mind that the added mass coefficients for a circle and a triangle are 1 0 5 as shown in the previous examples we conclude that added mass also represents floe shape influence including added mass is the biggest contribution of the present method another advantage of the method is the approach to simplify the collision process with a point contact which is worthy of further research if a more general theory is constructed to handle the problem it should be mentioned that eq 22 is obtained from thin ship and small ice floe hypotheses care is needed when applying it to ships which are not thin and to large ice floes covered waters acknowledgement the current research is financially supported by the key program grant no

tangential direction or vice versa and the third being Î¼ t t in the tangential direction due to the motion in the tangential direction they are all functions of the distance to the hull then the momenta in normal and tangential directions are 5 i n m i Î¼ n n v n Î¼ n t v t i t Î¼ t n v n m i Î¼ t t v t the momentum changes in both directions are equal to impulses in each direction which turn out to be 6 Î´ i n Î´ m i Î¼ n n v n Î¼ n t v t Î´ m i Î¼ n n v n Î´ Î¼ n t v t Î´ i t Î´ Î¼ t n v n m i Î¼ t t v t Î´ Î¼ t n v n we simplify the process for possible theoretical treatment to do so we assume that the collision process is very short such that velocity changes before and after the collision are modeled as a jump therefore the normal velocity changes its sign before and after collision with all mass values unchanged that is 7 Î´ v n v n v n 2 v n Î´ v t v t v t 0 then we obtain 8 Î´ i n 2 m i Î¼ n n v n Î´ i t 2 Î¼ t n v n note that added mass values are dependent on the distance between the ice floe and the hull hydrodynamic theory predicts that the added mass in the normal direction close to a wall is about twice the value of that faraway from wall at infinity the added mass value in the previous equations is those close to the hull which may be approximated by its value at infinity in the following approximate equations irrespective of shapes landweber et al 1991 9a Î¼ n n Î¼ n n 0 2 Î¼ n n add mass in normal tangential direction induced by the motion in other direction is related to add mass at infinity in the following way lamb 1995 9b Î¼ n t Î¼ n t 0 2

consider the simple example that a thin ship moves in pack ice flow the ship has hull form described by 14 y g x z where x is positive in the bow direction y is positive starboard and z is positive upwards the hull surface condition is a non penetrating one in the form of v n u n x the pressure and shear stress are obtained from eq 13 by letting the area tend to zero 15a p 2 Î» m i 2 Î¼ n n u 2

assumption is applied that is the order of beam derivatives with respect to x and z are all small that is 17 o g x z x g x z z 1 n x g x z x g x using the thin ship approximation we note that the

Ï h b l 2 it is a function of ice concentration function beam to length ratio and ice thickness to length ratio it is interesting to compare eq 22 with the widely used colbourne s empirical formula aboulazm 1989 24 r 4 4 f 0 8627 Ï i b h u 2 Ï 2 f u g h Ï besides added mass eq 22 and eq 24 contain the same parameters this increases our confidence that eq 22 does not miss any influences considered by our traditional formula more than that is that the new equation introduces water influences through added mass and reveals the relationships among all parameters in a theoretical way 4 comparison with experimental tests it is lucky that sawamura 2015 presented very good and clearly recorded model tests to measure ship resistance in ice floe covered water the ship model length is l 1 5 m width b 0 3 m and ice thickness h 0 01 m all ice floes are circular with radius r 0 05 m they are closely packed so that the ice concentration function is estimated be around 0 9 using such information we estimate the ship resistance in ice floe covered water using eq 22 which are plotted using solid lines in fig 4 in the figure model tests are marked by diamond points from the figure it is observed that ship resistance in ice water is proportional to squared velocity as eq 22 predicts such relationship is thus well be validated in our second example we consider the model tests of uto et al 2015 in their tests ice floes are all square shaped with size being 0 5 m so that added mass coefficient c a 1 189 in eq 22 the ship model under consideration is 4 5 m long 0 78 m wide towed in 0 03 m thick ice flows the ice concentration function is 0 8 based on such information we estimate the ship model resistance in ice floe covered water using eq 22 they are plotted using solid lines in fig 5 while model tests are marked by diamond points the correlation between theoretical and experimental results are not as good as the previous example the ratio of typical ice floe length over ship length in the previous example is 1 30 0 033 much smaller than 1 while the present ratio is 1 7 0 143 much greater than the ratio in the previous example therefore the basic assumption that ice floes are small is not well met for the present example even so the theoretical predictions still lie in between experimental test results aboulazm 1989 predicted full scale resistance of a r class ice going vessel scaled up from model tests the ship length was l 93 m ship width b 19 34 m in the tests triangular ice floes were employed ice thickness was h 1 m and ice concentration function was Ï 0 5 the up scaled results are given in fig 6 using diamond points the added mass coefficient for a triangle is nearly equal to c a 1 2 lamb 1995 landweber et al 1991 if the ratios among the three sides of a triangle are not disproportionate one side is not too long over the rest two using this value the theoretically predicted resistance is plotted in the same figure with solid black line figs 4 6 show that the theoretical formula 22 is in pleasant agreement with model tests we have introduced simplified assumptions but the agreements are still satisfactorily good this is somewhat surprising showing that this problem is very complicated but the dominant effects are approximately included in eq 22 eq 22 also indicates that hydrodynamic influence added mass and distance with ship hull plays very important role this reminds us that numerical models to handle the problem should carefully include hydrodynamic effects 5 conclusions ship resistance in waters covered with broken ice floes is theoretically investigated closed formula is obtained to reveal the influences of some parameters on ship resistance three conclusions obtained from the theoretical formula and experimental results are 1 ship resistance is proportional to squared velocity 2 ship resistance is proportional to ice concentration function and 3 added mass effects are very important the reason for conclusion 3 is emphasized here ice resistance is proportional to added mass coefficient as in eq 22 so hydrodynamic influence is fundamentally important when ship resistance is estimated in ice floe covered waters this factor has not been explicitly mentioned often in practice when empirical formulas are used it is also useful for numerical modelling when a numerical method is employed to handle ship ice interaction water as an in compressible fluid is necessary keeping in mind that the added mass coefficients for a circle and a triangle are 1 0 5 as shown in the previous examples we conclude that added mass also represents floe shape influence including added mass is the biggest contribution of the present method another advantage of the method is the approach to simplify the collision process with a point contact which is worthy of further research if a more general theory is constructed to handle the problem it should be mentioned that eq 22 is obtained from thin ship and small ice floe hypotheses care is needed when applying it to ships which are not thin and to large ice floes covered waters acknowledgement the current research is financially supported by the key program grant no
