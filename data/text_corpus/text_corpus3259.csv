16295,the minimization of disinfection by product dbp formation by the removal of its precursors before water disinfection is a highly effective approach granular activated carbon gac filtration is widely used for water treatment but our understanding of molecular dissolved organic matter dom remains insufficient this research investigates the removal of dom and the minimization of dbp formation by pilot scale coal and coconut based granular activated carbon filtrations coac and ccac respectively using unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry dom adsorption rates by both gacs were fitted with pseudo second order models with initial adsorption rates of 0 005 mg g 1 min 1 and 0 022 mg g 1 min 1 for ccac and coac respectively based on observations ccac was more effective in the removal of dissolved organic carbon and prolonged adsorption longer than coac as the breakthrough of coac was found on day 10 ccac removed compounds with carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho features with a wide range of oxidation states as indicated by the carbon oxidation state cos and a wide range of unsaturation as indicated by oxygen subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon dbe o c while coac selectively removed only those cho features with less oxidized characters less oxidized compounds low cos were preferentially removed with less contact time while more oxidized compounds needed more contact time to adsorb on the gacs a biofilm was developed on day 60 and many cho features were found to have increased after gac treatment on day 60 indicating the formation of microbial products chlorination resulted in a decrease in many cho and cho with cl atom chocl features and the formation of chocl dbps more than cho dbp features ccac was effective in the minimization of trihalomethane thm and chocl dbp feature formations on day 10 and day 60 while coac was found to be much less effective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter molecular characteristics orbitrap mass spectrometry trihalomethane non targeted analysis unknown disinfection byproduct chlorine disinfections 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in surface water is a complex mixture of natural and anthropogenic organic compounds dom is the main cause of unpleasant odors colors and taste in water and it has been widely proven to be a precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps during water disinfection gilca et al 2020 hence dom should be effectively removed before water disinfection although hydrophobic dom is reported as the primary precursor to dbps hua and reckhow 2007 low molecular weight and hydrophilic dom also play significant roles due to their refractoriness to conventional water treatment matilainen et al 2002 sillanpää 2014 and these also cause the formation of dbps hua and reckhow 2007 water disinfection is an important part of preventing the spread of waterborne diseases but treated water may still contain organic matter leading to the formation of dbps dbps are generated by interactions between organic inorganic matter and the disinfectant added during water treatment processes and their existence has been widely proven to have adverse effects on human health such as bladder and colon cancer spontaneous miscarriage and urinary and gastrointestinal cancers gopal et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 while many dbps have been identified and their health effects investigated about half of them are still unknown cuthbertson et al 2019 richardson et al 2007 weinberg et al 2002 some of dbps in unknown fraction were reported to potentially more toxic than regulated dbps han et al 2021 wawryk et al 2021 in addition the number of emerging dbps has increased and this can be attributed to changes in climates organic precursors introduced by anthropogenic activities into water environments algal organic matters and salt intrusion chaukura et al 2020 delpla et al 2009 gilca et al 2020 this also increases complexity in dbps formation as the most effective way to control dbp formation is precursor removals sustainable and effective dom removal techniques must be required for water treatment before water disinfection several water treatment techniques have been widely applied to increase doc treatment efficiency and to minimize dbp formation including enhanced coagulation magnetic ion exchange resin advanced oxidation and adsorption cuthbertson et al 2019 jutaporn et al 2020 liu et al 2012 matilainen et al 2006 yang et al 2010 among the techniques adsorption by activated carbon ac has been widely used in water treatment due to its reliable efficiencies availability simple operation and maintenance cost cuthbertson et al 2019 gibert et al 2013 golea et al 2020 katsigiannis et al 2015 velten et al 2011 xing et al 2020 ac has widely used in water treatment due to high efficiency in dom removal by high specific surface area and improved pore structure bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2017 xing et al 2008 acs have two forms including powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac gac is widely used for long term operation as water filtration unit while pac is occasionally applied during high pollutants coal peat wood and coconut shell based materials are widely used for commercial gacs due to its proper characteristics as adsorbent jjagwe et al 2021 mailler et al 2016 coal based granular activated carbon gac from non renewable source has been long used in water treatment with promising adsorption capacity and efficiency cuthbertson et al 2019 gibert et al 2013 teng and lin 1998 however due to environmental concerns research on ac production from biomass have been increasingly reported jjagwe et al 2021 advantages of coconut shell based gac ccac on specific area porosity cost effectiveness and abundant of functional groups over other materials li et al 2011 lu et al 2012 su et al 2003 make applications of ccac in water treatment become more popular bhatnagar et al 2010 jjagwe et al 2021 xing et al 2020 not only doc removals by adsorption some gac could enrich biomass biological activated carbon bac resulting in biodegradation of doc and dbp precursors sharma et al 2018 xing et al 2020 the removal of dom by gac filtration via adsorption or biodegradation has been widely investigated via several techniques such as uv absorbance at 254 nanometer total organic carbon size fractionation gibert et al 2013 lu et al 2020 matilainen et al 2006 and fluorescence excitation emission matrix baghoth et al 2011 low molecular weight dom was found to remain after being treated by ac and it acted as an organic precursor of dbps in addition as carbonaceous materials reaction of disinfectants to organic matter in ac to form disinfection byproducts was reported erdem et al 2020 and dom released from adsorbents could also react with disinfectant to form dbps du et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however studies of molecular level dom removal via adsorption or biodegradation are still inadequate for understanding the removal of complex dom recently unknown screening analysis by orbitrap technology has been successfully applied to investigate the removal of molecular level dom in conventional water treatment processes gonsior et al 2014 phatthalung et al 2021 advanced water treatments phungsai et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 and dbp formation postigo et al 2021 in addition changes of molecular dom or dbp formation by pac rakruam et al 2021 and gac kasuga et al 2020 phungsai et al 2018 were also investigated by this technique fate of putative dbp precursors were tracked during advanced water treatment and some of molecular dom were found releasing from bac treatment by this technique phungsai et al 2018 changes in several thousand dom features before and after treatment can been analyzed in a semi quantitative approach in combination with molecular characteristics such as hydrogen and oxygen to carbon ratios h c and o c for compound like characters hockaday et al 2009 oxygen subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon dbe o c for degree of unsaturation phungsai et al 2018 carbon oxidation state cos for degree of oxidation kroll et al 2011 and kendrick mass analysis for changes in alkylation families or other functional groups kim et al 2003 with these combinations treatment mechanisms of molecular dom by water treatment processes could be obtained for instance phungsai et al 2018 reported escaping of ozone organic by products in bac treatment and those were reacted with chlorine to form dbps rakruam et al 2021 found more adsorption capacity of molecular dom with oxidized and saturated character via mesopore of magnetic carbon fiber adsorbent to provide insight into molecular changes of dom by gac treatment this study investigated removal of molecular dom by commercial coal and coconut shell based gac in pilot scale water filtration systems using unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry gac columns were operated to treat pre oxidized water by chlorine dioxide from a water treatment plant sourced phong river in thailand and monitored doc removal efficiencies for 80 days dom compositions and characteristics of over thousand dom features removed and released from gacs in different filtration depth during adsorption and adsorption with biodegradation were investigated in a semiquantitative approach molecular characteristics of dom features were calculated to elucidate adsorption and desorption mechanisms formation potentials of trihalomethanes thm and unknown disinfection byproducts by chlorination were evaluated and investigated for the samples treated by gacs obtained during initial stage by only adsorption and after a biofilm develop for the first time we further explored correlation analysis to dom characteristics to thm formation potential thmfp and unknown dbp formation at different filtration depth preferential adsorption of gac and molecular characteristics of dbp precursors of chlorination were investigated and discussed 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup and water sampling two laboratory scale columns loaded with 8 30 mesh coal based coac and coconut based granular activated carbon ccac filters were operated in parallel and fed chlorine dioxide pre oxidized water for 80 days the design of the set up is shown in fig s1 the

screening analysis 500 ml samples of raw water water after treatment by both gacs at 1 5 7 5 and 15 min of ebct and water after chlorination were acidified to a ph of 2 using hcl high purity grade the dom in the water samples was extracted using a bond elut ppl cartridge containing 500 mg of polystyrene divinylbenzene sorbent agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the cartridge was rinsed with 10

characteristics such as van krevelen diagrams h c and o c ratios the degree of unsaturation by oxygen subtracted carbon double bond equivalent per carbon dbe o c by phungsai et al 2018 and degree of oxidation by carbon oxidation state cos by kroll et al 2011 dbe o c and cos were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 as follows the intensities of the features were compared before and after treatment intensity changes of 30 and categorized as increased unchanged decreased and totally removed this criterion applicable to samples with a similar background matrix was developed from the deviation of measurements phungsai et al 2016 to find putative dbp precursors we applied correlation coefficient to intensities of dom features decreased by chlorine and chlorinated features increased after

characteristics efficiencies of adsorbents are based on various characters such as pore size pore volume surface area and surface chemistry bjelopavlic et al 1999 pivokonsky et al 2021 fig 1 a reveals the surface properties of ccac and coac using a sem at 500x and 1000x the surfaces of ccac were rougher than those of the coal based material coac from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms the surface bet s bet of ccac was 633 19 m2 g 1 while the micropore and mesopore volumes by t plot were 0 163 cm3 g 1 and 0 179 cm3 g 1 respectively table s2 the s bet micropore and mesopore volumes of coac were 842 45 m2 g 1 0 227 cm3 g 1 and 0 230 cm3 g 1 respectively which are higher than those of ccac as the volumes of both gacs in the columns were the same coac had slightly higher total micropore and mesopore volumes than ccac due to differences in their density table s2 gac surfaces play very important roles in adsorption by electrostatic hydrophobic hydrogen bonding and π π interactions moreno castilla 2004 pivokonsky et al 2021 the phpzc of coac and ccac were 3 97 and 4 01 respectively these values indicate negatively charged surfaces of both gacs at operation conditions as the ph of water was around 6 7 these observations are consistent with the existence of oh bending 1250 1410 cm 1 coates 2006 rankin et al 2013 in ft ir spectra as shown in fig 1b and coac contains more oh than ccac as determined by comparing troughs acidic surfaces would be unfavorable for the electrostatic interaction to negatively charged dom in water to some extent bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2017 moreno castilla 2004 however protonated oh group would still response for adsorption via hydrogen bonding pivokonsky et al 2021 both gacs were found to have similar c h bending 610 680 cm 1 c h stretching 3010 3095 cm 1 and aromatic combinations 2000 1660 cm 1 c o stretching 1560 1590 cm 1 c o stretching 1050 1100 cm 1 coates 2006 liu et al 2019 rodríguez and núñez 2011 with differences in abundancies detections of aromatic combination and carbonyl groups implies existence of pyrones chromenos quinones or diketones responds for basic surface enable for electrostatic adsorption of dom montes morán et al 2004 broad peaks at around 25o and 43o in the xrd patterns fig 1c indicate 002 and 100 planes of carbon respectively and amorphous and graphitic characters of both gacs similar to gacs in other studies shang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 other peaks indicate impurities in the gacs as adsorption of dom on adsorbents are based on several mechanisms these differences on gacs characters on surface area functional groups and pore volume would result in different dom adsorptions in some extent 3 2 dom removals both gacs were better fitted to freundlich isotherms r2 0 9303 and 0 8239 for ccac and coac respectively as seen in fig s2a than to langmuir isotherms r2 0 9107 and 0 658 for ccac and coac respectively as seen in fig s2b this indicates multilayer adsorptions of dom by both gacs coac had a freundlich capacity factor kf of 1 652 which is more than the 1 200 for ccac table s2 while the 1 n of ccac was 0 601 which is higher than the 0 233 for coac a 1 n value lower than 1 for both gacs indicates lower adsorption intensity at higher concentration of doc based on kf and 1 n values coac would have an adsorption capacity that is higher than that for ccac to some extent at lower doc levels and ccac would have a higher adsorption capacity at a higher doc level fig s2c the adsorption kinetics of both gacs were fitted to pseudo second order pso models r2 0 980 and 0 9101 for ccac and coac respectively better than to pseudo first order pfo models r2 0 9114 and 0 8761 for ccac and coac respectively as shown in fig s3 and table s2 coac had an initial rate constant of 0 029 mgc gac 1 min 1 which is higher than the 0 007 mgc gac 1 min 1 for ccac the higher capacity and rate of adsorption of coac over ccac could be due to the higher micro and meso pore volumes available for adsorption of dom as the proportion of macro meso and micropores plays a role in removing the pollutants contained in the dom fundneider et al 2021 for the column experiments doc levels were monitored during operations for 80 days as shown in fig 2 a both gacs could effectively remove most of the doc in the water during the first 5 days before breakthroughs of coac and ccac were found on day 10 and day 33 respectively even if higher pore volumes were found in coac the breakthrough of coac earlier than ccac implies that coac has a lower adsorption capacity for dom the pores in coac would not have enough active surface for the adsorption of dom on day 3 3 4 mgc l 1 of doc were removed at a filtration depth of 0 15 cm first 1 5 min ebct by coac while 2 9 0 5 and 0 1 mgc l 1 of doc were removed at filtration depths of 0 15 cm first 1 5 min ebct 15 50 cm 1 5 7 5 min ebct and 50 100 cm 7 5 15 min ebct respectively fig 2b the greater doc removal by coac adsorption than ccac adsorption at a filtration depth of 0 15 cm is consistent with the faster adsorption rate of coac over ccac table s2 coac could still effectively remove doc in the first 0 15 cm of filtration depth on day 5 while ccac would need 0 50 cm of filtration to remove the same level of doc the removal efficiencies of coac substantially decreased on day 10 as only 1 3 mgc l 1 of doc was removed at a depth of 50 100 cm this also implies the saturation of coac at a filtration depth of 0 50 cm ccac was still effective for doc removal at a filtration depth of 0 50 cm on day 10 both gacs were slightly effective after breakthrough in doc removals after day 35 these removals can be attributed to both the adsorption and biodegradation of microbial activities and can be confirmed by levels of microbes on both gacs 103 104 cfu g 1 wet weight as shown on table s3 the levels of microbes found in the gacs in this study were lower than the 108 cfu g 1 wet weight of a previous study lu et al 2020 which might be due to a residual oxidant in the influent as contact time is only 15 min biodegradation would only take place for organic matter adsorbed by the gacs ccac achieves around 1 mgc l 1 by adsorption and biodegradation while coac achieved only 0 1 0 2 mgc l 1 of doc removals 3 3 changes in dom elemental composition by coal and coconut based activated carbon filtrations we further observed changes in dom compositions during adsorption day 10 and adsorption and biodegradation day 60 by both gacs using unknown screening analysis with orbitrap ms dom peaks in both influents were found in m z ranges of 150 500 as shown in fig s4 consistent with the detection of natural dom in several studies using orbitrap ms phungsai et al 2018 han et al 2021 remucal et al 2012 however dom m z ranges would be shifted to a higher m z for detections by other high resolution ms type as orbitrap ms is prone to detect molecules in this range pan et al 2020 hence we focused here on lower molecular weight dom which has been widely proven as problematic and refractory dom in conventional and advanced water treatments matilainen et al 2010 phungsai et al 2018 the mass spectra drastically changed after treatments by both gacs indicating the removal of dom fig s5 after formula identification over two thousand dom features were found in system influents on both days fig 3 dom with carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho features were the most abundant class consistent with the dom in several raw waters in various countries lavonen et al 2015 phungsai et al 2021 yuthawong et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 this is also consistent with our previous report observing dom in this river prasert et al 2021 over 80 of dom features were commonly found in the influents of the system data not shown indicating a similar matrix of dom with close distances in two dimensional scaling to each other fig s6 compared to other treated samples on day 10 the number of dom features substantially decreased along with the filtration depths fig 3 for ccac while the number of dom features decreased slightly along the depth of coac in addition only short distances were found from the influent to the samples after coac compared to the larger distances with increasing filtration depth by ccac confirming that coac is less effective than ccac in the treatment of dom features fig s7 these observations are consistent with the high doc removal by ccac and the low doc removal by coac on day 10 fig 2a ccac could completely remove many dom features as their intensities were below the detection limit resulting in a decrease of feature numbers while coac could only adsorb some dom features allowing it remaining in the treated water on day 60 the number of dom features slightly decreased by ccac treatments in contrast to an increase in dom features after coac treatments this observation of ccac treatment on day 60 implies the generation of soluble microbial products resulting in an increase in the number of dom features to avoid complexity in molecular characterization we focus on cho features due to its most abundant class in all the water samples and widely focused in water treatments by many studies gonsior et al 2014 rakruam et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 and chocl features due to its abundance in the source river and source water of gacs most of the cho features in both influents were lignin like compounds followed by lipid like carbohydrate like compounds and aromatic structure compounds respectively the abundance of lignin like compounds is consistent with the high intensity of humic like peaks in the eem results as shown in fig s9a as their character has a reported correlation lavonen et al 2015 these compounds are refractory to conventional water treatment and pre oxidation by the chlorine dioxide remaining in the influents at both day 10 and day 60 at day 10 the number of cho features decreased and these were totally removed by ccac and coac which increased with increasing filtration depth fig 4 ccac could substantially remove a much larger number of cho features than coac consistent with the doc removals some of the cho features increased or were newly formed after filtration indicating the release of doc background by both gacs releasing of dom background detected by unknown screening analysis was also previously reported phungsai et al 2018 as both gacs were rinsed until no doc background before uses this observation on dom background implies desorption of dom from gacs when other compound arrived ccac could remove doc with wide ranges of oxidation states and unsaturation fig 5 a and table s4 while coac selectively removed only those cho features with less oxidized characters fig 5b and table s4 those less oxidized cho features were removed by ccac in 1 5 min ebct fig s10a but needed 15 min ebct to be removed by coac fig s10f higher contact times increased the removal of cho features including those with a higher degree of oxidation by ccac figs s10b and s10c while those that were more oxidized were refractory to coac fig s10d f more oxidized molecules would contain more oxygenated groups making them more hydrophilic and making it difficult for them to be adsorbed by ac by hydrophobic force moreno castilla 2004 which is also consistent with our previous finding phungsai et al 2021 in addition as coac is nearly saturated its selectivity to dom would be prone to more adsorbable molecules which are less oxidized features in this study the numbers of cho features removed on day 60 by both gacs were much lower compared to day 10 indicating less dom removal efficiency compared to the adsorption during the beginning stage decreasing doc removal after a long period of gac operation has been widely reported cuthbertson et al 2019 gibert et al 2013 many cho features were found to have increased at day 60 indicating the release of doc background from the degradation of the gacs or the release of microbial products this is similar to a previous report on the formation of cho features after biological activated carbon filtration phungsai et al 2018 cho features released after both gacs showed a wide range of dbe o c and cos fig 5c and 5d hence the characteristics of microbial products were not specific regarding the degree of unsaturation and carbon oxidation state changes in the numbers of chocl and chon features by both gacs were similar to cho features fig s11 this observation implies that gacs had similar removal effects to compounds with other heteroatoms in terms of numbers 3 5 effect of doc removals by gacs on disinfection byproduct formation potential after chlorination in the day 10 sample the chlorine decreased or totally removed over half of the cho features as shown in fig 6 a for coac around 50 cho features increased or were newly formed after chlorination in pre treated water indicating the formation of some cho dbp features with remaining dom from adsorption in contrast fewer cho dbp features were found in chlorinated samples pre treated by ccac than in the chlorinated influent the detection of cho dbp was also reported in our previous work phungsai et al 2021 as a greater number of cho features were released from coac figs 4 and 5b compared to ccac a decrease in cho features of coac organic matter after chlorination implies their precursor character on day 60 over 80 of the cho features in the influent and the samples pretreated by ccac and coac had been decreased by chlorine while the number of cho dbp features formed after chlorination were similar and smaller than the chlorinated influents respectively fig 6a as over half of the cho features remaining after treatment by both gacs increased newly formed and unchanged portions in fig 4 reacted with and were decreased by chlorine fig 6a the organic matter released by the microbial growth of gacs would also act as precursors of dbps to discuss chlorinated dbps we also focus on the existence of chocl features fig 3 changes in chocl dbp formation by both ac pretreatments fig 6b and further analysis of the formation potentials of thm fig 7 thmfp fig 7 and the number of chocl dbp features fig 8 a in the chlorinated influents at day 60 were higher than in the chlorinated the day 10 influent the levels of cf bdcm and dbcm in the chlorinated influent at day 10 were below who standard 300 µg l for cf 60 µg l for bdcm and 100 µg l for dbcm but some are higher than standards of japan eu directive and usa guideline gilca et al 2020 in contrast cf of day 60 was higher than most of the standards this observation implies importance of addiction treatment before chlorination for this water samples to minimize toxicity level in water at day 60 the number of unique chocl dbps was 87 which is much higher than the 12 on day 10 fig 8a numbers of chlorinated dbps in day 60 higher than day 10 was consistent with levels of thmfp hence the influents at day 60 would contain more dbp precursors than on day 10 several hundred chocl features were found in both influents and these could be attributed to chocl features existing in the river water or formed by chlorine dioxide pre oxidation prasert et al 2021 on day 10 those chocl were decreased by both gacs following a similar trend to cho features fig s11 indicating the effectiveness of both gacs on the removal of chlorinated molecules lists of the chocl dbps features detected in this study are provided in supplementary information 2 many of the chocl contained in the influents were decreased or totally removed by both gacs fig s11 however the numbers and portions of chocl features increased after chlorination in all the samples as shown in fig 6b and fig s12 respectively this observation indicates that modifications of cho or chocl features to form chocl dbp features and formations of chocl dbp features more than cho dbps increased and newly formed of fig 6a vs 6b for ccac on day 10 the number of chocl dbp formations and thmfp decreased with filtration depth as shown in fig 6b and fig 7 respectively this is also consistent with the decrease in precursors by ccac indicated by the decrease in doc levels along the filtration depth fig 2b as very low levels of thmfp found after 15 min ebct by ccac on day 10 this implies effectiveness of ccac on dbp precursors removals and would make water safer as dbps levels much lower than the standards in contrast the number of chocl dbps in the chlorinated samples pretreated by coac at different filtration depths were close to the influents or higher fig 6b and this observation is consistent with the thmfp of samples pretreated by coac fig 7 the findings imply the formation of chlorinated dbps from the organic background released from coac fig 4 more than the minimization of dbps we also found that 72 chocl dbp features were uniquely formed in the chlorinated sample pre treated by coac fig 8b and might have been formed from those precursors released from coac hence it would be very important to pay attention to the background of gacs after some period of operation as the background could be released and act as a precursor of dbps we applied correlation analysis to correlate decreasing of cho features intensities and increasing of chocl dbps by chlorination in day 10 water samples this is based on assumption that intensities of cho precursors decreased by chlorine correlated with intensities of chocl dbps increased after chlorination changes of intensities of dom peaks in the samples with similar background matrix followed changes in concentration in unknown screening analysis was also previously reported phungsai et al 2016 from correlation analysis 391 cho features were found to be correlated with formation of chocl dbps 0 95 while cf and bdcm found correlated with 31 and 49 cho features as shown in table 1 almost all top 15 abundant chocl dbps were correlated with over 10 cho features table s5 and 169 in total in table 1 this observation explain abundance of dbps after chlorination as it can potentially be formed via reaction of chlorine to many precursors putative precursors were found to have higher molecular weight more unsaturated higher dbe o c and less oxidized lower cos compared to all cho features table 1 these preferential reactions of chlorine to more unsaturated precursors more carbon double bonds consistent with previous reports on electrophilic substitution and addition reactions deborde and von gunten 2008 wenk et al 2013 in addition preferential reaction to less oxidized compounds lower cos was previously reported zhang et al 2012 and consistent with thermodynamic on preferential oxidation to less oxidized molecules to gain more energy hence this approach would be one of possible method to investigate dbp precursors as cho features with less oxidized characters could be removed by both gacs fig 5 this would minimize formation of chocl dbps in some extent on day 60 many cho and chocl features had increased or newly formed from both gacs while only a small number of cho and chocl features had decreased by both gacs on day 60 fig 4 and fig s11a as only lower doc removals were observed 1 21 and 0 17 mgc l 1 for ccac and coac respectively this small number of decreased features and high numbers of increased and newly formed features by both gacs indicates biodegradation from higher molecular weight molecules to lower molecular weight molecules with less mineralization the organic matter remaining after the gacs also act as precursors of dbps after chlorination as over 105 chocl dbp features were commonly found in the chlorinated influent and the chlorinated samples after treatment by both gacs fig 8c this is consistent with thmfp as only a small decrease was found in the sample pre treated by ccac and no change was found for the sample pre treated by coac fig 7 pretreatments by both gacs also resulted in the formation of some unique chocl dbp features fig 8c and this might be due to the release of doc background or the remnants of different precursors from the ac treatments comparing the chocl dbp features found in the chlorinated samples after the ac treatments on day 10 and day 60 around 14 chocl dbp features were commonly found in all the sample indicating that its precursors are refractory to ac treatments fig 8d only a small number of chocl dbps were found after treatment by ccac on day 10 while coac was already less efficient in doc removal and dbp minimization on day 10 3 6 implications for further study this study investigated the removal of molecular doc and changes in dbp formations in water samples pre treated by different types of gacs in the initial stage and after a biofilm developed orbitrap ms implies its possibility to detect doc released from adsorbents during operation further studies are needed to investigate the formation of dbps with molecular organic matter released from gacs as different types of organic matter might be released at different operation times long term studies on doc background released from various adsorbent materials would provide very useful information for proper application of adsorbents in water treatment in addition it would be essential to incorporate the formation of dbps and the identification of organic precursors released during microbial activities with advanced microbial community analysis to understand the roles of microorganisms and its precursor removal with advanced unknown screening analysis as microbial communities might vary with different operation times long term monitoring is needed with more frequent sampling to observe changes in ac treatments by both adsorption and biodegradation more frequent sampling would also provide more detail on existence of and insight into unknown dbps furthermore incorporating unknown screening analysis to characterize dbps minimization of adsorption and biodegradation and toxicity evaluation han et al 2021 wawryk et al 2021 would provide more insight into minimization of precursors and toxicity of dbps in addition statistical analysis such as rank correlation would provide more insight into the removal of precursors by microbes unknown screening analysis is a promising tool for dom mechanisms and this method could be applied to characterize dom removals by other types of or modified gacs to find the best modification conditions for molecular dom or precursor removal 4 conclusions this research investigated the efficiencies of pilot scale coal and coconut shell based granular activated carbon filtrations coac and ccac respectively for the minimization of trihalomethanes and unknown disinfection by products dbps detected by unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry the adsorption of dissolved organic matter dom by ccac and coac were fitted with pseudo second order models with initial rates of adsorption of 0 005 mg g 1 min 1 and 0 022 mg g 1min 1 respectively the surface area of the coac was 842 45 m2 g 1 which is higher than the ccac surface area 633 19 m2 g 1 coac was found to be effective for adsorption only for 10 days while ccac could maintain its effectiveness for around 30 days c h and o containing compounds cho features with less oxidized compounds low carbon oxidation state cos were easily removed within a short contact time with ac while more oxidized compounds needed more contact time to be removed after the biofilm developed many cho features increased indicating the formation of microbial products chlorination resulted in a decrease in many cho and cho with cl atom chocl features and the formation of chocl dbps more than cho dbps features on day 10 ccac was effective in minimizing the formation of both chocl dbps and trihalomethanes correlation analysis indicated less oxidized and more unsaturated characters of dbp precursors in contrast the samples passing through the gacs on day 60 had formed more chocl dbps than the chlorinated influent while only ccac could slightly decrease the formation of trihalomethanes credit authorship

16295,the minimization of disinfection by product dbp formation by the removal of its precursors before water disinfection is a highly effective approach granular activated carbon gac filtration is widely used for water treatment but our understanding of molecular dissolved organic matter dom remains insufficient this research investigates the removal of dom and the minimization of dbp formation by pilot scale coal and coconut based granular activated carbon filtrations coac and ccac respectively using unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry dom adsorption rates by both gacs were fitted with pseudo second order models with initial adsorption rates of 0 005 mg g 1 min 1 and 0 022 mg g 1 min 1 for ccac and coac respectively based on observations ccac was more effective in the removal of dissolved organic carbon and prolonged adsorption longer than coac as the breakthrough of coac was found on day 10 ccac removed compounds with carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho features with a wide range of oxidation states as indicated by the carbon oxidation state cos and a wide range of unsaturation as indicated by oxygen subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon dbe o c while coac selectively removed only those cho features with less oxidized characters less oxidized compounds low cos were preferentially removed with less contact time while more oxidized compounds needed more contact time to adsorb on the gacs a biofilm was developed on day 60 and many cho features were found to have increased after gac treatment on day 60 indicating the formation of microbial products chlorination resulted in a decrease in many cho and cho with cl atom chocl features and the formation of chocl dbps more than cho dbp features ccac was effective in the minimization of trihalomethane thm and chocl dbp feature formations on day 10 and day 60 while coac was found to be much less effective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter molecular characteristics orbitrap mass spectrometry trihalomethane non targeted analysis unknown disinfection byproduct chlorine disinfections 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in surface water is a complex mixture of natural and anthropogenic organic compounds dom is the main cause of unpleasant odors colors and taste in water and it has been widely proven to be a precursor of disinfection byproducts dbps during water disinfection gilca et al 2020 hence dom should be effectively removed before water disinfection although hydrophobic dom is reported as the primary precursor to dbps hua and reckhow 2007 low molecular weight and hydrophilic dom also play significant roles due to their refractoriness to conventional water treatment matilainen et al 2002 sillanpää 2014 and these also cause the formation of dbps hua and reckhow 2007 water disinfection is an important part of preventing the spread of waterborne diseases but treated water may still contain organic matter leading to the formation of dbps dbps are generated by interactions between organic inorganic matter and the disinfectant added during water treatment processes and their existence has been widely proven to have adverse effects on human health such as bladder and colon cancer spontaneous miscarriage and urinary and gastrointestinal cancers gopal et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 while many dbps have been identified and their health effects investigated about half of them are still unknown cuthbertson et al 2019 richardson et al 2007 weinberg et al 2002 some of dbps in unknown fraction were reported to potentially more toxic than regulated dbps han et al 2021 wawryk et al 2021 in addition the number of emerging dbps has increased and this can be attributed to changes in climates organic precursors introduced by anthropogenic activities into water environments algal organic matters and salt intrusion chaukura et al 2020 delpla et al 2009 gilca et al 2020 this also increases complexity in dbps formation as the most effective way to control dbp formation is precursor removals sustainable and effective dom removal techniques must be required for water treatment before water disinfection several water treatment techniques have been widely applied to increase doc treatment efficiency and to minimize dbp formation including enhanced coagulation magnetic ion exchange resin advanced oxidation and adsorption cuthbertson et al 2019 jutaporn et al 2020 liu et al 2012 matilainen et al 2006 yang et al 2010 among the techniques adsorption by activated carbon ac has been widely used in water treatment due to its reliable efficiencies availability simple operation and maintenance cost cuthbertson et al 2019 gibert et al 2013 golea et al 2020 katsigiannis et al 2015 velten et al 2011 xing et al 2020 ac has widely used in water treatment due to high efficiency in dom removal by high specific surface area and improved pore structure bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2017 xing et al 2008 acs have two forms including powdered activated carbon pac and granular activated carbon gac gac is widely used for long term operation as water filtration unit while pac is occasionally applied during high pollutants coal peat wood and coconut shell based materials are widely used for commercial gacs due to its proper characteristics as adsorbent jjagwe et al 2021 mailler et al 2016 coal based granular activated carbon gac from non renewable source has been long used in water treatment with promising adsorption capacity and efficiency cuthbertson et al 2019 gibert et al 2013 teng and lin 1998 however due to environmental concerns research on ac production from biomass have been increasingly reported jjagwe et al 2021 advantages of coconut shell based gac ccac on specific area porosity cost effectiveness and abundant of functional groups over other materials li et al 2011 lu et al 2012 su et al 2003 make applications of ccac in water treatment become more popular bhatnagar et al 2010 jjagwe et al 2021 xing et al 2020 not only doc removals by adsorption some gac could enrich biomass biological activated carbon bac resulting in biodegradation of doc and dbp precursors sharma et al 2018 xing et al 2020 the removal of dom by gac filtration via adsorption or biodegradation has been widely investigated via several techniques such as uv absorbance at 254 nanometer total organic carbon size fractionation gibert et al 2013 lu et al 2020 matilainen et al 2006 and fluorescence excitation emission matrix baghoth et al 2011 low molecular weight dom was found to remain after being treated by ac and it acted as an organic precursor of dbps in addition as carbonaceous materials reaction of disinfectants to organic matter in ac to form disinfection byproducts was reported erdem et al 2020 and dom released from adsorbents could also react with disinfectant to form dbps du et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 however studies of molecular level dom removal via adsorption or biodegradation are still inadequate for understanding the removal of complex dom recently unknown screening analysis by orbitrap technology has been successfully applied to investigate the removal of molecular level dom in conventional water treatment processes gonsior et al 2014 phatthalung et al 2021 advanced water treatments phungsai et al 2019 remucal et al 2020 and dbp formation postigo et al 2021 in addition changes of molecular dom or dbp formation by pac rakruam et al 2021 and gac kasuga et al 2020 phungsai et al 2018 were also investigated by this technique fate of putative dbp precursors were tracked during advanced water treatment and some of molecular dom were found releasing from bac treatment by this technique phungsai et al 2018 changes in several thousand dom features before and after treatment can been analyzed in a semi quantitative approach in combination with molecular characteristics such as hydrogen and oxygen to carbon ratios h c and o c for compound like characters hockaday et al 2009 oxygen subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon dbe o c for degree of unsaturation phungsai et al 2018 carbon oxidation state cos for degree of oxidation kroll et al 2011 and kendrick mass analysis for changes in alkylation families or other functional groups kim et al 2003 with these combinations treatment mechanisms of molecular dom by water treatment processes could be obtained for instance phungsai et al 2018 reported escaping of ozone organic by products in bac treatment and those were reacted with chlorine to form dbps rakruam et al 2021 found more adsorption capacity of molecular dom with oxidized and saturated character via mesopore of magnetic carbon fiber adsorbent to provide insight into molecular changes of dom by gac treatment this study investigated removal of molecular dom by commercial coal and coconut shell based gac in pilot scale water filtration systems using unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry gac columns were operated to treat pre oxidized water by chlorine dioxide from a water treatment plant sourced phong river in thailand and monitored doc removal efficiencies for 80 days dom compositions and characteristics of over thousand dom features removed and released from gacs in different filtration depth during adsorption and adsorption with biodegradation were investigated in a semiquantitative approach molecular characteristics of dom features were calculated to elucidate adsorption and desorption mechanisms formation potentials of trihalomethanes thm and unknown disinfection byproducts by chlorination were evaluated and investigated for the samples treated by gacs obtained during initial stage by only adsorption and after a biofilm develop for the first time we further explored correlation analysis to dom characteristics to thm formation potential thmfp and unknown dbp formation at different filtration depth preferential adsorption of gac and molecular characteristics of dbp precursors of chlorination were investigated and discussed 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup and water sampling two laboratory scale columns loaded with 8 30 mesh coal based coac and coconut based granular activated carbon ccac filters were operated in parallel and fed chlorine dioxide pre oxidized water for 80 days the design of the set up is shown in fig s1 the

screening analysis 500 ml samples of raw water water after treatment by both gacs at 1 5 7 5 and 15 min of ebct and water after chlorination were acidified to a ph of 2 using hcl high purity grade the dom in the water samples was extracted using a bond elut ppl cartridge containing 500 mg of polystyrene divinylbenzene sorbent agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the cartridge was rinsed with 10

identification only peaks with the 13c1 12cn 1 isotope were retained for further data analysis while formula assigned features with cl atoms were further validated using the 37cl1 isotope the features of each sample were processed by two dimensional scaling using multidimensional scaling mds in spss ibm armonk ny usa the numbers of atoms in each formula were used to analyze molecular characteristics such as van krevelen diagrams h c and o c ratios the degree of unsaturation by oxygen subtracted carbon double bond equivalent per carbon dbe o c by phungsai et al 2018 and degree of oxidation by carbon oxidation state cos by kroll et al 2011 dbe o c and cos were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 as follows the intensities of the features were compared before and after treatment intensity changes of 30 and categorized as increased unchanged decreased and totally removed this criterion applicable to samples with a similar background matrix was developed from the deviation of measurements phungsai et al 2016 to find putative dbp precursors we applied correlation coefficient to intensities of dom features decreased by chlorine and chlorinated features increased after

characteristics efficiencies of adsorbents are based on various characters such as pore size pore volume surface area and surface chemistry bjelopavlic et al 1999 pivokonsky et al 2021 fig 1 a reveals the surface properties of ccac and coac using a sem at 500x and 1000x the surfaces of ccac were rougher than those of the coal based material coac from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms the surface bet s bet of ccac was 633 19 m2 g 1 while the micropore and mesopore volumes by t plot were 0 163 cm3 g 1 and 0 179 cm3 g 1 respectively table s2 the s bet micropore and mesopore volumes of coac were 842 45 m2 g 1 0 227 cm3 g 1 and 0 230 cm3 g 1 respectively which are higher than those of ccac as the volumes of both gacs in the columns were the same coac had slightly higher total micropore and mesopore volumes than ccac due to differences in their density table s2 gac surfaces play very important roles in adsorption by electrostatic hydrophobic hydrogen bonding and π π interactions moreno castilla 2004 pivokonsky et al 2021 the phpzc of coac and ccac were 3 97 and 4 01 respectively these values indicate negatively charged surfaces of both gacs at operation conditions as the ph of water was around 6 7 these observations are consistent with the existence of oh bending 1250 1410 cm 1 coates 2006 rankin et al 2013 in ft ir spectra as shown in fig 1b and coac contains more oh than ccac as determined by comparing troughs acidic surfaces would be unfavorable for the electrostatic interaction to negatively charged dom in water to some extent bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2017 moreno castilla 2004 however protonated oh group would still response for adsorption via hydrogen bonding pivokonsky et al 2021 both gacs were found to have similar c h bending 610 680 cm 1 c h stretching 3010 3095 cm 1 and aromatic combinations 2000 1660 cm 1 c o stretching 1560 1590 cm 1 c o stretching 1050 1100 cm 1 coates 2006 liu et al 2019 rodríguez and núñez 2011 with differences in abundancies detections of aromatic combination and carbonyl groups implies existence of pyrones chromenos quinones or diketones responds for basic surface enable for electrostatic adsorption of dom montes morán et al 2004 broad peaks at around 25o and 43o in the xrd patterns fig 1c indicate 002 and 100 planes of carbon respectively and amorphous and graphitic characters of both gacs similar to gacs in other studies shang et al 2015 xu et al 2018 other peaks indicate impurities in the gacs as adsorption of dom on adsorbents are based on several mechanisms these differences on gacs characters on surface area functional groups and pore volume would result in different dom adsorptions in some extent 3 2 dom removals both gacs were better fitted to freundlich isotherms r2 0 9303 and 0 8239 for ccac and coac respectively as seen in fig s2a than to langmuir isotherms r2 0 9107 and 0 658 for ccac and coac respectively as seen in fig s2b this indicates multilayer adsorptions of dom by both gacs coac had a freundlich capacity factor kf of 1 652 which is more than the 1 200 for ccac table s2 while the 1 n of ccac was 0 601 which is higher than the 0 233 for coac a 1 n value lower than 1 for both gacs indicates lower adsorption intensity at higher concentration of doc based on kf and 1 n values coac would have an adsorption capacity that is higher than that for ccac to some extent at lower doc levels and ccac would have a higher adsorption capacity at a higher doc level fig s2c the adsorption kinetics of both gacs were fitted to pseudo second order pso models r2 0 980 and 0 9101 for ccac and coac respectively better than to pseudo first order pfo models r2 0 9114 and 0 8761 for ccac and coac respectively as shown in fig s3 and table s2 coac had an initial rate constant of 0 029 mgc gac 1 min 1 which is higher than the 0 007 mgc gac 1 min 1 for ccac the higher capacity and rate of adsorption of coac over ccac could be due to the higher micro and meso pore volumes available for adsorption of dom as the proportion of macro meso and micropores plays a role in removing the pollutants contained in the dom fundneider et al 2021 for the column experiments doc levels were monitored during operations for 80 days as shown in fig 2 a both gacs could effectively remove most of the doc in the water during the first 5 days before breakthroughs of coac and ccac were found on day 10 and day 33 respectively even if higher pore volumes were found in coac the breakthrough of coac earlier than ccac implies that coac has a lower adsorption capacity for dom the pores in coac would not have enough active surface for the adsorption of dom on day 3 3 4 mgc l 1 of doc were removed at a filtration depth of 0 15 cm first 1 5 min ebct by coac while 2 9 0 5 and 0 1 mgc l 1 of doc were removed at filtration depths of 0 15 cm first 1 5 min ebct 15 50 cm 1 5 7 5 min ebct and 50 100 cm 7 5 15 min ebct respectively fig 2b the greater doc removal by coac adsorption than ccac adsorption at a filtration depth of 0 15 cm is consistent with the faster adsorption rate of coac over ccac table s2 coac could still effectively remove doc in the first 0 15 cm of filtration depth on day 5 while ccac would need 0 50 cm of filtration to remove the same level of doc the removal efficiencies of coac substantially decreased on day 10 as only 1 3 mgc l 1 of doc was removed at a depth of 50 100 cm this also implies the saturation of coac at a filtration depth of 0 50 cm ccac was still effective for doc removal at a filtration depth of 0 50 cm on day 10 both gacs were slightly effective after breakthrough in doc removals after day 35 these removals can be attributed to both the adsorption and biodegradation of microbial activities and can be confirmed by levels of microbes on both gacs 103 104 cfu g 1 wet weight as shown on table s3 the levels of microbes found in the gacs in this study were lower than the 108 cfu g 1 wet weight of a previous study lu et al 2020 which might be due to a residual oxidant in the influent as contact time is only 15 min biodegradation would only take place for organic matter adsorbed by the gacs ccac achieves around 1 mgc l 1 by adsorption and biodegradation while coac achieved only 0 1 0 2 mgc l 1 of doc removals 3 3 changes in dom elemental composition by coal and coconut based activated carbon filtrations we further observed changes in dom compositions during adsorption day 10 and adsorption and biodegradation day 60 by both gacs using unknown screening analysis with orbitrap ms dom peaks in both influents were found in m z ranges of 150 500 as shown in fig s4 consistent with the detection of natural dom in several studies using orbitrap ms phungsai et al 2018 han et al 2021 remucal et al 2012 however dom m z ranges would be shifted to a higher m z for detections by other high resolution ms type as orbitrap ms is prone to detect molecules in this range pan et al 2020 hence we focused here on lower molecular weight dom which has been widely proven as problematic and refractory dom in conventional and advanced water treatments matilainen et al 2010 phungsai et al 2018 the mass spectra drastically changed after treatments by both gacs indicating the removal of dom fig s5 after formula identification over two thousand dom features were found in system influents on both days fig 3 dom with carbon hydrogen and oxygen cho features were the most abundant class consistent with the dom in several raw waters in various countries lavonen et al 2015 phungsai et al 2021 yuthawong et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 this is also consistent with our previous report observing dom in this river prasert et al 2021 over 80 of dom features were commonly found in the influents of the system data not shown indicating a similar matrix of dom with close distances in two dimensional scaling to each other fig s6 compared to other treated samples on day 10 the number of dom features substantially decreased along with the filtration depths fig 3 for ccac while the number of dom features decreased slightly along the depth of coac in addition only short distances were found from the influent to the samples after coac compared to the larger distances with increasing filtration depth by ccac confirming that coac is less effective than ccac in the treatment of dom features fig s7 these observations are consistent with the high doc removal by ccac and the low doc removal by coac on day 10 fig 2a ccac could completely remove many dom features as their intensities were below the detection limit resulting in a decrease of feature numbers while coac could only adsorb some dom features allowing it remaining in the treated water on day 60 the number of dom features slightly decreased by ccac treatments in contrast to an increase in dom features after coac treatments this observation of ccac treatment on day 60 implies the generation of soluble microbial products resulting in an increase in the number of dom features to avoid complexity in molecular characterization we focus on cho features due to its most abundant class in all the water samples and widely focused in water treatments by many studies gonsior et al 2014 rakruam et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 and chocl features due to its abundance in the source river and source water of gacs most of the cho features in both influents were lignin like compounds followed by lipid like carbohydrate like compounds and aromatic structure compounds respectively the abundance of lignin like compounds is consistent with the high intensity of humic like peaks in the eem results as shown in fig s9a as their character has a reported correlation lavonen et al 2015 these compounds are refractory to conventional water treatment and pre oxidation by the chlorine dioxide remaining in the influents at both day 10 and day 60 at day 10 the number of cho features decreased and these were totally removed by ccac and coac which increased with increasing filtration depth fig 4 ccac could substantially remove a much larger number of cho features than coac consistent with the doc removals some of the cho features increased or were newly formed after filtration indicating the release of doc background by both gacs releasing of dom background detected by unknown screening analysis was also previously reported phungsai et al 2018 as both gacs were rinsed until no doc background before uses this observation on dom background implies desorption of dom from gacs when other compound arrived ccac could remove doc with wide ranges of oxidation states and unsaturation fig 5 a and table s4 while coac selectively removed only those cho features with less oxidized characters fig 5b and table s4 those less oxidized cho features were removed by ccac in 1 5 min ebct fig s10a but needed 15 min ebct to be removed by coac fig s10f higher contact times increased the removal of cho features including those with a higher degree of oxidation by ccac figs s10b and s10c while those that were more oxidized were refractory to coac fig s10d f more oxidized molecules would contain more oxygenated groups making them more hydrophilic and making it difficult for them to be adsorbed by ac by hydrophobic force moreno castilla 2004 which is also consistent with our previous finding phungsai et al 2021 in addition as coac is nearly saturated its selectivity to dom would be prone to more adsorbable molecules which are less oxidized features in this study the numbers of cho features removed on day 60 by both gacs were much lower compared to day 10 indicating less dom removal efficiency compared to the adsorption during the beginning stage decreasing doc removal after a long period of gac operation has been widely reported cuthbertson et al 2019 gibert et al 2013 many cho features were found to have increased at day 60 indicating the release of doc background from the degradation of the gacs or the release of microbial products this is similar to a previous report on the formation of cho features after biological activated carbon filtration phungsai et al 2018 cho features released after both gacs showed a wide range of dbe o c and cos fig 5c and 5d hence the characteristics of microbial products were not specific regarding the degree of unsaturation and carbon oxidation state changes in the numbers of chocl and chon features by both gacs were similar to cho features fig s11 this observation implies that gacs had similar removal effects to compounds with other heteroatoms in terms of numbers 3 5 effect of doc removals by gacs on disinfection byproduct formation potential after chlorination in the day 10 sample the chlorine decreased or totally removed over half of the cho features as shown in fig 6 a for coac around 50 cho features increased or were newly formed after chlorination in pre treated water indicating the formation of some cho dbp features with remaining dom from adsorption in contrast fewer cho dbp features were found in chlorinated samples pre treated by ccac than in the chlorinated influent the detection of cho dbp was also reported in our previous work phungsai et al 2021 as a greater number of cho features were released from coac figs 4 and 5b compared to ccac a decrease in cho features of coac organic matter after chlorination implies their precursor character on day 60 over 80 of the cho features in the influent and the samples pretreated by ccac and coac had been decreased by chlorine while the number of cho dbp features formed after chlorination were similar and smaller than the chlorinated influents respectively fig 6a as over half of the cho features remaining after treatment by both gacs increased newly formed and unchanged portions in fig 4 reacted with and were decreased by chlorine fig 6a the organic matter released by the microbial growth of gacs would also act as precursors of dbps to discuss chlorinated dbps we also focus on the existence of chocl features fig 3 changes in chocl dbp formation by both ac pretreatments fig 6b and further analysis of the formation potentials of thm fig 7 thmfp fig 7 and the number of chocl dbp features fig 8 a in the chlorinated influents at day 60 were higher than in the chlorinated the day 10 influent the levels of cf bdcm and dbcm in the chlorinated influent at day 10 were below who standard 300 µg l for cf 60 µg l for bdcm and 100 µg l for dbcm but some are higher than standards of japan eu directive and usa guideline gilca et al 2020 in contrast cf of day 60 was higher than most of the standards this observation implies importance of addiction treatment before chlorination for this water samples to minimize toxicity level in water at day 60 the number of unique chocl dbps was 87 which is much higher than the 12 on day 10 fig 8a numbers of chlorinated dbps in day 60 higher than day 10 was consistent with levels of thmfp hence the influents at day 60 would contain more dbp precursors than on day 10 several hundred chocl features were found in both influents and these could be attributed to chocl features existing in the river water or formed by chlorine dioxide pre oxidation prasert et al 2021 on day 10 those chocl were decreased by both gacs following a similar trend to cho features fig s11 indicating the effectiveness of both gacs on the removal of chlorinated molecules lists of the chocl dbps features detected in this study are provided in supplementary information 2 many of the chocl contained in the influents were decreased or totally removed by both gacs fig s11 however the numbers and portions of chocl features increased after chlorination in all the samples as shown in fig 6b and fig s12 respectively this observation indicates that modifications of cho or chocl features to form chocl dbp features and formations of chocl dbp features more than cho dbps increased and newly formed of fig 6a vs 6b for ccac on day 10 the number of chocl dbp formations and thmfp decreased with filtration depth as shown in fig 6b and fig 7 respectively this is also consistent with the decrease in precursors by ccac indicated by the decrease in doc levels along the filtration depth fig 2b as very low levels of thmfp found after 15 min ebct by ccac on day 10 this implies effectiveness of ccac on dbp precursors removals and would make water safer as dbps levels much lower than the standards in contrast the number of chocl dbps in the chlorinated samples pretreated by coac at different filtration depths were close to the influents or higher fig 6b and this observation is consistent with the thmfp of samples pretreated by coac fig 7 the findings imply the formation of chlorinated dbps from the organic background released from coac fig 4 more than the minimization of dbps we also found that 72 chocl dbp features were uniquely formed in the chlorinated sample pre treated by coac fig 8b and might have been formed from those precursors released from coac hence it would be very important to pay attention to the background of gacs after some period of operation as the background could be released and act as a precursor of dbps we applied correlation analysis to correlate decreasing of cho features intensities and increasing of chocl dbps by chlorination in day 10 water samples this is based on assumption that intensities of cho precursors decreased by chlorine correlated with intensities of chocl dbps increased after chlorination changes of intensities of dom peaks in the samples with similar background matrix followed changes in concentration in unknown screening analysis was also previously reported phungsai et al 2016 from correlation analysis 391 cho features were found to be correlated with formation of chocl dbps 0 95 while cf and bdcm found correlated with 31 and 49 cho features as shown in table 1 almost all top 15 abundant chocl dbps were correlated with over 10 cho features table s5 and 169 in total in table 1 this observation explain abundance of dbps after chlorination as it can potentially be formed via reaction of chlorine to many precursors putative precursors were found to have higher molecular weight more unsaturated higher dbe o c and less oxidized lower cos compared to all cho features table 1 these preferential reactions of chlorine to more unsaturated precursors more carbon double bonds consistent with previous reports on electrophilic substitution and addition reactions deborde and von gunten 2008 wenk et al 2013 in addition preferential reaction to less oxidized compounds lower cos was previously reported zhang et al 2012 and consistent with thermodynamic on preferential oxidation to less oxidized molecules to gain more energy hence this approach would be one of possible method to investigate dbp precursors as cho features with less oxidized characters could be removed by both gacs fig 5 this would minimize formation of chocl dbps in some extent on day 60 many cho and chocl features had increased or newly formed from both gacs while only a small number of cho and chocl features had decreased by both gacs on day 60 fig 4 and fig s11a as only lower doc removals were observed 1 21 and 0 17 mgc l 1 for ccac and coac respectively this small number of decreased features and high numbers of increased and newly formed features by both gacs indicates biodegradation from higher molecular weight molecules to lower molecular weight molecules with less mineralization the organic matter remaining after the gacs also act as precursors of dbps after chlorination as over 105 chocl dbp features were commonly found in the chlorinated influent and the chlorinated samples after treatment by both gacs fig 8c this is consistent with thmfp as only a small decrease was found in the sample pre treated by ccac and no change was found for the sample pre treated by coac fig 7 pretreatments by both gacs also resulted in the formation of some unique chocl dbp features fig 8c and this might be due to the release of doc background or the remnants of different precursors from the ac treatments comparing the chocl dbp features found in the chlorinated samples after the ac treatments on day 10 and day 60 around 14 chocl dbp features were commonly found in all the sample indicating that its precursors are refractory to ac treatments fig 8d only a small number of chocl dbps were found after treatment by ccac on day 10 while coac was already less efficient in doc removal and dbp minimization on day 10 3 6 implications for further study this study investigated the removal of molecular doc and changes in dbp formations in water samples pre treated by different types of gacs in the initial stage and after a biofilm developed orbitrap ms implies its possibility to detect doc released from adsorbents during operation further studies are needed to investigate the formation of dbps with molecular organic matter released from gacs as different types of organic matter might be released at different operation times long term studies on doc background released from various adsorbent materials would provide very useful information for proper application of adsorbents in water treatment in addition it would be essential to incorporate the formation of dbps and the identification of organic precursors released during microbial activities with advanced microbial community analysis to understand the roles of microorganisms and its precursor removal with advanced unknown screening analysis as microbial communities might vary with different operation times long term monitoring is needed with more frequent sampling to observe changes in ac treatments by both adsorption and biodegradation more frequent sampling would also provide more detail on existence of and insight into unknown dbps furthermore incorporating unknown screening analysis to characterize dbps minimization of adsorption and biodegradation and toxicity evaluation han et al 2021 wawryk et al 2021 would provide more insight into minimization of precursors and toxicity of dbps in addition statistical analysis such as rank correlation would provide more insight into the removal of precursors by microbes unknown screening analysis is a promising tool for dom mechanisms and this method could be applied to characterize dom removals by other types of or modified gacs to find the best modification conditions for molecular dom or precursor removal 4 conclusions this research investigated the efficiencies of pilot scale coal and coconut shell based granular activated carbon filtrations coac and ccac respectively for the minimization of trihalomethanes and unknown disinfection by products dbps detected by unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry the adsorption of dissolved organic matter dom by ccac and coac were fitted with pseudo second order models with initial rates of adsorption of 0 005 mg g 1 min 1 and 0 022 mg g 1min 1 respectively the surface area of the coac was 842 45 m2 g 1 which is higher than the ccac surface area 633 19 m2 g 1 coac was found to be effective for adsorption only for 10 days while ccac could maintain its effectiveness for around 30 days c h and o containing compounds cho features with less oxidized compounds low carbon oxidation state cos were easily removed within a short contact time with ac while more oxidized compounds needed more contact time to be removed after the biofilm developed many cho features increased indicating the formation of microbial products chlorination resulted in a decrease in many cho and cho with cl atom chocl features and the formation of chocl dbps more than cho dbps features on day 10 ccac was effective in minimizing the formation of both chocl dbps and trihalomethanes correlation analysis indicated less oxidized and more unsaturated characters of dbp precursors in contrast the samples passing through the gacs on day 60 had formed more chocl dbps than the chlorinated influent while only ccac could slightly decrease the formation of trihalomethanes credit authorship

16296,rainwater dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle and evolution of organic matter in the land atmosphere interface to better understand their sources and molecular composition in the atmosphere rainwater samples were collected at six different locations along the yangtze river basin based on the application of a combined approach including excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms various sources terrestrial anthropogenic and autochthonous sources of rainwater dom were revealed results show that the derivatives of biogenic volatile organic compounds were widely distributed and contributed to rainwater dom along the yangtze river basin in the up river city batang rainwater dom was affected by the long range atmospheric transport due to the indian summer monsoon lijiang a city on the southeastern edge of tibetan plateau was related to strong local biomass burning the industrial cities of panzhihua and luzhou showed large differences in organic composition due to distinct industrial types fuling a district in chongqing municipality was significantly contributed by aged organics from biomass burning while rainwater dom in shanghai a coastal megacity contained a high fraction of sea spray organics further more than 70 of rainwater dom molecules are associated with 36 typical transformation mechanisms during rainwater scavenging processes e g oxidation reactions dealkylation and decarboxylation our study demonstrates that local natural and anthropogenic emissions and climatic conditions strongly shaped the chemodiversity and possible precursor product pairs of rainwater dom along the yangtze river basin which helps to better understand the biogeochemical cycles of organic matter in a large scale watershed under the influence of human activities image graphical abstract keywords rainwater dissolved organic matter excitation emission matrix fluorescence fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry yangtze river basin 1 introduction organic matter the complicated chemical mixture in the atmosphere affects local and regional climate air quality and ecosystem health the ultimate fate of atmospheric organic carbon oc is the inorganic forms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide hallquist et al 2009 or it is removed from the atmosphere through wet and dry deposition and finally landed in the landscape goldstein and galbally 2007 precipitation is an efficient removal mechanism for atmospheric organic matter in which most of the carbon is organic 76 96 and can be higher in concentration than inorganic species such as nitric and sulfuric acids willey et al 2000 global scale models suggest that about 60 of oc deposition is wet deposition every year kanakidou et al 2012 rain is the most important form of wet deposition dissolved organic matter dom in rainwater plays a nonnegligible role in eco environment and climate change and it has a great impact on the albedo of clouds and atmospheric photochemical processes zhao et al 2019 among them the properties of cloud droplets aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei are highly dependent on the composition and structure of dom altieri et al 2009 therefore characterization at the molecular level is the key to understand and elucidate the changing behaviors of dom during wet deposition process however what is less well known is that the composition source and change pattern of rainwater dom because of its extensive complexity and heterogeneity approximately 50 of rainwater dom is considered uncharacterized at the levels of neither compound class nor individual compound willey et al 2000 previous studies have shown that rainwater dom concentrations and composition are closely related to air mass sources rainfall and anthropogenic activities altieri et al 2009 bao et al 2018b lee et al 2019 mead et al 2015 mead et al 2013 yang et al 2019 for example a study of european rainwater by santos found that more chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom was found in summer and autumn than in other seasons rainwater related to terrestrial air masses presented higher levels of cdom contents than those associated with marine air masses emphasizing the influence of anthropogenic sources santos et al 2013 it is significant that if the temporal and spatial variability of rainwater dom is remarkable then it will naturally have different ecological impacts on the receiving surface environment however how these factors influence the molecular composition of rainwater dom remains unknown detailed characterization the quality and dynamics of rainwater dom at a molecular level is hindered primarily by its chemical complexity which is combined with huge numbers of organic species for chemical characterization of such complex substances ultra high resolution mass spectrometry can be used in combination with spectroscopic analysis shi et al 2021 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a commonly used analytical method to study the optical and structural properties of light absorption and fluorescent chromophores of complex organic matters chen et al 2016 we can use fluorescence spectroscopy to quickly concisely and inexpensively track the fluorescence chromophores of sample dom and gain preliminary insight into the interesting variation pattern of dom found in the sample however it can only provide an ambiguous labeling of the chemical composition of dom rosario ortiz and korak 2017 ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has recently been proved to be the only effective way to obtain more complementary characterization in complex mixtures including natural dom at the molecular level nebbioso and piccolo 2013 and has been successfully applied to various environmental samples bao et al 2017 bianco et al 2018 cook et al 2017 lee et al 2019 mcdonough et al 2020 xie et al 2021 it provides a wealth of qualitative chemical information but the method is limited in its ability to systematically illuminate the main drivers leading to the observed dynamics wunsch et al 2018 experience has shown that considerable analytical progress is achieved when the two complementary datasets are analyzed jointly acar et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 the changes in environmental conditions have a significant impact on the composition of dom wagner et al 2015 until now the optical and molecular compositional characteristics of dom which determine its reactivity and destination have rarely been studied and none in large scale river basin areas rainwater for the current study the yangtze river basin a typical large scale watershed in southern china was selected to reveal optical characteristics and molecular information to better understand the molecular composition and diversity of rainwater dom that are related to a large scale landscapes and anthropogenic factors which contribute to evaluate the diversity of dom molecules in rainwater at a large catchment scale and to investigate the potential driving factors of their chemodiversity 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and rainwater sampling we conducted rainwater sampling along the yangtze river basin in the summer of 2019 six representative rainwater samples were collected along the yangtze river batang lijiang panzhihua luzhou fuling and shanghai detailed sampling information is presented in the supporting information and table s1 in brief a batang is located on the southeastern edge of the tibetan plateau and is influenced by the indian monsoon b lijiang is located at the junction of the yunnan guizhou plateau and the tibetan plateau it is one of the largest cities in the upper reaches of the yangtze river c panzhihua is a typical mining city in southwest china coal mine is the main energy source for this city d luzhou is a megacity locating in the southern margin of the sichuan basin it has a well developed wine making industry and is an important national natural gas chemical industry base it is also the largest urea production base in asia e fuling is in the middle of chongqing city and the hinterland of the three gorges reservoir area it has a humid subtropical monsoon climate and f shanghai is the economic center with the largest population in china which is located at the estuary of the yangtze river the rainwater sampling site in shanghai is located approximately 30 km away from the western pacific ocean all rainwater and blank samples were filtered through pre combusted glass fiber filters whatman gff baked for 4 h at 450 c then washed with millipore q water the concentration of doc was acquired using a toc analyzer 1030 w 1088 oi analytical us fluorescence spectra were measured simultaneously using a uv visible fluorometer and eem spectrofluorometer aqualog horiba japan blank samples were used to deduct possible contamination caused by field sampling and laboratory processes uv vis absorption spectra were measured at wavelengths of 240 600 nm at 2 nm intervals and were the same for the eem excitation wavelength λex the integration time was 0 5 s in addition the fluorescence index fi was used to identify the relative contribution of terrestrial and microbial sources in the sample to the dom pool which was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at 370 nm 470 nm excitation emission by the value of 370 nm 520 nm chen et al 2016 2 2 ft icr ms analysis filtered rainwater samples were extracted using a solid phase extraction cartridge 200 mg oasis hlb 6cc waters u s the extracts were analyzed with a 7 0 t superconducting magnet bruker solarix ft icr ms solarix 2xr bruker germany equipped with an electrospray ionization source esi in the negative ion mode prepared samples were continuously infused into the unit at a flow rate of accurately 150 µl h 1 with a capillary voltage of 5000 v the spectra mass limits were held at mass to charge m z values of 150 and 1000 respectively 256 scans were averaged per spectrum with 4 m transient of data more detailed information of extraction procedure and instrument parameters are available in previous studies su et al 2021 and supporting information 2 3 molecular formula assignment after the acquisition of ft icr ms measurements the raw datasets were internally recalibrated using the dataanalysis ver 5 0 bruker daltonics the composer sierra analytics usa software was used to assign the elemental compositions for all recalibrated peaks with a signal to noise ratio s n 4 using a mass allowance of 1 0 ppm the molecular formula limits were set to atom numbers of 12c 1 50 1h 1 100 16o 1 30 14n 0 2 and 32s 0 2 the isotopomers were not considered in the present study after calculation peaks in blank samples with an average s n 20 were excluded from the final list for all samples bao et al 2017 for molecular formulas cchhoonnss several selected indices are available in supporting information a van krevelen vk diagram can be used to visualize the chemical composition and structure of molecules by using elemental ratios such as h c ratio and o c ratio kim et al 2004 correspondingly there are seven types of compounds in natural dom a lipids like b aliphatic peptides like c carbohydrates like d unsaturated hydrocarbons e carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams like structures f aromatic structures and g highly oxygenated compounds hoc bianco et al 2018 detailed classification range is present in the table s2 3 results 3 1 general molecular characterization and fluorescence properties of rainwater dom the reconstructed mass spectra of chemical formulas assigned to all samples after deducting the blank are present in figure s1 the composition and distribution of organic species in rainwater among different locations along the yangtze river basin in china are closely related to their sources and formation mechanisms fig 1 and fig 2 we found that the chemodiversity of rainwater dom shows certain commonalities and uniqueness the number of cho and chon molecular formulas were the dominant species in all samples which were between 1745 and 3163 24 5 56 7 and 1441 2995 23 4 47 7 respectively table s4 and figure s2 s containing formulas particularly chos also represented a nonnegligible constitution of the assigned total molecular formulas 280 1596 molecular formulas like the number distribution the total abundances of cho and chon compounds accounted for 29 0 81 0 and 7 6 33 5 respectively figure s2 although the ranges of mean o c and h c ratios in this study were comparable with previous studies on wet precipitation bianco et al 2018 mead et al 2015 mead et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 it can be seen that the distribution of samples in the vk diagram was highly variable from region to region fig 1 and table s10 which may be related to the complex sources of air masses and the influence of local aerosols during the precipitation events the reasons for this variability will be investigated in detail below the fluorescence intensity of the rainwater samples also showed great variability fig 3a this result indicates that the chemical composition of the chromophoric water soluble organics varies depending on the sampling location three typical peaks were observed as hulis 1 246 314 450 hulis 2 242 310 400 and plom 278 320 the chromophore fractions of hulis 1 and 2 were associated with highly and hypoxic structured humic like fractions respectively while plom as protein like substances chen et al 2016 of these hulis 1 is ubiquitous in water soluble chromophores of different environments but is more frequently found in terrestrial waters and aerosols chen et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 wu et al 2019 hulis 1 is more likely to be produced by the breakdown of macromolecules through photodegradation wu et al 2019 moreover it may also be affected by dust sources chen et al 2020 hulis 2 is mainly of terrestrial origin and partly from fresh industrial and combustion sources yan and kim 2017 plom may be phenolic or amino acid substances which are the least oxidized it can be clearly found that luzhou shows a significant increase in protein like fluorescence compared to other regions together with the increase in the fluorescence intensity of humic like substances luzhou is a typical industrial city where pollutants from anthropogenic activities can significantly increase the fluorescence intensity of rainwater on the one hand luzhou has a well developed brewing industry that would use a large number of microorganisms for industrial fermentation production aromatic amino acids can be produced by microbial fermentation which in turn exhibits high protein like fluorescence large amounts of volatile and semi volatile substances were released into the atmosphere added from microbial fermentation kroll et al 2011 this may be one of the reasons for the significantly higher plom peak on the other hand it has been shown that the fluorescence of naphthalene and phenolic compounds would contribute to the protein like peak sun et al 2017 in the case of urban precipitation may also be the main source of contribution to the plom peak due to their presence in diesel exhaust aerosols panzhihua exhibited a strong hulis 2 fluorescence intensity which may be related to the local industrial sources lijiang and fuling showed stronger and weaker fluorescence intensity of hulis 2 respectively which may be influenced by different degrees of biomass burning the eem spectrum of shanghai showed strong hulis 1 and hulis 2 characteristics similar to coastal aerosols wu et al 2020 and rainwater yang et al 2019 it may be related to its dissolved secondary organic aerosol soa zhao et al 2013 3 2 characterization of regional variations in molecular composition figure s4a presents an intersection venn diagram of the molecular formulas in the rainwater dom the 2055 identical molecular formulas in the overlapping area among the total 13 488 assigned formulas cho species 1147 contribute the most significant proportion of common formulas followed by chon 787 chos 114 and chons 7 the existence of these common molecular formulas indicates similar sources of rainwater dom in different regions as shown in figure s4b common formulas are widely distributed throughout the vk diagram revealing the ubiquity of some components in rainwater dom cho compounds were the most abundant among common species characterized by the o c ratios of 0 67 and h c ratios from 0 4 to 2 0 the distribution of chon compounds was similar to that of cho but it was relatively more concentrated the chon compounds were divided into 17 subclasses according to their heteroatom numbers including oxn1 o2n1 o12n1 and oxn2 o3n2 o8n2 groups figure s5 it should be noted that some oxn2 compounds might be the dimers of oxn1 the major subgroup chon was oxn1 which increased dramatically from four o atoms o4 with a large distribution ranging from o4n1 to o9n1 almost all the oxn1 subgroups exhibited oxygen to nitrogen ratios o n of 3 indicating the presence of nitro compounds no2 and or organic nitrates no3 functional groups in these compounds zhao et al 2013 chos compounds were in the range of h c 1 0 and relatively moderate o c ratios their average h c ratios were the highest among all the common compound classifications indicating the lowest unsaturation of these sulfur containing compounds more than 92 of them have an o s ratio 4 and are identified as organosulfates peng et al 2012 as for the unique molecular formulas we observed some interesting results along the yangtze river up to downstream the unique molecular formulas in batang were mainly cho compounds followed by chon compounds fig 4a the cho compounds were well divided into two classes representing different sources in the vk diagram one is crams like compounds derived from biogenic sources the class1cho and the other is aliphatic peptides like compounds the class2cho unlike in batang chon compounds accounted for the majority of the unique molecular formulas in lijiang almost all these compounds had relatively higher h c ratios 1 0 and lower o c ratios 0 5 indicating relatively higher degree of saturation and lower oxidation state the compounds in fuling were comparable with those in lijiang with slightly lower h c and higher o c indicating that they had undergone more oxidation processes the unique molecular formulas of panzhihua were mainly cho chon and chos compounds while the chons compounds were dominant in luzhou in luzhou more than 91 of the chons compounds had more than seven oxygen atoms thus they are classified as nitrooxy organosulfates with multiple oxygen containing functional groups bianco et al 2019 song et al 2018 mainly distributed in the aliphatic peptides like 46 9 of total unique number classes followed by crams like 21 9 and carbohydrates like 12 0 classes shanghai is the largest coastal city in china its unique molecular formulas in rainwater dom were distributed in crams like aliphatic peptides like lipids like and unsaturated hydrocarbons categories based on this such special molecular tracers can be used to determine the impact of human activities and climate change on rainwater dom in different geographical landscapes 4 discussions 4 1 correlation between molecular composition and optical properties we combine fluorescence spectroscopy with mass spectrometry data to provide new insight into the different sources and chemical properties of the samples fi for example can characterize the sensitivity of humic sources and aromaticity in organic matter with fi less than 1 4 samples are dominated by exogenous terrestrial inputs and above 1 9 mainly autogenous biogenic features lavonen et al 2015 the distribution of molecules in the vk diagram can likewise explain the structure and origin of compounds here fi 1 4 in panzhihua corresponds to terrestrial origin and higher aromaticity luzhou had the largest fi value indicating strong microbial activity moreover we correlated the fi values with the percentage of aromatic intensity in ft icr ms data fig 2b and table s11 and found that the fi values were somewhat negatively correlated with the aromaticity of dissolved organic matter fig 3c which was similar to the results of previous studies mcknight et al 2001 it is worth noting that the distribution of molecular formulae in the vk diagram further supports the conclusion of eems with the highest proportion of aliphatic peptide like groups in luzhou compared to other regions again indicating the influence of local anthropogenic factors bianco et al 2018 thus the mass spectrometry can provide better information than the fluorescence properties when their differences among different regions were minor 4 2 chemodiversity of rainwater dom 4 2 1 common sources of rainwater dom the results in the previous section illustrate that the common compounds in this study are similar to the soa derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds bvocs kourtchev et al 2015 indicating that biogenic soa is one of the main sources of rainwater dom among different geographical locations along the yangtze river the formulas were denoted in table s6 and these compounds were probably derived from aqueous photooxidation reactions nguyen et al 2012 renard et al 2015 yu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 based on laboratory studies the formulas c10h14o5 and c10h14o6 represent typical α pinene oxidation products aljawhary et al 2015 the formulas c7h10o4 c7h12o4 c9h12o5 c14h24o8 and c15h24o9 are the derivatives of isoprene renard et al 2015 in addition numerous similar cho formulas identified in this study such as methoxyphenols limonene and diterpenoid derivatives are consistent with those found in wildfire influenced cloud water and biomass combustion influenced aerosol samples yu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 the common chon1 formulas in this work are also an important part of soa they are generated from peroxy radicals ro2 by oxidizing vocs and then react with no to form organic nitrates bianco et al 2019 additionally common molecular formulas might contain chon2 compounds with reduced nitrogen indicating that the oxidation degree of chon1 compounds is higher than other subgroups moreover the presence of these compounds might be related to the dissolution of chno reduced nitrogen in aerosols or to the liquid phase reactivity of ammonia gasses released by agricultural activities in the yangtze river basin bianco et al 2019 as for organosulfates studies have suggested that organosulfates are the oxidation products of gaseous precursors ervens et al 2011 and could be generated by oxidizing the volatile and water soluble oxidation products of the parent vocs dissolved in fog cloud water and performing aqueous phase oxidation they are widely distributed in the environmental and had also been identified in chamber studies of biological sources e g monoterpenes isoprene and sesquiterpenes and anthropogenic vocs oxidation products iinuma et al 2007 noziere et al 2010 xie et al 2021 in this study some hydrolysates or precursors were identified which were previously detected in chamber experiments and cloud water of biological influences table s7 furthermore s tao et al 2014 found organosulfates with c chain length less than 16 are generally derived from bvocs while organosulfates produced by anthropogenic emissions such as coal fuels are generally long aliphatic chain organosulfates with 17 28 c chain lengths figure s6 shows the c chain length and number of molecules of shared organosulfates more than 60 of the compounds have a c chain length of less than 16 indicating that bvocs are the main common precursors of organosulfates in the yangtze river rainwater dom 4 2 2 molecular composition variability of rainwater dom in addition to the identical molecular formulas unique molecular components are regionally different figs 4 indicating that rainwater in large scale landscapes contains multifarious proportions of organic matter from diverse sources and or evolution mechanisms the exclusive particularity of rainwater in each area may be strongly affected by local natural and anthropogenic emissions and climatic conditions batang is located on the southeastern edge of the tibetan plateau previous studies have shown that during the summer monsoon season bvocs could be transported from the lower elevations of subtropical india forming biogenic secondary organic aerosols over the tibetan plateau cong et al 2015 according to the online measurement of the nepal s pyramid climate observatory nco p from 2006 to 2008 the highest ozone concentration was 61 9 ppbv in the tibetan plateau during the pre monsoon period more ozone oxidized products of bvocs would be formed cristofanelli et al 2010 in addition fresh or aged biomass burning organic aerosols bboa accounted for a significant portion of organic aerosols measured by an aerosol mass spectrometer ams in the tibetan plateau zheng et al 2017 the class1cho compounds in this study have higher o c and lower h c ratios indicating that they underwent more oxidation and dehydration processes and their distribution was similar to the aged bboa wang et al 2019 which was also affected by the south asian monsoon therefore the class1cho compounds might be mainly from bboa via long range transport from south asia moreover the osc of the class1cho compounds is between 0 5 and 1 fig 4g indicating that they had undergone more oxidation processes but it is worth noting that their carbon chains were longer and did not fall in the shadow of fresh and aged secondary aerosols kroll et al 2011 liquid phase reactions are more likely to occur in rainwater than in aerosols therefore unique cho compounds might be dimers trimers and polymers formed through reactions in the cloud class2cho compounds are peptides like formulas that may derive from microorganisms bianco et al 2018 such as phytoplankton or might be affected by photochemical reactions some organic n containing compounds from fresh biomass combustion including lipids like crams like and aromatic structures were also found in the rainwater sample in batang indicating that this region was not only affected by pollutants transported over long distances but also affected by local biomass burning emissions such as stalks firewood and cow dung fleming et al 2018 the osc values of the chon compounds also confirm it lijiang rainwater dom exhibited strong local biomass burning effects mace et al 2003 reported that the majority of organonitrates in the atmosphere are derived from biomass burning organic aerosols bboa organonitrates have also been widely reported in aerosols rainwater and fog that are affected by bio combustion emissions wang et al 2019 distinguished fresh and aged bboa at the molecular level by the vk diagram compared with aged bboa fresh bboa with shorter transport processes and less oxidation has a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere in this study all the unique organonitrates in lijiang are within the range of fresh bboa lijiang is located in a high altitude area where the smoldering combustion of biofuels might be the main reason for the production of organic nitrates an et al 2019 moreover some homologous series of compounds derived from biomass burning were also found in our study table s8 therefore chon compounds may be associated with local intense bio combustion we also used osc to estimate the oxidation processes of compounds most compounds with long carbon chains were found osc ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 fig 4h it is worth noting that unique chon compounds in lijiang are in the category of the hoa and bboa which were related to primary particulate matter directly emitted into the atmosphere kroll et al 2011 the unique molecular formula of fuling differs from that of lijiang their distributions in the vk diagram were mostly in the aged bboa region wang et al 2019 we also observed some molecular tracers of aged bboa from c6 to c9 table s9 these compounds might be derived from the dissolution of aged organic aerosols they can also be produced by chemical reactions in cloud droplets in which water soluble volatile and semi volatile organic compounds react to produce highly oxidized compounds and molecular tracers furthermore high relative humidity 80 promotes the formation of soa through liquid phase reaction bianco et al 2019 aerosol particles condense into cloud droplets through supersaturated water vapor and are activated into condensation nuclei some gaseous precursors so2 no2 etc in the atmosphere can be rapidly adsorbed into cloud droplets to produce chos compounds and eventually form raindrops to fall to the ground surface unlike batang and lijiang fuling also contains a small amount of chos compounds in its unique formula the first two areas have less anthropogenic pollution and low so2 emissions so chos is missing from the unique compounds while the remaining cities are subject to different types of anthropogenic pollution and the location of chos differs in each area which means that the presence of so2 significantly affects the composition of rainwater in the watershed and the different degree of aging predicts different precursors in addition osc of dom in fuling was between 0 5 and 1 fig 4k suggesting that molecules were associated with semi volatile and low volatile oxidized organic aerosols sv ooa and lv ooa and were produced through multi step oxidation reactions kroll et al 2011 compared with other sampling sites panzhihua and luzhou are typical industrial cities in the yangtze river basin where anthropogenic activities are significant however their industrial types are quite different the distribution of panzhihua s unique molecules in the vk diagram was also observed in aerosols impacted by coal burning and vehicle emissions song et al 2018 j tang et al 2020 most of the unique molecular formulas had c lengths of more than 17 and the average dbe of panzhihua 9 8 were higher than those in luzhou 5 6 figure s7 indicating that the unique compounds in both places were mainly from anthropogenic emissions rather coal combustion produces high molecular weight compounds with aromatic structures there were most aromatic compounds in the unique molecular formulas including reduced n compounds and condensed organosulfur formulas previously detected from anthropogenic emissions such as diesel and coal combustion j tang et al 2020 in panzhihua among the six sampling sites in addition there were also a considerable amount of crams like compounds possibly derived from terrestrial sources such as soil organic matter wozniak et al 2015 they might be caused by the smoke and dust produced in the process of mining development similar molecular characteristics have been observed in dust aerosols bao et al 2018a wozniak et al 2015 in luzhou nitrooxy organosulfates are derived from biogenic and anthropogenic vocs and their formation mechanisms require acidic conditions caused by anthropogenic emissions of so2 and nox as mentioned above liquor manufacturing the first pillar industry in luzhou releases abundant vocs during the production process and a certain amount of so2 and nox were inevitably be emitted in other industrial production processes the unique chons species in luzhou were aliphatic peptides like 46 9 of total unique number classes followed by crams like 21 9 and carbohydrates like 12 0 classes such a distribution of chons species was consistent with those reported in vehicle emissions products x j tao et al 2014 aliphatic peptides like nitrooxy oss have relatively high h c ratios and low dbe values indicating high degree of saturation and long carbon lengths and they might be formed by the oxidation of precursors long chain alkanes from vehicle exhaust s tao et al 2014 the unique molecular formulas of shanghai showed the influence of marine sources the peptide like compounds with h c ratios of 1 5 2 0 include functionalized amino acid residues peptide and protein fragments which were mainly attributed to sea spray based biological sources for example wozniak et al 2015 detected aliphatic peptides like compounds in primary marine aerosol samples collected in the north atlantic ocean considered that they were derived from sea spray some researchers speculated that they might be associated with phospholipid compounds in biological cell membranes bao et al 2018a most compounds had an osc value of less than 0 5 fig 4l indicating that primary particulate matters might directly emit into atmosphere along with the rupture of biological cell membranes kroll et al 2011 unsaturated hydrocarbons were mainly composed of chos and cho compounds which might be derived from the primary product of coastal anthropogenic emissions such as fossil fuel combustion song et al 2018 or during the ocean atmosphere transfer process the depletion of o was a result of that the explosion of ocean droplets produces compounds with few o atoms which were also found in coastal aerosols and coastal rainwater bao et al 2018a mead et al 2013 4 3 possible precursor product pairs the molecular composition of rainwater dom is very complex many transformation reactions occur during the rainwater scavenging process to explore the potential precursor product pairs at a molecular level 36 types of general transformation reactions of atmospheric organic compounds are summarized in fig 5 it is mainly divided into demethylation oxygenation decarboxylation amino nitro sulfur and other reactions which are commonly encountered in free radical oxidation and photochemical transformations yeh and ziemann 2014 herrmann et al 2010 otto et al 2017 riva et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 it is worth noting that the changing trends of the reaction mechanism of rainwater in different regions are similar fig 5a which indicates that the full spectrum scanning and high resolution characteristics of ft icr ms can fully demonstrate the transformation principle of dom in rainwater in general oxidation reactions dealkylation and decarboxylation are relatively common for conversion processes in rainwater systems moreover the number of compounds involved in the same reaction increased or decreased due to the different characteristics of different regions suggesting the chemodiversity of rainwater dom the number of heteroatom precursor product pairs are closely related to local anthropogenic disturbances for example in biomass burning events a large amount of free glycine was degraded and the amino nitrogen is lost through the cn cracking of glycine zhu et al 2020 therefore the amino reaction that chon compounds participate in reflects the contribution of the local biomass burning in such a complex reaction system each precursor and product can participate in multiple reactions comparing the compounds that meet this reaction with the total number of compounds that would theoretically participate in this reaction in this area it was found that in each reaction process more than 70 of the compounds follow this transformation mechanism fig 5b 5 conclusions the yangtze river is the longest river in asia serving more than one third of china s population this study provides rainwater dom with a great variability and chemodiversity along the yangtze river basin which was interpreted by a combination of optical and molecular techniques the source of rainwater dom is complicated and the unique variability of dom molecular composition may be driven by several key factors such as climate variables landscapes and human activities our research emphasizes that the complicated molecular composition of rainwater dom responds more obviously to local anthropogenic disturbances so it warrants future studies to comprehensively investigate organic matter in rainwater aerosols soils lakes and rivers to obtain an integrated overview of the biogeochemical cycles of organics in the yangtze river basin furthermore we provide 36 types of molecular level transformation reactions during the rainwater scavenging process more than 70 of the molecules in rainwater dom follow this transformation mechanism which may be helpful to better understand the sources and scavenging mechanisms of organics in the atmosphere along the yangtze river basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16296,rainwater dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycle and evolution of organic matter in the land atmosphere interface to better understand their sources and molecular composition in the atmosphere rainwater samples were collected at six different locations along the yangtze river basin based on the application of a combined approach including excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms various sources terrestrial anthropogenic and autochthonous sources of rainwater dom were revealed results show that the derivatives of biogenic volatile organic compounds were widely distributed and contributed to rainwater dom along the yangtze river basin in the up river city batang rainwater dom was affected by the long range atmospheric transport due to the indian summer monsoon lijiang a city on the southeastern edge of tibetan plateau was related to strong local biomass burning the industrial cities of panzhihua and luzhou showed large differences in organic composition due to distinct industrial types fuling a district in chongqing municipality was significantly contributed by aged organics from biomass burning while rainwater dom in shanghai a coastal megacity contained a high fraction of sea spray organics further more than 70 of rainwater dom molecules are associated with 36 typical transformation mechanisms during rainwater scavenging processes e g oxidation reactions dealkylation and decarboxylation our study demonstrates that local natural and anthropogenic emissions and climatic conditions strongly shaped the chemodiversity and possible precursor product pairs of rainwater dom along the yangtze river basin which helps to better understand the biogeochemical cycles of organic matter in a large scale watershed under the influence of human activities image graphical abstract keywords rainwater dissolved organic matter excitation emission matrix fluorescence fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry yangtze river basin 1 introduction organic matter the complicated chemical mixture in the atmosphere affects local and regional climate air quality and ecosystem health the ultimate fate of atmospheric organic carbon oc is the inorganic forms of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide hallquist et al 2009 or it is removed from the atmosphere through wet and dry deposition and finally landed in the landscape goldstein and galbally 2007 precipitation is an efficient removal mechanism for atmospheric organic matter in which most of the carbon is organic 76 96 and can be higher in concentration than inorganic species such as nitric and sulfuric acids willey et al 2000 global scale models suggest that about 60 of oc deposition is wet deposition every year kanakidou et al 2012 rain is the most important form of wet deposition dissolved organic matter dom in rainwater plays a nonnegligible role in eco environment and climate change and it has a great impact on the albedo of clouds and atmospheric photochemical processes zhao et al 2019 among them the properties of cloud droplets aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei are highly dependent on the composition and structure of dom altieri et al 2009 therefore characterization at the molecular level is the key to understand and elucidate the changing behaviors of dom during wet deposition process however what is less well known is that the composition source and change pattern of rainwater dom because of its extensive complexity and heterogeneity approximately 50 of rainwater dom is considered uncharacterized at the levels of neither compound class nor individual compound willey et al 2000 previous studies have shown that rainwater dom concentrations and composition are closely related to air mass sources rainfall and anthropogenic activities altieri et al 2009 bao et al 2018b lee et al 2019 mead et al 2015 mead et al 2013 yang et al 2019 for example a study of european rainwater by santos found that more chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom was found in summer and autumn than in other seasons rainwater related to terrestrial air masses presented higher levels of cdom contents than those associated with marine air masses emphasizing the influence of anthropogenic sources santos et al 2013 it is significant that if the temporal and spatial variability of rainwater dom is remarkable then it will naturally have different ecological impacts on the receiving surface environment however how these factors influence the molecular composition of rainwater dom remains unknown detailed characterization the quality and dynamics of rainwater dom at a molecular level is hindered primarily by its chemical complexity which is combined with huge numbers of organic species for chemical characterization of such complex substances ultra high resolution mass spectrometry can be used in combination with spectroscopic analysis shi et al 2021 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy is a commonly used analytical method to study the optical and structural properties of light absorption and fluorescent chromophores of complex organic matters chen et al 2016 we can use fluorescence spectroscopy to quickly concisely and inexpensively track the fluorescence chromophores of sample dom and gain preliminary insight into the interesting variation pattern of dom found in the sample however it can only provide an ambiguous labeling of the chemical composition of dom rosario ortiz and korak 2017 ultrahigh resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has recently been proved to be the only effective way to obtain more complementary characterization in complex mixtures including natural dom at the molecular level nebbioso and piccolo 2013 and has been successfully applied to various environmental samples bao et al 2017 bianco et al 2018 cook et al 2017 lee et al 2019 mcdonough et al 2020 xie et al 2021 it provides a wealth of qualitative chemical information but the method is limited in its ability to systematically illuminate the main drivers leading to the observed dynamics wunsch et al 2018 experience has shown that considerable analytical progress is achieved when the two complementary datasets are analyzed jointly acar et al 2017 wunsch et al 2018 the changes in environmental conditions have a significant impact on the composition of dom wagner et al 2015 until now the optical and molecular compositional characteristics of dom which determine its reactivity and destination have rarely been studied and none in large scale river basin areas rainwater for the current study the yangtze river basin a typical large scale watershed in southern china was selected to reveal optical characteristics and molecular information to better understand the molecular composition and diversity of rainwater dom that are related to a large scale landscapes and anthropogenic factors which contribute to evaluate the diversity of dom molecules in rainwater at a large catchment scale and to investigate the potential driving factors of their chemodiversity 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and rainwater sampling we conducted rainwater sampling along the yangtze river basin in the summer of 2019 six representative rainwater samples were collected along the yangtze river batang lijiang panzhihua luzhou fuling and shanghai detailed sampling information is presented in the supporting information and table s1 in brief a batang is located on the southeastern edge of the tibetan plateau and is influenced by the indian monsoon b lijiang is located at the junction of the yunnan guizhou plateau and the tibetan plateau it is one of the largest cities in the upper reaches of the yangtze river c panzhihua is a typical mining city in southwest china coal mine is the main energy source for this city d luzhou is a megacity locating in the southern margin of the sichuan basin it has a well developed wine making industry and is an important national natural gas chemical industry base it is also the largest urea production base in asia e fuling is in the middle of chongqing city and the hinterland of the three gorges reservoir area it has a humid subtropical monsoon climate and f shanghai is the economic center with the largest population in china which is located at the estuary of the yangtze river the rainwater sampling site in shanghai is located approximately 30 km away from the western pacific ocean all rainwater and blank samples were filtered through pre combusted glass fiber filters whatman gff baked for 4 h at 450 c then washed with millipore q water the concentration of doc was acquired using a toc analyzer 1030 w 1088 oi analytical us fluorescence spectra were measured simultaneously using a uv visible fluorometer and eem spectrofluorometer aqualog horiba japan blank samples were used to deduct possible contamination caused by field sampling and laboratory processes uv vis absorption spectra were measured at wavelengths of 240 600 nm at 2 nm intervals and were the same for the eem excitation wavelength λex the integration time was 0 5 s in addition the fluorescence index fi was used to identify the relative contribution of terrestrial and microbial sources in the sample to the dom pool which was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at 370 nm 470 nm excitation emission by the value of 370 nm 520 nm chen et al 2016 2 2 ft icr ms analysis filtered rainwater samples were extracted using a solid phase extraction cartridge 200 mg oasis hlb 6cc waters u s the extracts were analyzed with a 7 0 t superconducting magnet bruker solarix ft icr ms solarix 2xr bruker germany equipped with an electrospray ionization source esi in the negative ion mode prepared samples were continuously infused into the unit at a flow rate of accurately 150 µl h 1 with a capillary voltage of 5000 v the spectra mass limits were held at mass to charge m z values of 150 and 1000 respectively 256 scans were averaged per spectrum with 4 m transient of data more detailed information of extraction procedure and instrument parameters are available in previous studies su et al 2021 and supporting information 2 3 molecular formula assignment after the acquisition of ft icr ms measurements the raw datasets were internally recalibrated using the dataanalysis ver 5 0 bruker daltonics the composer sierra analytics usa software was used to assign the elemental compositions for all recalibrated peaks with a signal to noise ratio s n 4 using a mass allowance of 1 0 ppm the molecular formula limits were set to atom numbers of 12c 1 50 1h 1 100 16o 1 30 14n 0 2 and 32s 0 2 the isotopomers were not considered in the present study after calculation peaks in blank samples with an average s n 20 were excluded from the final list for all samples bao et al 2017 for molecular formulas cchhoonnss several selected indices are available in supporting information a van krevelen vk diagram can be used to visualize the chemical composition and structure of molecules by using elemental ratios such as h c ratio and o c ratio kim et al 2004 correspondingly there are seven types of compounds in natural dom a lipids like b aliphatic peptides like c carbohydrates like d unsaturated hydrocarbons e carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules crams like structures f aromatic structures and g highly oxygenated compounds hoc bianco et al 2018 detailed classification range is present in the table s2 3 results 3 1 general molecular characterization and fluorescence properties of rainwater dom the reconstructed mass spectra of chemical formulas assigned to all samples after deducting the blank are present in figure s1 the composition and distribution of organic species in rainwater among different locations along the yangtze river basin in china are closely related to their sources and formation mechanisms fig 1 and fig 2 we found that the chemodiversity of rainwater dom shows certain commonalities and uniqueness the number of cho and chon molecular formulas were the dominant species in all samples which were between 1745 and 3163 24 5 56 7 and 1441 2995 23 4 47 7 respectively table s4 and figure s2 s containing formulas particularly chos also represented a nonnegligible constitution of the assigned total molecular formulas 280 1596 molecular formulas like the number distribution the total abundances of cho and chon compounds accounted for 29 0 81 0 and 7 6 33 5 respectively figure s2 although the ranges of mean o c and h c ratios in this study were comparable with previous studies on wet precipitation bianco et al 2018 mead et al 2015 mead et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 it can be seen that the distribution of samples in the vk diagram was highly variable from region to region fig 1 and table s10 which may be related to the complex sources of air masses and the influence of local aerosols during the precipitation events the reasons for this variability will be investigated in detail below the fluorescence intensity of the rainwater samples also showed great variability fig 3a this result indicates that the chemical composition of the chromophoric water soluble organics varies depending on the sampling location three typical peaks were observed as hulis 1 246 314 450 hulis 2 242 310 400 and plom 278 320 the chromophore fractions of hulis 1 and 2 were associated with highly and hypoxic structured humic like fractions respectively while plom as protein like substances chen et al 2016 of these hulis 1 is ubiquitous in water soluble chromophores of different environments but is more frequently found in terrestrial waters and aerosols chen et al 2020 hosen et al 2014 wu et al 2019 hulis 1 is more likely to be produced by the breakdown of macromolecules through photodegradation wu et al 2019 moreover it may also be affected by dust sources chen et al 2020 hulis 2 is mainly of terrestrial origin and partly from fresh industrial and combustion sources yan and kim 2017 plom may be phenolic or amino acid substances which are the least oxidized it can be clearly found that luzhou shows a significant increase in protein like fluorescence compared to other regions together with the increase in the fluorescence intensity of humic like substances luzhou is a typical industrial city where pollutants from anthropogenic activities can significantly increase the fluorescence intensity of rainwater on the one hand luzhou has a well developed brewing industry that would use a large number of microorganisms for industrial fermentation production aromatic amino acids can be produced by microbial fermentation which in turn exhibits high protein like fluorescence large amounts of volatile and semi volatile substances were released into the atmosphere added from microbial fermentation kroll et al 2011 this may be one of the reasons for the significantly higher plom peak on the other hand it has been shown that the fluorescence of naphthalene and phenolic compounds would contribute to the protein like peak sun et al 2017 in the case of urban precipitation may also be the main source of contribution to the plom peak due to their presence in diesel exhaust aerosols panzhihua exhibited a strong hulis 2 fluorescence intensity which may be related to the local industrial sources lijiang and fuling showed stronger and weaker fluorescence intensity of hulis 2 respectively which may be influenced by different degrees of biomass burning the eem spectrum of shanghai showed strong hulis 1 and hulis 2 characteristics similar to coastal aerosols wu et al 2020 and rainwater yang et al 2019 it may be related to its dissolved secondary organic aerosol soa zhao et al 2013 3 2 characterization of regional variations in molecular composition figure s4a presents an intersection venn diagram of the molecular formulas in the rainwater dom the 2055 identical molecular formulas in the overlapping area among the total 13 488 assigned formulas cho species 1147 contribute the most significant proportion of common formulas followed by chon 787 chos 114 and chons 7 the existence of these common molecular formulas indicates similar sources of rainwater dom in different regions as shown in figure s4b common formulas are widely distributed throughout the vk diagram revealing the ubiquity of some components in rainwater dom cho compounds were the most abundant among common species characterized by the o c ratios of 0 67 and h c ratios from 0 4 to 2 0 the distribution of chon compounds was similar to that of cho but it was relatively more concentrated the chon compounds were divided into 17 subclasses according to their heteroatom numbers including oxn1 o2n1 o12n1 and oxn2 o3n2 o8n2 groups figure s5 it should be noted that some oxn2 compounds might be the dimers of oxn1 the major subgroup chon was oxn1 which increased dramatically from four o atoms o4 with a large distribution ranging from o4n1 to o9n1 almost all the oxn1 subgroups exhibited oxygen to nitrogen ratios o n of 3 indicating the presence of nitro compounds no2 and or organic nitrates no3 functional groups in these compounds zhao et al 2013 chos compounds were in the range of h c 1 0 and relatively moderate o c ratios their average h c ratios were the highest among all the common compound classifications indicating the lowest unsaturation of these sulfur containing compounds more than 92 of them have an o s ratio 4 and are identified as organosulfates peng et al 2012 as for the unique molecular formulas we observed some interesting results along the yangtze river up to downstream the unique molecular formulas in batang were mainly cho compounds followed by chon compounds fig 4a the cho compounds were well divided into two classes representing different sources in the vk diagram one is crams like compounds derived from biogenic sources the class1cho and the other is aliphatic peptides like compounds the class2cho unlike in batang chon compounds accounted for the majority of the unique molecular formulas in lijiang almost all these compounds had relatively higher h c ratios 1 0 and lower o c ratios 0 5 indicating relatively higher degree of saturation and lower oxidation state the compounds in fuling were comparable with those in lijiang with slightly lower h c and higher o c indicating that they had undergone more oxidation processes the unique molecular formulas of panzhihua were mainly cho chon and chos compounds while the chons compounds were dominant in luzhou in luzhou more than 91 of the chons compounds had more than seven oxygen atoms thus they are classified as nitrooxy organosulfates with multiple oxygen containing functional groups bianco et al 2019 song et al 2018 mainly distributed in the aliphatic peptides like 46 9 of total unique number classes followed by crams like 21 9 and carbohydrates like 12 0 classes shanghai is the largest coastal city in china its unique molecular formulas in rainwater dom were distributed in crams like aliphatic peptides like lipids like and unsaturated hydrocarbons categories based on this such special molecular tracers can be used to determine the impact of human activities and climate change on rainwater dom in different geographical landscapes 4 discussions 4 1 correlation between molecular composition and optical properties we combine fluorescence spectroscopy with mass spectrometry data to provide new insight into the different sources and chemical properties of the samples fi for example can characterize the sensitivity of humic sources and aromaticity in organic matter with fi less than 1 4 samples are dominated by exogenous terrestrial inputs and above 1 9 mainly autogenous biogenic features lavonen et al 2015 the distribution of molecules in the vk diagram can likewise explain the structure and origin of compounds here fi 1 4 in panzhihua corresponds to terrestrial origin and higher aromaticity luzhou had the largest fi value indicating strong microbial activity moreover we correlated the fi values with the percentage of aromatic intensity in ft icr ms data fig 2b and table s11 and found that the fi values were somewhat negatively correlated with the aromaticity of dissolved organic matter fig 3c which was similar to the results of previous studies mcknight et al 2001 it is worth noting that the distribution of molecular formulae in the vk diagram further supports the conclusion of eems with the highest proportion of aliphatic peptide like groups in luzhou compared to other regions again indicating the influence of local anthropogenic factors bianco et al 2018 thus the mass spectrometry can provide better information than the fluorescence properties when their differences among different regions were minor 4 2 chemodiversity of rainwater dom 4 2 1 common sources of rainwater dom the results in the previous section illustrate that the common compounds in this study are similar to the soa derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds bvocs kourtchev et al 2015 indicating that biogenic soa is one of the main sources of rainwater dom among different geographical locations along the yangtze river the formulas were denoted in table s6 and these compounds were probably derived from aqueous photooxidation reactions nguyen et al 2012 renard et al 2015 yu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 based on laboratory studies the formulas c10h14o5 and c10h14o6 represent typical α pinene oxidation products aljawhary et al 2015 the formulas c7h10o4 c7h12o4 c9h12o5 c14h24o8 and c15h24o9 are the derivatives of isoprene renard et al 2015 in addition numerous similar cho formulas identified in this study such as methoxyphenols limonene and diterpenoid derivatives are consistent with those found in wildfire influenced cloud water and biomass combustion influenced aerosol samples yu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 the common chon1 formulas in this work are also an important part of soa they are generated from peroxy radicals ro2 by oxidizing vocs and then react with no to form organic nitrates bianco et al 2019 additionally common molecular formulas might contain chon2 compounds with reduced nitrogen indicating that the oxidation degree of chon1 compounds is higher than other subgroups moreover the presence of these compounds might be related to the dissolution of chno reduced nitrogen in aerosols or to the liquid phase reactivity of ammonia gasses released by agricultural activities in the yangtze river basin bianco et al 2019 as for organosulfates studies have suggested that organosulfates are the oxidation products of gaseous precursors ervens et al 2011 and could be generated by oxidizing the volatile and water soluble oxidation products of the parent vocs dissolved in fog cloud water and performing aqueous phase oxidation they are widely distributed in the environmental and had also been identified in chamber studies of biological sources e g monoterpenes isoprene and sesquiterpenes and anthropogenic vocs oxidation products iinuma et al 2007 noziere et al 2010 xie et al 2021 in this study some hydrolysates or precursors were identified which were previously detected in chamber experiments and cloud water of biological influences table s7 furthermore s tao et al 2014 found organosulfates with c chain length less than 16 are generally derived from bvocs while organosulfates produced by anthropogenic emissions such as coal fuels are generally long aliphatic chain organosulfates with 17 28 c chain lengths figure s6 shows the c chain length and number of molecules of shared organosulfates more than 60 of the compounds have a c chain length of less than 16 indicating that bvocs are the main common precursors of organosulfates in the yangtze river rainwater dom 4 2 2 molecular composition variability of rainwater dom in addition to the identical molecular formulas unique molecular components are regionally different figs 4 indicating that rainwater in large scale landscapes contains multifarious proportions of organic matter from diverse sources and or evolution mechanisms the exclusive particularity of rainwater in each area may be strongly affected by local natural and anthropogenic emissions and climatic conditions batang is located on the southeastern edge of the tibetan plateau previous studies have shown that during the summer monsoon season bvocs could be transported from the lower elevations of subtropical india forming biogenic secondary organic aerosols over the tibetan plateau cong et al 2015 according to the online measurement of the nepal s pyramid climate observatory nco p from 2006 to 2008 the highest ozone concentration was 61 9 ppbv in the tibetan plateau during the pre monsoon period more ozone oxidized products of bvocs would be formed cristofanelli et al 2010 in addition fresh or aged biomass burning organic aerosols bboa accounted for a significant portion of organic aerosols measured by an aerosol mass spectrometer ams in the tibetan plateau zheng et al 2017 the class1cho compounds in this study have higher o c and lower h c ratios indicating that they underwent more oxidation and dehydration processes and their distribution was similar to the aged bboa wang et al 2019 which was also affected by the south asian monsoon therefore the class1cho compounds might be mainly from bboa via long range transport from south asia moreover the osc of the class1cho compounds is between 0 5 and 1 fig 4g indicating that they had undergone more oxidation processes but it is worth noting that their carbon chains were longer and did not fall in the shadow of fresh and aged secondary aerosols kroll et al 2011 liquid phase reactions are more likely to occur in rainwater than in aerosols therefore unique cho compounds might be dimers trimers and polymers formed through reactions in the cloud class2cho compounds are peptides like formulas that may derive from microorganisms bianco et al 2018 such as phytoplankton or might be affected by photochemical reactions some organic n containing compounds from fresh biomass combustion including lipids like crams like and aromatic structures were also found in the rainwater sample in batang indicating that this region was not only affected by pollutants transported over long distances but also affected by local biomass burning emissions such as stalks firewood and cow dung fleming et al 2018 the osc values of the chon compounds also confirm it lijiang rainwater dom exhibited strong local biomass burning effects mace et al 2003 reported that the majority of organonitrates in the atmosphere are derived from biomass burning organic aerosols bboa organonitrates have also been widely reported in aerosols rainwater and fog that are affected by bio combustion emissions wang et al 2019 distinguished fresh and aged bboa at the molecular level by the vk diagram compared with aged bboa fresh bboa with shorter transport processes and less oxidation has a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere in this study all the unique organonitrates in lijiang are within the range of fresh bboa lijiang is located in a high altitude area where the smoldering combustion of biofuels might be the main reason for the production of organic nitrates an et al 2019 moreover some homologous series of compounds derived from biomass burning were also found in our study table s8 therefore chon compounds may be associated with local intense bio combustion we also used osc to estimate the oxidation processes of compounds most compounds with long carbon chains were found osc ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 fig 4h it is worth noting that unique chon compounds in lijiang are in the category of the hoa and bboa which were related to primary particulate matter directly emitted into the atmosphere kroll et al 2011 the unique molecular formula of fuling differs from that of lijiang their distributions in the vk diagram were mostly in the aged bboa region wang et al 2019 we also observed some molecular tracers of aged bboa from c6 to c9 table s9 these compounds might be derived from the dissolution of aged organic aerosols they can also be produced by chemical reactions in cloud droplets in which water soluble volatile and semi volatile organic compounds react to produce highly oxidized compounds and molecular tracers furthermore high relative humidity 80 promotes the formation of soa through liquid phase reaction bianco et al 2019 aerosol particles condense into cloud droplets through supersaturated water vapor and are activated into condensation nuclei some gaseous precursors so2 no2 etc in the atmosphere can be rapidly adsorbed into cloud droplets to produce chos compounds and eventually form raindrops to fall to the ground surface unlike batang and lijiang fuling also contains a small amount of chos compounds in its unique formula the first two areas have less anthropogenic pollution and low so2 emissions so chos is missing from the unique compounds while the remaining cities are subject to different types of anthropogenic pollution and the location of chos differs in each area which means that the presence of so2 significantly affects the composition of rainwater in the watershed and the different degree of aging predicts different precursors in addition osc of dom in fuling was between 0 5 and 1 fig 4k suggesting that molecules were associated with semi volatile and low volatile oxidized organic aerosols sv ooa and lv ooa and were produced through multi step oxidation reactions kroll et al 2011 compared with other sampling sites panzhihua and luzhou are typical industrial cities in the yangtze river basin where anthropogenic activities are significant however their industrial types are quite different the distribution of panzhihua s unique molecules in the vk diagram was also observed in aerosols impacted by coal burning and vehicle emissions song et al 2018 j tang et al 2020 most of the unique molecular formulas had c lengths of more than 17 and the average dbe of panzhihua 9 8 were higher than those in luzhou 5 6 figure s7 indicating that the unique compounds in both places were mainly from anthropogenic emissions rather coal combustion produces high molecular weight compounds with aromatic structures there were most aromatic compounds in the unique molecular formulas including reduced n compounds and condensed organosulfur formulas previously detected from anthropogenic emissions such as diesel and coal combustion j tang et al 2020 in panzhihua among the six sampling sites in addition there were also a considerable amount of crams like compounds possibly derived from terrestrial sources such as soil organic matter wozniak et al 2015 they might be caused by the smoke and dust produced in the process of mining development similar molecular characteristics have been observed in dust aerosols bao et al 2018a wozniak et al 2015 in luzhou nitrooxy organosulfates are derived from biogenic and anthropogenic vocs and their formation mechanisms require acidic conditions caused by anthropogenic emissions of so2 and nox as mentioned above liquor manufacturing the first pillar industry in luzhou releases abundant vocs during the production process and a certain amount of so2 and nox were inevitably be emitted in other industrial production processes the unique chons species in luzhou were aliphatic peptides like 46 9 of total unique number classes followed by crams like 21 9 and carbohydrates like 12 0 classes such a distribution of chons species was consistent with those reported in vehicle emissions products x j tao et al 2014 aliphatic peptides like nitrooxy oss have relatively high h c ratios and low dbe values indicating high degree of saturation and long carbon lengths and they might be formed by the oxidation of precursors long chain alkanes from vehicle exhaust s tao et al 2014 the unique molecular formulas of shanghai showed the influence of marine sources the peptide like compounds with h c ratios of 1 5 2 0 include functionalized amino acid residues peptide and protein fragments which were mainly attributed to sea spray based biological sources for example wozniak et al 2015 detected aliphatic peptides like compounds in primary marine aerosol samples collected in the north atlantic ocean considered that they were derived from sea spray some researchers speculated that they might be associated with phospholipid compounds in biological cell membranes bao et al 2018a most compounds had an osc value of less than 0 5 fig 4l indicating that primary particulate matters might directly emit into atmosphere along with the rupture of biological cell membranes kroll et al 2011 unsaturated hydrocarbons were mainly composed of chos and cho compounds which might be derived from the primary product of coastal anthropogenic emissions such as fossil fuel combustion song et al 2018 or during the ocean atmosphere transfer process the depletion of o was a result of that the explosion of ocean droplets produces compounds with few o atoms which were also found in coastal aerosols and coastal rainwater bao et al 2018a mead et al 2013 4 3 possible precursor product pairs the molecular composition of rainwater dom is very complex many transformation reactions occur during the rainwater scavenging process to explore the potential precursor product pairs at a molecular level 36 types of general transformation reactions of atmospheric organic compounds are summarized in fig 5 it is mainly divided into demethylation oxygenation decarboxylation amino nitro sulfur and other reactions which are commonly encountered in free radical oxidation and photochemical transformations yeh and ziemann 2014 herrmann et al 2010 otto et al 2017 riva et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 it is worth noting that the changing trends of the reaction mechanism of rainwater in different regions are similar fig 5a which indicates that the full spectrum scanning and high resolution characteristics of ft icr ms can fully demonstrate the transformation principle of dom in rainwater in general oxidation reactions dealkylation and decarboxylation are relatively common for conversion processes in rainwater systems moreover the number of compounds involved in the same reaction increased or decreased due to the different characteristics of different regions suggesting the chemodiversity of rainwater dom the number of heteroatom precursor product pairs are closely related to local anthropogenic disturbances for example in biomass burning events a large amount of free glycine was degraded and the amino nitrogen is lost through the cn cracking of glycine zhu et al 2020 therefore the amino reaction that chon compounds participate in reflects the contribution of the local biomass burning in such a complex reaction system each precursor and product can participate in multiple reactions comparing the compounds that meet this reaction with the total number of compounds that would theoretically participate in this reaction in this area it was found that in each reaction process more than 70 of the compounds follow this transformation mechanism fig 5b 5 conclusions the yangtze river is the longest river in asia serving more than one third of china s population this study provides rainwater dom with a great variability and chemodiversity along the yangtze river basin which was interpreted by a combination of optical and molecular techniques the source of rainwater dom is complicated and the unique variability of dom molecular composition may be driven by several key factors such as climate variables landscapes and human activities our research emphasizes that the complicated molecular composition of rainwater dom responds more obviously to local anthropogenic disturbances so it warrants future studies to comprehensively investigate organic matter in rainwater aerosols soils lakes and rivers to obtain an integrated overview of the biogeochemical cycles of organics in the yangtze river basin furthermore we provide 36 types of molecular level transformation reactions during the rainwater scavenging process more than 70 of the molecules in rainwater dom follow this transformation mechanism which may be helpful to better understand the sources and scavenging mechanisms of organics in the atmosphere along the yangtze river basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16297,the three gorges dam tgd is the world s largest hydropower project it could potentially influence the footprint and transport of microplastics mps in yangtze river which is the largest riverine input of oceanic mps worldwide in addition to analyzing the mp particles of all size categories and polymer groups we also evaluated the stability pollution risk and source identification of mps after the catastrophic flood of 2020 in the three gorges reservoir tgr and downstream of the tgd we found that the mp abundance 6214 5394 particles m3 in the tgr water increased by a 57 9 growth after this catastrophic flood interestingly we observed the small sized mps smps 300 μm were dominant in the tgr accounting for 65 4 of the total mp particles after flooding the main morphological types were fragment and fiber while the major polymer was polyethylene pe although the mp level was at a low pollution risk 13 6 of the sampling sites in the tgr water faced potential ecological risks driven by smps in particular there was no significant difference in the abundances morphological types and polymer composition of mps between upstream and downstream of the tgd p 0 05 indicating flooding control operation could weaken the barrier effect of the dam on mps further based on the conditional fragmentation model the pe fragments in smps of the tgr remained at a stable state mps in the tgr mainly originated from anthropogenic activities wastewater containers and agriculture films with atmospheric deposition as a potential transport pathway for polymers our study demonstrates that dam operation during the flood period can influence the mp organization in tgr providing new insights of the global land sea transportation of mps in the yangtze river keywords microplastics three gorges reservoir surface water floods potential ecological risk 1 introduction microplastic mp contamination is recognized as one of the world s most pressing environmental concerns because of its potential toxicity and ubiquity avio et al 2015 giani et al 2019 kane et al 2020 weiss et al 2021 based on the plastics the facts 2020 plastics europe 2020 the annual plastic production was more than 368 million tons in 2019 it has been estimated that 64 90 of marine mps originate from land based sources hurley et al 2018 rivers are recognized to be the major conveyors for terrestrial plastics to the ocean mai et al 2019 recent years a large number of hydropower dams have been built worldwide for increasing the energy supply and flood control lehner et al 2011 leading to the fragmentation of the free flowing river by the dams and reservoirs grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 and affecting the transport and fate of mps huang et al 2020 song et al 2020 weideman et al 2019 previous studies indicated that high concentrations of mps agglomerated in reservoirs due to the interception of dams huang et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 weideman et al 2019 suggested that dams did not trap floating mps during the wet season however information on the knowledge limitation of the impact of dams on mps such as the impact of the particle size and polymer composition of mps is still unclear therefore it is very necessary to further study the impact of dam on the transportation and fate of mps from inland to the oceans plastic debris can be fragmented into small sized debris exposed to different weathering such as photolytic biological and mechanical degradation wang et al 2021 size of mps was a critical feature which influenced the potential threats of freshwater organisms especially for the small sized mps due to their easy ingestion by freshwater organisms such as phytoplankton zooplankton and fish garcia et al 2021 these small sized mps with large specific surface area absorbed in organic and inorganic pollutants could enter the food chain through the freshwater organisms and consequently threaten the human health xiang et al 2022 most small sized mps have been generally neglected because of several reasons e g trawl sampling methods with 0 33 μm net clothes and qualitative and quantitative analysis of mps by picking up method under microscope lebreton et al 2017 sebille et al 2015 fig 1 in fact the small sized mps 300 μm fraction accounted for 85 of total mp particles in sediments wang et al 2018 while their patterns in freshwater surface remain virtually unclear therefore ignoring small sized mps would affect the understanding and estimation of the mass balance and land to sea transportation of mps in the future the yangtze river is recognized as the largest worldwide contributor to the global plastic load lebreton et al 2017 the three gorges dam tgd located mainstream of the yangtze river is the world s largest hydroelectric construction liu et al 2020 and the main role of tgd is the flood control fang et al 2012 in recent years the concentration of mps in the tgr increased concerns due to their pervasive distribution detected in this area di and wang 2018 zhang et al 2017 di and wang 2018 found that the mp abundances in the surface water of tgr ranged from 1597 to 12 611 n m3 and was more serious in urban areas zhang et al 2017 indicated that the high mp accumulation in the tgr could be attributed to the variation in the hydrodynamic conditions during water level operation in the tgr however these early studies primarily focused on mps with sizes of more than 300 μm or 500 μm and did not consider the impacts of floods on mps in the reservoir in fact the floods could export approximately 70 of the mps load stored on the river bed hurley et al 2018 song et al 2020 indicated that the artificial floods could accelerate the transportation of mps from the river to the sea however the lack of all size analysis of mps under various hydrological regimes flood period is insufficient to fully understand the mp patterns in the tgr area in 2020 the tgr experienced the largest watershed catastrophic flood since 1998 we hypothesized that this catastrophic flood can influenced the fate and transport of small sized microplastics smps in the tgr and downstream of the tgd in this study the footprint organization patterns and potential ecological risk of both mps and smps in surface water were studied after this catastrophic flood our study provides underlying insights into the characteristics of mps and smps in the reservoir affected after flooding and serves as a basis for scientifically understanding this influence on the inland sea transportation of smps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection in july 2020 due to the continuous rainstorm in the upper reaches of wujiang chongqing and the tgr section the yangtze river experienced the largest basin flood since 1998 while the upper reaches experienced five flood peaks there were three flood peaks in july with peak discharges of 53 000 m3 s 61 000 m3 s and 60 000 m3 s then in august it experienced two extraordinary flood peaks with peak discharges of 62 000 m3 s and 75 000 m3 s the last flood was the highest water level in chongqing in 115 years cwrc 2020 therefore this study was carried out in august to october 2020 in the tgr and downstream of the tgd in the yangtze river in china a total of twenty eight surface water samples were collected including nine samples in the mainstream of the tgr s7 s15 thirteen samples in four tributaries namely xiangxi river s16 s18 daning river s19 s22 meixi river s23 s25 and zhuyi river s26 s28 of the tgr and six samples downstream of the tgd area s1 s6 fig 2 approximate 20 l of surface water 0 1 m in depth were collected using a 5 l stainless steel barrel at each sampling site then the surface water was filtered through a 5 0 mm stainless steel sieve the filtrate was transferred into brown glass bottles and 10 ml 4 formalin solution was mixed with the samples which were taken back to the laboratory for further treatment meanwhile another water sample was collected using a polypropylene bottle 500 ml and immediately taken back to the laboratory for elemental measurement all samples were stored at 4 c before laboratory treatment and analysis 2 2 microplastics extraction the surface water samples were separated to remove any organic matter by wet peroxide oxidation wpo masura et al 2015 in detail the surface water sample was filtered through a 0 01 mm stainless steel sieve by vacuum filtration then the sieve was transferred to a 250 ml glass beaker to remove the organic matters and extract the mps a 0 05 m ferrous sulfate 20 ml and 30 hydrogen peroxide 20 ml solution was added to decompose the organic matter and heated to 75 c in a hotplate to accelerate the reaction if natural organic material was visible another 20 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide was added until no natural organic material was visible then 6 g of sodium chloride per 20 ml of sample was used to increase the density of the aqueous solution until the salt dissolved after setting the supernatant was filtered through stainless steel sieves with different pore sizes 0 01 mm 0 3 mm and 1 0 mm for further identification samples on the stainless steel sieves were flushed into a precleaned 250 ml beaker and then filtered through a 0 45 μm glass microfiber filter whatman gf b with a vacuum pump all the filtrates were stored in petri dishes and dried at 50 c for further identification to avoid potential background contamination a laboratory coat was worn and aluminum foil was used to cover all apparatus during the entire process in an ultra clean laboratory 2 3 microplastics identification the dried filter paper was firstly placed under the microscope sc iii china to randomly mark the suspected microplastics covering the visual particles next the suspected microplastics were examined to identify their polymer composition using a micro raman spectrometer thermo fisher scientific dxr2 532 nm laser raman shift 50 3500 cm 1 because the particle size was larger than 10 μm can be identified by micro raman spectrometer therefore we discriminated the suspected microplastics in the size range of 10 5000 μm by micro raman spectroscopy in this study once identified as microplastic the morphological characteristics were recorded including morphological types i e fragment film and fiber and size which were identified based on a previous study wang et al 2021 the abundance of mps was expressed as particles m3 the mp sizes could be divided into four classes 10 100 μm 100 300 μm 300 1000 μm and 1000 5000 μm the smps was defined as the mps with particle size 300 μm while the normal microplastics nmps were between 300 and 5000 μm 2 4 procedural blanks the unused meshes were prepared during sampling process for the procedural blanks for the blank test 20 l of milli q water were passed through the clean unused meshes in triplicate with the similar treatment to the samples meanwhile the laboratory blank in triplicate was also prepared the types of polymers in both procedural blank and laboratory blank were detected using micro raman spectrometer to obtain the background contamination 2 5 calculation of the stability and particle size of microplastics we used a model to understand the stability and particle size distribution of mps in surface water of the tgr based on the fragmentation induced size distribution cfd the simplified expression of this model can be defined as follows wang et al 2021 1 f x 1 e λ x α x 0 where λ determines the relative location of the cumulative size distribution of mps i e the size range of mps α defines the shape of the cumulative size distribution i e the fragmentation pattern specifically if the mps are relatively small a high value of α should be stabilized additionally the aging rate can be represented as λαxα 1 if α 1 meaning the probability of mp fragmentation is high with larger mp sizes and the weathering and downsizing processes could be eased to influence larger mps for smaller mps the process of downsizing would be suppressed if α 1 small mps will have an elevated probability of downsizing compared with that or larger mps the modeling parameters λ and α are the fingerprint parameters which can be used to rapidly identify the source apportionment of the mps in the environment wang et al 2021 if the values of the λ and α in this study were closed to the reference values it indicated that they have similar sources due to the lack of the λ and α values with different mp sources only some referential data are presented in fig 5c and table s1 in this study we calculated the λ and α values of morphological types and major polymers as shown in fig 5c to identify the sources of mps 2 6 measurement for ions concentrations different ions including anions cl no3 so4 and f and cations k na ca2 and mg2 in surface water samples were measured by a dionex ion chromatography system ics 2500 the total organic carbon content was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer elementar vario toc elementar co germany 2 7 pollution load index and pollution risk assessments for microplastics the pollution load index pli of mps was calculated based on previous study kabir et al 2021 a site with pli 1 was considered to be polluted the calculation of pli is as follows kabir et al 2021 2 p l i i c i c 0 3 pl i tgr pl i 1 pl i 2 pl i 3 pl i n n where i indicates a sampling sites n is the number of sampling sites in tgr ci indicates the mp abundance at site i and c0 indicates the minimum baseline concentration taken from the available literature we chose the lowest mp abundance in this study as baseline concentration c0 here plii is the pollution load index at sites i and plitgr is the mp pollution load index in tgr the pollution risk assessment for mps not only identified by abundances but also influenced by the different toxicity of the identified mp polymers therefore the toxicity indices were calculated based on the polymeric risks utilizing hazard scores from lithner et al 2011 the calculation processes of pollution risk assessment for mps were as follows 4 h i j 1 m p j i c i s j 5 h tgr h 1 h 2 h 3 h n n 6 p r i i h i p l i i 7 pr i tgr pr i 1 pr i 2 pr i 3 pr i n n where hi indicates the summation of mp polymeric risk indices at site i and h tgr indicates the polymeric risk in tgr prii indicates the pollution risk index of mps at the site i and pritgr indicates the pollution risk of mps for tgr area the j represents a polymer type m indicates the number of the identified polymer types pji is the number of each single mp polymer identified at sites i and sj is the risk score for each detected polymer referred to the previous report lithner et al 2011 the detected polymers and their score values were pe 11 pet 4 pp 1 ps 30 pvc 10 001 and pa 1 respectively in this reference lithner et al 2011 the categories of pri and h were listed in table s2 2 8 data analysis a correlation analysis and an independent samples t test were applied to determine significant differences using spss spss inc chicago when the data did not show a normal distribution the logarithm based on 10 was used for the data conversion and then to further test the independent samples t test the homoscedasticity and significance of the data were analyzed according to the results of the data analysis using spss the significant differences were established at 0 01 and 0 05 level of significance moreover the global distribution of mp abundances was mapped with arcgis 10 2 and origin 2021 was used to create the figures 3 results 3 1 abundance of microplastics up and downstream of the dam all the sampling sites were detected mps in the surface water in this study no mp particles were reliably identified as the polymers were detected in the procedural and laboratory blanks the average abundance of mps in the tgr surface water was 6214 5392 particles m3 mean standard deviation ranging from 974 particles m3 to 21 132 particles m3 while the average abundance of mps downstream of the tgd was 6215 3441 particles m3 in the range of 2353 particles m3 to 10 429 particles m3 fig 2 and table 1 for smps the average abundance in the tgr surface water was 4514 4803 particles m3 while the average abundance of nmps was 1701 1377 particles m3 the average of smps accounted for 65 4 18 6 of total mps while the nmps accounted for 34 6 18 6 of the total mps for the smps downstream of the tgd the average abundance was 4316 3028 particles m3 table 1 which accounted for 70 2 19 7 of total mps moreover there were no significant differences between the abundances of mps and smps in the tgr surface water and downstream of the tgd surface water p 0 565 for mps and p 0 459 for smps 3 2 morphological characteristics of microplastics up and downstream of the dam the morphological types of mps were classified into three categories fiber fragment and film with the following proportions in the tgr surface water fragments 55 1 fiber 43 2 film 1 7 fig 3 b1 for smps fragments and fibers were also the major morphological types in the tgr surface water accounting for 76 1 and 21 8 of smps respectively downstream of the tgd the proportion of fragments for mps slightly increased 61 1 while the fibers for mps decreased 35 9 fig 3b2 the smps in downstream of the tgd exhibited a similar trend to that in the tgr fig 3c2 which accounted for 77 1 for fragments and 19 4 for fibers respectively 3 3 particle size characteristics of microplastics in up and downstream of dam the particle size of all detected mps in this study ranged from 30 μm to 5000 μm in the tgr area mean 321 5 μm and downstream of the tgd area mean 313 2 μm further the 100 300 μm mps in the tgr showed the highest abundance 47 0 among the total mps fig 3a1 the following sizes were 300 1000 μm 10 100 μm and 1000 5000 μm accounting for 26 6 21 5 and 4 8 respectively fig 3a1 there was a high proportion of smps 10 300 μm in the surface water accounting for 68 5 of the total mps in the tgr the mean size of smps in the tgr was 139 6 63 7 μm fragments were the major morphological type with high percentage 76 1 in smps while the percentage of fragments in the nmp fraction was relatively lower 4 3 conversely fibers constituted a small fraction in smps 21 7 but were a main component of the nmp fraction 41 4 fig 3b1 and 3c1 for mps in downstream of the tgd the proportion of smps 10 300 μm was considerably high 72 8 while the nmps 300 5000 μm occupied 27 2 of mps downstream of the tgd specifically the proportion of 100 300 μm mps was 47 5 following by the sizes of 10 100 μm and 300 1000 μm mps accounting for 25 3 and 22 2 respectively fig 3a2 the smp fraction accounted for 72 8 of the total mps in downstream of the tgd with the mean size of 129 5 60 3 μm the proportion of fragments in the smps in downstream of the tgd 61 1 was lower than that in tgr while the percentage of fragments in the nmps was 18 5 the proportion of fibers in the smps accounted for 19 4 while it was 79 5 in nmps fig 3b2 and 3c2 3 4 polymer compositions of microplastics in up and downstream of dam the characteristics of mps in this study were presented in fig 4 seven polymer compositions were detected in the tgr surface water and downstream of the tgd which were cellulose polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc and nylon pa fig s4 pe was identified as a pervasive polymer group with significant proportion 41 6 in the tgr surface water followed by cellulose 29 1 pp 18 7 and pet 9 2 ps 0

for pa the other polymer components were all detected in the surface water downstream of the tgd the proportions of these multiple polymers were as follows pe 35 4 pp 22 7 pet 22 2 cellulose 16 2 ps 3

morphological types of mps in the tgr were fragments and fibers which fitted the conditional fragmentation based model well cfd r2 0 98 0 99 fig 5 for these morphological types the α values fragmentation parameter in the tgr showed a rising trend with the following order fibers 1 63 fragments 2 34 both α values of fragments and fiber were all higher than 1 fig 5 the λ values of fragments and fibers were 103 00 and 69 28 respectively fig 5 for the major polymer types of mps pe pp pet and cellulose in tgr surface water the order of α values for different polymers was as follows pe 2 51

60 22 pp 5 53 cellulose 2 96 pet 1 07 table s1 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic organization after the catastrophic flood 4 1 1 influence of floods on microplastic abundances in the tgr mps can be significantly evacuated from the river catchment with a subsequent enhancement in scouring on the river bed and an increase in discharge of urban rainwater and sewage during floods hurley et al 2018 in the tgr area the average abundance of mps after the catastrophic flood in 2020 6214 particles m3 was increased by 57 9 compared with that report 2614 particles m3 in 2019 for a similar particle range he et al 2021 table 2 this rise of abundance in mps exhibited high spatial heterogeneity because of the high coefficient of variation table 1 the abundance with the same particle size category for mps 1 mm in this study 5910 particles m3 was remarkably higher than that of the previous report 1958 particles m3 leading to a 66 9 increase he et al 2021 interestingly the smps 300 μm dominated the abundance of mps in this study 65 4 18 6 ranging from 447 particles m3 to 18 053 particles m3 which early researches seldom focused on in the tgr fig 2 most of the freshwater research to date have evaluated the mps with a particle size greater than 300 μm due to the inconsistency of sampling and the limitations of the identification fig 1 the smps were not investigated comprehensively for the following reasons 1 most freshwater mp studies based on the particle size categories of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa protocol with mesh aperture 333 μm did not include mps with sizes smaller than 300 μm he et al 2021 masura et al 2015 mai et al 2019 2 most studies randomly selected a certain number of mp particles 50 200 suspected mp particles by picking with needles or tweezers which led to the selection of larger mp particles because of the artificial selectivity he et al 2021 mai et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 2019 in fact only six studies reported the particle size of mps 300 μm ding et al 2019 lin et al 2021 pan et al 2020 su et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 these studies exhibited high mp abundances which was attributed to the high abundances of smps in freshwater with proportions of smps of approximately 55 fig 1 moreover the smps were considered a threat to the aquatic organisms owing to their ease in ingestion and potential to retain other contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops on their large surface area auta et al 2017 cao et al 2021 wang et al 2019 4 1 2 microplastic variations in the morphological types and polymers the abundances of mps and smps not only increased after the catastrophic flood but also varied the morphological type composition of mps in the tgr surface water previous studies in tgr have segmented multiple morphological types of mps into fibers fragments pellets film and styrofoam with fibers and fragments dominating the mps 28 6 90 5 and 2 4 72 2 respectively di and wang 2018 zhang et al 2017 however the morphological types of mps after the 2020 catastrophic flood were detected three types including fragments fibers and films fig 3 additionally the fragments were now dominant in most of the surface water samples fig s1 these fragments were mainly concentrated in smps fig 3c1 interestingly a significant difference was not observed between that in tgr area upstream and downstream of tgd in surface water p 0 358 after the catastrophic flood period in 2020 six polymer types cellulose pe pet pp ps pvc and pa were detected in this study and pe became the main component of mps accounting for 41 6 fig 4 previous studies reported pp 29 4 90 91 and ps 38 5 as the commonly detected polymers while pe 21 0 had a low occurrence di and wang 2018 zhang et al 2017 except for the effect of flood scouring and mechanical force this change in major polymer types was mainly attributed to the previous neglect of high small size pe particles moreover pe mainly existed in smp fragments fig 4b and their proportions were 73 8 followed by pp 15 1 which was observed in our results fig 3d1 there was no significant difference between the pe proportions in the tgr surface water and downstream of the tgd p 0 638 therefore although the morphological types and proportion of polymer groups of mps changed after the catastrophic flood there was no significant difference between that in tgr surface water and downstream of tgd p 0 05 4 1 3 barrier effect of the three gorges dam on microplastics after flooding although the mps were obstructed in the surface water by the tgd in previous study zhang et al 2015 this study did not show that the mps in downstream of the tgd was lower than that of the tgr p 0 565 figs 2 and s1a this discrepancy between previous reports and our measurements may be attributed to the artificial operation of the tgr during the flood period which enhanced the connectivity of the yangtze river and east china sea and weakened the interception of the tgd during the flood period the discharge could have aggravated the mixing of water and promoted the homogenization of upstream and downstream of the tgd resulting in the increment of mp concentrations according to available research data li et al 2019 luo et al 2019 the average abundance of mps was higher downstream of the tgd in this study by 2 5 to 8 0 times than that of before in addition we first reported the effect of reservoir operation on smp abundances in the tgr and downstream of the tgd fig 2 there was no significant difference in the smp abundances in the tgr and downstream surface water of the tgd p 0 459 moreover the size proportions of smps upstream and downstream of the tgd indicated the homogenization of smps by reservoir operation the size distribution of smps did not reorganize in the tgr and downstream surface water of the tgd p 0 05 fig 3a1 and a2 attributing to the yangtze river becoming a free flowing system via the reservoir operation of the tgr during the flood period 4 2 stability and fragmentation of microplastics in the tgr surface water for morphological types of mps in tgr surface water the λ values indicated that the average size of the fragments was obviously smaller than that of fibers fig 5b in addition the fragmentation parameter α values in the tgr suggested that the stability increased from fibers to fragments this result should be attributed to the different fragmentation of fibers and fragments fibers were more susceptible to weathering and downsizing however the downsizing of fragments would be suppressed due to their small size αfragments αfibers α 1 fig 5 the results were supported by wang et al 2021 in figs 3 and 5c the fragments were the dominant the smp morphological types with 99 8 of cumulative percentage implying that fragments 300 μm reached a stable size distribution in this study the average size of fragments was 140 6 μm signifying that most of the fragments in the tgr were stable with the particle size smaller than 300 µm based on the order of α values the fragmentation of pe mps had reached a stable stage when the size of pe was lower than 300 μm the cumulative percentage reached 99 9 according to the cfd model the aging rate of different polymers in this study showed that pe had the highest aging rate 60 22 suggesting that pe should be easy to fragment preferentially to reach stability comparing with the other polymers this result meant that the pe should stay at its stable stage and be suppressed or slow to further fragment into smaller particles besides ions concentrations in surface water should influence the fragmentation and stabilization of mps in surface water with positive correlation trends p 0 05 fig s2 future studies should consider these mp fragmentation and degradation factors in the water environment 4 3 source identification of microplastics in the tgr surface water until now identifying the sources of mps in different environmental medias still faces great challenge however the morphological types and proportions can be inferred to have originated from direct discharge and fragmentation of plastic wastes wang et al 2021 in the tgr surface water the three sources of mps identified included containers packages wastewater sludge and agriculture films which were presented as λ vs α in figs 5c s3 and table s1 the dot values within the sewage wastewater group have covered the range for cellulose and pet this category indicated that cellulose and pet in surface water mainly originated from sewage wastewater in the tgr prior studies indicated that the plastic particles were found in raw sewage consisting of fibers dris et al 2015 most of the cellulose and pet were found in fibers in this study fig 4a which was probably the effluent from washing synthetic clothes browne et al 2011 this was also compatible with the findings of feng et al 2021 where pet fibers were the main contributor of domestic cloth washing 0 5 mm in length in addition the fertilizers represented the agricultural sources wang et al 2021 which was closed to the pet spot identified in this study this result meant that part of the pet in the tgr surface water originated from agriculture sources in the tgr area people would develop planting e g corn soybean peanut and ginger on the soils of water level fluctuating zone wlfz sun 2007 and the use of the agriculture films reached to more than thirty thousand tons sun 2007 the use of agriculture films enhanced the input of agricultural mps into the tgr water during the flooding period we also found that the wlfz soils and pet pp and cellulose could be grouped together which further certified the above observation as a result the plastic debris imported into the river during the flood period may not have enough time to fragment into small particles and thus the size of these polymers exhibited relatively larger than pe fragments as suggested by xiong et al 2019 unfortunately owing to the lack of data for mp sources especially for smp information it was impossible to ascertain the source of pe using the cfd model however fragments mainly pe and pp were the most common particles as has been in previous studies klein et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2018 these mp fragments may be attributed to the wide use of plastic materials such as food containers and plastic bags feng et al 2021 interestingly the points of α and λ for different polymers were all closed to the points for atmospheric deposition fig 5c indicating that the atmospheric deposition may be one of the transport pathways for multiple polymers the result is similar to a current study by allen et al 2019 where they represented atmospheric wet and dry deposition and identified fibers 750 μm long and fragments 300 μm as mps 4 4 potential ecological risks of small sized microplastics in the tgr surface water the potential pollution risks of mps were mainly affected by particle sizes morphological types and polymer compositions jung et al 2021 kabir et al 2021 in general all of the sampling sites were polluted with mps due to pli 1 in this study table s3 there were six types of polymers containing pe pet pp pvc ps and pa detected in tgr fig 4 considering the toxicity indices for each detected polymer hi values in table s3 the pri in tgr was 1 47 ranging from 0 07 to 21 28 for each sampling sites which was lower than a value of 150 table s2 the results indicated that although all sampling sites were polluted with mps pli 1 table s3 the mp pollution risk was at low a level for each sampling site table s2 recently researchers indicated that the toxicity of mps can also be influenced by their size and morphological types fragments and fibers previous studies were found that only non spherical mps fragments and fibers 20 300 μm could be the target for risk assessment due to the potential adverse biological effects jung et al 2021 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 the potential ecological risks of smps 300 μm have been obtained with the standard limit of predicted no effect concentration pnec value of smps 12 000 particles m3 jung et al 2021 in this study the smp fragments and fibers dominated the mps morphological types fig 3c1 and the abundances of smps were in the range of 447 particles m3 to 18 053 particles m3 mean 4514 particles m3 fig 2b the potential ecological risk of smps in most of sampling sites in the tgr did not exceed the standard limit of pnec 12 000 particles m3 however there were still three sampling sites accounting for 13 6 of all sampling sites in the tgr that required further much attention after the catastrophic flood because the abundances of smps in these sampling sites exceeded the standard limit 12 000 particles m3 jung et al 2021 in addition these three sampling sites were located near to the areas with high population density s11 and s14 were located in a town upstream of the tgr with 18 053 particles m3 and s27 was located midstream in the tributary zhuyi river with 12 605 particles m3 fig 2b implying that the anthropogenic influences may be the major cause of the elevated mp levels 5 conclusion the abundance organization patterns stability and source identification of mps and smps were investigated in the surface water of the tgr and downstream of the tgd after the catastrophic floods of 2020 in china the results showed that high levels of mps were found in the tgr surface water with the average abundance of 6214 particles m3 that increased by a 57 9 in 2019 the smps accounting for 65 4 of the total mps played an important role in mps affecting the overall abundance variation in the tgr pe dominated the polymer types in the tgr and was mainly concentrated in the smp fragments after the flood the proportion of morphological types and polymer types of mps did not significantly differ in upstream and downstream of the tgd pe fragments with a size smaller than 300 μm were in a stable stage there were three sources corresponding to anthropogenic activities including plastic containers wastewater and agricultural films while atmospheric deposition may be one mode of transportation for mps in the tgr area the mp level was at a low pollution risk with 13 6 of the sampling sites in the tgr water facing potential ecological risks driven by smps in conclusion this study demonstrated that the reservoir operation during the flood period can affect the land sea transportation of mps especially for the smps the quantification of the all size categories of mps should be encouraged for future researches understanding the organization transportation and ecological risk of smps in a range of environmental and hydrological conditions is crucial to scientifically assess their potential

16297,the three gorges dam tgd is the world s largest hydropower project it could potentially influence the footprint and transport of microplastics mps in yangtze river which is the largest riverine input of oceanic mps worldwide in addition to analyzing the mp particles of all size categories and polymer groups we also evaluated the stability pollution risk and source identification of mps after the catastrophic flood of 2020 in the three gorges reservoir tgr and downstream of the tgd we found that the mp abundance 6214 5394 particles m3 in the tgr water increased by a 57 9 growth after this catastrophic flood interestingly we observed the small sized mps smps 300 μm were dominant in the tgr accounting for 65 4 of the total mp particles after flooding the main morphological types were fragment and fiber while the major polymer was polyethylene pe although the mp level was at a low pollution risk 13 6 of the sampling sites in the tgr water faced potential ecological risks driven by smps in particular there was no significant difference in the abundances morphological types and polymer composition of mps between upstream and downstream of the tgd p 0 05 indicating flooding control operation could weaken the barrier effect of the dam on mps further based on the conditional fragmentation model the pe fragments in smps of the tgr remained at a stable state mps in the tgr mainly originated from anthropogenic activities wastewater containers and agriculture films with atmospheric deposition as a potential transport pathway for polymers our study demonstrates that dam operation during the flood period can influence the mp organization in tgr providing new insights of the global land sea transportation of mps in the yangtze river keywords microplastics three gorges reservoir surface water floods potential ecological risk 1 introduction microplastic mp contamination is recognized as one of the world s most pressing environmental concerns because of its potential toxicity and ubiquity avio et al 2015 giani et al 2019 kane et al 2020 weiss et al 2021 based on the plastics the facts 2020 plastics europe 2020 the annual plastic production was more than 368 million tons in 2019 it has been estimated that 64 90 of marine mps originate from land based sources hurley et al 2018 rivers are recognized to be the major conveyors for terrestrial plastics to the ocean mai et al 2019 recent years a large number of hydropower dams have been built worldwide for increasing the energy supply and flood control lehner et al 2011 leading to the fragmentation of the free flowing river by the dams and reservoirs grill et al 2019 maavara et al 2020 and affecting the transport and fate of mps huang et al 2020 song et al 2020 weideman et al 2019 previous studies indicated that high concentrations of mps agglomerated in reservoirs due to the interception of dams huang et al 2020 song et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 weideman et al 2019 suggested that dams did not trap floating mps during the wet season however information on the knowledge limitation of the impact of dams on mps such as the impact of the particle size and polymer composition of mps is still unclear therefore it is very necessary to further study the impact of dam on the transportation and fate of mps from inland to the oceans plastic debris can be fragmented into small sized debris exposed to different weathering such as photolytic biological and mechanical degradation wang et al 2021 size of mps was a critical feature which influenced the potential threats of freshwater organisms especially for the small sized mps due to their easy ingestion by freshwater organisms such as phytoplankton zooplankton and fish garcia et al 2021 these small sized mps with large specific surface area absorbed in organic and inorganic pollutants could enter the food chain through the freshwater organisms and consequently threaten the human health xiang et al 2022 most small sized mps have been generally neglected because of several reasons e g trawl sampling methods with 0 33 μm net clothes and qualitative and quantitative analysis of mps by picking up method under microscope lebreton et al 2017 sebille et al 2015 fig 1 in fact the small sized mps 300 μm fraction accounted for 85 of total mp particles in sediments wang et al 2018 while their patterns in freshwater surface remain virtually unclear therefore ignoring small sized mps would affect the understanding and estimation of the mass balance and land to sea transportation of mps in the future the yangtze river is recognized as the largest worldwide contributor to the global plastic load lebreton et al 2017 the three gorges dam tgd located mainstream of the yangtze river is the world s largest hydroelectric construction liu et al 2020 and the main role of tgd is the flood control fang et al 2012 in recent years the concentration of mps in the tgr increased concerns due to their pervasive distribution detected in this area di and wang 2018 zhang et al 2017 di and wang 2018 found that the mp abundances in the surface water of tgr ranged from 1597 to 12 611 n m3 and was more serious in urban areas zhang et al 2017 indicated that the high mp accumulation in the tgr could be attributed to the variation in the hydrodynamic conditions during water level operation in the tgr however these early studies primarily focused on mps with sizes of more than 300 μm or 500 μm and did not consider the impacts of floods on mps in the reservoir in fact the floods could export approximately 70 of the mps load stored on the river bed hurley et al 2018 song et al 2020 indicated that the artificial floods could accelerate the transportation of mps from the river to the sea however the lack of all size analysis of mps under various hydrological regimes flood period is insufficient to fully understand the mp patterns in the tgr area in 2020 the tgr experienced the largest watershed catastrophic flood since 1998 we hypothesized that this catastrophic flood can influenced the fate and transport of small sized microplastics smps in the tgr and downstream of the tgd in this study the footprint organization patterns and potential ecological risk of both mps and smps in surface water were studied after this catastrophic flood our study provides underlying insights into the characteristics of mps and smps in the reservoir affected after flooding and serves as a basis for scientifically understanding this influence on the inland sea transportation of smps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection in july 2020 due to the continuous rainstorm in the upper reaches of wujiang chongqing and the tgr section the yangtze river experienced the largest basin flood since 1998 while the upper reaches experienced five flood peaks there were three flood peaks in july with peak discharges of 53 000 m3 s 61 000 m3 s and 60 000 m3 s then in august it experienced two extraordinary flood peaks with peak discharges of 62 000 m3 s and 75 000 m3 s the last flood was the highest water level in chongqing in 115 years cwrc 2020 therefore this study was carried out in august to october 2020 in the tgr and downstream of the tgd in the yangtze river in china a total of twenty eight surface water samples were collected including nine samples in the mainstream of the tgr s7 s15 thirteen samples in four tributaries namely xiangxi river s16 s18 daning river s19 s22 meixi river s23 s25 and zhuyi river s26 s28 of the tgr and six samples downstream of the tgd area s1 s6 fig 2 approximate 20 l of surface water 0 1 m in depth were collected using a 5 l stainless steel barrel at each sampling site then the surface water was filtered through a 5 0 mm stainless steel sieve the filtrate was transferred into brown glass bottles and 10 ml 4 formalin solution was mixed with the samples which were taken back to the laboratory for further treatment meanwhile another water sample was collected using a polypropylene bottle 500 ml and immediately taken back to the laboratory for elemental measurement all samples were stored at 4 c before laboratory treatment and analysis 2 2 microplastics extraction the surface water samples were separated to remove any organic matter by wet peroxide oxidation wpo masura et al 2015 in detail the surface water sample was filtered through a 0 01 mm stainless steel sieve by vacuum filtration then the sieve was transferred to a 250 ml glass beaker to remove the organic matters and extract the mps a 0 05 m ferrous sulfate 20 ml and 30 hydrogen peroxide 20 ml solution was added to decompose the organic matter and heated to 75 c in a hotplate to accelerate the reaction if natural organic material was visible another 20 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide was added until no natural organic material was visible then 6 g of sodium chloride per 20 ml of sample was used to increase the density of the aqueous solution until the salt dissolved after setting the supernatant was filtered through stainless steel sieves with different pore sizes 0 01 mm 0 3 mm and 1 0 mm for further identification samples on the stainless steel sieves were flushed into a precleaned 250 ml beaker and then filtered through a 0 45 μm glass microfiber filter whatman gf b with a vacuum pump all the filtrates were stored in petri dishes and dried at 50 c for further identification to avoid potential background contamination a laboratory coat was worn and aluminum foil was used to cover all apparatus during the entire process in an ultra clean laboratory 2 3 microplastics identification the dried filter paper was firstly placed under the microscope sc iii china to randomly mark the suspected microplastics covering the visual particles next the suspected microplastics were examined to identify their polymer composition using a micro raman spectrometer thermo fisher scientific dxr2 532 nm laser raman shift 50 3500 cm 1 because the particle size was larger than 10 μm can be identified by micro raman spectrometer therefore we discriminated the suspected microplastics in the size range of 10 5000 μm by micro raman spectroscopy in this study once identified as microplastic the morphological characteristics were recorded including morphological types i e fragment film and fiber and size which were identified based on a previous study wang et al 2021 the abundance of mps was expressed as particles m3 the mp sizes could be divided into four classes 10 100 μm 100 300 μm 300 1000 μm and 1000 5000 μm the smps was defined as the mps with particle size 300 μm while the normal microplastics nmps were between 300 and 5000 μm 2 4 procedural blanks the unused meshes were prepared during sampling process for the procedural blanks for the blank test 20 l of milli q water were passed through the clean unused meshes in triplicate with the similar treatment to the samples meanwhile the laboratory blank in triplicate was also prepared the types of polymers in both procedural blank and laboratory blank were detected using micro raman spectrometer to obtain the background contamination 2 5 calculation of the stability and particle size of microplastics we used a model to understand the stability and particle size distribution of mps in surface water of the tgr based on the fragmentation induced size distribution cfd the simplified expression of this model can be defined as follows wang et al 2021 1 f x 1 e λ x α x 0 where λ determines the relative location of the cumulative size distribution of mps i e the size range of mps α defines the shape of the cumulative size distribution i e the fragmentation pattern specifically if the mps are relatively small a high value of α should be stabilized additionally the aging rate can be represented as λαxα 1 if α 1 meaning the probability of mp fragmentation is high with larger mp sizes and the weathering and downsizing processes could be eased to influence larger mps for smaller mps the process of downsizing would be suppressed if α 1 small mps will have an elevated probability of downsizing compared with that or larger mps the modeling parameters λ and α are the fingerprint parameters which can be used to rapidly identify the source apportionment of the mps in the environment wang et al 2021 if the values of the λ and α in this study were closed to the reference values it indicated that they have similar sources due to the lack of the λ and α values with different mp sources only some referential data are presented in fig 5c and table s1 in this study we calculated the λ and α values of morphological types and major polymers as shown in fig 5c to identify the sources of mps 2 6 measurement for ions concentrations different ions including anions cl no3 so4 and f and cations k na ca2 and mg2 in surface water samples were measured by a dionex ion chromatography system ics 2500 the total organic carbon content was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer elementar vario toc elementar co germany 2 7 pollution load index and pollution risk assessments for microplastics the pollution load index pli of mps was calculated based on previous study kabir et al 2021 a site with pli 1 was considered to be polluted the calculation of pli is as follows kabir et al 2021 2 p l i i c i c 0 3 pl i tgr pl i 1 pl i 2 pl i 3 pl i n n where i indicates a sampling sites n is the number of sampling sites in tgr ci indicates the mp abundance at site i and c0 indicates the minimum baseline concentration taken from the available literature we chose the lowest mp abundance in this study as baseline concentration c0 here plii is the pollution load index at sites i and plitgr is the mp pollution load index in tgr the pollution risk assessment for mps not only identified by abundances but also influenced by the different toxicity of the identified mp polymers therefore the toxicity indices were calculated based on the polymeric risks utilizing hazard scores from lithner et al 2011 the calculation processes of pollution risk assessment for mps were as follows 4 h i j 1 m p j i c i s j 5 h tgr h 1 h 2 h 3 h n n 6 p r i i h i p l i i 7 pr i tgr pr i 1 pr i 2 pr i 3 pr i n n where hi indicates the summation of mp polymeric risk indices at site i and h tgr indicates the polymeric risk in tgr prii indicates the pollution risk index of mps at the site i and pritgr indicates the pollution risk of mps for tgr area the j represents a polymer type m indicates the number of the identified polymer types pji is the number of each single mp polymer identified at sites i and sj is the risk score for each detected polymer referred to the previous report lithner et al 2011 the detected polymers and their score values were pe 11 pet 4 pp 1 ps 30 pvc 10 001 and pa 1 respectively in this reference lithner et al 2011 the categories of pri and h were listed in table s2 2 8 data analysis a correlation analysis and an independent samples t test were applied to determine significant differences using spss spss inc chicago when the data did not show a normal distribution the logarithm based on 10 was used for the data conversion and then to further test the independent samples t test the homoscedasticity and significance of the data were analyzed according to the results of the data analysis using spss the significant differences were established at 0 01 and 0 05 level of significance moreover the global distribution of mp abundances was mapped with arcgis 10 2 and origin 2021 was used to create the figures 3 results 3 1 abundance of microplastics up and downstream of the dam all the sampling sites were detected mps in the surface water in this study no mp particles were reliably identified as the polymers were detected in the procedural and laboratory blanks the average abundance of mps in the tgr surface water was 6214 5392 particles m3 mean standard deviation ranging from 974 particles m3 to 21 132 particles m3 while the average abundance of mps downstream of the tgd was 6215 3441 particles m3 in the range of 2353 particles m3 to 10 429 particles m3 fig 2 and table 1 for smps the average abundance in the tgr surface water was 4514 4803 particles m3 while the average abundance of nmps was 1701 1377 particles m3 the average of smps accounted for 65 4 18 6 of total mps while the nmps accounted for 34 6 18 6 of the total mps for the smps downstream of the tgd the average abundance was 4316 3028 particles m3 table 1 which accounted for 70 2 19 7 of total mps moreover there were no significant differences between the abundances of mps and smps in the tgr surface water and downstream of the tgd surface water p 0 565 for mps and p 0 459 for smps 3 2 morphological characteristics of microplastics up and downstream of the dam the morphological types of mps were classified into three categories fiber fragment and film with the following proportions in the tgr surface water fragments 55 1 fiber 43 2 film 1 7 fig 3 b1 for smps fragments and fibers were also the major morphological types in the tgr surface water accounting for 76 1 and 21 8 of smps respectively downstream of the tgd the proportion of fragments for mps slightly increased 61 1 while the fibers for mps decreased 35 9 fig 3b2 the smps in downstream of the tgd exhibited a similar trend to that in the tgr fig 3c2 which accounted for 77 1 for fragments and 19 4 for fibers respectively 3 3 particle size characteristics of microplastics in up and downstream of dam the particle size of all detected mps in this study ranged from 30 μm to 5000 μm in the tgr area mean 321 5 μm and downstream of the tgd area mean 313 2 μm further the 100 300 μm mps in the tgr showed the highest abundance 47 0 among the total mps fig 3a1 the following sizes were 300 1000 μm 10 100 μm and 1000 5000 μm accounting for 26 6 21 5 and 4 8 respectively fig 3a1 there was a high proportion of smps 10 300 μm in the surface water accounting for 68 5 of the total mps in the tgr the mean size of smps in the tgr was 139 6 63 7 μm fragments were the major morphological type with high percentage 76 1 in smps while the percentage of fragments in the nmp fraction was relatively lower 4 3 conversely fibers constituted a small fraction in smps 21 7 but were a main component of the nmp fraction 41 4 fig 3b1 and 3c1 for mps in downstream of the tgd the proportion of smps 10 300 μm was considerably high 72 8 while the nmps 300 5000 μm occupied 27 2 of mps downstream of the tgd specifically the proportion of 100 300 μm mps was 47 5 following by the sizes of 10 100 μm and 300 1000 μm mps accounting for 25 3 and 22 2 respectively fig 3a2 the smp fraction accounted for 72 8 of the total mps in downstream of the tgd with the mean size of 129 5 60 3 μm the proportion of fragments in the smps in downstream of the tgd 61 1 was lower than that in tgr while the percentage of fragments in the nmps was 18 5 the proportion of fibers in the smps accounted for 19 4 while it was 79 5 in nmps fig 3b2 and 3c2 3 4 polymer compositions of microplastics in up and downstream of dam the characteristics of mps in this study were presented in fig 4 seven polymer compositions were detected in the tgr surface water and downstream of the tgd which were cellulose polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc and nylon pa fig s4 pe was identified as a pervasive polymer group with significant proportion 41 6 in the tgr surface water followed by cellulose 29 1 pp 18 7 and pet 9 2 ps 0 9 while other polymers pvc and pa accounted for less than 1 such as pvc and pa for smps in the tgr the proportions of the main polymers were as follows pe 39 5 pp 12 9 cellulose 12 8 pet 1 9 except for pa the other polymer components were all detected in the surface water downstream of the tgd the proportions of these multiple polymers were as follows pe 35 4 pp 22 7 pet 22 2 cellulose 16 2 ps 3 0 pvc 0 5 fig 4a pe was still the main polymer component in the smps accounting for 32 3 followed by pp 20 2 cellulose 9 6 and pet 7 6 3 5 microplastic stability and fragmentation the major morphological types of mps in the tgr were fragments and fibers which fitted the conditional fragmentation based model well cfd r2 0 98 0 99 fig 5 for these morphological types the α values fragmentation parameter in the tgr showed a rising trend with the following order fibers 1 63 fragments 2 34 both α values of fragments and fiber were all higher than 1 fig 5 the λ values of fragments and fibers were 103 00 and 69 28 respectively fig 5 for the major polymer types of mps pe pp pet and cellulose in tgr surface water the order of α values for different polymers was as follows pe 2 51 cellulose 1 51 pp 1 42 pet 1 25 table s1 while the λ values was as follows pe 147 49 pp 6 47 cellulose 3 62 pet 1 15 the order of the aging rates λαxα 1 of these four polymer types was as follows pe 60 22 pp 5 53 cellulose 2 96 pet 1 07 table s1 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic organization after the catastrophic flood 4 1 1 influence of floods on microplastic abundances in the tgr mps can be significantly evacuated from the river catchment with a subsequent enhancement in scouring on the river bed and an increase in discharge of urban rainwater and sewage during floods hurley et al 2018 in the tgr area the average abundance of mps after the catastrophic flood in 2020 6214 particles m3 was increased by 57 9 compared with that report 2614 particles m3 in 2019 for a similar particle range he et al 2021 table 2 this rise of abundance in mps exhibited high spatial heterogeneity because of the high coefficient of variation table 1 the abundance with the same particle size category for mps 1 mm in this study 5910 particles m3 was remarkably higher than that of the previous report 1958 particles m3 leading to a 66 9 increase he et al 2021 interestingly the smps 300 μm dominated the abundance of mps in this study 65 4 18 6 ranging from 447 particles m3 to 18 053 particles m3 which early researches seldom focused on in the tgr fig 2 most of the freshwater research to date have evaluated the mps with a particle size greater than 300 μm due to the inconsistency of sampling and the limitations of the identification fig 1 the smps were not investigated comprehensively for the following reasons 1 most freshwater mp studies based on the particle size categories of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa protocol with mesh aperture 333 μm did not include mps with sizes smaller than 300 μm he et al 2021 masura et al 2015 mai et al 2019 2 most studies randomly selected a certain number of mp particles 50 200 suspected mp particles by picking with needles or tweezers which led to the selection of larger mp particles because of the artificial selectivity he et al 2021 mai et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 2019 in fact only six studies reported the particle size of mps 300 μm ding et al 2019 lin et al 2021 pan et al 2020 su et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 these studies exhibited high mp abundances which was attributed to the high abundances of smps in freshwater with proportions of smps of approximately 55 fig 1 moreover the smps were considered a threat to the aquatic organisms owing to their ease in ingestion and potential to retain other contaminants such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants pops on their large surface area auta et al 2017 cao et al 2021 wang et al 2019 4 1 2 microplastic variations in the morphological types and polymers the abundances of mps and smps not only increased after the catastrophic flood but also varied the morphological type composition of mps in the tgr surface water previous studies in tgr have segmented multiple morphological types of mps into fibers fragments pellets film and styrofoam with fibers and fragments dominating the mps 28 6 90 5 and 2 4 72 2 respectively di and wang 2018 zhang et al 2017 however the morphological types of mps after the 2020 catastrophic flood were detected three types including fragments fibers and films fig 3 additionally the fragments were now dominant in most of the surface water samples fig s1 these fragments were mainly concentrated in smps fig 3c1 interestingly a significant difference was not observed between that in tgr area upstream and downstream of tgd in surface water p 0 358 after the catastrophic flood period in 2020 six polymer types cellulose pe pet pp ps pvc and pa were detected in this study and pe became the main component of mps accounting for 41 6 fig 4 previous studies reported pp 29 4 90 91 and ps 38 5 as the commonly detected polymers while pe 21 0 had a low occurrence di and wang 2018 zhang et al 2017 except for the effect of flood scouring and mechanical force this change in major polymer types was mainly attributed to the previous neglect of high small size pe particles moreover pe mainly existed in smp fragments fig 4b and their proportions were 73 8 followed by pp 15 1 which was observed in our results fig 3d1 there was no significant difference between the pe proportions in the tgr surface water and downstream of the tgd p 0 638 therefore although the morphological types and proportion of polymer groups of mps changed after the catastrophic flood there was no significant difference between that in tgr surface water and downstream of tgd p 0 05 4 1 3 barrier effect of the three gorges dam on microplastics after flooding although the mps were obstructed in the surface water by the tgd in previous study zhang et al 2015 this study did not show that the mps in downstream of the tgd was lower than that of the tgr p 0 565 figs 2 and s1a this discrepancy between previous reports and our measurements may be attributed to the artificial operation of the tgr during the flood period which enhanced the connectivity of the yangtze river and east china sea and weakened the interception of the tgd during the flood period the discharge could have aggravated the mixing of water and promoted the homogenization of upstream and downstream of the tgd resulting in the increment of mp concentrations according to available research data li et al 2019 luo et al 2019 the average abundance of mps was higher downstream of the tgd in this study by 2 5 to 8 0 times than that of before in addition we first reported the effect of reservoir operation on smp abundances in the tgr and downstream of the tgd fig 2 there was no significant difference in the smp abundances in the tgr and downstream surface water of the tgd p 0 459 moreover the size proportions of smps upstream and downstream of the tgd indicated the homogenization of smps by reservoir operation the size distribution of smps did not reorganize in the tgr and downstream surface water of the tgd p 0 05 fig 3a1 and a2 attributing to the yangtze river becoming a free flowing system via the reservoir operation of the tgr during the flood period 4 2 stability and fragmentation of microplastics in the tgr surface water for morphological types of mps in tgr surface water the λ values indicated that the average size of the fragments was obviously smaller than that of fibers fig 5b in addition the fragmentation parameter α values in the tgr suggested that the stability increased from fibers to fragments this result should be attributed to the different fragmentation of fibers and fragments fibers were more susceptible to weathering and downsizing however the downsizing of fragments would be suppressed due to their small size αfragments αfibers α 1 fig 5 the results were supported by wang et al 2021 in figs 3 and 5c the fragments were the dominant the smp morphological types with 99 8 of cumulative percentage implying that fragments 300 μm reached a stable size distribution in this study the average size of fragments was 140 6 μm signifying that most of the fragments in the tgr were stable with the particle size smaller than 300 µm based on the order of α values the fragmentation of pe mps had reached a stable stage when the size of pe was lower than 300 μm the cumulative percentage reached 99 9 according to the cfd model the aging rate of different polymers in this study showed that pe had the highest aging rate 60 22 suggesting that pe should be easy to fragment preferentially to reach stability comparing with the other polymers this result meant that the pe should stay at its stable stage and be suppressed or slow to further fragment into smaller particles besides ions concentrations in surface water should influence the fragmentation and stabilization of mps in surface water with positive correlation trends p 0 05 fig s2 future studies should consider these mp fragmentation and degradation factors in the water environment 4 3 source identification of microplastics in the tgr surface water until now identifying the sources of mps in different environmental medias still faces great challenge however the morphological types and proportions can be inferred to have originated from direct discharge and fragmentation of plastic wastes wang et al 2021 in the tgr surface water the three sources of mps identified included containers packages wastewater sludge and agriculture films which were presented as λ vs α in figs 5c s3 and table s1 the dot values within the sewage wastewater group have covered the range for cellulose and pet this category indicated that cellulose and pet in surface water mainly originated from sewage wastewater in the tgr prior studies indicated that the plastic particles were found in raw sewage consisting of fibers dris et al 2015 most of the cellulose and pet were found in fibers in this study fig 4a which was probably the effluent from washing synthetic clothes browne et al 2011 this was also compatible with the findings of feng et al 2021 where pet fibers were the main contributor of domestic cloth washing 0 5 mm in length in addition the fertilizers represented the agricultural sources wang et al 2021 which was closed to the pet spot identified in this study this result meant that part of the pet in the tgr surface water originated from agriculture sources in the tgr area people would develop planting e g corn soybean peanut and ginger on the soils of water level fluctuating zone wlfz sun 2007 and the use of the agriculture films reached to more than thirty thousand tons sun 2007 the use of agriculture films enhanced the input of agricultural mps into the tgr water during the flooding period we also found that the wlfz soils and pet pp and cellulose could be grouped together which further certified the above observation as a result the plastic debris imported into the river during the flood period may not have enough time to fragment into small particles and thus the size of these polymers exhibited relatively larger than pe fragments as suggested by xiong et al 2019 unfortunately owing to the lack of data for mp sources especially for smp information it was impossible to ascertain the source of pe using the cfd model however fragments mainly pe and pp were the most common particles as has been in previous studies klein et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2018 these mp fragments may be attributed to the wide use of plastic materials such as food containers and plastic bags feng et al 2021 interestingly the points of α and λ for different polymers were all closed to the points for atmospheric deposition fig 5c indicating that the atmospheric deposition may be one of the transport pathways for multiple polymers the result is similar to a current study by allen et al 2019 where they represented atmospheric wet and dry deposition and identified fibers 750 μm long and fragments 300 μm as mps 4 4 potential ecological risks of small sized microplastics in the tgr surface water the potential pollution risks of mps were mainly affected by particle sizes morphological types and polymer compositions jung et al 2021 kabir et al 2021 in general all of the sampling sites were polluted with mps due to pli 1 in this study table s3 there were six types of polymers containing pe pet pp pvc ps and pa detected in tgr fig 4 considering the toxicity indices for each detected polymer hi values in table s3 the pri in tgr was 1 47 ranging from 0 07 to 21 28 for each sampling sites which was lower than a value of 150 table s2 the results indicated that although all sampling sites were polluted with mps pli 1 table s3 the mp pollution risk was at low a level for each sampling site table s2 recently researchers indicated that the toxicity of mps can also be influenced by their size and morphological types fragments and fibers previous studies were found that only non spherical mps fragments and fibers 20 300 μm could be the target for risk assessment due to the potential adverse biological effects jung et al 2021 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 the potential ecological risks of smps 300 μm have been obtained with the standard limit of predicted no effect concentration pnec value of smps 12 000 particles m3 jung et al 2021 in this study the smp fragments and fibers dominated the mps morphological types fig 3c1 and the abundances of smps were in the range of 447 particles m3 to 18 053 particles m3 mean 4514 particles m3 fig 2b the potential ecological risk of smps in most of sampling sites in the tgr did not exceed the standard limit of pnec 12 000 particles m3 however there were still three sampling sites accounting for 13 6 of all sampling sites in the tgr that required further much attention after the catastrophic flood because the abundances of smps in these sampling sites exceeded the standard limit 12 000 particles m3 jung et al 2021 in addition these three sampling sites were located near to the areas with high population density s11 and s14 were located in a town upstream of the tgr with 18 053 particles m3 and s27 was located midstream in the tributary zhuyi river with 12 605 particles m3 fig 2b implying that the anthropogenic influences may be the major cause of the elevated mp levels 5 conclusion the abundance organization patterns stability and source identification of mps and smps were investigated in the surface water of the tgr and downstream of the tgd after the catastrophic floods of 2020 in china the results showed that high levels of mps were found in the tgr surface water with the average abundance of 6214 particles m3 that increased by a 57 9 in 2019 the smps accounting for 65 4 of the total mps played an important role in mps affecting the overall abundance variation in the tgr pe dominated the polymer types in the tgr and was mainly concentrated in the smp fragments after the flood the proportion of morphological types and polymer types of mps did not significantly differ in upstream and downstream of the tgd pe fragments with a size smaller than 300 μm were in a stable stage there were three sources corresponding to anthropogenic activities including plastic containers wastewater and agricultural films while atmospheric deposition may be one mode of transportation for mps in the tgr area the mp level was at a low pollution risk with 13 6 of the sampling sites in the tgr water facing potential ecological risks driven by smps in conclusion this study demonstrated that the reservoir operation during the flood period can affect the land sea transportation of mps especially for the smps the quantification of the all size categories of mps should be encouraged for future researches understanding the organization transportation and ecological risk of smps in a range of environmental and hydrological conditions is crucial to scientifically assess their potential

16298,sewer sediments not only induce sewer blockages but also contributes to significant sulfide and methane productions in gravity sewer systems chemical control of sulfide and methane production is extremely expensive this study aims to propose a novel physical control approach intermittent surface sediment flushing to synchronously address sediment induced multiple issues the proposed approach was established investigating the suppression and recovery characteristics of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sediments including the in situ activity analysis by using the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt the results showed that 70 of total sulfide and methane production in sediments was contributed by surface sediments 0 1 5 cm which could be easily flushed away by a low shear stress 0 1 n m2 surface sediment flushing resulted in an immediate reduction in sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities which both required about one week to recover to 50 of the maximum these novel insights hopefully provide a feasible approach i e intermittent surface sediment flushing to effectively reduce sulfide and methane production in sewers compared with chemical dosing methods the proposed approach which has no chemical input greatly reduces operating cost and environment impact moreover intermittent surface flushing is expected to keep sediment thickness within a certain range to alleviate sewer blockage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity sewer sediment flushing sulfide and methane control sewer blockage 1 introduction sewer network is among the most critical urban infrastructure assets which collects and delivers sewage to downstream wastewater treatment plants for pollutant removal wang et al 2021 over 95 of sewers are gravity systems xu et al 2018 in which adverse hydraulic conditions such as slight flat slope are prevalent due to irregular construction wirahadikusumah et al 2001 this is very conducive to formation of anaerobic sediment beds rodríguez et al 2012 sediment induced sewer blockages and pollutants e g heavy metals release from combined sewer overflow cso have long been of a concern ten veldhuis et al 2009 el samrani et al 2008 kaeseberg et al 2018 lu et al 2020 over the past years sediments have also been shown sigrnificant sulfide and methane production potential liu et al 2015a 2015b zuo et al 2020b as a result of the abundant growth of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma within sediments liu et al 2016 the formation of sulfide not only causes malodor and health concerns but also erodes pipelines severely that requires costly rehabilitation gostelow et al 2001 pikaar et al 2014 the produced methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas with a 100 year global warming potential gwp100 28 times higher than co2 and contributes greatly to climate change ipcc 2014 therefore effective solutions against the problems caused by sediment in gravity sewers have a positive effect on the proper operation of sewer system and environmental protection in terms of sulfide and methane control in sewers chemical dosing is considered to be the most common method oxygen nitrate and iron salts can remove already produced sulfide foley et al 2009 guisasola et al 2008 2009 and free nitrous acid fna free ammonia fa and ferrate reduce sulfide and methane production by inactivating srb and ma jiang et al 2011 zuo et al 2020a 2020b gutierrez et al 2009 yan et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 most of these strategies aim to control sulfide and methane produced by biofilms in pressure sewers with simple operating conditions ganigue et al 2011 in complex gravity sewers sewer parameters e g flow pipe diameter slope and mean hydraulic depth vary spatially in a significant way leading to a great challenge for optimization of chemical dosing strategies moreover the required equipment and chemical consumption may lead to a high cost zhang et al 2008 therefore simpler and more operation friendly control methods for gravity sewer need to be further developed compared with chemical methods to mitigate sulfide and methane physical approach on sediments may be an economical and feasible alternative it is well known regular sediment cleaning in sewers is essential primarily to prevent sewer blockages and cso incidents high pressure flushing as the most common and cost effective cleaning technique shahsavari et al 2017 allows most sediments to be re suspended and entrained to the downstream points before being transported to the wastewater treatment plant fan et al 2001 from this regard the microorganisms in the sediment will likewise be removed with the flushing therefore it is reasonably speculated that the removal of sediments will synchronously lead to the control of sulfide and methane production however a great challenge is the potential re formation of new microbially active layers in surface sediments the interval time of sediment flushing is usually 50 150 days significantly longer than the recovery time of srb growth 10 day for half growth jiang et al 2011 this difference still leads to sulfide production between the two flushing events shortening the interval time of sewer flushing to match the srb growth rate may be a feasible approach however high frequency high pressure flushing would result in huge energy requirements and heavy labor demands recent studies have surfaced that sewer sediments have a complex spatial distribution and stratified structure both in terms of physical and microbial properties driven by different penetration abilities of multiple substrates e g sulfate and soluble organic matter sulfide and methane production usually occur near the sediment surface chen et al 2003 liu et al 2015a 2016 zuo et al 2020b 2021b this discovery provides a possible hypothesis that only flushing surface layer of sediments can also achieve significant effectiveness of sulfide and methane inhibition it can bring three possible benefits 1 the low shear stress for surface sediment flushing requires much less energy compared to the above mentioned flushing technique 2 surface sediment flushing helpfully keeps the sediment thickness within a certain value to prevent sewer blockage 3 replacing or reducing chemical dosing strategies can significantly reduce economic cost and environmental impacts to test our hypothesis a systematic test evaluation was conducted sediment was collected from real sewers and incubated for 100 days in five parallel laboratory scale sewer reactors to achieve steady sulfide and methane productions the effect of shear stress on sediment flushing thickness was first determined then contribution of different layers of sediments on sulfide and methane production was investigated using batch tests moreover the recovery process of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities after the flushing at a selected flushing thickness 1 5 cm was assessed the feasibility economic and environmental impacts of the proposed surface sediment flushing strategy were also discussed the outcomes from this evaluation will lead to new technology for solving sewer sediment induced multiple environment issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage and sediment source raw sewage was collected per day in a gravity sewer on the campus of tsinghua university beijing china the collected sewage was immediately transferred to a 4 c refrigerator to minimize water quality change the raw sewage contained 15 60 mg so4 2 s l 5 10 mg h2s s l ph 7 0 7 5 100 500 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l 10 50 mg volatile fatty acids vfa l and 1 mg dissolved ch4 l sewer sediment was collected from a mature gravity sewer at tsinghua university beijing china the sewer sediment was taken out using a shovel and immediately added to the reactor the total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the sediment was 65 3 3 5 and 2 8 0 5 wet weight and the bulk density contents was 1 3 0 1 g cm3 which were similar to previous studies zuo et al 2021b 2 2 sediment cultivation to mimic the realistic structure of sediment in sewers sediments were necessarily cultivated by long term feeding real sewer sewage to this end five lab scale sediment reactors r1 r5 were operated in parallel under anaerobic conditions fig s1 in the si the reactor was cylindrical with a volume of 2 1 l a diameter of 140 mm and height of 140 mm a constant speed mechanical stirrer was installed in the reactors to simulate the shear velocity on the sediments mechanical stirrer fitted with two stainless steels stirring paddles 4 cm above the sediment each being 80 mm in length the sewage inlet was located on the side of the reactor and the sewage outlet was located on the top side of the reactor for overflowing sewage all reactors were completely covered with black cloth to mimic the dark environment of the sewers the sediment zone in the reactor was 70 mm high and the remaining reactor space was completely filled with sewage the reactors were intermittently fed with domestic sewage using a peristaltic pump the feed pattern consisted of 16 times per day with 300 ml of sewage fed during each event resulting in an average wastewater retention time of 8 h which is similar to that in real sewers pikaar et al 2014 the experiment was carried out at room temperature approximately 18 20 c the biofilm on the reactor walls was cleaned once a week to prevent any impact on the sulfide production the operation of reactors lasted for nearly half a year to obtain mature and layered sewer sediments to ensure normal operation of the reactor sulfide and methane concentrations in the effluent of each reactor were monitored 3 4 times per week and the rate of sulfide and methane production was measured every 6 7 days see support material text s1 for batch experiments and measurement methods after the sediments achieved a steady state they were used to test the following experimental design 1 sediment anti scouribility 2 sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of different sediment layers 3 activity recovery after surface sediment flush and 4 downstream sediment activity tests table s1 in the si the four reactors r2 r5 were used to test the above designs in turn and the remaining reactor r1 was served as control reactor during all tests 2 3 sediment anti scouribility tests r2 was used to investigate the shear stress required to flush sediments of different thicknesses the reactor influent and effluent were continued for half an hour at each stirring speed i e 6 38 67 90 108 and 120 rpm then the overlying water was drained and sediment thickness recorded the critical shear stress and flow velocity were calculated from the rotational speed and the equations were described in detail in text s2 and table s2 2 4 sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities in sediment r3 was used to test the contribution of different sediment layers to sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities the sediment in r3 was scraped off manually for a more precise thickness using a spatula to remove 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 cm thicknesses of sediment in sequence batch tests were immediately carried out in r1 and r3 reactors when scraping each thickness of r3 to examine the effect of scraping on sulfide and methane production the effect of sediment removal of different thicknesses on sulfidogenic and methanogenic was expressed as the ratio of r3 activity to r1 activity the average concentration of sulfide and methane produced in each layer was calculated by dividing the average value of the difference in each layer by the volume of sediment 2 5 activity recovery after surface sediment flush the recovery of sulfide and methane production following sediment flushing was studied in r4 with r1 as the control a 1 5 cm thickness of sediment was flushed off by the stirring paddle speed at 35 rpm 0 05 n m 2 in r4 reactor on day 0 from day 0 to day 50 sulfide methane and soluble cod scod concentrations in the influent and effluent of r1 and r4 reactors were monitored daily and the rates of sulfide and methane production were measured every 3 4 days throughout the batch test furthermore a novel in situ analysis technique dgt was used to determine the sulfide activity recovery within sediments widerlund et al 2007 the dgt device was inserted in the sediments of r1 on day 1 r4 on day 1 and r4 on day 45 respectively the water in the reactor was first completely emptied and fresh sewage was pumped in until it filled the reactor after waiting for 20 min for the substrate in the sewage to be completely and uniformly distributed in the reactor the dgt probe was inserted vertically into the sediment in the reactors which were completely enclosed to prevent the loss of sulfide the dgt probe was removed after 40 min and a ceramic knife was used to mark the water sediment interface the binding gel was removed from the dgt probe and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and its surface was dried with filter paper before analysis section 2 7 2 6 downstream sediment activity tests to investigate the impact of sediment flushing on downstream sulfide and methane production the sediment that was flushed off from r4 reactor on day 0 as described in the section 2 5 was added directly to r5 reactor after r5 reactor was stabilized after 2 days the sulfide and methane production rates were measured every 3 4 days throughout the batch test 2 7 analytical methods the sulfide cod sulfate and vfas concentrations were determined using a standard method ministry of environmental protection 2006 for the measurement of dissolved methane 2 ml wastewater was filtered into vacutainer tubes using a hypodermic needle attached to a plastic syringe these tubes allow gas liquid equilibrium to be achieved overnight then the methane content in the gas phase was determined by gas chromatography gc 7890 a agilent usa with flame ionization detector fid therefore using mass balance and henry s law the concentration of methane in the liquid phase can be calculated guisasola et al 2008 each zro agi binding gel of dgt obtained from the activity recovery study was scanned in a flat bed scanner canon 5600f resolution 600 dpi 0 042 0 042 mm and the grayscale intensity of the scanned images was analyzed with imagej 1 42 downloaded from http rsb info nih gov ij the accumulated mass of sulfide was calculated using the exponential eq 1 ding et al 2012 1 y 171 e x 7 23 220 where y is the corresponding grayscale intensity and x is the accumulated mass of sulfide per unit area g m 2 the flux of sulfide in the sediment measured by dgt was calculated using the following eq 2 zhang et al 1998 2 f x t where f is the sulfide flux g m 2 d 1 and t is the deployment time d 0 028d in this study 3 results 3 1 critical shear stress for flushing different layers of sediment bed the critical shear stress in the sediment bed has a crucial influence on the effectiveness of flushing the relationship between sediment thickness with high sulfide production activity after long term domestication and critical bed shear stress and flow rate is shown in fig 1 the results show that the required critical shear stress increases with flushing the increased sediment thickness the trend was consistent with the results of previous studies on the relationship between sediment depth and flush resistance in the combined sewer meng et al 2019 najafzadeh et al 2017 perrusquía et al 1995 it is worth noting that the critical shear stress for flushing sediments at a surface thickness of 2 3 cm is 0 06 n m2 a further sharply increase in shear stress from 0 06 to 0 62 n m2 with sediment thickness from 2 3 to 3 8 cm this implies that much more energy is required to flush the entire sediment layer than to flush only the surface sediments 3 2 profiles of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities in sediment bed to identify the critical layers for sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities in sediment bed batch rate tests were immediately carried out r1 control and r3 experiment when scraping different thickness 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 cm of r3 the rates of sulfide and methane productions after removing different thicknesses of sediments were illustrated in fig 2 the results showed that the sulfide and methane production rates in sediments dropped significantly from 12 to 2 7 g s m 2 d 1 and from 8 8 to 2 0 g ch4 m 2 d 1 respectively with the increase of removing thickness from 0 to 1 5 cm whereas a further increase of removing thickness from 1 5 to 2 5 cm did not further decrease the sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sediments the sulfidogenic and methanogenic activity ratios as shown in fig 2c and d illustrated that 68 of sulfide and 73 methane productions were reduced by removing 1 5 cm thickness of surface sediment this indicates that removing shallow surface the sediments can efficiently control sulfide and methane in sewers an unexpected result was that sulfide and methane productions were still existent although at reduced levels this result that was inconsistent with previous experiments chen et al 2003 liu et al 2015a 2016 zuo et al 2020b 2021b necessitates further analysis of the sulfide and methane producing zones using the removal of the difference value in sulfide and methane production rates of different layers of sediments the average sulfide and methane production rates of different layers can be visually characterized the sulfide production rates were 1040 g s m 3 d 1 in the surface layer of 0 0 5 cm sediments and then decreased sharply with depth fig 3 a this indicates that the sulfide production is mainly concentrated within the 0 1 5 cm of surface sediments but there is still a small amount of sulfide producing activity at the bottom the methane production rate in the surface layer 0 0 5 cm was 570 g m 3 d 1and also decreased with depth but more slowly than for sulfide fig 3b this means that methane production is also predominantly in the surface layer but more evenly distributed than sulfide production in sediment 3 3 effectiveness of surface sediment flushing on controlling sulfidogenic and methanogenic production fig 4 a and b show the sulfide and methane production rates before and after flushing the 1 5 cm of surface sediment in r4 reactor relative to that in the control reactor r1 during the entire experimental period the sulfide and methane production rates of control reactor r1 remained stable the experimental reactor r4 had sulfide and methane production rates similar to r1 before the sediment scraping on day 0 sulfide and methane concentrations in the inlet and outlet water of all reactors are shown in the supplementary information fig s2 the sediment decreased in thickness by 1 5 cm after being flushed by a shear stress of 0 05 n m2 consistent with the above measurements of the critical shear stress required to flush the sediment the physical chemical properties and microbial communities of the top 1 5 cm of sediment flushed out of the reactor are shown in the supplementary information table s3 and fig s3 sulfide and methane activity ratios were reduced to 27 and 30 respectively after flushing consistent with the results of viability tests reported above fig 4c showed the two dimensional distribution of the sulfide production activity before and after flushing the sediments measured using the dgt the results showed that after flushing the surface sediment there were no obvious areas of high sulfide production in the sediment and the sulfide flux was lower than that in the sediment below 1 5 cm in the control reactor this result is consistent with the above results it indicates that the high sulfide producing areas has been removed by flushing the top 1 5 cm of the sediment and the sulfide production rate in the low sulfide producing areas at the bottom is reduced after flushing it is evident that sulfide and methane production rates of the sediment started to recover without a lag phase on 16th day sulfide and methane production recovered to 90 and 80 of control reactor levels respectively and were maintained at these levels thereafter this indicates that a single flush of the sediment surface can sustain a 16 day reduction in sulfide and methane production the depth distribution of the fully recovered sulfide producing activity of the sediment was tested by the dgt technique fig 4 c showed the sulfide production zones in r4 reactor on day 45 the results showed that the sulfide producing zone of sediment also appeared within 1 5 cm of the surface sediments similar to the sulfide producing zone of the control reactor a second flushing of sediment under the same conditions was carried out for r4 reactor at day 50 the results showed that the second flush had the same effect on sulfide and methane removal as the first i e 70 reduction not shown in the figure this indicates that long term regular sediment surface flushing can provide effective sulfide and methane control therefore the success of low shear surface flushing and the need for effective and long term control of sulfide and methane implies a novel sewer management strategy intermittent surface sediment flushing 3 4 synchronous impact of surface sediment flushing on downstream sediment activity flushing surface sediments upstream in gravity sewers and redeposition downstream may theoretically enhance sulfide and methane production in downstream sewers fig 5 showed the change in sulfide and methane production rates relative to the corresponding r1 rates as the sediment is discharged to the downstream reactor r5 the results showed that the sulfide and methane production of reactor r5 were similar to the control reactor r1 before sediment discharge after discharge on day 0 sulfide production showed a slight decrease on day 2 and returned to a level similar to that of the control reactor on day 9 in contrast no significant change in methane production was observed and it remained at similar level to the control this indicates that upstream sediment discharge does not increase downstream methane production and does reduce downstream sulfide production by a small amount 3 5 model based analysis the exponential decay model y y0 ae bx has been used to describe the fna ferrate and fa biocidal effects on the anaerobic sewer biofilms in previous studies jiang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 zuo et al 2020a in this study we have modelled the ratio of sulfide to methane production in the sediment after scraping at different thicknesses instead of the proportion of viable cells after inactivator application as shown in fig 2c and d this model had a satisfactory description of the dependency of the sulfide and methane activity ratio with sediment removal thickness the model predicts were good correlation to experimentally measured data with a high r square coefficient as 0 99 the parameter y0 indicates the residual percentage of viable microorganisms the y0 values of residual sulfide and methane production viable microorganisms is 26 4 and 19 2 in this study in previous studies y0 total residual viable microorganisms was 27 2 and 20 7 for the inactivators fa and ferrate respectively this indicates that removing sulfide and methane producing microorganisms by scraping the surface sediment has a similar effect to reduce methane and sulfide production by killing the total microorganisms with inactivators the gompertz growth equation was used to fit the recovery phase jiang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 as shown in fig 4a and b it is clear that the recovery process is similar to microbial regrowth according to the model prediction the time required for 50 recovery rt50 of sulfide production rate was 6 7 days this result is consistent with the previously reported rt50 i e 6 days for the inhibitory effect of fna on sediments but slightly lower than rt50 i e 10 1 days for biofilm inactivation by ferrate the rt50 of methane production rate was 7 3 days this result is significantly lower relative to the rt50 after inactivation of biofilms by fna and ferrate i e 44 5 and 58 respectively this is mainly due to the small reduction in methane production from flushing which only reduces it to 30 all of these previous models used to simulate the above mentioned inactivators provide a good fit for the control of sulfide and methane by surface flushing sediments this indicates that controlling sulfide and methane production by removing surface sediment has a similar effect to past control methods with biocides this method could replace other inactivators and serve as a new control method 4 discussion 4 1 heterogeneity of sulfide and methane production in sediment this study firstly accurately measured the distribution of sulfide and methane production rates along the sediment depth for the first time fig 3 previous studies determined sulfide and methane production zones using microelectrode combined with model analysis kuhl et al 1992 liu et al 2015a or using dgt technique for direct observation zuo et al 2021a 2021b although these two methods could determine the apparent concentration of sulfide in sediment it is difficult to precisely identify the specific sulfide production rate in different layers of sediment this is due to the diffusion of sulfide up and down and the different rates of sulfide diffusion caused by the water content of different layers of sediment in this study fresh effluent was supplied to the whole sediment and the excess substrate concentration eliminated errors due to diffusion the differential values between sulfide and methane production rates in sediments of different thicknesses provides a visual representation of the average production rate of this different layer compared with what was previously reported this study discovered a different vertical profile of sulfide and methane production in sediments i e surface sediment layer 0 1 5 cm only contributed to 70 of the total productions under anaerobic sewage condition fig 3 we speculate that this difference across studies is related to the differences in substrate concentrations in the sewage used for the experiments kuhl et al 1992 liu et al 2015a when the substrate in the effluent is constant the srb and ma form a stable active layer on the surface where they completely consume the substrate and result in no sulfide and methane production on the bottom under the condition of unstable sewage substrate concentration surface sediment may not have a stable microbial community that fully consume the substrate leading to thicker active top layer as well as srb and ma formation in bottom layer the distribution of substrate concentrations is inconsistent in real sewers pikaar et al 2014 this requires the identification of active thicknesses in the sediment by techniques such as dgt when applying surface flushing techniques in real sewers the variable hydraulic conditions in gravity sewers result in a wide range of dissolved oxygen in the effluent although aerobic conditions substantially reduce the amount of sulfide and methane production in the sediment there is still the aerobic condition of the effluent drives the migration of srb and ma from the surface sediments to deeper layers zuo et al 2021a this study only considered the distribution of sulfide and methane production in the sediment under anaerobic conditions and did not consider aerobic conditions therefore further studies on the distribution under aerobic conditions are needed in addition to this banasiak et al 2005 found that sediments under aerobic conditions were less anti scouribility relative to anaerobic conditions we speculate that flushing aerobic surface sediments has a more optimistic effect for carbon source depletion and sulfide and methane control in sewers but further studies are needed to verify this 4 2 the proposed novel physical approach intermittent surface sediment flushing the sediment in a qualified sewer is dynamically changing due to changes in flow rate dynamics throughout the day rarely accumulates and microbial activity however due to the extremely complex conditions of the sewers the sediments of sulfide and methane producing tend to accumulate in the pipes over a long period of time these sediments are concentrated in areas that are difficult to flush out such as in areas with flat and inverted slopes of the pipe where the flow velocity is extremely low even at high flows zuo et al 2019 these areas are also hot spots that cause blockage problems and need to be flushed of sediment conventional flushing methods may still lead to significant sulfide and methane production between flushing cycles because of rapid growth of microorganisms the method of this study is to reduce the microbial activity of the sediment by emulating the high frequency of dynamic flow processes in qualified sewers in this study 7 days was the time point at which 50 of sulfide and methane productions were recovered after flushing this means that a lower than7 day flushing frequency is mandatory for the sewer to reduce sulfide and methane however the high frequency of complete sediment removal over a long period of time inevitably leads to the generation of bottom biofilms which also result in sulfide and methane production and may be more difficult to remove therefore maintaining the sediment bed at a constant thickness through high frequency removal of the surface sediment is a promising way to control sulfide and methane production and sewer blockage the rate of sediment deposit is different in different sewers ashley et al 2004 ashley and verbanck 1996 resulting in dynamic flushing frequencies that need to be calculated for specific sewer the low energy demand of surface sediment flushing on sulfide and methane control provides the feasibility of high frequency flushing the traditional manual method of flushing sediment is to pump the water into the sewer at a manhole via a tank truck to create a heavy flow of water to flush the sediment however conventional flushing methods perform high pressure flushing when deposits accumulate to the point of a potential blockage the long term accumulation of and biochemical reactions in sediment in the sewer make the sediment more resistant against flushing regueiro picallo et al 2020 seco et al 2014 which makes the complete sediment flushing waste a lot of energy in contrast high frequency surface sediment flushing of the sewer in time prevents the increase of resistant to flushing this will have important implications for saving energy used in sediment cleaning in recent years automatic flushing gate fg equipment has become the best choice for flushing drains due to being more economical previous fg equipment has been designed to provide a minimum bed shear of 2 n m2 goormans et al 2009 shahsavari et al 2017 which is sufficient for flushing surface sediments this automatic flushing device is a best way to achieve the high frequency and low energy surface sediment flushing 4 3 implications the reduction of sulfide and methane production by surface sediment flushing has similar effect to previous inactivators e g fa fna jiang et al 2011 zuo et al 2020a 2020b however the flushing technique has a limited removal effect and does not entirely remove sulfide and methane for complete removal of sulfide and methane surface flushing techniques must be combined with inactivators e g fa fna ferrate or removers e g iron nitrate oxygen predictably when operating with combined inactivators the soaking concentration and time required for inactivator penetration is greatly reduced due to the removal of surface sediment similarly compared to direct dosing removers for sulfide and methane control sediment surface flushing saves about 70 chemical consumption therefore the use of chemical dosing strategies in combination with flushing techniques can significantly reduce the consumption of chemicals moreover sediment surface flushing has an implication for reducing carbon source losses in sewage transport in sewers the sewage loses 80 of its carbon source in sewer transport causing a shortage of carbon for the nitrogen and phosphorus removal process at the wastewater treatment plant most of the dissolved organic matter is consumed in the process of producing sulfide and methane guisasola et al 2009 surface sediment flushing can reduce scod losses by 36 fig s4 insoluble organic matter can settle in sewers to form sediment beds and then be discharged directly into the water environment during cso events or gradually hydrolyzed to form soluble organic matter to produce sulfide and methane insoluble organic matter in the sediment bed is mainly concentrated in the surface layer due to its low density laplace et al 2003 particulate organic matter will be transported in greater quantities to the wastewater treatment plant during surface flushing this further reduces the loss of carbon source in the transport of sewage in sewers moreover due to surface sediment accounts for 70 of the organic pollution from cso events laplace et al 2003 the long term removal of surface sediment reduces the water pollution caused during cso events in addition to gravity sewers sewage pumping stations in force and gravity mains are also places that are often attacked by sulfide large amounts of sediment in the pumping station produce sulfide at the bottom and corrode the pumping station equipment when released hann et al 1983 however completely removing large amounts of sediment is extremely difficult for pumping stations this study provides a viable idea for controlling sulfide and methane production in pumping stations by removing surface layers from pumping station sediment at a high frequency a final deserving discussion concerns the economic implications of surface sediment flushing in gravity sewer the total cost of the strategy is expected to be low as the intermittent flushing without any chemical consumption the cost of intermittent flushing strategy to achieve 70 sulfide and methane control only is 1 8 kg s based on the results in section 3 3 a flush gate and a flushing interval of 2 5 days for achieving sulfide control efficiency of 70 it is much lower than the most chemical dosing for sulfide and methane control such as using ferric ferrous and nitrate shown in table s4 cao et al 2019 yan et al 2020 liu et al 2015b the intermittent surface flushing method reduces the energy required for traditional high pressure flushing e g high pressure water gun and flush tank truck which also could save significant costs overall surface sediment flushing a two birds with one stone strategy can cost effectively control sewer corrosion odor and greenhouse gas which bears great application potential in sewer management 5 conclusions a novel physical control approach by the intermittent surface sediment flushing for the simultaneous control of sulfide and methane in sewers was proposed and evaluated based on the systematic experimental exploration the main conclusions include the following points the production of sulfide and methane in the sediments is mainly but not exclusively in the surface layer intermittent surface sediment flushing effectively reduces sulfide and methane production and their activities will require one week to recovery to 50 of the maximum maintaining the sediment bed at a constant thickness through high frequency removal of the surface sediment is a promising way to address sediment induced multiple issues surface sediment flushing is easily implemented by a low shear stress 0

16298,sewer sediments not only induce sewer blockages but also contributes to significant sulfide and methane productions in gravity sewer systems chemical control of sulfide and methane production is extremely expensive this study aims to propose a novel physical control approach intermittent surface sediment flushing to synchronously address sediment induced multiple issues the proposed approach was established investigating the suppression and recovery characteristics of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sediments including the in situ activity analysis by using the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt the results showed that 70 of total sulfide and methane production in sediments was contributed by surface sediments 0 1 5 cm which could be easily flushed away by a low shear stress 0 1 n m2 surface sediment flushing resulted in an immediate reduction in sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities which both required about one week to recover to 50 of the maximum these novel insights hopefully provide a feasible approach i e intermittent surface sediment flushing to effectively reduce sulfide and methane production in sewers compared with chemical dosing methods the proposed approach which has no chemical input greatly reduces operating cost and environment impact moreover intermittent surface flushing is expected to keep sediment thickness within a certain range to alleviate sewer blockage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gravity sewer sediment flushing sulfide and methane control sewer blockage 1 introduction sewer network is among the most critical urban infrastructure assets which collects and delivers sewage to downstream wastewater treatment plants for pollutant removal wang et al 2021 over 95 of sewers are gravity systems xu et al 2018 in which adverse hydraulic conditions such as slight flat slope are prevalent due to irregular construction wirahadikusumah et al 2001 this is very conducive to formation of anaerobic sediment beds rodríguez et al 2012 sediment induced sewer blockages and pollutants e g heavy metals release from combined sewer overflow cso have long been of a concern ten veldhuis et al 2009 el samrani et al 2008 kaeseberg et al 2018 lu et al 2020 over the past years sediments have also been shown sigrnificant sulfide and methane production potential liu et al 2015a 2015b zuo et al 2020b as a result of the abundant growth of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic archaea ma within sediments liu et al 2016 the formation of sulfide not only causes malodor and health concerns but also erodes pipelines severely that requires costly rehabilitation gostelow et al 2001 pikaar et al 2014 the produced methane is a highly potent greenhouse gas with a 100 year global warming potential gwp100 28 times higher than co2 and contributes greatly to climate change ipcc 2014 therefore effective solutions against the problems caused by sediment in gravity sewers have a positive effect on the proper operation of sewer system and environmental protection in terms of sulfide and methane control in sewers chemical dosing is considered to be the most common method oxygen nitrate and iron salts can remove already produced sulfide foley et al 2009 guisasola et al 2008 2009 and free nitrous acid fna free ammonia fa and ferrate reduce sulfide and methane production by inactivating srb and ma jiang et al 2011 zuo et al 2020a 2020b gutierrez et al 2009 yan et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 most of these strategies aim to control sulfide and methane produced by biofilms in pressure sewers with simple operating conditions ganigue et al 2011 in complex gravity sewers sewer parameters e g flow pipe diameter slope and mean hydraulic depth vary spatially in a significant way leading to a great challenge for optimization of chemical dosing strategies moreover the required equipment and chemical consumption may lead to a high cost zhang et al 2008 therefore simpler and more operation friendly control methods for gravity sewer need to be further developed compared with chemical methods to mitigate sulfide and methane physical approach on sediments may be an economical and feasible alternative it is well known regular sediment cleaning in sewers is essential primarily to prevent sewer blockages and cso incidents high pressure flushing as the most common and cost effective cleaning technique shahsavari et al 2017 allows most sediments to be re suspended and entrained to the downstream points before being transported to the wastewater treatment plant fan et al 2001 from this regard the microorganisms in the sediment will likewise be removed with the flushing therefore it is reasonably speculated that the removal of sediments will synchronously lead to the control of sulfide and methane production however a great challenge is the potential re formation of new microbially active layers in surface sediments the interval time of sediment flushing is usually 50 150 days significantly longer than the recovery time of srb growth 10 day for half growth jiang et al 2011 this difference still leads to sulfide production between the two flushing events shortening the interval time of sewer flushing to match the srb growth rate may be a feasible approach however high frequency high pressure flushing would result in huge energy requirements and heavy labor demands recent studies have surfaced that sewer sediments have a complex spatial distribution and stratified structure both in terms of physical and microbial properties driven by different penetration abilities of multiple substrates e g sulfate and soluble organic matter sulfide and methane production usually occur near the sediment surface chen et al 2003 liu et al 2015a 2016 zuo et al 2020b 2021b this discovery provides a possible hypothesis that only flushing surface layer of sediments can also achieve significant effectiveness of sulfide and methane inhibition it can bring three possible benefits 1 the low shear stress for surface sediment flushing requires much less energy compared to the above mentioned flushing technique 2 surface sediment flushing helpfully keeps the sediment thickness within a certain value to prevent sewer blockage 3 replacing or reducing chemical dosing strategies can significantly reduce economic cost and environmental impacts to test our hypothesis a systematic test evaluation was conducted sediment was collected from real sewers and incubated for 100 days in five parallel laboratory scale sewer reactors to achieve steady sulfide and methane productions the effect of shear stress on sediment flushing thickness was first determined then contribution of different layers of sediments on sulfide and methane production was investigated using batch tests moreover the recovery process of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities after the flushing at a selected flushing thickness 1 5 cm was assessed the feasibility economic and environmental impacts of the proposed surface sediment flushing strategy were also discussed the outcomes from this evaluation will lead to new technology for solving sewer sediment induced multiple environment issues 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage and sediment source raw sewage was collected per day in a gravity sewer on the campus of tsinghua university beijing china the collected sewage was immediately transferred to a 4 c refrigerator to minimize water quality change the raw sewage contained 15 60 mg so4 2 s l 5 10 mg h2s s l ph 7 0 7 5 100 500 mg chemical oxygen demand cod l 10 50 mg volatile fatty acids vfa l and 1 mg dissolved ch4 l sewer sediment was collected from a mature gravity sewer at tsinghua university beijing china the sewer sediment was taken out using a shovel and immediately added to the reactor the total solids ts and volatile solids vs of the sediment was 65 3 3 5 and 2 8 0 5 wet weight and the bulk density contents was 1 3 0 1 g cm3 which were similar to previous studies zuo et al 2021b 2 2 sediment cultivation to mimic the realistic structure of sediment in sewers sediments were necessarily cultivated by long term feeding real sewer sewage to this end five lab scale sediment reactors r1 r5 were operated in parallel under anaerobic conditions fig s1 in the si the reactor was cylindrical with a volume of 2 1 l a diameter of 140 mm and height of 140 mm a constant speed mechanical stirrer was installed in the reactors to simulate the shear velocity on the sediments mechanical stirrer fitted with two stainless steels stirring paddles 4 cm above the sediment each being 80 mm in length the sewage inlet was located on the side of the reactor and the sewage outlet was located on the top side of the reactor for overflowing sewage all reactors were completely covered with black cloth to mimic the dark environment of the sewers the sediment zone in the reactor was 70 mm high and the remaining reactor space was completely filled with sewage the reactors were intermittently fed with domestic sewage using a peristaltic pump the feed pattern consisted of 16 times per day with 300 ml of sewage fed during each event resulting in an average wastewater retention time of 8 h which is similar to that in real sewers pikaar et al 2014 the experiment was carried out at room temperature approximately 18 20 c the biofilm on the reactor walls was cleaned once a week to prevent any impact on the sulfide production the operation of reactors lasted for nearly half a year to obtain mature and layered sewer sediments to ensure normal operation of the reactor sulfide and methane concentrations in the effluent of each reactor were monitored 3 4 times per week and the rate of sulfide and methane production was measured every 6 7 days see support material text s1 for batch experiments and measurement methods after the sediments achieved a steady state they were used to test the following experimental design 1 sediment anti scouribility 2 sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of different sediment layers 3 activity recovery after surface sediment flush and 4 downstream sediment activity tests table s1 in the si the four reactors r2 r5 were used to test the above designs in turn and the remaining reactor r1 was served as control reactor during all tests 2 3 sediment anti scouribility tests r2 was used to investigate the shear stress required to flush sediments of different thicknesses the reactor influent and effluent were continued for half an hour at each stirring speed i e 6 38 67 90 108 and 120 rpm then the overlying water was drained and sediment thickness recorded the critical shear stress and flow velocity were calculated from the rotational speed and the equations were described in detail in text s2 and table s2 2 4 sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities in sediment r3 was used to test the contribution of different sediment layers to sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities the sediment in r3 was scraped off manually for a more precise thickness using a spatula to remove 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 cm thicknesses of sediment in sequence batch tests were immediately carried out in r1 and r3 reactors when scraping each thickness of r3 to examine the effect of scraping on sulfide and methane production the effect of sediment removal of different thicknesses on sulfidogenic and methanogenic was expressed as the ratio of r3 activity to r1 activity the average concentration of sulfide and methane produced in each layer was calculated by dividing the average value of the difference in each layer by the volume of sediment 2 5 activity recovery after surface sediment flush the recovery of sulfide and methane production following sediment flushing was studied in r4 with r1 as the control a 1 5 cm thickness of sediment was flushed off by the stirring paddle speed at 35 rpm 0 05 n m 2 in r4 reactor on day 0 from day 0 to day 50 sulfide methane and soluble cod scod concentrations in the influent and effluent of r1 and r4 reactors were monitored daily and the rates of sulfide and methane production were measured every 3 4 days throughout the batch test furthermore a novel in situ analysis technique dgt was used to determine the sulfide activity recovery within sediments widerlund et al 2007 the dgt device was inserted in the sediments of r1 on day 1 r4 on day 1 and r4 on day 45 respectively the water in the reactor was first completely emptied and fresh sewage was pumped in until it filled the reactor after waiting for 20 min for the substrate in the sewage to be completely and uniformly distributed in the reactor the dgt probe was inserted vertically into the sediment in the reactors which were completely enclosed to prevent the loss of sulfide the dgt probe was removed after 40 min and a ceramic knife was used to mark the water sediment interface the binding gel was removed from the dgt probe and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and its surface was dried with filter paper before analysis section 2 7 2 6 downstream sediment activity tests to investigate the impact of sediment flushing on downstream sulfide and methane production the sediment that was flushed off from r4 reactor on day 0 as described in the section 2 5 was added directly to r5 reactor after r5 reactor was stabilized after 2 days the sulfide and methane production rates were measured every 3 4 days throughout the batch test 2 7 analytical methods the sulfide cod sulfate and vfas concentrations were determined using a standard method ministry of environmental protection 2006 for the measurement of dissolved methane 2 ml wastewater was filtered into vacutainer tubes using a hypodermic needle attached to a plastic syringe these tubes allow gas liquid equilibrium to be achieved overnight then the methane content in the gas phase was determined by gas chromatography gc 7890 a agilent usa with flame ionization detector fid therefore using mass balance and henry s law the concentration of methane in the liquid phase can be calculated guisasola et al 2008 each zro agi binding gel of dgt obtained from the activity recovery study was scanned in a flat bed scanner canon 5600f resolution 600 dpi 0 042 0 042 mm and the grayscale intensity of the scanned images was analyzed with imagej 1 42 downloaded from http rsb info nih gov ij the accumulated mass of sulfide was calculated using the exponential eq 1 ding et al 2012 1 y 171 e x 7 23 220 where y is the corresponding grayscale intensity and x is the accumulated mass of sulfide per unit area g m 2 the flux of sulfide in the sediment measured by dgt was calculated using the following eq 2 zhang et al 1998 2 f x t where f is the sulfide flux g m 2 d 1 and t is the deployment time d 0 028d in this study 3 results 3 1 critical shear stress for flushing different layers of sediment bed the critical shear stress in the sediment bed has a crucial influence on the effectiveness of flushing the relationship between sediment thickness with high sulfide production activity after long term domestication and critical bed shear stress and flow rate is shown in fig 1 the results show that the required critical shear stress increases with flushing the increased sediment thickness the trend was consistent with the results of previous studies on the relationship between sediment depth and flush resistance in the combined sewer meng et al 2019 najafzadeh et al 2017 perrusquía et al 1995 it is worth noting that the critical shear stress for flushing sediments at a surface thickness of 2 3 cm is 0 06 n m2 a further sharply increase in shear stress from 0 06 to 0 62 n m2 with sediment thickness from 2 3 to 3 8 cm this implies that much more energy is required to flush the entire sediment layer than to flush only the surface sediments 3 2 profiles of sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities in sediment bed to identify the critical layers for sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities in sediment bed batch rate tests were immediately carried out r1 control and r3 experiment when scraping different thickness 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 cm of r3 the rates of sulfide and methane productions after removing different thicknesses of sediments were illustrated in fig 2 the results showed that the sulfide and methane production rates in sediments dropped significantly from 12 to 2 7 g s m 2 d 1 and from 8 8 to 2 0 g ch4 m 2 d 1 respectively with the increase of removing thickness from 0 to 1 5 cm whereas a further increase of removing thickness from 1 5 to 2 5 cm did not further decrease the sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities of sediments the sulfidogenic and methanogenic activity ratios as shown in fig 2c and d illustrated that 68 of sulfide and 73 methane productions were reduced by removing 1 5 cm thickness of surface sediment this indicates that removing shallow surface the sediments can efficiently control sulfide and methane in sewers an unexpected result was that sulfide and methane productions were still existent although at reduced levels this result that was inconsistent with previous experiments chen et al 2003 liu et al 2015a 2016 zuo et al 2020b 2021b necessitates further analysis of the sulfide and methane producing zones using the removal of the difference value in sulfide and methane production rates of different layers of sediments the average sulfide and methane production rates of different layers can be visually characterized the sulfide production rates were 1040 g s m 3 d 1 in the surface layer of 0 0 5 cm sediments and then decreased sharply with depth fig 3 a this indicates that the sulfide production is mainly concentrated within the 0 1 5 cm of surface sediments but there is still a small amount of sulfide producing activity at the bottom the methane production rate in the surface layer 0 0 5 cm was 570 g m 3 d 1and also decreased with depth but more slowly than for sulfide fig 3b this means that methane production is also predominantly in the surface layer but more evenly distributed than sulfide production in sediment 3 3 effectiveness of surface sediment flushing on controlling sulfidogenic and methanogenic production fig 4 a and b show the sulfide and methane production rates before and after flushing the 1 5 cm of surface sediment in r4 reactor relative to that in the control reactor r1 during the entire experimental period the sulfide and methane production rates of control reactor r1 remained stable the experimental reactor r4 had sulfide and methane production rates similar to r1 before the sediment scraping on day 0 sulfide and methane concentrations in the inlet and outlet water of all reactors are shown in the supplementary information fig s2 the sediment decreased in thickness by 1 5 cm after being flushed by a shear stress of 0 05 n m2 consistent with the above measurements of the critical shear stress required to flush the sediment the physical chemical properties and microbial communities of the top 1 5 cm of sediment flushed out of the reactor are shown in the supplementary information table s3 and fig s3 sulfide and methane activity ratios were reduced to 27 and 30 respectively after flushing consistent with the results of viability tests reported above fig 4c showed the two dimensional distribution of the sulfide production activity before and after flushing the sediments measured using the dgt the results showed that after flushing the surface sediment there were no obvious areas of high sulfide production in the sediment and the sulfide flux was lower than that in the sediment below 1 5 cm in the control reactor this result is consistent with the above results it indicates that the high sulfide producing areas has been removed by flushing the top 1 5 cm of the sediment and the sulfide production rate in the low sulfide producing areas at the bottom is reduced after flushing it is evident that sulfide and methane production rates of the sediment started to recover without a lag phase on 16th day sulfide and methane production recovered to 90 and 80 of control reactor levels respectively and were maintained at these levels thereafter this indicates that a single flush of the sediment surface can sustain a 16 day reduction in sulfide and methane production the depth distribution of the fully recovered sulfide producing activity of the sediment was tested by the dgt technique fig 4 c showed the sulfide production zones in r4 reactor on day 45 the results showed that the sulfide producing zone of sediment also appeared within 1 5 cm of the surface sediments similar to the sulfide producing zone of the control reactor a second flushing of sediment under the same conditions was carried out for r4 reactor at day 50 the results showed that the second flush had the same effect on sulfide and methane removal as the first i e 70 reduction not shown in the figure this indicates that long term regular sediment surface flushing can provide effective sulfide and methane control therefore the success of low shear surface flushing and the need for effective and long term control of sulfide and methane implies a novel sewer management strategy intermittent surface sediment flushing 3 4 synchronous impact of surface sediment flushing on downstream sediment activity flushing surface sediments upstream in gravity sewers and redeposition downstream may theoretically enhance sulfide and methane production in downstream sewers fig 5 showed the change in sulfide and methane production rates relative to the corresponding r1 rates as the sediment is discharged to the downstream reactor r5 the results showed that the sulfide and methane production of reactor r5 were similar to the control reactor r1 before sediment discharge after discharge on day 0 sulfide production showed a slight decrease on day 2 and returned to a level similar to that of the control reactor on day 9 in contrast no significant change in methane production was observed and it remained at similar level to the control this indicates that upstream sediment discharge does not increase downstream methane production and does reduce downstream sulfide production by a small amount 3 5 model based analysis the exponential decay model y y0 ae bx has been used to describe the fna ferrate and fa biocidal effects on the anaerobic sewer biofilms in previous studies jiang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 zuo et al 2020a in this study we have modelled the ratio of sulfide to methane production in the sediment after scraping at different thicknesses instead of the proportion of viable cells after inactivator application as shown in fig 2c and d this model had a satisfactory description of the dependency of the sulfide and methane activity ratio with sediment removal thickness the model predicts were good correlation to experimentally measured data with a high r square coefficient as 0 99 the parameter y0 indicates the residual percentage of viable microorganisms the y0 values of residual sulfide and methane production viable microorganisms is 26 4 and 19 2 in this study in previous studies y0 total residual viable microorganisms was 27 2 and 20 7 for the inactivators fa and ferrate respectively this indicates that removing sulfide and methane producing microorganisms by scraping the surface sediment has a similar effect to reduce methane and sulfide production by killing the total microorganisms with inactivators the gompertz growth equation was used to fit the recovery phase jiang et al 2011 yan et al 2020 as shown in fig 4a and b it is clear that the recovery process is similar to microbial regrowth according to the model prediction the time required for 50 recovery rt50 of sulfide production rate was 6 7 days this result is consistent with the previously reported rt50 i e 6 days for the inhibitory effect of fna on sediments but slightly lower than rt50 i e 10 1 days for biofilm inactivation by ferrate the rt50 of methane production rate was 7 3 days this result is significantly lower relative to the rt50 after inactivation of biofilms by fna and ferrate i e 44 5 and 58 respectively this is mainly due to the small reduction in methane production from flushing which only reduces it to 30 all of these previous models used to simulate the above mentioned inactivators provide a good fit for the control of sulfide and methane by surface flushing sediments this indicates that controlling sulfide and methane production by removing surface sediment has a similar effect to past control methods with biocides this method could replace other inactivators and serve as a new control method 4 discussion 4 1 heterogeneity of sulfide and methane production in sediment this study firstly accurately measured the distribution of sulfide and methane production rates along the sediment depth for the first time fig 3 previous studies determined sulfide and methane production zones using microelectrode combined with model analysis kuhl et al 1992 liu et al 2015a or using dgt technique for direct observation zuo et al 2021a 2021b although these two methods could determine the apparent concentration of sulfide in sediment it is difficult to precisely identify the specific sulfide production rate in different layers of sediment this is due to the diffusion of sulfide up and down and the different rates of sulfide diffusion caused by the water content of different layers of sediment in this study fresh effluent was supplied to the whole sediment and the excess substrate concentration eliminated errors due to diffusion the differential values between sulfide and methane production rates in sediments of different thicknesses provides a visual representation of the average production rate of this different layer compared with what was previously reported this study discovered a different vertical profile of sulfide and methane production in sediments i e surface sediment layer 0 1 5 cm only contributed to 70 of the total productions under anaerobic sewage condition fig 3 we speculate that this difference across studies is related to the differences in substrate concentrations in the sewage used for the experiments kuhl et al 1992 liu et al 2015a when the substrate in the effluent is constant the srb and ma form a stable active layer on the surface where they completely consume the substrate and result in no sulfide and methane production on the bottom under the condition of unstable sewage substrate concentration surface sediment may not have a stable microbial community that fully consume the substrate leading to thicker active top layer as well as srb and ma formation in bottom layer the distribution of substrate concentrations is inconsistent in real sewers pikaar et al 2014 this requires the identification of active thicknesses in the sediment by techniques such as dgt when applying surface flushing techniques in real sewers the variable hydraulic conditions in gravity sewers result in a wide range of dissolved oxygen in the effluent although aerobic conditions substantially reduce the amount of sulfide and methane production in the sediment there is still the aerobic condition of the effluent drives the migration of srb and ma from the surface sediments to deeper layers zuo et al 2021a this study only considered the distribution of sulfide and methane production in the sediment under anaerobic conditions and did not consider aerobic conditions therefore further studies on the distribution under aerobic conditions are needed in addition to this banasiak et al 2005 found that sediments under aerobic conditions were less anti scouribility relative to anaerobic conditions we speculate that flushing aerobic surface sediments has a more optimistic effect for carbon source depletion and sulfide and methane control in sewers but further studies are needed to verify this 4 2 the proposed novel physical approach intermittent surface sediment flushing the sediment in a qualified sewer is dynamically changing due to changes in flow rate dynamics throughout the day rarely accumulates and microbial activity however due to the extremely complex conditions of the sewers the sediments of sulfide and methane producing tend to accumulate in the pipes over a long period of time these sediments are concentrated in areas that are difficult to flush out such as in areas with flat and inverted slopes of the pipe where the flow velocity is extremely low even at high flows zuo et al 2019 these areas are also hot spots that cause blockage problems and need to be flushed of sediment conventional flushing methods may still lead to significant sulfide and methane production between flushing cycles because of rapid growth of microorganisms the method of this study is to reduce the microbial activity of the sediment by emulating the high frequency of dynamic flow processes in qualified sewers in this study 7 days was the time point at which 50 of sulfide and methane productions were recovered after flushing this means that a lower than7 day flushing frequency is mandatory for the sewer to reduce sulfide and methane however the high frequency of complete sediment removal over a long period of time inevitably leads to the generation of bottom biofilms which also result in sulfide and methane production and may be more difficult to remove therefore maintaining the sediment bed at a constant thickness through high frequency removal of the surface sediment is a promising way to control sulfide and methane production and sewer blockage the rate of sediment deposit is different in different sewers ashley et al 2004 ashley and verbanck 1996 resulting in dynamic flushing frequencies that need to be calculated for specific sewer the low energy demand of surface sediment flushing on sulfide and methane control provides the feasibility of high frequency flushing the traditional manual method of flushing sediment is to pump the water into the sewer at a manhole via a tank truck to create a heavy flow of water to flush the sediment however conventional flushing methods perform high pressure flushing when deposits accumulate to the point of a potential blockage the long term accumulation of and biochemical reactions in sediment in the sewer make the sediment more resistant against flushing regueiro picallo et al 2020 seco et al 2014 which makes the complete sediment flushing waste a lot of energy in contrast high frequency surface sediment flushing of the sewer in time prevents the increase of resistant to flushing this will have important implications for saving energy used in sediment cleaning in recent years automatic flushing gate fg equipment has become the best choice for flushing drains due to being more economical previous fg equipment has been designed to provide a minimum bed shear of 2 n m2 goormans et al 2009 shahsavari et al 2017 which is sufficient for flushing surface sediments this automatic flushing device is a best way to achieve the high frequency and low energy surface sediment flushing 4 3 implications the reduction of sulfide and methane production by surface sediment flushing has similar effect to previous inactivators e g fa fna jiang et al 2011 zuo et al 2020a 2020b however the flushing technique has a limited removal effect and does not entirely remove sulfide and methane for complete removal of sulfide and methane surface flushing techniques must be combined with inactivators e g fa fna ferrate or removers e g iron nitrate oxygen predictably when operating with combined inactivators the soaking concentration and time required for inactivator penetration is greatly reduced due to the removal of surface sediment similarly compared to direct dosing removers for sulfide and methane control sediment surface flushing saves about 70 chemical consumption therefore the use of chemical dosing strategies in combination with flushing techniques can significantly reduce the consumption of chemicals moreover sediment surface flushing has an implication for reducing carbon source losses in sewage transport in sewers the sewage loses 80 of its carbon source in sewer transport causing a shortage of carbon for the nitrogen and phosphorus removal process at the wastewater treatment plant most of the dissolved organic matter is consumed in the process of producing sulfide and methane guisasola et al 2009 surface sediment flushing can reduce scod losses by 36 fig s4 insoluble organic matter can settle in sewers to form sediment beds and then be discharged directly into the water environment during cso events or gradually hydrolyzed to form soluble organic matter to produce sulfide and methane insoluble organic matter in the sediment bed is mainly concentrated in the surface layer due to its low density laplace et al 2003 particulate organic matter will be transported in greater quantities to the wastewater treatment plant during surface flushing this further reduces the loss of carbon source in the transport of sewage in sewers moreover due to surface sediment accounts for 70 of the organic pollution from cso events laplace et al 2003 the long term removal of surface sediment reduces the water pollution caused during cso events in addition to gravity sewers sewage pumping stations in force and gravity mains are also places that are often attacked by sulfide large amounts of sediment in the pumping station produce sulfide at the bottom and corrode the pumping station equipment when released hann et al 1983 however completely removing large amounts of sediment is extremely difficult for pumping stations this study provides a viable idea for controlling sulfide and methane production in pumping stations by removing surface layers from pumping station sediment at a high frequency a final deserving discussion concerns the economic implications of surface sediment flushing in gravity sewer the total cost of the strategy is expected to be low as the intermittent flushing without any chemical consumption the cost of intermittent flushing strategy to achieve 70 sulfide and methane control only is 1 8 kg s based on the results in section 3 3 a flush gate and a flushing interval of 2 5 days for achieving sulfide control efficiency of 70 it is much lower than the most chemical dosing for sulfide and methane control such as using ferric ferrous and nitrate shown in table s4 cao et al 2019 yan et al 2020 liu et al 2015b the intermittent surface flushing method reduces the energy required for traditional high pressure flushing e g high pressure water gun and flush tank truck which also could save significant costs overall surface sediment flushing a two birds with one stone strategy can cost effectively control sewer corrosion odor and greenhouse gas which bears great application potential in sewer management 5 conclusions a novel physical control approach by the intermittent surface sediment flushing for the simultaneous control of sulfide and methane in sewers was proposed and evaluated based on the systematic experimental exploration the main conclusions include the following points the production of sulfide and methane in the sediments is mainly but not exclusively in the surface layer intermittent surface sediment flushing effectively reduces sulfide and methane production and their activities will require one week to recovery to 50 of the maximum maintaining the sediment bed at a constant thickness through high frequency removal of the surface sediment is a promising way to address sediment induced multiple issues surface sediment flushing is easily implemented by a low shear stress 0

16299,sorption based atmospheric water harvesting sawh has emerged as an attractive way to relieve water scarcity however the daily water yield of currently reported sawh devices remains low to satisfy the rising demand for drinking water the sorption and desorption kinetics long term stability and especially facile scaling fabrication of adsorbents and scaled up device implementation have become the bottleneck to such large scale sawh application to overcome these challenges an air cooled sawh device was fabricated to investigate its atmospheric water harvesting awh performance under

alternative clean water technology to tackle global water crises originating from deteriorating water environment severe climate change rapid urbanization and ever increasing demand andrade et al 2018 deng 2021 lipczynska kochany 2018 vörösmarty et al 2000 desalination frappa et al 2021 ma et al 2021 zang et al 2021 has long been considered a reliable way to alleviate the water shortage but its huge initial investment high energy consumption and dependence on well developed infrastructures make it unviable for decentralized water supply in remote or impoverished areas so high priority is to develop new viable efficient flexible and green water extraction approaches the earth s atmosphere always holds about 12 900 billion tons of water in the form of vapor and droplets equivalent to 6 times of water in all the rivers on our planet schneider et al 2011 in this context atmospheric water harvesting awh is regarded as an alternative accessible and sustainable method to acquire fresh water to quench the world s thirst lord et al 2021 wahlgren 2001 şen 2015 several awh technologies have attracted considerable attention and demonstrated their potential in providing clean water in the past decades direct awh methods like fog capture azeem et al 2020 klemm et al 2012 lawrence and parker 2001 park et al 2013 shi et al 2018 zheng et al 2010 and dewing clus et al 2008 gido et al 2016 lee et al 2012 wahlgren 2001 are either limited to specific environmental requirements like high humidity dependence or intensive energy consumption as well as the possible contamination issues hoek et al 2013 lu et al 2010 fortunately there is a way to overcome these drawbacks the sorption based atmospheric water harvesting sawh which uses a sorbent to trap moisture from the air and then release it for condensation sawh technology has aroused a great interest in both academia and industry because it promises facile regeneration at low temperature a wide working relative humidity rh range low energy consumption and environmental friendliness notably it can be employed anywhere at any time recently many researchers have been focused on the developing of adsorbents with high performance and a variety of novel materials have been reported e g mofs metal organic frameworks gordeeva et al 2020 gordeeva et al 2021 hanikel et al 2021 kim et al 2017 logan et al 2020 rieth et al 2019 hydrogels guo et al 2020 li et al 2018 matsumoto et al 2018 nandakumar et al 2019 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 composite adsorbents kallenberger and fröba 2018 li et al 2021 wang et al 2016 2021a xu et al 2021 these adsorbents have either excellent water uptake as high as several times of their own weight or fast adsorption desorption kinetics that enable them to be used for multicyclic water harvesting however the high performance adsorbent alone cannot guarantee a high water productivity in device level to meet personal water demand there is still a long way to go from materials to actual water harvesting applications in device in general the reported sawh devices can be divided into two categories depending on the number of awh cycles in one day one is monocyclic mode kim et al 2017 wang et al 2017b 2021a 2021b xu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 and the other is multicyclic mode hanikel et al 2019 li et al 2020 terzis et al 2020 in a typical monocyclic water harvester in which only one awh cycle is allowed per day the moisture is trapped at night and subsequently released and condensed during the day especially for solar driven systems in which the desorption is triggered by exposure to the sunlight for example kim et al 2017 reported a mof 801 based water harvester and tested it outdoors adsorption at 25 c 65 rh and desorption at 66 c 10 rh loaded with 1 79 g of adsorbent and estimated to harvest 0 3 lwater kg adsorbent 1 in one adsorption desorption cycle this prototype demonstrated the viability of a passive awh device fathieh et al 2018 further demonstrated a laboratory to desert device which employed up to 0 825 kg adsorbent the scaled up device can produce 78 g per day under lab conditions this demonstration brings water generation in desert climates one step closer to practical application these monocyclic sawh devices usually possess a rather long water generation duration and a small productivity that cannot meet the growing demand for drinking water however the limitations of scaling fabrication of adsorbent materials scaled up device implementation and small adsorption and desorption kinetics make it challenging and infeasible to employ such sawh devices to water production applications at large scales or commercially one way to overcome this challenge is to develop the multicyclic sawh system hanikel et al 2019 presented a mof 303 based awh device which can perform 8 9 awh cycles per day with 579 g of mof 303 the device achieves higher water productivity of 1 3 lwater kgmof 1 day 1 in the mojave desert 27 c and 32 rh corresponding to a daily productivity of 0 75 l day 1 li et al 2020 constructed an awg device capable of 3 adsorption desorption cycles within 10 h using 12 6 g hcs licl nano adsorbent the device yielded 1 6 lwater kgadsorbent 1 day 1 or 0 07 l day 1 xu et al 2021 reported a rapid cycling water harvester successfully achieving 8 awh cycles and achieving an ultrahigh capacity of 2 12 lwater kgadsorbent 1 or 0 046 l day 1 it can be found that these multicyclic sawh devices yield enhanced water productivity with reduced amount of adsorbent and demonstrated extremely outstanding water productivity per unit mass of adsorbent however the daily water productivity in device level is still insufficient to meet the water demand furthermore the long term stability and actual implementation of large scale sawh devices are still lack of relevant research therefore there are still some challenges and issues to be solved for deploying scaled up sawh to real applications and industrial level inspired by the urgent needs of large scale sawh the outstanding water uptake of asli which has been reported liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2017a 2017b 2021a is ideally applicable for water generation at large scales in our previous work we designed an asli based monocyclic sawh device and tested it in lab conditions obtaining a high water yield up to 7 7 kg water per day wang et al 2021a but unfortunately it was not tested in the field thus to test the practical performance of the asli water harvester and its adaptability to real island climate an optimized asli based water harvester was assembled and tested on an island outdoor field tests confirmed its water generation capacity even under a regeneration temperature as low as 50 c to maximize the awh potential of this sawh device we demonstrate an active two cycle operation yielding ultrahigh water productivity as high as 4 2 kg day 1 or 0 42 kgwater kgadsorbent 1 day 1 with a high thermal efficiency of 32 2 to the best of our knowledge this is the first exploration in large scale sawh device enabling multiple adsorption desorption cycles besides the quality of the collected water is also tested and analyzed this work sheds significant light on sparking research to large scale sawh systems for practical applications 2 experimental description 2 1 materials fabrication the composite adsorbent

assisted forming iii immersion with 30 wt licl solution and iv oven assisted drying wang et al 2021a the silica sol was added as a supporting material to enhance the strength of the matrix and to help form the stable air channel 2 2 sawh system configuration equipped with the idea of harvesting water from the island air in field condition an asli based sawh device was designed and fabricated fig 1 c and d illustrate the structure of the water harvester mainly consisting of two units the adsorption desorption unit and the condensation unit the adsorption desorption unit comprises a sorbent bed an electric heater and a fan the condensing unit includes an air cooled condenser an axial fan and a water collector an acrylic enclosure 20 50 50 cm3 was used as the container and 10 kg of asli adsorbents was homogeneously placed inside as the sorbent bed composite sorbent material asli has been identified as one of the most promising materials for large scale awh application due to its high water uptake low temperature regeneration ideal and facile scaled up fabrication ejeian and wang 2021 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017b 2021a as displayed in fig 1a the adsorbents were fabricated into planar and corrugated forms and arranged in staggered layers the layer structure of the adsorbent bed is optimized as shown in fig 1b with a size of 10 mm 15 mm 200 mm l1 l2 l and the thickness of the adsorbent layer δ is 3 mm the power of electric heater can be adjusted by the controller to investigate the effect of the regeneration temperature in addition to circumvent warming of the condenser the sidewalls of the condenser are attached with reflective film to minimize the solar irradiation 2 3 water harvesting procedure each water harvesting cycle involves two working stages an open adsorption and a closed desorption condensation processes fig 1a for the open adsorption process fig 1c fan 1 is on and adjust the three way valve 1 to connect its left entrance and the upper entrance and connect the left entrance and the right entrance of three way valve 2 the island air is introduced into the sorbent bed from its bottom and the moisture in the air is captured by the sorbent meanwhile adsorption heat is released and the dehumidified air is discharged to the environment for the closed desorption condensation process adjust the three way valves 1 connecting its right and upper sides and 2 connecting its left and lower sides to create a closed operating environment and opens fan 2 to wake the air cooled condenser when the sorbent is saturated with moisture the electric heater is turned on to heat the recovered air from the outlet of the condenser then the sorbent bed is regenerated by the hot air releasing the captured moisture simultaneously the humid and high temperature air obtained is cooled below the dew point by the condenser producing liquid water saturated air continues to circulate in the device until the desorption process is complete 2 4 measurement and performance index the inlets and outlets of sorbent bed and condenser were equipped with temperature and humidity transmitters rh t 1 rh t 2 and rh t 3 in fig 1c meacon china these transmitters were calibrated in the 5 95 rh range and 20 100 c with 5 rh and 10 c increments respectively inside a constant temperature and humidity test chamber shanghai linpin three thermocouples were attached to the inlet and outlet of the electric heater tc1 and tc2 fig 1c and the outlet of the cooling air of the condenser tc3 these thermocouples were calibrated between 20 and 100 c in increments of 10 c inside a low constant temperature bath cnshp the temperature and humidity transmitters had accuracies of 0 3 c and 3 rh at 10 80 rh 4 rh at 0 10 rh and 90 100 rh for temperature and relative humidity respectively the accuracy of the pt100 thermocouple was 0 1 c the signals from the temperature and humidity transmitters and thermocouples were measured by an agilent lxi data acquisition switch unit connected to a laptop the produced water was weighed by a spring scale with an accuracy of 0 01 g real time amount of water vapor adsorbed desorbed and condensed per unit mass of air during the experiment can be calculated as follows 1 r ads d i d o 2 r des d i d o 3 r cond d co d o where d i d o d c o represent the moisture content of the air at the inlet and outlet of the sorbent bed and the outlet of the condenser respectively the awh device was tested outside on an island for one month in may 2021 for large scale application the daily water productivity in device level dwp l day 1 defined as litres of water harvested per day in device level and thermal efficiency were applied to quantitively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of sawh devices thermal efficiency was defined as the ratio of latent heat of water times the harvested water over input thermal energy calculated as 4 η h fg m c q i 100 here h fg is the latent heat of evaporation 2453 kj kg 1 at 20 c and 2265 kj kg 1 at 100 c mc is the mass of collected water kg and q i is the input thermal energy kj 3 results and discussion 3 1 water vapor sorption performance of asli30 asli30 shows excellent water vapor sorption performance as shown in fig 2 the isothermal water sorption curve fig 2a reveals that asli30 has outstanding awh performance over a wide rh range and its stepwise transition position at x223c11 rh makes it the preferred choice for efficient water harvesting applications with a small temperature swing fig 2b shows the dynamic water sorption performance of asli30 under different conditions 3 2 validation in laboratory conditions to validate the water harvesting performance of the sawh device this device was first evaluated in the laboratory condition where the environmental conditions are controlled by the central air conditioning system in a typical lab controlled experiment fig 3 the sorbent bed was saturated overnight under 16 c and 83 rh for 14 h then desorption process was triggered by an electric heater after about 12 h the experiment ended and liquid water was collected initial tests were performed using 10 kg sorbent and a condenser temperature of 22 c was maintained via the central air conditioning system the device yielded 5 1 kg water under a regeneration temperature of 85 c this experiment is encouraging and demonstrates the viability of generating water under island conditions 3 3 monocyclic water production under real outdoor conditions to confirm the practical viability of the sawh device outdoors this device was then shipped to an island to validate and study its ability to generate clean water under island conditions 60 80 rh 25 35 c 3 3 1 dynamic water harvesting cycles several water harvesting experiments were performed and the experimental procedures and measurements details are presented in experimental section the first awh cycle was initiated around 22 00 h in local time in the outdoor test the influences of ambient conditions including temperature and rh and operating parameters like air velocity regeneration temperature and condensation temperature on the awh performance were investigated fig 4 a d shows the temperature and rh variations during the adsorption and desorption experiments for four representative awh cycles in these four figures the upper abscissa represents the local time of the day the adsorption conditions for the four experiments were similar namely 31 c and x223c75 rh this meant comparable adsorption capacity for the device which was verified by r ads in fig 4e here r ads is the moisture content difference between the inlet and outlet of the sorbent bed during adsorption the temperature at the outlet of the sorbent bed named sot first rapidly increased because of the exothermic adsorption process and then slowly decreased as heat was lost to the surroundings and the incoming air flow finally the temperature sot decreased close to the temperature at the inlet of the sorbent bed sit which means the complete of the adsorption process meanwhile the relative humidity of the air at the outlet of the sorbent bed sorh gradually increased to or approached the inlet rh sirh at the end of the adsorption process the moisture content difference between the inlet and outlet air r ads was almost 0 fig 4e after saturation the desorption process started immediately driven by an electric heater and water condensation was observed on the wall of the water collector in desorption process the regeneration temperature was regulated and maintained under the help of a power controller the inlet temperature sit increased quickly to the set temperature tdes and fluctuated around it the outlet temperature sot rose slowly at the beginning of desorption and the temperature difference between sit and sot is due to the endothermic regeneration in the later stage of desorption sot increased rapidly and the final temperature difference with sit was less than 10 c indicating the end of the desorption sirh usually maintained at a relatively stable value which was determined by the desorption condition meanwhile sorh declined with time it can tell from fig 4a c that under a mild regeneration temperature the relative humidity at the outlet of the condenser corh raised sharply to x223c100 then stayed at 100 rh for a long time and finally gradually decreased taking condition 7 as an example adsorption at 31 c and 77 rh fig 4a at a regeneration temperature of 80 c the outlet temperature sot gradually increased from 35 to 70 c and sirh kept around 10 rh the dew point temperature td of the desorbed air increased sharply from 25 8 to 43 5 c and then slowly decreased to 33 c the temperature difference between td and the temperature at the outlet of the condenser cot meant successful condensation of the desorbed air by forced natural air cooling actually after a 1440 min operation the awh cycle completed and totally 2 2 kg water was collected fig 4d displayed a failed awh experiment at a regeneration temperature of 41 c in which corh could not reach x223c100 rh it is also clear from fig 4e that a higher regeneration temperature provides a higher moisture content difference between the outlet and inlet of the sorbent and also a higher condensation rate namely r des and r cond respectively in these awh experiments the dew point td under different operating conditions is found to be greatly affected by the regeneration temperature as shown in fig 4f this can be attributed to the full regeneration of the saturated sorbent which raises the vapor pressure of the desorbed air and thus imparts a higher dew point generally if td is greater than 32 c that is the average ambient temperature and also the maximum condensation capacity of an air cooled system and condensation is feasible on the contrary e g td is lower than 30 c for condition 6 with a regeneration temperature of 41 c fig 4d and actually no water could be collected 3 3 2 overall water harvesting performance the water produced in each awh cycle was collected and measured as shown in fig 5 and table 1 the first cycle produced the highest productivity of water this sawh device can yield as high as 3 9 kg water under outdoor island climates adsorption at 31 c 70 rh desorption at 94 c experimental results showed that the minimum effective regeneration temperature was 51 c and the water yield was 0 7 kg in the case of similar adsorption conditions and condensation temperature a higher regeneration temperature enabled fast water release with high desorption efficiency as indicated by fig 4e and also more water yield this can be obtained by comparing the results of working conditions 2 6 see table 2 for details inevitably however a high regeneration temperature or a harsh condensation condition generally requires more energy input resulting in a reduced thermal efficiency this is clear from fig 5 upper and table 2 conditions 1 and 8 for example the water productivity under condition 1 is the highest but its high energy consumption leads to a reduced thermal efficiency in addition by comparing working conditions of 1 and 8 2 and 7 3 and 9 it can also be found that under the same adsorption and desorption conditions the lower the condensation temperature is the higher the thermal efficiency is when the regeneration temperature is too low and limited by the condensation capacity in air cooled condition it is insufficient to obtain effective condensation leading to energy loss this suggests that in practical applications it is necessary to consider the matching of regeneration desorption temperature and condensation temperature so as to pay attention to the strengthening of the condensation process through the improvement of the thermal efficiency a sawh device is potential to produce adequate water with low energy consumption 3 4 two cycle water production under real outdoor conditions in the experimental process it is found that the sorption kinetics is very slow in the late adsorption stage combined that the ineffective condensation of the desorbed air due to the limited condensation temperature so the monocyclic operation is not efficient in this context considering the special island climates the same device was performed with multiple sorption desorption cycles to study its feasibility of continuous awh operation the device was operated continuously for 10 days in 2 cycles daily under island environment the evolution of temperature and rh of two representative multicyclic awh experiments was monitored and recorded by the temperature and humidity sensors as shown in fig 6 during the outdoor tests the first adsorption cycle of each experiment started around 0 00 local time and lasted for 8 h and the first day time desorption process usually lasted for 4 h the device was then subject to the second adsorption desorption cycle as shown in fig 6a and b the change trend of temperature and rh is similar to that of monocyclic experiment during the adsorption process sirh fluctuated with the environment and the initial decrease of sit was affected by the previous desorption process it was then cooled by the inlet air to ambient temperature and fluctuated accordingly by comparing fig 6c and d with fig 4e it found out that the adsorption capacity of the sorbent bed was always maintained at a better level presenting a higher r ads similarly in the desorption process the desorption bed showed a stable and better desorption capacity with a higher r des it is apparent that two cycle operation ensures a stable water harvesting the water harvested in each cycle was collected and weighed as displayed in table 2 under a regeneration temperature of 70 c fig 6a the 1st and 2nd cycles produced 0 9 kg and 1 5 kg of liquid water respectively at 80 c the water yield were 1 7 kg and 2 5 kg respectively 3 5 comparison of water harvesting performance by comparison the cycle water yield of two cycle awh operation was increased by 10 50 over the single cycle mode fig 7 a detailed list of water harvesting performance between different operating strategies in varied conditions has been displayed in table 2 for example under regeneration at 70 c during daytime desorption the 1st cycle adsorption at 31 c 75 rh of the 2 cycle mode yielded 0 9 kg of water which is 1 1 times of that of the single cycle awh 0 8 kg half of daily productivity of 1 6 kg cycle 2 adsorption at 31 c 69 rh with a lower condensation temperature produced 1 5 kg water 1 2 times of the single cycle mode similarly when regenerating at 80 c the water productivity of two cycle mode was 1 5 and 1 4 times of the single mode experiment respectively another thing to be noted is that the daytime desorption presented a relatively harsh condensation conditions thus leading to a decreased water harvesting performance compared with the nighttime desorption ongoing effect is being made on improving the efficiency in condensation process in the future research by analyzing the daily water productivity it is surprising to find that the water harvesting rate of the two cycle experiment was greatly improved as shown in fig 7 taking regeneration at 80 c as an example the water harvesting rate of two cycle mode was increased from 2 2 kg day 1 and 3 5 kg day 1 to 4 2 kg day 1 relative to the single cycle mode the anomaly at 70 c is due to the inadequate desorption indicating that a regeneration temperature greater than or equal to 80 c is beneficial to efficient water harvesting the thermal efficiency was further calculated and compared to further evaluate the awh performance in different operating strategies the calculated thermal efficiencies for day desorption in single cycle tests were 16 1 and 16 7 for desorption at 70 c and 80 c respectively although the performance can be improved to 25 6 and 25 0 x0025 respectively by desorption at night it is inevitable that the adsorption condition in daytime is worse than that in the evening fortunately two cycle operation can solve this contradiction increasing the thermal efficiency to 28 7 and 32 2 for comparison the thermal efficiencies of reported sawh devices were 14 kim et al 2018 22 8 xu et al 2021 and 30 37 wang et al 2021a the system proposed here therefore ranks among the top level of start of the art sawh devices and the thermal efficiency is expected to be further improved by strengthening the heat transfer in condensation process in summary the multicyclic sawh device demonstrated here can conduct two adsorption desorption cycles in island conditions in one day to the best of our knowledge this is the first field tested large scale sawh device ever reported enabling multicycle operation and delivering kilogram level water generation daily kg d 1 to meet personal water demand admittedly more efforts need to be made on further optimization and the improvement of the overall awh efficiency of the device 3 6 water quality analysis the quality of the directly collected water was further analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms cap q thermofisher scientific usa with an accuracy of 0 01 mg l 1 water quality measurements indicated that the concentrations of all the primary ions in the harvested water meet the who standards for drinking water for these individual measured parameters cotruvo 2017 fig 8 the concentration of na ca mg were far below the drinkable water standard limits in addition the concentrations of al cu and fe were negligible well below the detection limit of the icp ms besides the concentration of li was also measured to be 0 00918 mg l 1 indicating the stability of the adsorbent asli the quite low ion concentrations enable the harvested water to be potable 4 conclusions in this study we developed an multicyclic asli based sawh device with two water adsorption desorption cycles per day the multicyclic water harvester showed an extraordinary performance of 4 2 kg day 1 or 0 42 kgwater kgadsorbent 1 day 1 which is 1 2 1 9 times of the monocyclic operation under the same condition under a regeneration temperature of 80 c this operation strategy helps to greatly improve the thermal efficiency from 25 6 to 32 2 limited by the worse daytime condensation temperature under the monocyclic operation the sawh device exhibited the superior water productivity up to 3 9 kg day 1 of liquid water at 31 c and 70 rh desorption at 90 c besides the parametric study by varying the regeneration temperatures indicates that the matching of regeneration and condensation temperature is vital to achieve efficient water production a relatively regeneration temperature of 51 c delivered a water yield of 0 7 kg day 1 this enables the deployment of low grade industrial waste or heat generated from solar energy or other renewable energy resources our demonstration of a large scale sawh device in an island climate indicates that sorption based water harvesting strategy is a promising solution to solve water scarcity in these regions and brings the sawh device one step closer to industrial and practical applications beyond water harvesting the sawh device is also potential in indoor dehumidification because it can transfer the moisture through an awh cycle which is especially meaningful in humid

16299,sorption based atmospheric water harvesting sawh has emerged as an attractive way to relieve water scarcity however the daily water yield of currently reported sawh devices remains low to satisfy the rising demand for drinking water the sorption and desorption kinetics long term stability and especially facile scaling fabrication of adsorbents and scaled up device implementation have become the bottleneck to such large scale sawh application to overcome these challenges an air cooled sawh device was fabricated to investigate its atmospheric water harvesting awh performance under real island climate and its feasibility of multicyclic operation under monocyclic operation the device demonstrated the superior water productivity as much as 3 9 kg day 1 or 0 39 kgwater kgadsorbent

alternative clean water technology to tackle global water crises originating from deteriorating water environment severe climate change rapid urbanization and ever increasing demand andrade et al 2018 deng 2021 lipczynska kochany 2018 vörösmarty et al 2000 desalination frappa et al 2021 ma et al 2021 zang et al 2021 has long been considered a reliable way to alleviate the water shortage but its huge initial investment high energy consumption and dependence on well developed infrastructures make it unviable for decentralized water supply in remote or impoverished areas so high priority is to develop new viable efficient flexible and green water extraction approaches the earth s atmosphere always holds about 12 900 billion tons of water in the form of vapor and droplets equivalent to 6 times of water in all the rivers on our planet schneider et al 2011 in this context atmospheric water harvesting awh is regarded as an alternative accessible and sustainable method to acquire fresh water to quench the world s thirst lord et al 2021 wahlgren 2001 şen 2015 several awh technologies have attracted considerable attention and demonstrated their potential in providing clean water in the past decades direct awh methods like fog capture azeem et al 2020 klemm et al 2012 lawrence and parker 2001 park et al 2013 shi et al 2018 zheng et al 2010 and dewing clus et al 2008 gido et al 2016 lee et al 2012 wahlgren 2001 are either limited to specific environmental requirements like high humidity dependence or intensive energy consumption as well as the possible contamination issues hoek et al 2013 lu et al 2010 fortunately there is a way to overcome these drawbacks the sorption based atmospheric water harvesting sawh which uses a sorbent to trap moisture from the air and then release it for condensation sawh technology has aroused a great interest in both academia and industry because it promises facile regeneration at low temperature a wide working relative humidity rh range low energy consumption and environmental friendliness notably it can be employed anywhere at any time recently many researchers have been focused on the developing of adsorbents with high performance and a variety of novel materials have been reported e g mofs metal organic frameworks gordeeva et al 2020 gordeeva et al 2021 hanikel et al 2021 kim et al 2017 logan et al 2020 rieth et al 2019 hydrogels guo et al 2020 li et al 2018 matsumoto et al 2018 nandakumar et al 2019 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 composite adsorbents kallenberger and fröba 2018 li et al 2021 wang et al 2016 2021a xu et al 2021 these adsorbents have either excellent water uptake as high as several times of their own weight or fast adsorption desorption kinetics that enable them to be used for multicyclic water harvesting however the high performance adsorbent alone cannot guarantee a high water productivity in device level to meet personal water demand there is still a long way to go from materials to actual water harvesting applications in device in general the reported sawh devices can be divided into two categories depending on the number of awh cycles in one day one is monocyclic mode kim et al 2017 wang et al 2017b 2021a 2021b xu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 and the other is multicyclic mode hanikel et al 2019 li et al 2020 terzis et al 2020 in a typical monocyclic water harvester in which only one awh cycle is allowed per day the moisture is trapped at night and subsequently released and condensed during the day especially for solar driven systems in which the desorption is triggered by exposure to the sunlight for example kim et al 2017 reported a mof 801 based water harvester and tested it outdoors adsorption at 25 c 65 rh and desorption at 66 c 10 rh loaded with 1 79 g of adsorbent and estimated to harvest 0 3 lwater kg adsorbent 1 in one adsorption desorption cycle this prototype demonstrated the viability of a passive awh device fathieh et al 2018 further demonstrated a laboratory to desert device which employed up to 0 825 kg adsorbent the scaled up device can produce 78 g per day under lab conditions this demonstration brings water generation in desert climates one step closer to practical application these monocyclic sawh devices usually possess a rather long water generation duration and a small productivity that cannot meet the growing demand for drinking water however the limitations of scaling fabrication of adsorbent materials scaled up device implementation and small adsorption and desorption kinetics make it challenging and infeasible to employ such sawh devices to water production applications at large scales or commercially one way to overcome this challenge is to develop the multicyclic sawh system hanikel et al 2019 presented a mof 303 based awh device which can perform 8 9 awh cycles per day with 579 g of mof 303 the device achieves higher water productivity of 1 3 lwater kgmof 1 day 1 in the mojave desert 27 c and 32 rh corresponding to a daily productivity of 0 75 l day 1 li et al 2020 constructed an awg device capable of 3 adsorption desorption cycles within 10 h using 12 6 g hcs licl nano adsorbent the device yielded 1 6 lwater kgadsorbent 1 day 1 or 0 07 l day 1 xu et al 2021 reported a rapid cycling water harvester successfully achieving 8 awh cycles and achieving an ultrahigh capacity of 2 12 lwater kgadsorbent 1 or 0 046 l day 1 it can be found that these multicyclic sawh devices yield enhanced water productivity with reduced amount of adsorbent and demonstrated extremely outstanding water productivity per unit mass of adsorbent however the daily water productivity in device level is still insufficient to meet the water demand furthermore the long term stability and actual implementation of large scale sawh devices are still lack of relevant research therefore there are still some challenges and issues to be solved for deploying scaled up sawh to real applications and industrial level inspired by the urgent needs of large scale sawh the outstanding water uptake of asli which has been reported liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 2017a 2017b 2021a is ideally applicable for water generation at large scales in our previous work we designed an asli based monocyclic sawh device and tested it in lab conditions obtaining a high water yield up to 7 7 kg water per day wang et al 2021a but unfortunately it was not tested in the field thus to test the practical performance of the asli water harvester and its adaptability to real island climate an optimized asli based water harvester was assembled and tested on an island outdoor field tests confirmed its water generation capacity even under a regeneration temperature as low as 50 c to maximize the awh potential of this sawh device we demonstrate an active two cycle operation yielding ultrahigh water productivity as high as 4 2 kg day 1 or 0 42 kgwater kgadsorbent 1 day 1 with a high thermal efficiency of 32 2 to the best of our knowledge this is the first exploration in large scale sawh device enabling multiple adsorption desorption cycles besides the quality of the collected water is also tested and analyzed this work sheds significant light on sparking research to large scale sawh systems for practical applications 2 experimental description 2 1 materials fabrication the composite adsorbent

assisted forming iii immersion with 30 wt licl solution and iv oven assisted drying wang et al 2021a the silica sol was added as a supporting material to enhance the strength of the matrix and to help form the stable air channel 2 2 sawh system configuration equipped with the idea of harvesting water from the island air in field condition an asli based sawh device was designed and fabricated fig 1 c and d illustrate the structure of the water harvester mainly consisting of two units the adsorption desorption unit and the condensation unit the adsorption desorption unit comprises a sorbent bed an electric heater and a fan the condensing unit includes an air cooled condenser an axial fan and a water collector an acrylic enclosure 20 50 50 cm3 was used as the container and 10 kg of asli adsorbents was homogeneously placed inside as the sorbent bed composite sorbent material asli has been identified as one of the most promising materials for large scale awh application due to its high water uptake low temperature regeneration ideal and facile scaled up fabrication ejeian and wang 2021 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017b 2021a as displayed in fig 1a the adsorbents were fabricated into planar and corrugated forms and arranged in staggered layers the layer structure of the adsorbent bed is optimized as shown in fig 1b with a size of 10 mm 15 mm 200 mm l1 l2 l and the thickness of the adsorbent layer δ is 3 mm the power of electric heater can be adjusted by the controller to investigate the effect of the regeneration temperature in addition to circumvent warming of the condenser the sidewalls of the condenser are attached with reflective film to minimize the solar irradiation 2 3 water harvesting procedure each water harvesting cycle involves two working stages an open adsorption and a closed desorption condensation processes fig 1a for the open adsorption process fig 1c fan 1 is on and adjust the three way valve 1 to connect its left entrance and the upper entrance and connect the left entrance and the right entrance of three way valve 2 the island air is introduced into the sorbent bed from its bottom and the moisture in the air is captured by the sorbent meanwhile adsorption heat is released and the dehumidified air is discharged to the environment for the closed desorption condensation process adjust the three way valves 1 connecting its right and upper sides and 2 connecting its left and lower sides to create a closed operating environment and opens fan 2 to wake the air cooled condenser when the sorbent is saturated with moisture the electric heater is turned on to heat the recovered air from the outlet of the condenser then the sorbent bed is regenerated by the hot air releasing the captured moisture simultaneously the humid and high temperature air obtained is cooled below the dew point by the condenser producing liquid water saturated air continues to circulate in the device until the desorption process is complete 2 4 measurement and performance index the inlets and outlets of sorbent bed and condenser were equipped with temperature and humidity transmitters rh t 1 rh t 2 and rh t 3 in fig 1c meacon china these transmitters were calibrated in the 5 95 rh range and 20 100 c with 5 rh and 10 c increments respectively inside a constant temperature and humidity test chamber shanghai linpin three thermocouples were attached to the inlet and outlet of the electric heater tc1 and tc2 fig 1c and the outlet of the cooling air of the condenser tc3 these thermocouples were calibrated between 20 and 100 c in increments of 10 c inside a low constant temperature bath cnshp the temperature and humidity transmitters had accuracies of 0 3 c and 3 rh at 10 80 rh 4 rh at 0 10 rh and 90 100 rh for temperature and relative humidity respectively the accuracy of the pt100 thermocouple was 0 1 c the signals from the temperature and humidity transmitters and thermocouples were measured by an agilent lxi data acquisition switch unit connected to a laptop the produced water was weighed by a spring scale with an accuracy of 0 01 g real time amount of water vapor adsorbed desorbed and condensed per unit mass of air during the experiment can be calculated as follows 1 r ads d i d o 2 r des d i d o 3 r cond d co d o where d i d o d c o represent the moisture content of the air at the inlet and outlet of the sorbent bed and the outlet of the condenser respectively the awh device was tested outside on an island for one month in may 2021 for large scale application the daily water productivity in device level dwp l day 1 defined as litres of water harvested per day in device level and thermal efficiency were applied to quantitively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of sawh devices thermal efficiency was defined as the ratio of latent heat of water times the harvested water over input thermal energy calculated as 4 η h fg m c q i 100 here h fg is the latent heat of evaporation 2453 kj kg 1 at 20 c and 2265 kj kg 1 at 100 c mc is the mass of collected water kg and q i is the input thermal energy kj 3 results and discussion 3 1 water vapor sorption performance of asli30 asli30 shows excellent water vapor sorption performance as shown in fig 2 the isothermal water sorption curve fig 2a reveals that asli30 has outstanding awh performance over a wide rh range and its stepwise transition position at x223c11 rh makes it the preferred choice for efficient water harvesting applications with a small temperature swing fig 2b shows the dynamic water sorption performance of asli30 under different conditions 3 2 validation in laboratory conditions to validate the water harvesting performance of the sawh device this device was first evaluated in the laboratory condition where the environmental conditions are controlled by the central air conditioning system in a typical lab controlled experiment fig 3 the sorbent bed was saturated overnight under 16 c and 83 rh for 14 h then desorption process was triggered by an electric heater after about 12 h the experiment ended and liquid water was collected initial tests were performed using 10 kg sorbent and a condenser temperature of 22 c was maintained via the central air conditioning system the device yielded 5 1 kg water under a regeneration temperature of 85 c this experiment is encouraging and demonstrates the viability of generating water under island conditions 3 3 monocyclic water production under real outdoor conditions to confirm the practical viability of the sawh device outdoors this device was then shipped to an island to validate and study its ability to generate clean water under island conditions 60 80 rh 25 35 c 3 3 1 dynamic water harvesting cycles several water harvesting experiments were performed and the experimental procedures and measurements details are presented in experimental section the first awh cycle was initiated around 22 00 h in local time in the outdoor test the influences of ambient conditions including temperature and rh and operating parameters like air velocity regeneration temperature and condensation temperature on the awh performance were investigated fig 4 a d shows the temperature and rh variations during the adsorption and desorption experiments for four representative awh cycles in these four figures the upper abscissa represents the local time of the day the adsorption conditions for the four experiments were similar namely 31 c and x223c75 rh this meant comparable adsorption capacity for the device which was verified by r ads in fig 4e here r ads is the moisture content difference between the inlet and outlet of the sorbent bed during adsorption the temperature at the outlet of the sorbent bed named sot first rapidly increased because of the exothermic adsorption process and then slowly decreased as heat was lost to the surroundings and the incoming air flow finally the temperature sot decreased close to the temperature at the inlet of the sorbent bed sit which means the complete of the adsorption process meanwhile the relative humidity of the air at the outlet of the sorbent bed sorh gradually increased to or approached the inlet rh sirh at the end of the adsorption process the moisture content difference between the inlet and outlet air r ads was almost 0 fig 4e after saturation the desorption process started immediately driven by an electric heater and water condensation was observed on the wall of the water collector in desorption process the regeneration temperature was regulated and maintained under the help of a power controller the inlet temperature sit increased quickly to the set temperature tdes and fluctuated around it the outlet temperature sot rose slowly at the beginning of desorption and the temperature difference between sit and sot is due to the endothermic regeneration in the later stage of desorption sot increased rapidly and the final temperature difference with sit was less than 10 c indicating the end of the desorption sirh usually maintained at a relatively stable value which was determined by the desorption condition meanwhile sorh declined with time it can tell from fig 4a c that under a mild regeneration temperature the relative humidity at the outlet of the condenser corh raised sharply to x223c100 then stayed at 100 rh for a long time and finally gradually decreased taking condition 7 as an example adsorption at 31 c and 77 rh fig 4a at a regeneration temperature of 80 c the outlet temperature sot gradually increased from 35 to 70 c and sirh kept around 10 rh the dew point temperature td of the desorbed air increased sharply from 25 8 to 43 5 c and then slowly decreased to 33 c the temperature difference between td and the temperature at the outlet of the condenser cot meant successful condensation of the desorbed air by forced natural air cooling actually after a 1440 min operation the awh cycle completed and totally 2 2 kg water was collected fig 4d displayed a failed awh experiment at a regeneration temperature of 41 c in which corh could not reach x223c100 rh it is also clear from fig 4e that a higher regeneration temperature provides a higher moisture content difference between the outlet and inlet of the sorbent and also a higher condensation rate namely r des and r cond respectively in these awh experiments the dew point td under different operating conditions is found to be greatly affected by the regeneration temperature as shown in fig 4f this can be attributed to the full regeneration of the saturated sorbent which raises the vapor pressure of the desorbed air and thus imparts a higher dew point generally if td is greater than 32 c that is the average ambient temperature and also the maximum condensation capacity of an air cooled system and condensation is feasible on the contrary e g td is lower than 30 c for condition 6 with a regeneration temperature of 41 c fig 4d and actually no water could be collected 3 3 2 overall water harvesting performance the water produced in each awh cycle was collected and measured as shown in fig 5 and table 1 the first cycle produced the highest productivity of water this sawh device can yield as high as 3 9 kg water under outdoor island climates adsorption at 31 c 70 rh desorption at 94 c experimental results showed that the minimum effective regeneration temperature was 51 c and the water yield was 0 7 kg in the case of similar adsorption conditions and condensation temperature a higher regeneration temperature enabled fast water release with high desorption efficiency as indicated by fig 4e and also more water yield this can be obtained by comparing the results of working conditions 2 6 see table 2 for details inevitably however a high regeneration temperature or a harsh condensation condition generally requires more energy input resulting in a reduced thermal efficiency this is clear from fig 5 upper and table 2 conditions 1 and 8 for example the water productivity under condition 1 is the highest but its high energy consumption leads to a reduced thermal efficiency in addition by comparing working conditions of 1 and 8 2 and 7 3 and 9 it can also be found that under the same adsorption and desorption conditions the lower the condensation temperature is the higher the thermal efficiency is when the regeneration temperature is too low and limited by the condensation capacity in air cooled condition it is insufficient to obtain effective condensation leading to energy loss this suggests that in practical applications it is necessary to consider the matching of regeneration desorption temperature and condensation temperature so as to pay attention to the strengthening of the condensation process through the improvement of the thermal efficiency a sawh device is potential to produce adequate water with low energy consumption 3 4 two cycle water production under real outdoor conditions in the experimental process it is found that the sorption kinetics is very slow in the late adsorption stage combined that the ineffective condensation of the desorbed air due to the limited condensation temperature so the monocyclic operation is not efficient in this context considering the special island climates the same device was performed with multiple sorption desorption cycles to study its feasibility of continuous awh operation the device was operated continuously for 10 days in 2 cycles daily under island environment the evolution of temperature and rh of two representative multicyclic awh experiments was monitored and recorded by the temperature and humidity sensors as shown in fig 6 during the outdoor tests the first adsorption cycle of each experiment started around 0 00 local time and lasted for 8 h and the first day time desorption process usually lasted for 4 h the device was then subject to the second adsorption desorption cycle as shown in fig 6a and b the change trend of temperature and rh is similar to that of monocyclic experiment during the adsorption process sirh fluctuated with the environment and the initial decrease of sit was affected by the previous desorption process it was then cooled by the inlet air to ambient temperature and fluctuated accordingly by comparing fig 6c and d with fig 4e it found out that the adsorption capacity of the sorbent bed was always maintained at a better level presenting a higher r ads similarly in the desorption process the desorption bed showed a stable and better desorption capacity with a higher r des it is apparent that two cycle operation ensures a stable water harvesting the water harvested in each cycle was collected and weighed as displayed in table 2 under a regeneration temperature of 70 c fig 6a the 1st and 2nd cycles produced 0 9 kg and 1 5 kg of liquid water respectively at 80 c the water yield were 1 7 kg and 2 5 kg respectively 3 5 comparison of water harvesting performance by comparison the cycle water yield of two cycle awh operation was increased by 10 50 over the single cycle mode fig 7 a detailed list of water harvesting performance between different operating strategies in varied conditions has been displayed in table 2 for example under regeneration at 70 c during daytime desorption the 1st cycle adsorption at 31 c 75 rh of the 2 cycle mode yielded 0 9 kg of water which is 1 1 times of that of the single cycle awh 0 8 kg half of daily productivity of 1 6 kg cycle 2 adsorption at 31 c 69 rh with a lower condensation temperature produced 1 5 kg water 1 2 times of the single cycle mode similarly when regenerating at 80 c the water productivity of two cycle mode was 1 5 and 1 4 times of the single mode experiment respectively another thing to be noted is that the daytime desorption presented a relatively harsh condensation conditions thus leading to a decreased water harvesting performance compared with the nighttime desorption ongoing effect is being made on improving the efficiency in condensation process in the future research by analyzing the daily water productivity it is surprising to find that the water harvesting rate of the two cycle experiment was greatly improved as shown in fig 7 taking regeneration at 80 c as an example the water harvesting rate of two cycle mode was increased from 2 2 kg day 1 and 3 5 kg day 1 to 4 2 kg day 1 relative to the single cycle mode the anomaly at 70 c is due to the inadequate desorption indicating that a regeneration temperature greater than or equal to 80 c is beneficial to efficient water harvesting the thermal efficiency was further calculated and compared to further evaluate the awh performance in different operating strategies the calculated thermal efficiencies for day desorption in single cycle tests were 16 1 and 16 7 for desorption at 70 c and 80 c respectively although the performance can be improved to 25 6 and 25 0 x0025 respectively by desorption at night it is inevitable that the adsorption condition in daytime is worse than that in the evening fortunately two cycle operation can solve this contradiction increasing the thermal efficiency to 28 7 and 32 2 for comparison the thermal efficiencies of reported sawh devices were 14 kim et al 2018 22 8 xu et al 2021 and 30 37 wang et al 2021a the system proposed here therefore ranks among the top level of start of the art sawh devices and the thermal efficiency is expected to be further improved by strengthening the heat transfer in condensation process in summary the multicyclic sawh device demonstrated here can conduct two adsorption desorption cycles in island conditions in one day to the best of our knowledge this is the first field tested large scale sawh device ever reported enabling multicycle operation and delivering kilogram level water generation daily kg d 1 to meet personal water demand admittedly more efforts need to be made on further optimization and the improvement of the overall awh efficiency of the device 3 6 water quality analysis the quality of the directly collected water was further analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms cap q thermofisher scientific usa with an accuracy of 0 01 mg l 1 water quality measurements indicated that the concentrations of all the primary ions in the harvested water meet the who standards for drinking water for these individual measured parameters cotruvo 2017 fig 8 the concentration of na ca mg were far below the drinkable water standard limits in addition the concentrations of al cu and fe were negligible well below the detection limit of the icp ms besides the concentration of li was also measured to be 0 00918 mg l 1 indicating the stability of the adsorbent asli the quite low ion concentrations enable the harvested water to be potable 4 conclusions in this study we developed an multicyclic asli based sawh device with two water adsorption desorption cycles per day the multicyclic water harvester showed an extraordinary performance of 4 2 kg day 1 or 0 42 kgwater kgadsorbent 1 day 1 which is 1 2 1 9 times of the monocyclic operation under the same condition under a regeneration temperature of 80 c this operation strategy helps to greatly improve the thermal efficiency from 25 6 to 32 2 limited by the worse daytime condensation temperature under the monocyclic operation the sawh device exhibited the superior water productivity up to 3 9 kg day 1 of liquid water at 31 c and 70 rh desorption at 90 c besides the parametric study by varying the regeneration temperatures indicates that the matching of regeneration and condensation temperature is vital to achieve efficient water production a relatively regeneration temperature of 51 c delivered a water yield of 0 7 kg day 1 this enables the deployment of low grade industrial waste or heat generated from solar energy or other renewable energy resources our demonstration of a large scale sawh device in an island climate indicates that sorption based water harvesting strategy is a promising solution to solve water scarcity in these regions and brings the sawh device one step closer to industrial and practical applications beyond water harvesting the sawh device is also potential in indoor dehumidification because it can transfer the moisture through an awh cycle which is especially meaningful in humid
